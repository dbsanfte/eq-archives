<br>
<br>
<br>
        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I was wandering aimlessly through the wilds of yet another land when I began to faintly hear the sounds of a <br>
battle. So out of curiosity I turned and began searching for the battle, Something I never should have done for I was <br>
only prepared for death and not for life.<br>
When I arrived at the battle site I witnessed a beautiful god of wind and fire mercilessly pummeling a group of farmers <br>
and peasants while she screamed the same question over and over again, &quot;WHERE IS HE!?!?&quot; but the peasants only <br>
screamed and ran as she killed them never replying. Then I witnessed a impressive looking warrior in shining mail and <br>
some plate armor step out into my vision, and her vision apparently because she stopped hurling her fire and looked <br>
closely at him. He began to start saying something but I was to distant to hear him so I ran quickly to a building near <br>
them(I believe he was naming himself because by the time I got to the building he was just beginning to address the <br>
goddess) but safely out of their vision it went along something like this, &quot;..O Great God of fire I know not your quarrel <br>
with us but I beseech you to...&quot; but he was quickly cut short, quite literally also as the goddess had flung a piece of <br>
farming equipment, a sharp looking sickle of sorts with such force that it tore through his plating and mail as if it was <br>
nothing but a tunic of ordinary cloth and cleaved him in half. With this act I herd her chuckle to herself, &quot;Too bad his <br>
tong isn't acutely gold otherwise it might fetch quite a price.&quot; And with this statement I had to agree with her. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp But my interest had been touched off and found my self wondering why she was destroying these people so I <br>
snuck around behind the goddess as you might guess is quite a trick because gods are very observant; and I started to <br>
step out to talk with her when I was grabbed by many strong human hands and pulled into a nearby house where my <br>
hood was pulled back and I was quickly examined by many hooded figures where upon one's approval I was stood <br>
upright and told to be quite or I the noisy, stupid, and foul smelling human would get them all killed and their <br>
ambushed discovered, ( yes they had some odd priorities) I was about to ask them why I was considered a stupid human <br>
when they were not but I noticed one of the figures was much shorter and less defined as the others.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This figure looked quickly at me then turned to look out the window, with this movement I noticed that &quot;it&quot; <br>
was her and very attractive. She must have been about 15 and she had one (or many) large intertwining tattoo(s) of black <br>
on her face probably a ritual or something. Her hair must be very short under her hood because large locks of thick black <br>
hair poked out about two inches above her eyes and dispite the fact that she was smaller in bust she was very shapely as I could make out despite her long and lose garments. But my attention was turned to the current problem by one of the <br>
large hooded figures saying, &quot;lets go!&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp At this they all turned and filed out of the room, including the girl; This I could only shake my head at, they <br>
would all be killed unless I helped them and I didn't really feel like reviling that I was a man made god. I was just <br>
settling on letting them die but I felt drawn to look back at the group heading to die and there holding me in her gaze <br>
with her beautiful green eyes that I had only now noticed was the girl looking back over her shoulder into my eyes, into <br>
my soul. Something that had not been felt by me in a very long time. By the time I realized that they were noticed by the <br>
goddess most of them were already dead. The only ones left were the girl and two of the others. I found myself  bringing <br>
up my energies, then I was before the goddess the girl lay wounded behind me from a near miss from the goddess the <br>
other live one was standing staring at me by a dead man his body horribly burnt and bent.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The goddess smiled all she saw and felt was a tall and tanned but still pathetic human swathed in a overly long <br>
cloak that was a deep black that the eye just seemed to slip right off. However this was nothing special and she said, <br>
&quot;Fool!! You must be a romantic protecting that small Aaton girl, You have no idea what your doing I'll simply kill you <br>
and her so you two can go into oblivion together.&quot; And so she began to muster a very powerful blast to released upon us.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The other hooded figure must have felt the goddess’s power for he looked at me then leapt into the doorway <br>
of a nearby building. The girl behind me simply whimpered and drew up to me, I turned to her and swept her up into my <br>
arms then turned back to the goddess who was still preparing and saying, &quot;You know Your fate! I almost want to spare <br>
you!&quot; The girl in my arms began to pray but  I quieted her and said only, &quot;There is no one to hear that.&quot; And with that <br>
the goddess released her wrath upon us.<br>
I was later told that that the heat from that blast was felt on the other side of the town for it incinerated the vast <br>
majority of the town but as for me I was fine I managed to create a barrier of spinning winds in time although my girl <br>
friend was ready for the worst with her head leaned forward and lower lip fixed firmly between her teeth. I started <br>
chuckling at this but when she looked up with tears in her eyes it was all I could do to simply keep from becoming very <br>
grave. She looked about and asked, &quot;Wha  what happened?&quot; I replied, &quot;Well, you've angered a goddess and now I'm <br>
dealing with it.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The goddess must have been in a hurry to inspect her handiwork for a strong breeze ripped the smoke form its <br>
holds on the ground and we were now standing in a large patch of dirt there was no evidence of any structure ever being <br>
there. I let the winds that I had swirling around me die down so that I could speak with the goddess. She asked in a <br>
startled voice, &quot;What god or mage are you? For I have never beheld or heard of you, wanderer of darkness.&quot; &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I said <br>
nothing. &quot;Speak!&quot; She commanded, &quot;Speak or I shall tear you apart god or not!&quot; I looked sternly at her for a moment <br>
considering the words I should say, While she twisted and twirled the vapors that made up her visible body. Then I said <br>
in a soothing voice, &quot;I...am Gene. Who might you be? I should at lest know the name of my killer if I am to be destroyed <br>
as you say.&quot; &quot;You want to know a god's name!! you must be a fool or....&quot;her voice trailed off the only possible awnser <br>
coming to her mind for if I were a mage I would be no fool but, if I were a god I would every right to speak to her a <br>
equal.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A sudden weight was forced onto my arms, The cause of this I saw as looked down was that the girl was no <br>
long conscious and clinging to me. With this realization a sudden fear swept over me and I lost my concentration, the <br>
spell of my words on the goddess who had been staring at me quite startled fell from her and she began her wrath anew. <br>
To this I paid no attention for I was treating the girl's wounds which were many and bleeding horribly. The goddess had <br>
come back to herself and declared, &quot;HA! no god would ever care for a mortal as you do! you will DIE!&quot; and with that she <br>
grasped a large boulder from the edge of the wreckage field and hurled it at me. Just as the boulder was about to hit me <br>
I blocked with my arm shattering the boulder and one of the bones in my left arm. This enraged me. And horribly so, I <br>
quickly rolled away from the girl so that no more danger would come to her.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The goddess seemed almost delighted that she had found a worthy oppnet as she hurled many objects great <br>
and small at me with her raging winds. These thing hurling at me came with great speed and I was very pressed to dodge <br>
them, But at last I was poised for a leap that would bring us into close combat when she realized my plan. As I leapt at <br>
her I created a massive charge of energy and released it as lightning, but as I have said the goddess had seen this coming and the vapors that she was made up of dissipated before the charge reached her. This brought quite a surprise to me especially when she grabbed me with another strong wind and slammed me to the ground, in my pain and confusion I absorbed all the heat energy from the air around me and this quite unexpectedly brought me victory for the goddess you see was made up of water vapor and as there was no energy in the air or the vapor in it I had taken all of her energy thus returning her to her human form.<br>
 &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She fell naked and unconscious toward me. I caught her with only my right arm and swathed her in my cloak, <br>
and lay her on the ground quickly putting an enchantment over her putting her to sleep until I called for her to awake. As such I still had the power of the goddess in me so I went back to the girl to contiue healing her wounds. During this process I found I had to remove much of her clothing in order to properly treat the wounds. I found that she had long ears very much like the elves and small but strong horns just after her hair line and pointing backwards, but otherwise was very much like an elf or human. After her wounds had been treated I retrieved  my luggage and clothed her in my spare tunic. Unfortunatly though I had used most of the power I had taken from the goddess to heal her, this I knew would manifest it's self in some form upon her damning her to the same lonly and horrible fate as mine, to wander the universe forever.... <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=xzeo>XZEO</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif" BORDER=0> at: 7/7/02 6:21:17 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uthebigbang69.showPublicProfile?language=EN>thebigbang69</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(7/7/02 10:06:42 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=690.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A ummm well a kinda odd story</span><hr size=1> Well, it is kinda odd... but when was that ever a bad thing?
