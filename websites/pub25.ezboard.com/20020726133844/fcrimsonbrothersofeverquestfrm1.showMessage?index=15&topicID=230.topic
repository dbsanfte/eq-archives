<br>
After getting tanned on the Riveria, we headed north<br>
&gt;to Paris (oui oui Pari')!  We were there for about<br>
&gt;3 days.  The first two nights we spent at a campground<br>
&gt;on the banks of the Seine (pretty, but not really in<br>
&gt;Paris).  The 3rd night we stayed in a 3rd floor hotel<br>
&gt;room near the Eiffel Tower- it definitely felt more<br>
&gt;like Paris!  The 4th day we went to Versailles- not really<br>
&gt;worth the effort in my opinion (extremely crowded, 1<br>
&gt;hr. wait to get in, etc)!  Other sites have been way<br>
&gt;more impressive- the Louvre, Notre Dame, Arc de<br>
&gt;Triomphe, the Eiffel Tower, and the massive amounts of<br>
&gt;beautiful parks and gardens.  After Paris we went to Normandy and the D-Day beaches.  It was really cool and we had a awesome camp spot in Bayeux.<br>
<br>
We are now in Barcelona and having a blast.  Have watched a few pub club soccer games and a track meet.  This city kicks butt.  It gets a thumbs up.  We are camping a few towns down the coast, very cheap (9 euro a night).  <br>
<br>
We we be headed somewhere else in Spain in the next few days but who knows where))).<br>
<br>
Hope all is still going well for everyone, best of luck<br>
<br>

We enjoyed the hustle and bustle of the city, as well as El Prado and a day trip<br>
to Toledo.  After we left Madrid we came to Cordoba, where we were camping in the local campground.  There just happened to be the biggest festival of the year for Cordoba going on while we were there, so we we joined in the fun for a few days.  After that we went to Seville and had a nice 30 minute walk to our camp site, with backpacks on and in 39c weather it makes it a little more difficult(major suckage).  Anyway the city was cool but we only stayed one night.  After that we went to Granada and stayed at a 12 euro a night hostel over looking the city.  It was very cool...Later in the day we went to a bull fight with a couple Canadians.  The bull fight was the coolest thing I have ever seen))).  It was different than the normal bull fight with the flag waving guy, this one had the 3 best horse riding bull fighters in Spain.  One guy got knocked off his horse after the bull rammed the horse and then got thrown by the bull.  <br>
<br>
The next day we went to Algerciras which is near the southern point of Spain.  We took a boat over from there to Morocco, Africa.  Ok, talk about crazy....right when we got off the boat a 100 people come up to us saying that we need a guide in the city or we will be killed and stuff like that heehee.  We shruged off their remarks and ventured into the city.  After a while we saw a guy named Abdul and paid him 3 euro to show us the city, he was cool and thought we were rich for offering that much money)).  Later that evening we went back to Algerciras with much relief that we were not killed)).  Today we are in Lisbon, Portugal.  This city is really cool and we are staying for free at some ladys house we have never meet before today=) (I love contacts).  <br>
<br>
For the next week we will be travelling around Portugal and then somewhere else.  And by the way, if you are ever in a bar in a foreign country and cheer when the USA soccer team beats their team( ie. Portugal), you better get out fast heehee<br>
<br>
Hope all is well<br>

Yes, we have traveled many miles<br>
since we last updated you.... lots of beautiful<br>
countryside from the vantage point of a train window.<br>
Last time I wrote, we were in Lisbon, Portugal and headed to Oporto, Portugal.  Oporto was a neat town with much to see and do... in case you are following<br>
our journey, here are the towns we stopped in/spent<br>
the night in.  Valenca, Portugal (border town by<br>
Northern Spain), La Coruna (Northwestern tip of<br>
Spain), Santiago de Compostella (Spain), San Sebastian<br>
(Northeastern coast of Spain, a very cool resort<br>
town), Bordeaux (French wine region, but the town<br>
itself was terrible, dirty and unfriendly), La<br>
Rochelle (Western coast of France, we loved this<br>
little village and stayed in a great B&amp;B there), Brest<br>
(Northwestern coast of France), Morlaix (France... we<br>
got stuck here accidently, but it turned out to be a<br>
huge blessing.. very cool town), Roscoff (Northern<br>
France, great port town, very medieval), Cherbourg<br>
(Northern France... this is the port town where we<br>
took a 19 hour boat ride to Ireland), Rosslare<br>
(Southeastern tip of Ireland, did you know you could<br>
lay out and get a tan in Ireland?), and finally we<br>
took a nice train ride to Waterford yesterday!<br>
Last night we got our first taste of real Irish music,<br>
a folksy pub scene with a live performance, we ended<br>
up buying the CD! We stayed at O'Conner's B&amp;B, where<br>
Mrs. O'Conner served us a big breakfast this morning,<br>
and then we toured the one and only Waterford crystal<br>
factory this morning.  No wonder those pieces of<br>
crystal are expensive!<br>
<br>
I'll continue to keep you updated as we travel.<br>
<br>
Hope all is well!<br>

<br>
The last place I wrote from was Waterford, Ireland.  From there we went to Cahir and Cashel (cool castles).  From there we went to Blarney and watched people kissing the Blarney stone)).  After that we went to Kilarney and did a 16 mile hike, and ended up getting lost.  After Kilarney we went to Dingle where we did another long hike and saw some cool sites.<br>
We finally made it to the little town of Doolin on Ireland's western coast, where we saw the Cliffs of Moher and enjoyed camping next to a sheep farm.  Then we traveled east, all the way to Dublin, where we stayed in a Sheraton hotel next to Trinity College (the book of Kells) and not far from the Guinness factory, which we were happy to tour.  We spent our July 4th at the hotel, catching up on all the movies we have missed in the past 3 months :-)  From Dublin, we caught a short (and very cheap) flight to Glasgow, Scotland.  We headed south down the western coast to Ayrshire, Calzean Castle.  From Ayrshire, we went up to Oban and took a ferry over to the Isle of Mull (beautiful campsite overlooking the water and mountains). We took a day trip from there to the Isle of Iona (historical and breathtaking beaches).  After Mull, we went to Fort William, a small town at the foot of Ben Nevis, Britain's highest mountain.  So what did we do next?? We hiked the mountain!!  Spectacular views, until we reached the top, where we were surrounded by clouds and incredibly cold air!  Needless to say, we didn't spend much time admiring the view from the top.<br>
We left Fort William this morning, with aching muscles, and are staying in Inverness to catch some &quot;Highland Games&quot;.<br>
<br>
Cheers for now!<br>
