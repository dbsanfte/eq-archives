<br>
Big changes coming!<br>
<br>
Development Update, Game Balance<br>
<br>
Just like everyone else, we're people. People make mistakes.<br>
<br>
Some mistakes aren't that unbalancing and are safe to keep in the game and work around. Others can sometimes yield gameplay that turns out to be even more fun than developers even imagined, as ingenious adventurers discover unrealized potential in their abilities.  Yet others, even the best-intentioned ones, can cause an entire style of gameplay to shift dramatically in a direction that no one particularly enjoys.  <br>
<br>
Unfortunately, today, we need to address a number of the latter kind.  For that, we sincerely apologize. It is absolutely our fault that certain abilities have been allowed to grow out of control.<br>
<br>
In our last letter, we stated that our goal for large scale battles in EverQuest was never one of endurance contests. We'd prefer to actively return to the type of battles that everyone feels are more fun - Battles that require tactics and skill, as opposed to attendance and endurance.<br>
<br>
Due to some specific abilities as they exist today in EverQuest, this unfortunately isn't possible. The mathematics simply cannot be made to work. In extreme cases such as that, the abilities themselves must be altered.<br>
<br>
It isn't possible, for example, to ever make another fast-action, do-or-die-quickly style encounter as long as Manaburn exists in its current form, unless it is targeted solely at an entire group of people who have this ability, as it will otherwise be trivial to those who do.<br>
<br>
Likewise, it isn't possible to create encounters that must be completed in a certain amount of time due to mana consumption, when Rods of Mystical Transvergence provide an essentially unlimited source of mana. Every challenging encounter must also be challenging for the massive raid of people who have infinite mana, and the encounter then becomes undoable to those who do not have the infinite supply.<br>
<br>
Hypothetically, the only alternative to changing abilities such as these would be to inflate every other class up to the same tier of relative power (be it damaging power, or mana regenerative power), then inflate the rest of the world to compensate for the sudden rash of new found power. Drastic, world-wide changes of that sort, however, are a guaranteed way to do more harm than good.<br>
<br>
The time has come to address these abilities. Fortunately, after doing so, EverQuest as a whole, and the encounters in Planes of Power, will be able to be tuned for forces who are interested in active participation in the game, as opposed to those forced to sit through yet another 45 minute encounter with a single NPC, as became the norm in Luclin.<br>
<br>
<br>
* Manaburn. In addition to the problem described above, this ability was never intended to be a way for small bands of high level players to hold hostage the advancement of larger numbers of more appropriately leveled people. While this was not the universal case, it has unfortunately happened enough across most servers to where it became a large concern in recent months.  The concept of someone looking to complete their epic quest via teamwork and overcoming the odds, only to have their attempts obstructed, in some cases, by small teams of players looking to profit financially from their power, quite frankly, is not a behavior that we wish the game to reinforce.<br>
<br>
In the next patch, Wizards who have purchased Manaburn will find that their ability points have been refunded. Please make sure that you have fewer than 25 pooled Ability points.<br>
<br>
At that point, they will be able to purchase a new Manaburn if they choose, which has most of the power of the old one. However, the new Manaburn leaves a temporary effect on its target when used that  does not stack with other Manaburns.  The delay that we will be tuning on the Test Server soon will allow a single target to be manaburned no more frequently than once every minute. <br>
<br>
Hopefully, this will bring the ability back in line with the original intent -- A powerful ability that allows a Wizard to do massive short-term damage, but not a method for a group of wizards to destroy powerful creatures with zero risk. <br>
<br>
<br>
* Rods of Mystical Transvergence. The description above shows how this spell has perhaps singlehandedly altered the balance of the end-game encounter by turning it into an event where the largest challenge is setting up a timed rotation of Complete Healing.  Once that is established, in many cases, the event is just as playable by leaving AutoAttack on, and wandering away to watch television. This does not make for stellar interactive content.<br>
<br>
We view Magicians as an excellent source of damage, especially with the many pet enhancements that have been made over the past year. To be honest, it is a more than a small shame that their full energies have been viewed as "needed" to be spent, full-time, purely on transferring their mana to others. Magicians are supposed to be the masters of elemental conjuration and highly respected as a damage-dealer, not the masters of mana transferrence.<br>
<br>
In the next update, Rods of Mystical Transvergence will be changed so that the spell summons an item that is still a valuable upgrade over the original Modulation Rod, yet does not provide an infinite amount of mana.  The idea of sudden mana gain spells is only balanced if there is a net loss over time to counteract the rapid infusion.  The initial version of the spell that we will be testing summons a Rod containing a single charge of 360 mana for 450 hit points, and can only be used by a person once each minute.<br>
<br>
In addition, the Rods themselves will be non-droppable, and spell will turn into a "target based summon," such that the Magician summons them directly onto the recipient, as opposed to having to hand them out manually or create a stockpile on the ground.<br>
<br>
Since there are definitely encounters in the game where this type of mana regeneration is mandatory for the encounter to be beaten by a reasonably sized force, a number of those encounters will likewise be re-tuned to shorten their duration, most frequently by lowering the hit points on the NPC in question.<br>
<br>
Again, our intent here is provide Magicians with a desirable secondary ability that would ideally be used before a battle, not an ability which essentially compels them to suddenly transform into a full-time support role, transferring their mana to others, as opposed to dealing damage. <br>
<br>
<br>
* Complete Healing. The concept of any class getting their single best, most efficient primary ability at level 39, has never sat well with most people. In the days of characters having a maximum of 2000-4000 hit points, the spell was absolutely not imbalancing. However, as time went on and characters progressed, now doubling that amount of hit points, it becomes obvious that the spell must be scaled back slightly.<br>
<br>
This spell has, over time, become the defining cornerstone of the Cleric class. As such, it cannot be altered significantly. Taking that into account, and given that those with the most hit points in EverQuest have yet to hit the full 10,000 HP cap of this spell, the spell will remain nearly as useful as it is today, by being reclassified as a spell that heals for 7,500 hit points, down from its current cap of 10,000.<br>
<br>
This will allow it to continue to be used as it has been in the past, while allowing for more dynamic types of heals to be introduced in the future. Making this change will allow us to providing more entertaining high-end encounters that require more active involvement than setting up a Complete Healing "Rotation" or "Chain," then repeating the same motions until the Large Thing you are facing, eventually falls down.<br>
<br>
<br>
* Monk Defense.  Finally, the issue of defensive ability needs to be addressed with respect to Monks.  Monks in EverQuest were originally intended to be a class with excellent offensive potential, both with and without equipment.  This ability came at the expense of having only passable defensive abilities, partially in the form of an extremely small, restrictive selection of equipment from which to choose.  <br>
<br>
This, of course, caused its own series of problems of how to adequately reward the person behind the character.  It did not take long for universally equippable items (ALL/ALL items) to be considered by and large as "Monk Loot," as far back as before the launch of Kunark.<br>
<br>
Over time, Monks' defensive abilities had been tuned up to correct a perceived weakness.  This, taken in combination with a few years of universally equippable, low-weight, high powered items entering the game, slowly transformed Monks into what is arguably the strongest defensive class in the game.  Monks get hit less than any other class, and due to the tuning over time, no longer take appreciably more damage when they do get hit.<br>
<br>
This imbalance between the classes does need to be addressed in order for the Plate-wearing classes in the game to have their proper relative power.  The Plate-wearing classes in the game take a serious penalty to their offensive abilities in order to defend as well as they can, and we cannot fix this problem solely by inflating their defensive abilities to compensate for this.  Again, that type of change would harm EverQuest as a whole much more than altering the one class.  Likewise, we have no desire to retroactively alter all of the equipment in the game that is contributing to this problem.  <br>
<br>
Monk defense will be altered somewhat.  It is no secret that in EverQuest, a character's Armor Class does not compare equally across different classes.  (A Wizard with 1000 AC defends differently than a Warrior with 1000AC, for example.)  It's not the most optimal system, for sure, but it is the one that many people have had much time to get used to.  As such, Monk defense will be altered such that they may continue wearing the same equipment, however, they will get a decreased benefit to their overall ability to take damage.<br>
<br>
Again, we have no desire to make monks unable to take any type of punishment -- far from it.  What we are primarily striving for is maintaining the defensive order of the Plate classes being able to take the most punishment, followed by the Chain classes and Monks.  The latter being technically a Leather wearing class who will continue to make up the difference by being able to avoid more blows than the rest.<br>
<br>
In closing, we would like to again apologize for the amount of time that we've allowed these abilites to remain in their current state. With Planes of Power on the horizon, in order to make encounters that most people would consider "fun," these abilities and class attributes need to be brought back into line as sane upgrades and logical progressions, as opposed to their current manifestations.<br>
<br>
We appreciate the many well thought-out letters that have been sent in on these topics and more.  As always, we thank you for playing EverQuest and look forward to seeing you soon in the Planes of Power.<br>

READ!</span><hr size=1> the &quot;manaburn squad&quot; tactic was incredibly gimp, and even a lot of wizards said that.  it needed to go, this is a good way to keep the spell while ending the manaburm teams.<br>
<br>
mylo, monks CAN tank the high end stuff..mid-high end anyway.  they can survive sustained rampage hits and can tank adds of unmezzable mobs, they can even tank under real aggro fairly well, except they have trouble holding that aggro without taunt.  you really gotta admit this isn't right, a guy in leather shouldn't have the AC of a guy in plate.  as long as they don't go absolutly insane with the tuning-down pulling shouldn't be affected too much..most mobs you would actually pull aren't gonna beat your ass too badly because you can stay ahead of them with run3.  if the mob is THAT ungodly hard, maybe you should go to the mob instead or trying to pull it.<br>
<br>
the T-rod nerf is the bad one..rods create mana.  literally CREATE mana, and far faster than anything else known in the game.  this is the only way to kill stuff in luclin, and for a lot of people the only way to beat stuff in velious or kunark.  unless these fights are tuned down drastically they will be impossible to do.  mobs with 1+ million HPs simply cannot die without either having 25-40 clerics or T-rods.  that's not a mage nerf, it's a nerf that insanely increases the difficulty of any mob that cannot be killed in under 5 minutes.<br>
<br>
the mage-only part of the nerf is in group/soloing.  with a decent regen and clicking T-rods mages could do something like FT6 while just sitting there.  with chloroplast and regen-3 it became more like FT12..just from rodding.  with the T-rod nerf mages went from having the best self-mana-regen in the game to the worst, instantly. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/blottdrinal.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=nevarmoore>Nevarmoore</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 45<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/10/02 6:14:41 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/flottdrinalfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=797.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Holy Crap!!!!!!

The warrior with the highest hit points in CT has about 7800 fully buffed. so as long as he has a sliver of red in his health bar 7500 is a complete heal. With pop a few might get up to about 10k but they also said they might put in new healing spells once this change goes live. I know that me and kemp had the highest hp in lords and we were happy to break 5k. I would guess that this change means a Complete heal won't be complete on less than 1% of the warriors in the game.<br>
<br>
As far as the monk changes, as soon as Mylo can show me a single area where warriors can outdamage monks with similar equipment I will agree the change was bad. The original design was monks were better at offense and warriors were better at defense. Until the last year warriors were better at defense in every situation including xp groups. Monks are still better at offense in all situations so they gave up nothing but took over for warriors as the best tank in xp groups. <p><img src="http://www.terstai.net/~terstai/images/Baledorsig2.jpg"><BR> <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=402751" target="_blank">My Stuff</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uscallops02.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ScaLLoPs02</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 35<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/10/02 10:41:08 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/flottdrinalfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=797.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Holy Crap!!!!!! They finally decided to do it!!!!! READ!</span><hr size=1> I think all these nerfs are crap...<br>
<br>
First off, manaburn, in my opinion, is being nerfed too much... Its not like there are 100s of lvl 59 to 60 wizards with manaburn up and rdy at a moments notice... Even so, I think its an ability that a highend wizard has earned... Fights will be unbareable more difficult on, say Emp Ssra, when u can only manaburn once every minute. If u wanna nerf manaburn, make the downtime longer.<br>
<br>
Secondly, I still hate how clerics are getting shafted a lot lately by VI... As much as i hate the fact they are being &quot;nerfed&quot;, it isnt a bad nerf... Like the post said, there will prolly be another 10k ch in PoP anyways. I was about to be extremely livid if they had make CH lvl 50 plus or something like i thought the post was going.<br>
<br>
Finally, monk ac hits are crap. Who cares if a monk has better ac than a sk or pal? When was the last time CiH, CT, WL, Vice, UC, or whatever, has relied on a Paladin/ShadowKnight to tank? Monks need the ac a lot more because they have to pull and draw a lot more aggro with epic than Pals/SKs, unless the sk is chain dotting, draining, and using his hate spell on himself. Also, it is total BS to think that a highend monk can tank better than a warrior... At the higher end game, warriors get 70ac bps and monks get 35ish ac... Not to mention, the huge HP difference between monks and the plate classes also compensates... At 53, my monk has 1700hp with epic, and most sks and pals i know at that lvl have over 2k. Warriors have like 2600 or 2700 at 53. Sks, Pals, and Monks are fine the way they are... Just give warriors better ac rating and/or more hps and leave it at that.<br>
<br>
just letting ya know my opinion<br>

Make war 1600 or so, sk pal 1400 or so and leave monks and everyone at the current 1200. That would have fixed the defensive problem but Verant chose to do it a different way. And while you are right monks do not tank the big mobs, warriors are supposed to be the best tanks, that includes in xp groups against level 45 mobs. When Kunark came out and warriors got a lot of new weapons and disc. monks screamed bloody murder that warriors were outdamaging them sometimes. Verant responded by putting monks and rogues on a higher offensive table than warriors saying they should always outdamage warriors in every case and warriors should out tank monks in every case. Then Verant proceeded in Velious and Luclin to put 0 wt all/all gear in the game that when given to monks threw this totally out of whack. Monks still out damaged warriors in all cases but now could out tank them about half the time. As far as equipment I have seen in the past month 45ac helms and 60ac pants go to monks. There are no higher ac pants in the game except in Vex Thall and on Drinal that means only CiH and maybe some asian guilds have them. Anyway point is warriors tanking ability was kinda broken, Verant needed to improve it but instead nerfed the monks ability. <p><img src="http://www.terstai.net/~terstai/images/Baledorsig2.jpg"><BR> <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=402751" target="_blank">My Stuff</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ufabbz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fabbz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 68<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/10/02 12:14:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/flottdrinalfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=797.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Holy Crap!!!!!!

READ!</span><hr size=1> scall, wizzys don't use manaburn on big mobs...it's efficiency blows.  they can do easily 4 times the damage by chain-casting whatever their normal nukes using that same mana.  most high-manapool wizards can put over 40k (in some cases WELL over) into a mob on a full mana bar, versus a max manaburn of maybe 16k if it criticals.   manaburn has 2 uses basically, instant damage on hard to kill but low-HP mobs (queen in chardok and Rak'Ashir in CoM come to mind) and sniping low-HP dragons (anyof them in kunark) with manaburn teams.  with the nerf option 1 isn't really effected greatly, option 2 is gone.<br>
<br>
scall, at the same time those warriors are getting 70AC BP's monks are getting 60AC legs.  there's not a lot of difference.  Verant is calling monks on AC because monks don't take hits better than SK's...they take hits better than Warriors.  they have almost same AC, plus all the defence skills to not get hit.  and yes, i'm seen monks tank a ssra boss, it may not be intentional, but it worked out when it happened.<br>
<br>
the HP argument doesn't really work because verant is saying that in PoP everyone's HP, across the board, is going to go up by 25%.  that means in luclin and earlier monks will have same HP those warriors do now, with same AC and better damage aviodance.  that's why they're nerfing, not because you're overpowered now, but because you will be in a few weeks. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/usnackchips.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Snackchips</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 54<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/10/02 1:46:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/flottdrinalfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=797.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Holy Crap!!!!!!

True its not like there were probably ALOT of wizards that abused this ability if they even had it. It's just not right for a group of wizards to get together and take down what would require a few balanced well equipped players to take down. Complete heal doesn't really bother me, I don't think I will see many players breaking 7500hp anyways. Even so, Clerics will ALWAYS be needed for ressing, and they are still the best at healing, no other class can compare. The monk change makes since, if you're going to look at armor classes and compare their defense abilities (by the way, its rumored on Test that Ranger defense cap is going up to 240, 20 more points then the old cap), Plate>Chain>Leather>Silk. I always thought monks were too over powering with their melee damage plus defense abilities, but I never wanted them to be changed. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=264991" target="offsite"><img src="http://www.jenniferb.com/tek/tapbanner.jpg" border="0"></a>

They finally decided to do it!!!!! READ!</span><hr size=1> About the 60ac pants... They are from AoW if i'm not mistaken... How many are on Drinal atm? Less than 20 I'm guessing... Asides, AoW is a rare exception and correct me if i'm wrong, but there is a 55ac helm with even better stats than the legs have that is WARRIOR only that drops off him too... Warriors also get a Blade of Carnage (15 20 with uber stats and a Hate proc)... So warrior armor is on par with monk armor... And i wouldnt forget to mention that Flayed Barb Skin legs are a rare occurence for monk armor... 40 + ac armor in every slot is rather common in the high end raid for a warrior.<br>
<br>
Monks do get some nice higher end stuff, but its not nearly as easy to obtain as tank gear... Take quest armor for example, most warriors i know would kill for a full suit of SS armor, but most of the monk gear sucks... The bp is decent, even tho the proc doesnt help a monk as much as other classes, mainly becuz monks have lower hp and can bw to 70 and regen the rest by the time u can click urself to full. Bracers are decent, mainly cuz it clicks a 55 mage Pouch of Quellious... The rest is effectively crap (Monk ss legs = 6ac)... Examples below<br>
<br>
Warrior SS BP:<br>
54ac<br>
15str 10sta 7agi 7dex 10svm 5svc 5svh 10svd 90hp<br>
Effect: Invigorate<br>
<br>
Monk SS BP:<br>
18ac<br>
14str 13dex 5sta 13agi 4svall 50hp<br>
Effect: Invigorate<br>
<br>
<br>
I dont see monks getting any advantage here over ac, saves, or hp...<br>
<br>
Point is that a warrior of equal uberness to a monk has tons better tanking ability... U can't say that monks are better tanks than warriors because XWarrior has full crusty armor and Xmonk has full pimp gear and tanks better. If that is the case u can say that a mage is a better nuker than a wizzy if he has 255int and mana gear and wizzy only has 100int. I dont think u should nerf monks because more ppl twink them than they do warriors. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uscallops02.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ScaLLoPs02</A> at: 10/10/02 12:29:17 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/umylokar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mylokar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 287<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/10/02 2:49:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/flottdrinalfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=797.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Holy Crap!!!!!!

Basically if a warrior and a monk with the exact same AC get hit by the same mob the monk will take more damage from it. I know in HoT both me and doliok were over the soft cap of 1200, the max hit I got was 330, his max was like 350. Verant decided that there needed to be more of a difference. They said in the letter they are not changing avoidance which is your dodge and block so you still might get hit less than a similarly equipped warrior. At least wait until you see how much of a change they make before you yell about it. <p><img src="http://www.terstai.net/~terstai/images/Baledorsig2.jpg"><BR> <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=402751" target="_blank">My Stuff</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uscallops02.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ScaLLoPs02</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 37<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/10/02 6:35:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/flottdrinalfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=797.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Holy Crap!!!!!!

Like i said before, if they want to change damage mitigation, make warriors better than all classes, but dont nerf one class... The same problem will come up again, I guarentee it, in a few months with sks and pals having the same dmg mitigation as warriors... Are they gonna nerf them too? Lets just nerf everyone while we are at it instead of making one class better at what he's supposed to do.<br>

READ!</span><hr size=1> that argument almost works...except for AC capping.  past a certain amount AC doesn't mean much.  any class that can hit that AC amount is equally armored because past there you aren't gaining much, if anything.<br>
<br>
take bale's example...you have to admit there is somehing fundamentally wrong with a monk getting hit only about 30 points more in that kind of fight.  if average hit on a warrior is 350 it should be low/mid 400's on a monk, and then 500's on a caster.  look at rangers, massive damage output, low defence, that is exactly how monks were intended.  you're not supposed to be able to get hit more like a tank.<br>
<br>
and ok, so the AoW legs were a bad example.  but you can hit 1200AC without that kind of gear.  even my gimp ass monk at 44 with some not-so-good stuff has 960AC unbuffed.  i'm pretty sure what they're really changing for monks is just moving the AC softcap down.  instead of capping out at 1200 or so, it'll be more like 1000 or 900.  it's a tuning process though, you gotta play with it a little to get the right value, and yea, verant probably cut too much, that's their style.  just gotta hope it gets better.<br>
<br>
besides guys, keep perspective, AC shouldn't matter that much if you're good.  the only time on a raid you should get hit at all is on pulls, and you got discs you can use for pulling the ungodly hard hitters.  look at mage or wiz..my AC is about 700, i have no defence skills, and fully buffed about 3k HPs.  if i get hit i WILL die, that simple.  do i die every fight?  every other?  certainly not.  a lack of AC isn't a death sentence, it's a warning not to get aggro.  <br>
<br>
here's a thought.  maybe verant wants SK's to be the pullers in PoP  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
edit:  i just saw the bit about soloing.  remember, verant doesn't WANT people to solo.  they want xp groups, at least duo's.  with PoP even the xp group will be obsolete, people will RAID for xp.  if it makes monks unable to solo they see that as a bonus benefit, not a bad thing. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ufabbz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fabbz</A> at: 10/10/02 9:03:01 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uscallops02.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ScaLLoPs02</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 38<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/11/02 12:17:10 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/flottdrinalfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=797.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Holy Crap!!!!!! They finally decided to do it!!!!! READ!</span><hr size=1> No offense Fabs, but ur arguements are so one sided... You agree with every nerf but the mage one... If VI is so bent on keeping ppl from solo'ing, why arent they gonna nerf quad kiting from MAGES, druids, and wizards? Are they gonna take away fear from necros and sks? Take away charm from chanters and bards? Every caster in the game can solo w/ the exception of clerics... All hybrids can solo... Pure melee are the only ones who can't solo.. Monks being the only one's who really could... (usually becuz of high dmg output and high regen via fungi and mend)<br>
<br>
You fail to realize that not many monks have 1200ac... I'm sure mylo doesnt and he's lvl 60.... After about 1k ac, ac increase DRAMATICALLY drops for monks... At 1k ac you have some of the highest ac on droppable items... I barely break 1k ac with epic and some not bad items... With upgrades in the areas i need i will have maybe 1050 at best... After that, I can't really upgrade unless i'm raiding those uber mobs and get awarded Barbarian Legs or whatever. <br>
<br>
Also, everyone fails to realize that we have significantly less hp than ALL tanks.. Even if we could tank as well as you, we still go down a lot faster... (example: fully buffed 60 warrior MA has about 6.5k and 60 monk puller has about 4.5k). <br>
<br>
<br>
On another topic... WHY DOES EVERYONE KEEP BRINGING UP THE DEFENSIVE DISCS? Everyone acts like monk defense discs are godly uber or something... Well heres some info on our uber disc... Lvl 54 disc: Voiddance ( 7 sec combat dmg avoidance, reuse time=1 hour) Woot, I can pull 1 thing if i do it in 7 seconds every hour.... <br>
<br>
About the 30 dmg thing, 30 less dmg per hit is about 2k less dmg Bale is taking in a 3 minute fight with a mob who's fighting at 30 dly and more with double and triple hits. (dont say they dont fight at 30dly and u KNOW they do more than 1 hit every 3 seconds, so it is definately well OVER 2k hp)<br>
<br>
About moving monk softcap down:<br>
What they are changing is the value of each AC, as i understand it... Example: 1000ac for a wizard isnt the same as 1000ac for a warrior.<br>
<br>
And i dont know what i have to do to get this through ya'lls heads, but there is NO WAY IN HELL i can tank... Go have one of CTs monks tank Emp Ssra and tell me how long he lived... Be sure not to blink your eyes. As is, we can tank about as well as rangers, but with added dmg avoidance skills... (not counting the 10 or so Lvl 60 monks on Drinal who can tank as well as the not so uber warriors). PLZ PLZ PLZ PLZ PLZ stop saying we can tank becuz we dont go down like casters when we catch aggro.<br>
<br>
To Fabs, if you think monks are overpowered, u should really take a look at ur own class... Epic pet solo's epic monk w/o any help... Nuff said.<br>

I dont think the real issue the monks have right now is being able to out tank a warrior.. The real issue is monks are Pull Bitches and where you as a warrior will tank 1 mob in most situations the monk that brings you that 1 mob just split it from 3 others.<br>
So when your tanking quads for 300 on 1 mob<br>
The monks that split that spawn will have the chance to get hit by 4 mobs that will now quad us for 500.<br>
The nerf dosent really affect me in a raid manner at all, as im good enough at aggro control i dont take much dmg.. But it affects my soloing ability and pulling ability greatly..<br>
There will be a lot more monk deaths while pulling if a FD fails.<br>
<br>
The cleric nerf is no biggie as there will be very few 10K Warriors.<br>
The Wizard Nerf is actually a good thing it dosent affect anyone but the manaburn teams at all.<br>
The Mage Nerf Sucks because They dont have the raw casting power of a wizard and alot of the time the pets get them in trouble.. CotH is all thats left..I really do hope mages dont get thrown to the wayside on raids. I like mages... =)<br>
