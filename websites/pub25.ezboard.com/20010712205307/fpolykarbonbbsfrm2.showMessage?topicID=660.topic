Something I noticed about her's and Pat's <!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.polykarbon.com/gallery/images/polybraek.gif"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--> line art... and also Dananasan's <!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.skidvis.com/dojo/skatline.gif"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END-->... what these have in common is the great variation in line width, weight, stroke, and amount. Here I'll write some stuff I have discovered... as well as some questions I'd like to ask you peeps... <br>
<br>
As for Saka's pic... I noticed that different objects have lines that thin out near other objects. What do I mean...? Here're the pointers.....<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://server2039.virtualave.net/xenoflare/misc/sakapt1.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
For circle one I think she thinned the line between the knuckle area and the arm area because the skin there is touching. That leads me to think that areas where there are less depth change will have less of a contour line thickness.<br>
<br>
The wrist in cricle 2 leads me to ask, why did she thicken the line on her wrist, the one that connects to the thumb? It seems like she always thicken the lines whenever a concave shape appears. Is this for shading? Same with circle 3. Why did she darken those lines?<br>
<br>
Circle 4 confuses me even more. How did she know to make the line of her arm thin there? I know that Saka probably learned a lot of these inking styles over experience... but I bet good money there's reasoning behind how and why she inks the way she does. The lines flow so damn smoothly and realistically, and I'm beginning to ponder why the lines are drawn the way they are.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://server2039.virtualave.net/xenoflare/misc/patpt.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
Here's poly, being fried by something (what was it again pat?)<br>
Circle one's thick line is most likely thicker simply because Pat wanted to show that the forearm is closer to the viewr than the upper arm. Same with the rest of the hand. Same goes with circle 2.<br>
<br>
Another thing I've noticed, shown in circles 2 and 3, is that Pat tends to use thick lines for individual forms, and details on those forms have thinner lines. Is this because the details have less depth and therefore do not create as large a contour line?<br>
<br>
I'm curious about circle 4's straight line. There's a curve at the end of that line, so Pat probably didn't use a ruler. If he did, did he draw that line fast or slow? Usually when I ink slowly... my hand gets shaky. But it's also risky to ink too fast. How did he do it? Ruler?<br>
<br>
Circle 5 hair strand is interesting. Why did he choose to ink it thick above, then progressively thin the line down as it proceeds downwards (then thicken it again as it hits the bang's bottom). Is it because the form is getting closer to Poly's face, and therefore has less of a contour? Additionally... did he use multiple passes for that line or did he press hard down on the pen, then lighten it, then hard again? Sounds like a Matrix manuever... or a ninja trick.<br>
<br>
Finally I want to ask about Dansama's inking. <!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://server2039.virtualave.net/xenoflare/misc/dansama.gif"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--> If some of my previous assumptions were right, then Dananasan inked that hairy wolf guy with a thick line because he is in the foreground. Shouldn't the hand be composed of an even thicker line if it follows the same rule? I see that details of even the foreground forms have thin lines, and share the same line weight as the bg's detail line weight. Wouldn't that be confusing to the viewer?<br>
<br>
<br>
Arg.... sorry for this massive (and badly composed) post. I'm having a tough time inking &quot;properly&quot; with good contour... and having a billion questions running through my head I thought I'd share some of my ponderings and more immediate questions with you peeps. Thanx for reading, and help out if you can. ^_^<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>

<br>
I thought this was an interesting topic, so here are my thoughts, although I make no claims to be an expert inker (or even a good one), I just thought you shouldn't have to wait till tomorrow for an answer.<br>
<br>
Saka's pic:<br>
This one's tough for me.  I know that line variation is good, but I can't really spot the logic behind why the line gets thinner in certain places.  Her lines sometimes almost seem the opposite of what they should be, so maybe that's what she intended.  For example, I pressed my hand between my arms like where you have circle #1 and it seems to me that the line should be thicker there, not lighter.  I'm as curious as you on this one. <br>
<br>
Pat's pic:<br>
Since he's here, he can explain his own logic.  I will say though that he probably used a french curve or one of those adjustable rubber curves to get some of the lines so smooth.<br>
<br>
Dananasan's pic:<br>
I know that some people like to use a thicker line for the outline of an object to separate it from the background and draw attention to it.  I don't think it's right though to think of it like perspective, where the closer you get, the thicker you get.  If Dananasan (is that spelled right?) used a thicker line for the hand as you were wondering, it would have drawn the eyes to it, and I doubt that's what he intended.  He probably wanted the viewer to see the whole character, and not just the hand.  So maybe that's the point: The thicker outline is used to create depth and separate the foreground from the background, but not necessarily to indicate relative positions.<br>
<br>

For some reason I've missed this part in my art education... <br>
<br>
I think I'll go ask Saka about the lines directly. She seems to have it down to a pattern almost. And yeh... I hope Pat replies about his pic too since <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  His lineart is always this slick, even in the sketch phase.<br>

I'm just now getting into doing varying line widths and found this very helpful. My initial impression is that there are varying schools of thought as to when line widths should be thicker or thinner. Pat's general style is apperently using thick lines to define the most important shapes to the general image (i.e. body structure) and thinner ones on sharp curves and details. I printed out the very picture which you are discussing for reference when I draw, thereby Polykarbonating me.<br>
<br>
Saka's is a much different matter. I'm not quite as sure on this one, but naturally wrists (2 on the picture), when in the right direction, are at the sharpest angle from the picture's view. Therefore, a thinner line shows the depth of her body.<br>
<br>
As for Dananasan's, I'm the least clear of all. Perhaps he uses his line thicknesses just to draw the eye's attention to the character's body and not immediately to his hand. I think you'll agree if you looked at the hand first, which is far towards the bottom, the picture would not have the same immediate effect on you. One can see almost all of the picture when observing the pronounced lines on the character's head.<br>
<br>
I'm curious what everyone else thinks. This topic is very helpful to me as it is a technique I am in the stages of learning. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uthe3imagineers.showPublicProfile?language=EN>The3Imagineers</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br> <font color=#336699>(1/26/01 6:31:12 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A study in line weight</span><hr size=1> I believe that line weight is varied in certain places according to the artist's idea of what looks best. As soon as my scanner is working i will post my line art and you will notice I draw all the lines the same weight at first and then thicken lines according to where an imaginary light source hits the or darken lines to seperate one form from another. <br>
<br>
Looking at Saka's pic I think she wanted to go for softness for the woman thingy. Notice how the lines are thicken where part of the woman curves and thin out as things are straighten. Except for the chin where a dark line will ruin the soft look.<br>
<br>
I can't see any reason why the lines on Poly vary in weight except to bring out the figure from a backround not on the picture.<br>
<br>
Dananasan's line weights look simple to me. To atract attention to the fox warrior instead of the kill rock guy. The thing about the hand being in the forground and should have an even heavier line would destroy the specific part of the fox he want you to look at. Notice the light lines on the Fox's face. This is to suck your eye into a realativly white area and box your focus in with the heavy lines of the rest of the form. The heavy lines all have about the same wieght so your eye won't wander because they don't look interesting enough. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ulordgabriel3.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lord Gabriel 3</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br> <font color=#336699>(1/26/01 6:38:27 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/lord_hazama_iii/distortionbutton.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A study in line weight</span><hr size=1> ummm…I didn't learn this at all<br>
<br>
For Pat's pic, I think he used the classic-comic inking style…like you said, the major objects have darkened outlines, foreshadowing perspectives have bold lines, and details are done in fine-tip<br>
<br>
Of course, I don't thik I've ever heard (well, seen) Pat actually say his inking is good…although it's <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> always much better than mine</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. <br>
<br>
I've never seen Saka or Dananasan before…probably a result of my being largely absent for a month. Since I've never seen them before now, I need more time to study them to give a really good analysis.<br>
<br>
Saka's drawing looks 100% proffessional anime. Dananasan's drawing is also very proffessional (and it reminds me of Lynx from Chrono Cross performing Dash&amp;Slash against that Gigas monster in FF7). Those two pics are exceptionally better than my drawings, and I always kiss the better artist's ass <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :hat --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/pimp.gif ALT=":hat"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I ruin more pics with inking than anyone (ok...maybe an exagerration..but it's to make a point).<br>
<br>
When I first started inking I used a Staedtler mars tech pen. I took my work to a Convention and showed it around..I was picked up by a local comic publisher and he took me aside and said<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey, whatcha inking with?&quot; <br>
I showed him. He snatched it from my hand and threw it across the room..he said &quot;Don't&quot;. It was the single greatest thing anyone had ever done for me. (Mike Raabe...if you're reading this 'THANK YOU'!)<br>
<br>
He explained to me that inking was not merely tracing the pencil lines in black ink. It was using varied weights to give the object dimensions and visual cues to the viewer as to what was close and what was far away. He showed me some examples.<br>
<br>
I went home and trashed the rest of my techpens and ruined about 100 more pieces of art with a nib pen and brush.BUT my lines were at least dynamic.<br>
<br>
Then I discovered Shirow. My whole life I've only seen &quot;Jack Kirby/Marvel&quot; styled inking. And here Shirow used his pens like a pencil. I discovered Nylon tipped pens like Sakuras and they were way more natural for me to ink with than anything I've inked with before. Still, I was learning &quot;How&quot; to ink.<br>
<br>
Lately, I've finally made some breakthroughs (though not near enogh of them) and have a little more method to my inking than I've had before. Here's what I know and I'll spill it now:<br>
<br>
1) Inking is a lot like caligraphy. There are thick parts and thin parts..hard to tell which should be which until it's too late. When you see a Caligraphy letter that was written at the wrong angle..you can tell immediatlely...same with inking objects. When you made the wrong line thick...it's blaringly obvious.<br>
<br>
2)General rules of thumb to put the right lines in the right place:<br>
<br>
a) lines are thicker on objects nearer the view plane or &quot;camera&quot;<br>
<br>
b)Lines are thicker on the surfaces away from the light source. Especially on curved surfaces<br>
<br>
c)Start your stroke where you want your ink to be thickest and pull towards the lighter area while gradually relieving pressure on the pen.<br>
<br>
d) Keep your wrist straight (tape it if you have to) and mave your arm from your shoulder or elbow.<br>
<br>
e) the cleaner your pencils, the easier the inking job will be. Predetermine areas of shadow and cross-hatching.<br>
<br>
everything else you will have to experience. I've heard this stuff 1000 times before I finally figured it out by just doing it. I can't &quot;tell&quot; you how to ink, just give you a place to start.<br>

&quot;He explained to me that inking was not merely tracing the pencil lines in black ink&quot;<br>
<br>
I think that's one of the most important things I should have picked up a long time ago o_o; but didn't. Your response is probably going to help me (and anyone else who read this) tremendously.<br>

But yeah. Thanks for answering my questions! <br>

&quot;Keep your wrist straight (tape it if you have to) and mave your arm from your shoulder or elbow.&quot; <br>

o_o; that's like... playing the violin? Can't believe anyone inks like that. I'll give it a shot or two. <p><table width="373" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<br>
I'd be interested in trying these Nylon tipped pens out myself... Is Sakura the brand name?<br>
<br>
I'd pretty much given up on inking a long time ago because I only ruin what I ink... maybe, now that I've gotten some new insight into the process, I'll take it up again...<br>

One is to lead (and express) perception. In technical drawing you follow rules: Lines with open space behind them thicker - detail lines thinner, Lines in light thinner - in shadow thicker; For art it's seems to be more about emphasis. You ink thicker were a seperation or heavy constrast is needed to guide the viewer.<br>
<br>
For Saka's drawing I've not the slightest clue. It's not entirely pleasing to my eyes. It seems to thicken at peaks of curves; I just don't like the linework.<br>
<br>
I think the fox/wolf type guy in the foreground of Dananasan's pic has heavy lines around it because it would be otherwise difficult to seperate from the background. Imagine how confusing the whole thing would look with a thinner line around it.<br>

But I tend to do the black over your pencils with my pencils already varying in width. Also I tend to work from the top left to bottom right so I can bend my wrist bc straight arming it just is to uncomfortable.<br>
<br>
Staum* you want to use Bristol board like the pros for paper. Using my style I use a standard Pilot P-500 series.<br>
<br>
And my answers to the pics. The first is the most obvious and already stated in Danan's pic the Wolfie is brought forward by outlining the pic. It is to bring out of the background. Other examples are Ale Garza (penciler of the EVE Protomecha comic).<br>
<br>
Pat explained his so I'll leave his alone.<br>
<br>
In Saka' style (which I tend to ink like somewhat) the idea is wherever something touches the line is thinest as well as the long curve like on the arm Circle 4. But the joints tend to be thicker.  I guess it is like compressing the line at the joint and stretching it on the longer lengths. It is something of that nature of theory to which I think Saka inks.<br>
<br>
Hope that helped and if you have any other questions just ask, but I warn you there is no way I am close to an expert or Pro these are just my findings as I explore through my art classes in high school. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/usaphiresphere.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Saphire Sphere</A> at: 6/30/01 8:42:44 pm<br></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm2.showMessageRange?topicID=660.topic&start=21&stop=27>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm2.showMessage?topicID=1587.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm2.showMessage?topicID=1596.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm2.emailToFriend?topicID=660.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm2.threadControl?topicID=660.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm2.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=660.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm2.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=660.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub25.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="polykarbonbbsfrm18">PK-BBS Rules and Regulations!<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm3">News and Updates<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm2">Photoshop and Art questions<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm4">General Manga Discussion<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm5">Japanese Language Help<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm23">art in progress<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm13">Black and White Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm14">Color Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm19">Member's Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm17">Moderators Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm6">Member Photos<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm22">How to use Fight Club<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm20">Challenges<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm21">Matches<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm25">Pose Forum<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm26">Writer's Forum<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm27">Board F.A.Q.s</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#336699>- </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs>Polykarbon BBS</a><font color=#336699> - </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm2>Photoshop and Art questions</a> <font color=#336699> - </font><a href="http://www.polykarbon.com">Polykarbon: Manga & Photoshop</a><font color=#336699> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://www.qksrv.net/click-553273-677484" target="_blank" >
