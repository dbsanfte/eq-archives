If there are people from PK playing all the time, then maybe I'll get it becuase I love playing with you guys.  But if I have to play with people who have hacks all the time and just kill me with one shot, or can shoot me through walls, i don't really want to play it.  So...  Is it worth it? <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">

<br>
Before I started to play this I had heard a lot of info from people saying how it sucks and all.  So I decided to test out all the stuff that were &quot;bad&quot;.<br>
<br>
First off gun accuracy.  I've used most of the main guns, (deagle, ak, m4, aug, sig commando) and what i've noticed is that you're bascially screwed while jumping and gunning.  However, running and shooting isn't much of a problem if you burst fire 1-2 shots.   When you duck, your crosshair gets smaller and aiming gets significantly better.<br>
<br>
Deagle- shooting is horrible in the air. Semi good while running<br>
<br>
ak- i haven't made that many long distance kills with this. it seems less accurate than before even while ducking.  If you try to jump and shoot you can hit the wall that is right next to you o_0.  <br>
<br>
m4 - still very accurate with the silencer on.  I managed 3 headshots under the bridge of de_dust however running and gunning will get you no-where as well as jumping.  <br>
<br>
aug-  killer gun. quite accurate while running and a superb gun while crouching.  haven't tried jumping<br>
<br>
commando- same as aug<br>
<br>
awp-  haven't really used this but i heard there's a delay before the scope zooms in meaning those quick snipe-and-run's don't work that well. (However i've watched snipers in first person and they can still kick ass)<br>
<br>
Which leads to the second part.  The new spectator mode.  This has got to be the coolest features I've ever seen in the update.  If you press crouch while you're dead, you will get a whole bunch of options that you can choose from.  <br>
<br>
Instead of the 3 old modes :chase cam, free chase cam and free mode, they added :<br>
<br>
overhead spectate : The entire map is drawn out and there are little circles representing the players.  think of it like a detailed radar with both teams on it. (great for screen watching)  In this mode you can follow 1 person around and see who's near him or roam around free and see where people are.  <br>
The coolest feature about the new spectate mode is an option that works similar to split screen tv.  the main screen can show either the overhead map or the main game screen and in the top left there is a little box that shows the other.  (so if you choose the overhead map mode the little box will show the player running around in chase cam mode)  <br>
<br>
the best specate that can ever be made : <br>
First person: you are in first person mode of the selected character. Now you can really see if someone is cheating or you can learn some new tricks.!<br>
<br>
However you can't use the split screen in first person so it's hard to help your friend screen watch on the phone while learning his techniques.  <br>
<br>
yes yes i know this is getting long and you probably don't want to read anymore so i'll make the last few parts brief.  As far as jumping is concerned. There's not much of a problem with it. Sure it's a pain that you slow down every time you jump (if you jump again you will slow down even more) but this adds to the strategy of the game, but makes it easier for an awper to ping you &gt;.&lt;  I myself am an insane jumper and I love jumping around while i move. So this is one thing I don't really like... but that I can adapt to.  I haven't been awped yet tonight and I played for a few hours. <br>
<br>
Lag. no problem here.  I think those who complain should get a new ISP cuz it works as good as ever..  actually a little better.  normally my ping is 90.. today i was playing with 60 ping.  and this was de_chateau where it's supposedly super laggy.<br>
<br>
Overall.  What people say is not as drastic as it sounds.  Sure the jumping has totally changed the game and made this game a newbie-crouch-and-kill game, but you still have some aim while you're on the run and it's still very possible to take out a whole line of people while going full auto. You just need to know how to do it.  I actually like the new modes and such, very nice touch, same with all the little nitpicks that they fixed up.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Hope this helps. (yes yes it's long and doesn't make much sense in the end but it's getting late, (holy shiz it's 2 o_0)<br>
<br>
Well see you all later<br>
<br>
