<br>
Read the descritpion of a Rhakk at the very least, and the timeline includes everything you need to know about vocab.  Im not the greatest with grammer, and I detest wasting time with a spellchecker that deoesnt work properly, so deal with errors.  Othere then that, please c&amp;c the idea/plot, not te grammer ect.  Oh if anyone wishes to do any kind of concept art it would be appreciated, but e-mail me at Jakkin@att.net.  Thank you all!!!  By the way, How do I get in to edit the topic as so I can post chapters later, or where can I look to find this information. Sorry for being a noob at this board....<br>
<br>
<br>
The Rhakk Society<br>
<br>
Appearance:  The Rhakk usualy stand about 7 feet tall, but can reach heights of over 8 feet.  They have pale blue skin, and black, white, or yellow eyes.  Their hands are very<br>
delicate and can perform amny percise actions.  The Rhakk’s muscle fibers are very dense, giving a thin, but powerful, appearance.  The Rhakk have fourteen fingers, seven on each<br>
hand.  Each hand includes two opposable thumbs, giving the Rhakk vary good swimming and artistic technequies.  Rhakk can live upwards of two-hundred andforty years before<br>
death, and some have reached nearly fifty, but this is uncommon.<br>
<br>
Government:  The Rhakk value the elderly most highly in daily society, followed by women. When the Rhakk seek guidance or council, they most often visit one or more of the Yomar, the eldest of those who live amongst the Rhakk.  There are usually about ten Rhakk in the Yomar, followed by an eleventh, the leader, dubbed Yomen.  The Yomen act<br>
as an oligarchy, but rarely ever discuss things as a group, unless there is a major problem.<br>
<br>
Reproduction:  The Rhakk reproduce sexually.  A male and femal meet and meditate near a source of pure water for several hours.  After this time, the male exchanges a strand of<br>
DNA though the touching of palms.  The women will carry the child for six months before giving birth.<br>
<br>
Maturity:  Though it takes around 30 years for a Rhakk to be calm enought to go through the rigorus reproduction ritual, Rhakk grow to understand things such as complicated<br>
speech and motor skill by their first years of life.  Rhakk of the age of 5 are often active in daily routines and converstations, and by this time they are at an average height of four<br>
feet.  For the first five years, Rhakk eat intensively, and grow quickly.  After this period, the metabolic rate slows by over 50%.  Rhakk usually meet full height at the age of 25.<br>
<br>
State of mind:  The Rhakk meditate at least three times a week, four on average.  This give the Rhakk an excited state of being, and many of those who can master and further<br>
grasp ways to meditate can unlock powers unseen.  Many Yomen hav fortold tiny portions of the future, and others have had telekinetic abilitys.  No power as of yet as been great enough to do major physical damage, but it is believed that such power could be obtained.<br>
<br>
Culture:  The Rhakk are a peaceful culture, and work for the better of the group.  There are very few fights, and there has been no known record of murder or suicide.  The Rhakk<br>
are very mentally adept, and love to shape smooth artistic works.  The Rhakk are a very patient people, and will sometimes spend 50 or more years honing a single skill to utter<br>
perfection. The Rhakk love to learn, and are very knowlegable by the time they reach old age.<br>

Timeline:<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
0:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A waterfall.  From the lake that is formed by this single source, a group of beings come to life, from what seems to be the essance of the water<br>
itself.  Already civilized, they have no memory of any former life, or how they came to exist.  They give their tribe of 20 colonists the name of Rhaksha (Seed-well, or Life). <br>
(There were 8 men and 12 women who came forth from the waterfall)<br>
<br>
3:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ge’Nueem, son of Gee’Nu-(First born-the first to arrive in Rhakksha), is born.  He is the first child to be birthed in Rhaksha. <br>
<br>
5-60:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The years of Growth.  A major burst in population happened during this time.  By the year 62 the population doubbled to 40 Rhakk.<br>
<br>
100:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The Rhaksha have formed a large community, run by the surviving elders who were the origonals to arrive at Ramm’Tiel (Little stream-where the elders first came from).<br>
<br>
120-190:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A second Major population burst, setting the current population of Rhakksha to 95, over doubble, at the end of the year 190.<br>
<br>
250:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp There is only one surviving elder from the origonal 20-Gee’nu Who is the head of the Yomen (Council).  The Yomen is made of eleven<br>
elders, and is thus established that the eldest is to be advisor of the Yomen, and the youngest to be the link to the outside world, the one with the best connections as well as<br>
input of the colony.  The tribe has grown into a well-established colony of aprox. 120 Rhakk (Seed, or colonist.  Also, for one who assumes or is unknowleged.)<br>
<br>
253:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The death of Gee’Nu, the oldest Rhakk on record.  His son, Ge’Nueem, takes his place as the head Yomen.  He coins the term of Yomar for the head of the Yomen.  (This date marks the time in which the last of the origonal 20 settlers have passed.  253 marks the begining of era of the Second Yomen)<br>
<br>
260:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ge’Nueem passes away.  The next elder in line takes his place.<br>
<br>
270:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  Iem’Wruth, has a vision while meditating at Ramm’Tiel.  She see’s seveal dark, stout beings, trading with the people of Rhaksha.  These<br>
dark-colored creatures bring gifts of interesting metals and ore.  The population of Rhakksha is at 173 Rhakk.<br>
<br>
277:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Thrak’Hru commands that Ie'm Wruth be held in suspicion.<br>
<br>
278:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ha’root, daughter of Iem’Wruth, celebrates her 23rd birthday with several hours of medetation.  She as well has the vision of the dark colored<br>
people, and draws a picture of what she saw.  When she returns, she and her mother present the picture, and recount the visions of the dark people.  After several months of<br>
medetation at Ramm’Tiel, the Yomen say that these visions were false, and charge Iem’Wruth of bathing in the waters of the Ramm’Tiel, and forever tainting it.  She is executed at the waterfall, and a cup of her blood is poured into the pool as a sign that the Yomen are sorry for one of thier own offending he god Ramm’Tiel.  Ha’root is not killed,but is placed with a secondary family, and told that if she knew of anyone else who bathed in the water, she must speak the truth, or Ramm’Tiel would punish the Rhakk.  A fourth Yomar is placed in position after the unfortunate death of Thrak’Hru<br>
<br>
278-300:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ha’root has been mute for 22 years,  and at the age of 55, she is allowed to return to Ramm’Tiel to meditate.  She still says nothing.<br>
<br>
326:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Now allowed to live on her own, Ha’root bears a child of own, Ca’reem, a girl.  Ha’root continues to live alone, at the age of 81.  Though her life is<br>
nearly half through, she knows  there is much she must teach Ca’reem, and much that she herself must discover.  Though now Ha’root will communicate through a form of hand<br>
and body symbols and written words, she refuses to speak.  None know if this is by her own choice, or that of Ramm’Tiel punishing her for some unknown deed.  Suspision is<br>
beginning to surround her life as those within the city scrutinize her.  <br>
<br>
331:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ha’root is banished from the city, and shunned by the Rhakk.  Though they had no phisical evidence, testimonies from those in the community<br>
have her set doing numerous foul deeds around the Ramm’Tiel, and she meditated with her daughter semmingly too often.  Ha’root and Ca’reem become the first to ever live<br>
outside the community.  Ha’root sets up her new home nearly 23 miles away, by several small springs that lead into a large lake.  She believes, through meditation, that the lake is<br>
actually connected to Ramm’Tiel.<br>
<br>
351:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp On her twentieth birthday, Ca’reem is given a crystal by her mother.  Ha’root claims that the crystal contains powers that even she cannot<br>
comprehend, but there is no more time for study in her own life.  Ill informed of what it is she it to do, Ca’reem is forced to set off on her own, to travel farther away from the lake<br>
that had been her home.  The same year, a scouting party finds the home of Ha’root and executes her.  Ca’reem was considered dead, for Ha’root’s condition upon discovery was<br>
that of a Rhakk near death.<br>
<br>
356:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ca’reem followed the edges of the lakes and streams for five years.  At long last, she stops when she finds that she can move forward no longer.  Confronted by an ocean of great span, Ca’reem builds a temporary house, and begins to have images depicted in great detail while meditating.  That same year, Ca’reem builds a small type of boat, and floats out onto the great ocean, leaving the rocky shore that she had called her home for a short while.<br>
<br>
357:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The Fromaty (Revolution, new beinning) has started as a Yomar Gr’nuu’s last wish was to embody himself as a god, through pillars of stone, and a tomb deep under the earth, under the Ramm’tiel itself.  The entire Rhakk society is forced into labor, with the Yomen watching steadily.  The Rhakk are forced into long hours, hard labor, and have less time to tend crops and other duties of Rhaksha.<br>
<br>
358:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As several Rhakk plead for thier lives and sanity, the Yomen no chioce but to deny them.  Disease begins to spread as crops turn foul and working<br>
conditions worsen.  Later that year, small band of Rhakk plan an escape.<br>
<br>
359:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Fifteen Rhakk execute their escape plan.  The Yomen has no other choice to stop thier workers than force, and only seven make it away, the other six being dead, and two caught.  The same year, Ca’reem finds an island that is different from the others that she had found.  This odd, pillar-like island is given the name Kroon (Tower-home), and though it was a difficult climb to the top, Ca’reem finds herself at peace, and begins to explore the ten-mile wide island, that is suspended over one hundred<br>
meters above the vast ocean by a column of black rock.<br>
<br>
367:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp While Ca’reem was meditating at a lake surrounded by rock in the center of the island, five Rhakk emerge from the water.  At Ca’reem’s will, the rock towers flash brillantly, and the water freezes, holding the five in place.  The frail, malnourished beings tell of their story of the downfall of Rhaksha, and how they narrowly<br>
escaped, and believe that others followed them.  Ca’reem, knowing her life is safe for at least a short while, brings the five Rhakk back to health, and begins to teach them the arts<br>
that she has learned from her stay on the island.<br>
<br>
370:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As more time passes, Kroon becomes populated with the escapees of Rhaksha.  Conditions at the origonal colony still havent improved, even<br>
though the tasks of Gr’nuu had been completed, every Yomar to suceed him has wanted lavish and extrodinary things, and the Yomen itself has become corrupt, the entire city<br>
falling into chaos.<br>
<br>
372:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp At the age of 46, Ca’reem bears a child; a girl nammed Ahr’il.  In Rhaksha, there is tlak of a revolution of the peasants against the Yomen.  The<br>
Yomen calls upon strong, loyal Rhakk to serve as the Yomen’s gaurds.  A small army for the Yomen begins to form.<br>
<br>
380:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The majoriry of the Rhakk in Rhaksha began a revolt against the Yomen and their guardians.<br>
<br>
381:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A year later, the entire Rhakk revolution is crushed.  Hundreds die at the hands of the Yomen, and the army of the Yomen gains new great<br>
strength.  The Rhakk population, crushed and defeated, continues in slaver with the few hundred or so that survived the onslaught.<br>
<br>
384:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp TheYomen army has been granted the name Thr’null (Soldier of trust) by the Yomar himself.  Now having the entirety of Rhaksha under their<br>
control, the Yomen seperate them into proportionate sections, no caring of splitting mothers and children, brothers and sisters.  Everyone was placed within a special group,<br>
then set about doing tasks.  It was better than manual labor, for some of them, and many could return to their former lives, only sending their crops and products to the Yomen<br>
instead of the market.<br>
<br>
387:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Strange vibrations and weather have been affecting Kroon. Every night, while storms rage, there is but calm at the ring of stones in the center of the island.  This is where the population has gathered, to avoid the damage of the storms and weather, as well as to meditate.  They know that something is comming...<br>

<br>
<br>
Here's the story itself...<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Foundation of Amank’Sha<br>
<br>
Chapter 1: Into the Eye of the Storm<br>
<br>
Ca’reem knelt before the lake.  Her daughter, Ahr’il, is now fifteen, but is showing much more maturity than most of her age.<br>
<br>
“Mother, tell me again of your dreams.”<br>
<br>
“Arh’il, you will soon find that your dreams are much more than they appear, if you only look deep insie yourself.”<br>
<br>
“Mother, please.  Tell me of the future.”<br>
<br>
Ca’reem hated to speak of what was to come, for she knew that she had to hide much of what she knew.  Her own death was comming, and she would die by the same hands that killed her mother.  But her own death didn’t bother her.  She knew it was to come, and she would go willingly.  All that mattered was the survival of Ahr’il.<br>
<br>
“Arh’il, I will tell you once again.  This lake, with the tiny stone island in the center, is always there.  As are the five stone pillars that surround us.  A secong great people will come, and by our will, we will makew peace with them.  But there are spies among us, and they know of my dreams as well.  But in these dreams, Ahr’il, you are the hero.  You are the one who will grow up to punish those who killed your mother before me.  You will rise up in arms, and you will bring to them the full will of Ramm’Tiel.  And then, when the island we stand on, this island, Kroon, falls into the sea, you will be the one to bring our people to a new land.  There will be many new adventures.  Glowing white light will move your sould to hundreds of new worlds, and our race will prosper once again.”<br>
<br>
Arh’il sat patiently, watching her mother tell the tale.  She had seen some things like this when she meditated, but all too often she could not remember enough to tell her mother.<br>
<br>
Outside of the mile-wide circle of the five stones and the great lake, storms raged violently.  Hail, lightning, rain, and blinding sea spray welcomed anyone willing to venture out to die in their midst.<br>
<br>
“Mother, what of the rest of the island.  What is happening to Kroon?”<br>
<br>
Ca’reem filled a large, shallow bowl with watter from the lake.  Several drops of oil went in, and the clear water swirled with color, forming a shape of the island itself.<br>
<br>
“Kroon is going through a change.  You se, the island is ten miles wide, and several thousand feet above the water.  But it is suspended by a huge pillar in the center, and that pillar is wearing away.  Mind you, young one, that there is no fear here in the center of the island, the stones protect us.  There is magic here Arh’il, more than that I have ever felt.  More than what I knew when I was near your mother before me.  There are things here that belong to us, to Ramm’Tiel, but there are things that belong to others.<br>
<br>
“Like the columns, mother?”<br>
<br>
“Well, yes, like the columns.  You have grown very wise, Arh’il, and I fear that you will surpass my talent by a great deal when you venture out on your own.”<br>
<br>
“Mother, I want to learn the things you know.  I want to use the water to make shapes, I want to see as far as my mind will go.”<br>
<br>
“This will all come with time, young Rhakk.  What would you do if you could do as I?”<br>
<br>
“I would make the storm go away.  It has kept the sun away for so long.  How long has it been since the crops have grown?”<br>
<br>
“It has been several weeks.  Soon, we will be out of food.  But the water will keep us alive.  And the sun will return very soon.”<br>
<br>
“I could make it go away.  I could make all the storms elave us alone forever.”<br>
<br>
“Indeed, you will.  But you may not like the power you recieve.”<br>
<br>
At this, Ahr’il bowed her head, and thought of the things her mother had said.  She was very wise, and Ahr’il knew that what she said was true, but she felt that there was an emptiness that came with her story.  There was something of grief that her mother felt when she told it tonite, something that she felt would plauge her when her story came true.  But there was no time to dwell on her own idle thoughts, she had to meditate more, so that she would be more like her mother.<br>
<br>
Ca'reem left, leaving Ahr'il to her own thoughts, and Ca'reem hoped that her daughter would learn quickly to dream and summon spirits, to call upon Ramm'Tiel, and to do more than Ca'reem herself would be able to do.  But she knew that it would take many years for anything to become of her daughters dreams.  She knew that there was no Rhakk alive that had powers so great at so young.  Yet then again, Ahr'il had sown more progress than expected.  She loved to meditate every day, and did so more than Ca'reem had the will to do.<br>
<br>
&quot;She has great patience, doesn't she Ca'reem,&quot; said another Rhakk from besider her.  Ca'reem looked back at her daughter, still kneeling by the shore.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes she does.  More patience than I.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;More patience than all of us.  Ca'reem, Ahr'il will lead us all one day, wont she.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ma'nuk, you know that I will not speak of the future.  I am uncertain of t myself.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You lie.  You know exactly what is to become of her dont you?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You speak in tounges like that, and you are liable to find yourself in the storm on your own.  You know why I fled here?  It is because the Yomen banished my mother for seeing the future.  And yet it is because they saw the future themselves that they forced our people to slavery.  It is the future that is tainted.  No one is for sure of what events will start the chain, or what will end it.  But it is for sure that your future will bee one of great dispair if you do not hold your tounge more carefully, Ma'nuk.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I am once again made unworthy of your knowlege, Ca'reem.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Dont inult yourself, Ma'nuk.  Ignorance led to the destruction of our people, and it is ignorance and simple laws that made our people blind.  But it will be our time once again, for we can see on this island.  We can see farther then those of Rhaksha.  We can feel things they cannot, and we are the ones who have escaped slavery.  And though we are few, our powers are greater than that of any Rhaksha.  We are the treu Rhakk, Ma'nuk, do not forget this.  We will be the ones who make it when the storm reaches out its tendrils to lands unknown.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;May the water bless your will Ca'reem,&quot; Ma'nuk said, as he bowed, &quot;And the sea be your guide.&quot;<br>
<br>
Ma'nuk walked away, and Ca'reem went her way as well, but both would end up close together, in makeshift huts and small, animal-like dens in the earth.  But it would not be like that forever, for Ca'reem knew one thing above all else, that few others grasped:<br>
<br>
Water changed things.  Though many years it could take, water was that of one to wait, and to slowly erode the forces that kept it contained, and not even solid rock could stand in its way.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter 2: Forces yet Unseen<br>
<br>
&quot;Wu'kai, how goes the hunting?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We have found nothing so far, great Yomen, but it seems that there are several circles of stone columns.  They radiate extremely high amounts of magic, but none of our troops have been able to get to close to them.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Then you will try harder.  There are always more soldiers willing to die for us.  Make them seem worthy and praise them as heroes, I care not.  But we will find he rebels where they hide, and they are to be exterminated with extreme presidence.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, Yomen, I will do as you command.&quot;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
&quot;She still sits there Ca'reem.  Do you ever wonder what she is thinking?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It is not my place to ask her.  She will tell me what she wishes.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Are you not afraid that she will fall into a comma?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I trust her skills, she has the blood of my mother in her.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;She had no care about the consiquences.  She sacrificed her life willignly&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;As will I, if the time ever comes that I must give my life for Ahr'il.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But we are safe here, there is no need to worry of that.  You dont wish to upset the colonists.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But if I do not, I fear that ignorance will once again shatter our lives, as it did those before us.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;There is no need to worry Ca'reem here we are safe.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I hope you are right Ma'nuk.&quot;<br>
<br>

<br>
Ahr'il had vivid dreams.  Colors swirled into shapes, and shapes into living forms.  She saw the water erode the rocks from the shore, yet she saw other images.  She saw tiny bits of rock with water flowing inside of them, making runes appear on the outside.  She saw Rhakk disapear from sight, and watched as others were killed by strange brown creatures.<br>
<br>
There were other things, as she felt herself near the stages beyond her limits.  But she pressed further, deeper within her own soul.  She knew she was not ready to be as far inside as she was, but she had to move on.  She cast wards to keep the demons away, and pressed further.<br>
<br>
She was suddenly swallowed in blue light.  There was a larger soul there, something that enveloped her completely.  She felt that it was kind, but angered by something.<br>
<br>
It seemed to suffocate her, but she was entranced by it.  It was warm, and made her feel a power surge through her body.  Her mother never said anything of dreams like this.  The blue was taking over her soul.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
A rush of water was heard from the small hut that Ca'reem slept quietly in.  Somehting disturbed her sleep, some kind of power, being drawn from the water around her.  This disturbance was so great that it awoke Ca'reem from a deep sleep.  Something was happening at the lake.  Someone was summoning the great sprit of Ramm'Tiel!<br>
<br>
Ca'reem burst from the hut, and ran toward the lake.  There she saw a sight that both amazed and horrified her at the same time.  Ahr'il was suspended in the air, columns of water being pulled from the lake and enveloping Ahr'il, lifting her from the ground like tentacles of an octopus.  They pulled her until she was hovering twenty feet over the small rocky island in the center of the lake.  The watery columns lifeted outward, until they disconected themselves from the lake, and moved at their own will, yet still connected to Ahr'il.  Four of them dropped back to the water with a deafaning crash of sea spray, leaving five of them whirling in the air.<br>
<br>
Colonists began to wake fromtheir slumber and run out to the lake, unable to do anything to stop what was happening.<br>
<br>
Ca'reem watched in horror as her daughter was overcome by the spirit, too young to control it's power.  She would die soon, if she did not awaken herself...<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
The blue light began to focus itself into tight beams, and bubled up around her body.  The tendrils moved at their own will, and Ahr'il began to have a harder time breathing.<br>
<br>
But she would not abbandon such progress.  Thrusting her arms out, she began to chant invocations to control the light, but none prevailed.  White light hit her, in the form of four tight beams.  A sudden surge of power overcame her, and she could breathe again.  The blue columns thrust outward, and seemed to unlock even more magical power.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
The serpentine columns of water suddenly began to straighten, and then spin around Ahr'il.  The nearly fifty foot rock columns that surrounded the lake began to glow with a feverent white light, brining the entire camp to the look of broad daylight although it was night.<br>
<br>
Outside, the storm began to scream and his with ear-splitting noises, and the winds kicked up dramatically.  A veritable hurricane centered on the island, the gigantic storm released lightning into the skies in all directions...<br>
<br>
But the stones took this power from the sky, and used it to fuel their own.  Ca'reem felt completely surrounded by a thick air of magic, as though she were swimmin in deep mud.  It was hard to breathe in, but she felt herself suddenly at complete peace, and knew what was happening.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Ahr'il had no conrtol over her actions as she uttered spells that she had no knowlege of.  Her surroundings turned completely white, and she soon found herself lying on the floor, in utter virtigo.  A blue ball of light hovered above her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Do not be afraid,&quot; it spoke in a voice that echoed of a chourus, filled with only soprano and bass notes, &quot;I am the one that your people worship.  I was sent with those that first landed here, from powers greater than I.  I am the one who gave your people your powers.  I am the one who determined what you would look like and how you would act as a culture.  But even I cannot see the future as I would like it to be.  Your people ignored my blessing, your mother's bloodline.  They shunned her, and your people collapsed.  That is not my fault.  I cannot control you people completely.  But there are more like I, and you have found the secret that was placed in this land by those who created I.  Thus I am the one who can bring your people no further.  I can only act as your guide, and marvel at the powers you posess.  Your bloodline will be the one to bring together the lands, and your people will find that there is a greater purpose, but even I know not what it is.  I am only the key to the door.&quot;<br>
<br>
With that, the light exploded in a violent rage, sucking Ahr'il back into the blue essince that was her god, and she released the full power of Ramm'Tiel.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Ca'reem was forced back from were she stood, pushed slowly throught the thickness of the pure magic around her.  An explosive beam of light shot from her daughter ut into the sky, and the storm exploded outwards, showing the night stars once again.  Ahr'il dropped to the ground as if she were no more than a mere puppet, and the small island she lay on turned from brown to black, and grew twice in size, so that twenty people could stand on i if they were cramped together.<br>
<br>
With no boats available, Ca'reem was in a panic.  Her daughter had been overcome by the poer of her god, and now she laid dead on a tiny stone island.  Ca'reem ran up to the edge of the lake, and peered out at her daughter.  Slowly, in a frail manner, Ahr'il began to move...<br>
