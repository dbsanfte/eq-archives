You can't be an attention w**** and a recluse at the same time. You can't have it both ways. If you didn't want to be bothered, you should have made your email and IM info private, and certainly not advert your web site or your own easyboard addy as your sig. <br>

First off - you quoted me wrong.  Don't pretend to quote me when you are making up your own version of what I said.  <br>
<br>
Second - before all this came about I was hardly posting here.<br>
<br>
Third - this is my main ezboard account, the one I use on every board I go on.  The information in my profile is for friends/people that want to talk to me, not for people to use me.  My board is in my sig because I want people to come to my board, not so people think to IM me for crits or to go to my board for crits.  Your assertion that I am a recluse is stupid.  Just because I don't visit here regular doesn't make me a recluse.  Just becuase I don't do personal art reviews does not mean I'm a recluse.  Just because I don't want to bother with morons and children does not mean I'm a recluse.  All it means is that I don't post here much, I don't do personal reviews, and I don't like morons or children.<br>
<br>
Your attack on me is stupid.  Calling me an attention whore is retarded.<br>

(haha..i know her best as anyte so i'm gonna stick with that =P) had quite an ingenious tactic/ploy in addressing an issue that she (and apparently many other people) have. i think it was especially effective in that it a.)caught people's attention b.)to those whom 'knew' it did not apply to them, may, like i have, found it quite hilarious. the subject was 'children!', which had no implication to any status quo, be it a generalized objective point of view, or to those who may legally be recognized as holding the status of a 'child/minor.'<br>
the actual post itself was to whom it was she was defining as 'children', which, by the descriptive and thorough nature that was described, i would have to conclude to be that of immaturity and ignorance...both signs that many cultures would classify as 'childlike' behavior or signify one of the many terms that could be used to define a 'child'. it would be in my suspicion, and maybe to the author of said post that any deeming qualities of guilt would effectively lead to a person who would peruse this post and in a moment of pure genious realize that in fact, this post related to that individual as they realized that it was in fact them that took offense to the post itself, thus preventing any further injected violations of such acts.<br>
<br>
but then again...thats just how i read it. =P<br>
<br>
Ukijima: hmmm...i've seen 'most' of anyte's names, and seen her sigs...none of them ever had a link to her IM name that said, 'For A Good Time And Free Critique, Plz IM Me'. (note the dripping sarcasm). the main thing that i would take offense to is the fact that the person im'ing me would be using me as their own personal critiquing persona and with no other intent other to get a critique (possibly in hopes of praises, gifts, riches, fame, and a lifetime of paradise...again..in case you didn't realize..the last part of that was yet again dripping with sarcasm).<br>
my own experience with this would go something along the lines of:<br>
<br>
child: hi<br>
me: hello.<br>
child: how's it going?<br>
me: good. um...do i know you?<br>
child: no but i'm from the PK site. can you critique this cool dbz pic i did for me?<br>
me: *awkward pause* (i'm thinking..hmm..i know nothing of this person, don't know their name, age, sex, location, vital statistics etc...but yet they are asking something from me that they find of value if they are IM'img me. not to mention the fact they want me to put in time and energy that could be put forth elsewhere with a more redeeming result for me)<br>
child: hello? hello? are u there? <br>
me: ummm...ok<br>
child: ok i'm sending...<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.geocities.com/firephoenixgold/ssj.txt"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
me: (...where do i start?) *gives full critique: likes, dislikes, etc.*<br>
child: k thanks bye =O)<br>
<br>
me thinking: (what the hell just happened? i just wasted 25 minutes of my life i'll never be able to regain. =\ )<br>
<br>
i was slightly disturbed by this once instance i can imagine my sanity slipping a notch for each occurance. i can just imagine how anyte must have felt.<br>
also another thing i must inject and negate is your pervasive attitude to slander people by placing labels without further justification of said statement. (ie: in regards to the attention w**** comment) as proved in my theorem as stated above(note: this is a flagrant notation of my uber superiority and 1337 illuminati status. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
i could continue to further objectify your offending nature and mindset, but i believe that anything further than a few paragraphs would cause you to further lost interest...so therefore...i think without further ado..its summed up best in one word:<br>
noob.<br>
<br>
(ps. Whether you want to be a child or a noob, that's totally up to you to choose.

<br>
You see, If I was lurking around this board and got simply awe-struck by your incredible god-like artwork, I can click on your name and get to your EZboard personal profile. Through this I can find all sorts of things like your email address, IM handle, and your personal web address. <br>
<br>
If these IMs and emails about crits are bothering you, just go to your profile and make your IM, personal link, and email private, and disable the private message option. <br>
<br>
See? Simple yet effective. No more worries about noobs or morons or children bothering your busy and important day so that you can go about further honing your incredible god-like art skills.<br>
<br>
Can I assume that all you supreme artists who wish not to be bothered by mere noobs, children, and morons of this board don't have any of your personal contact info showing in the profiles? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Ukijima: again..u're missing the point entirely...i feel its going waaaay over your head but i'll try again... why should any individual have to hide themselves or any personal contact information from people such as yourselves? me, personally, through semi-self promotion (aka through the board and profile), have been contacted for commissions and requests to do character designs for games. other people have contacted me and shared interests as well as grown a friendship in the midst. some ask questions, or compliment me on my work. the world doesn't revolve around the needs of selfish individuals who evidently stalk other people looking for a cheap ego boost through their art.<br>
<br>
and as just a general opinion...i think that ignoring/blocking/saying 'no' politely hardly solves this issue from reoccurance. think about it. simple analogy... if a child does something wrong and you say, 'please stop. i'll give you a cookie if you stop.' that will result in spoiled little rugrats running around, committing the same behavior whenever they want a cookie because they have made the connection actingbad=cookie.  (read:the polite factor doesn't seem to be working with anyte.) now lets say you have a whole big bunch of little people running around urinating like mini racehorses..all acting bad because they learned from one inane child the idea to piss their pants was a good idea. u think those kids would listen to the cookie plea and just stop? and you think by reprimanding one of them will make them all stop by word of mouth? no...i think not. i think gathering all these children in a group (think PK bbs..not the entire BBS mind you..but to address the issue where it seems to be stemming from), make a firm and disapproving announcement (think this post), and watch as it reduces the number of pissed pants/im's focused on the sole intent to gain a critique.<br>
<br>
of course you'll always have the one child who may STILL not understand why its not a good idea to piss in their pants...sooo...you have to sit them down and explain it...spelling it out word for word why such behavior is unneccessary...and in turn hope to curb such behavior.<br>

To the child who doesn't like my way of arguing, oh no, you've hurt my feelings!  This isn't a debate, I don't have to sit and assess my wording and make it special just to make you or anyone else happy, this is me saying I don't like something and as long as you understand what I don't like and why I don't like it, I've used the proper wording.  No, I don't post happy stuff here, ever, don't you ever forget that either.  And what's that about PMS?  If I get angry about something once every three months and post about it, then I'm only getting PMS once every three months and hey, that would be cool by me.  It would be a lot better than getting PMS every other day like some people here.<br>

For some one &quot;tired of repeating myself&quot;, you're sure doing a lot of it.<br>
<br>
Ha ha ha...why does every retort involve people “crying?” Alright, let me put it this way, since apparently it’s gone from “I didn’t over generalize” to “I don’t care if I over generalize, people have said worse”--don’t sit there and tell people they’re “attacking” you, when apparently you warrant any such “attacks” with these offensive generalizations you could care less about.<br>
<br>
And if you don’t have some sort of superiority shtick, stop calling people “children”, “morons”, “cute”, and other lame stuff you’re saying to basically put people in place with as little mental effort as possible.<br>
<br>
You put out your info, and it’s been misused. It’s not like there is no potential for that to happen in any instance where you give out your info to the public...if you believe that, you’re being incredibly naive.  Count your losses, clean up after yourself, and move on. Don’t blame other people for something you didn’t give much attention to. <br>
<br>
Also, don’t sit here and tell people that you don’t care if you’re not using a debate style method to get your point across--it’s completely obvious (“uniformed” as opposed to “uninformed”, “quioted”).<br>
<br>
Alright, screw this, it's back to day care for me...we get to play with the infant sized legos for an extra half an hour today, and there's rumors we might have pop tarts at snack time today.

If you make public your IM handle at a message board, crying foul at unwanted strangers IMing you is pretty damn stupid. <br>
<br>
As for unwanted emails, you know what normal people do when they get them? That's right, they just delete them. Really simple stuff. <br>
<br>
What normal people <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>don't</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> do, is throw a hissy fit at a messgae board for being a message board. Common sense could be helpful here. <br>
<br>
Things are much simpler than people want to make it out to be. Just get over yourselves and think next time before wasting this board's bandwidth on this trivial crap.<br>

<br>
I totally agree with that. Me, I have two accounts, a &quot;public&quot; account and a private one which isn't advertised anywhere. I meet poeple on the public one, and if I like 'em, give them the addy to the private one so they can always contact me. Either that, or I block anyone who takes advantage. I really don't see the point of this 'cos as soon as this drops off the front lounge page all these &quot;children&quot; aren't gonna see it, and they're gonna start sending you these offensive messages again. You want to make this thread a sticky? Just DEAL WITH IT. Treat people as individuals and not as some kinda mass epidemic problem. &quot;sorry, I don't crit people I don't know.&quot; If it's that hard to type, put it in a text file and copy and paste it. As for the &quot;children&quot; comment...yeah, I found that kinda condecending. I know it wasn't aimed at me, or probably anyone who's posted so far here, but still, im my eyes it was unnecessary.<br>
<br>
And Meth; if you wanted to contact her she has a message board, neh? and an email address? Taking an IM name off a personal profile (and perhaps her site) isn't going ot make her unreachable. &quot;Your pre-karbonite status isn't helping at the board either. You're meddling in affairs I don't think you really understand.&quot; And come on Meth, I KNOW you're more mature than that.<br>
<br>
Gah. I was trying to avoid siding on this 'cos there's a lot of people with the opposite view that I respect, but this is just getting stupid. :\ <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://articide.keenspace.com"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/spoonofdoom/banners/longbanner.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Your words cannot hurt me.  Only a child uses words to try and hurt another.  I merely state my feelings.  You should give up since you keep misquoting me and you can't seem to keep straight what I have said.  <br>
