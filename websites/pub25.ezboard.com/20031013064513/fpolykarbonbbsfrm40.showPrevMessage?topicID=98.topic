Legend of Deraki - part 1 main story<br>
(takes place in the present - a few hundred years or so  after the introduction story)<br>
<br>
<br>
   An old man known for his disturbing obession of dark magic and necromancy, he is known to many as Craetus the black mage. Craetus has spent  nearly half of his life conjuring the depths of his powers, gaining vast knowledge and understanding of the dark arts. Unfortunetly, such a burdon has caused him to rapidly excel his aging process, he orginally  was a young 34 year old  man but now his physical appearence has caused him to be a withering , pale, 84 year old geyser. His only hope is to find a way to restore his youth yet his knowledge nor magic cannot reverse the aging process. <br>
<br>
  The good news is that Craetus has finally found a last resort to end his torment and restore himself to his former glory. An old scroll he had found years ago tells of a mystical power that grants any wish a person desires. He was one of the few villagers from long ago that experienced the bright orbs that di The scroll also tells of how this power ultimately destroyed all the demons in the surrounding area, as well as the mighty Demon King himself at the hands of 3 courageous templars. They wielded special items but what form this power has taken remains unknown. <br>
<br>
  Creatus realized that he could use his master of necromancy to the test by ressurecting those who have ever layed eyes upon such power. The mage traveled to the destined location, past the Valley of Windsor and to the ancient old final battlefield , in the depths of the Shadowlands, now a barren wasteland of scorched earth and unusable soil. Creatus used a spell to detect the location of any traces of the Demon King's former sanctuary. Buried beneath layers of Earth, Creatus could feel a slightly disturbing presence. He cast a magical spell that spew forth the unleveled earth, throwing boulders left and right. Several minutes later, remains of the dark sanctuary were visible. Creatus looked over the remaing wreckage, his search seemed in vain, for no remains of former life were visible anywhere. Suddenly, just as Craetus turned away, he felt the same disturbing presence as before, but it seemed to be calling out to him, and it sent a chill down his spine. Without thinking, Creatus moved a boulder and found a skeletal fragment of some creature. He set it down utop a boulder and stood back several feet. After chanting some unorthodox words, the mage used all his necromancy powers to bring flesh and blood back to the creature and ressurect it to its former life. <br>
<br>
  His magic seemed to be failing yet he did not give in, his weakened state was giving up but he was determind to continue the ressurection process. Finally it was finished, the bone fragment leviated and blood merged with flesh covering the skeletal remain, eventually fully restoring the creature. A dust cloud burst in front of the creature and an aura of pure evil could be felt miles away. As Craetus turned back from covering his eyes from the dust and debris, a lone dark figure took form. <br>
<br>
  Creatus slowly gazed upon the very subject he had brought forth, a creature with long demonic ram- like horns, blood red skin, and piercing yellow eyes. The Demon King has indeed returned. The mage jumped with delight and a smile crossed his face, he quickly cast a mind control spell upon the demon, attempting to gain control of his mind, to do his dirty work.<br>
<br>
  The demon king looked at his newly restored body, not fully realizing how long he has been gone from this world, he looked at the puny old man standing before him and asked him, &quot; Did you do this? How long have I been gone? The. the. What has happened to the templars? &quot; Creatus answered all his questions but failed to mention that the demon's freedom was in the hands of the mage. Creatus told the demon that he is his master and obeys only him. The old man said that he was the only known remaining demon left in the world, then Creatus asked the Demon King all he knew about what took place at this very site, and what power had claimed his very life. The Demon King told him that 3 templars wielding unique swords entered his sanctuary and took the lives of all of his kin. He was too confident, not realizing the full extent of the templars true powers, he was defeated for he was at a weakened state for holding the gate to the Astral Plane slowly drained his power. <br>
<br>
  Creatus ordered the demon king to find this source of power yo fulfil his wish for eternal youth and handed him the scroll that he had found long ago. His orders were to travel to the northern kingdom, where Lord Verok was the present king and ruler of the land. The scroll mentions that a secret lies within the northern land, &quot; He who finds that which thee is looking for shall gaze upon the untold beauty of the enchanted sphere.&quot; With this, the Demon King set out to his destined location, while Creatus would travel to the nearby Gaion mountain awaiting his prized collection and to give his slave the next mission.<br>

but i don't think you should make your posts so long<br>
it gets a bit hard to read.. u know?<br>
<br>
one thing you need to think about though is<br>
(if your making it into a comic)<br>
is how you'll lay out everything to<br>
keep the reader interested, because reading<br>
the story was kinda a drag. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=edgemaster009@polykarbonbbs>Edge Master 009</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/14/03 9:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm40.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=110.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> reply</span><hr size=1> Well, the story is long for a reason. It would be dull to just say how the old mage just traveled to the Shadowlands and some how found the exact location and ressurected the demon king. Details in the story show how  exactly  the storyline evolves from the story's introduction and into the  present day which is the main storyline. I'll try to see if i can simplify it so it is not so long, thanks for ur comment,, much appreciated <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
