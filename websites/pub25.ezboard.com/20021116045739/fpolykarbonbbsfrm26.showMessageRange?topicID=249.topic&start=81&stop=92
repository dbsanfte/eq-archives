Looks like she was wrong. Liz stared up at the ceiling, a tired look to her eyes. She half-heartly gazed out the window, searching for any sort of life form that might interfear with their escape. She watched the road roll by in front of her from the backseat. The rain had started to come down heavier now,making the road slick and obstructing her vision. <br>
<br>
So many things had happened that day. Someone had almost drowned, an abnormal storm had hit and a theory that we were not alone was proven. Their was life out their besides that of the tiny little planet she resided on.  With a sigh Liz gazed out the window again. She did not see the rain drenched asphalt as it rolled on past. What she did see though widened her eyes and caused her to gasp silently. <br>
<br>
&quot;Pull over,&quot; she muttered,the breath catching in her throat. <br>
Deuce peered over his shoulder to glance backwards. &quot;What did you say?&quot;he asked.<br>
She swallowed. &quot;Pull over, now.&quot;  <br>
Azoth pulled the car over to the shoulder,placing it in park. Liz pointed a shaking finger to the front of the car,directing their eyes to the space in front of them that was shrouded in mist.  Dimly,a faint light appeared in the sky,slowly getting closer. Soon,more lights followed.  <br>
As the object grew closer the dim car was flooded with light and the object's origin was revealed to the passengers of the car.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ubeige.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Beige</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/16/01 4:06:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=249.topic&index=82>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/67453 WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I am beheld to the unraveling threads...</span><hr size=1> ((Just trying to keep it alive.)))<br>
<br>
The air was tinged with dread. Vick had taken a shot to the shoulder, but the blood wasn't coagulating. Ross put more pressure on it - he had to get back to the station. There they could get more ammunition and perhaps there were some medical supplies there.<br>
<br>

The throbbing, searing heat had subsided, and Deuce felt light-headed. <br>
<br>
Maybe endorphines... maybe blood loss... maybe stress.<br>
<br>
He gripped his wrist and rubbed the skin on top of the tendrils of metal that had coiled around his ulna, snaking up to his shoulder.<br>
<br>
The gem still felt weird in his palm. His fingers constantly brushed against it, picking at it.<br>
<br>
It was a part of him, now. But for how long? The rest of his life?<br>
<br>
How long would that be?<br>
<br>
If the aliens didn't get him, Azoth would. Deuce was caught underneath the slide, and everyone and everything that ever wanted him dead was looking at him through the microscope.<br>
<br>
All he had was his burning desire to stay alive... and the pirated piece of alien technology now laced into his arm.<br>
<br>
Liz and the Doctor were quiet in the back seat. The doc was languidly tinkering with his electronics as Liz stared out the window. Deuce felt compelled to make some sort of conversation as they wound up the road, but it just felt pointless.<br>
<br>
So he watched Azoth.<br>
<br>
He was gripping the steering wheel with his fingers, rolling them with pressure.<br>
<br>
Just a matter of time.<br>
<br>
He wondered what became of Vick and Ross back in the town. They might be dead by now. Vick was a survivor. In the chaos, he might have escaped. That was ok with Deuce. He owed the man his life... despite the histrionics Deuce pulled. <br>
<br>
Liz's voice barked out from behind them, &quot;Pull over!&quot;<br>
<br>
Deuce craned his neck back. &quot;What did you say?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Pull over now!&quot;<br>
<br>
Deuce glanced over to Azoth, who was already complying. Deuce listened hard. His ears were still ringing, but he was pretty sure there wasn't anything out of the ordinary...<br>
<br>
Azoth muttered, &quot;What is that?&quot;<br>
<br>
Deuce shook his head. &quot;What is what?&quot;<br>
<br>
Then he saw it... lights pouring from the clouds ahead. Multiple sources of light.<br>
<br>
Deuce swore softly.<br>
<br>
The doctor whispered, &quot;More ships?&quot;<br>
<br>
Azoth quickly unbuckled and began to worry through the satchel at his feet. &quot;Not ships.&quot;<br>
<br>
Deuce squinted at the clouds as Liz and the doc unbuckled in the back seat. Something metallic poked through the clouds. It was sharp, angular, clumsy.<br>
<br>
Mechs!<br>
<br>
Velario had arrived. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uazoth30k.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Azoth30k</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/17/01 11:31:17 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=249.topic&index=84>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> It seems great minds do think alike...</span><hr size=1> Mechs. <br>
<br>
Lots of them. <br>
<br>
Hopefully this time they weren't piloted by clones. Lord knew that those creepy red eyed, blue haired girls that Valerio had used last time were unsettling enough...<br>
<br>
In his first glance Azoth had counted at least twenty of them. and there were more following. They wanted either him or the girl. Any which way this was not good. It looked like Deuce was slowly clueing in. Azoth didn't really care about that, he was too busy looking for something that would work against these things. His Mech rifle was gone but he still had the anti cyborg pistol. That and several grenades might buy them some time. <br>
<br>
How had Valerio known? he had covered his tracks well enough. It should have been like Azoth had dropped off the planet. Reaching into the back seat he grabbed the girl by the coat she was wearing, his coat. She started to protest but stopped as soon as he pulled an ovoid device from one of the inner pockets of the coat. <br>
<br>
&quot;Everybody out.&quot; Azoth said to the now unbuckled passengers of the car. Turning to the back seat and speaking to the man and the girl he said, &quot;Make sure that you head for the trees. These things are at least fifty feet tall and twenty to twenty-five feet wide. Try and find cover that they won't be able to fit in and deep enough that their arms won't reach you.&quot;<br>
<br>
With that Azoth opened the door and stepped out into the rain.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uazoth30k.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Azoth30k</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif" BORDER=0> at: 9/18/01 12:42:16 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/usempaisloan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SempaiSloan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/17/01 12:12:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=249.topic&index=85>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Character check...</span><hr size=1> (( Ok, continuity alarm's going off...  exactly where is everyone?

I mean, mechas.</span><hr size=1> Heated blasts of exhaust poured down through the trees as Deuce clawed through the undergrowth. The mechs were skating just above the line of pines around them. Deuce heard Azoth's footsteps pound harder behind him, and soon, Azoth had lapped him.<br>
<br>
Deuce was grinning.<br>
<br>
&quot;This wasn't in the playbook, was it?&quot;<br>
<br>
Azoth appeared to ignore him.<br>
<br>
Soon, Azoth hit his knees and began to pump grenades into some kind of shoulder weapon.<br>
<br>
From behind the mask, he muttered, &quot;Out of time.&quot;<br>
<br>
Deuce squinted up at the leaden sky. The sun was setting. It was about to get very cold out there. Cold with the blasts of VTOL engines keeping the hulking chunks of steel and ammunition afloat.<br>
<br>
&quot;So, what did you do? I gotta know.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It's not as important as what I'm about to do.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Fight?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Are you going to gloat until we're both dead, or are you going to do something?&quot;<br>
<br>
Light-headed from endorphines, blood loss, and fatigue, Deuce cackled as Azoth fired a round into the air. The grenade exploded in a brilliant display, kicking one of the mechs off-center for a second. <br>
<br>
It, and several nearby, turned and trained on their position.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, hell.&quot;<br>
<br>
Deuce felt the energy rising up his spine out of the ground. He directed it towards his palm. It was... natural... now.<br>
<br>
Heat built up in his hand as he lifted it to the sky.<br>
<br>
As the noise inside his head crescendoed into a painful cacophony, Deuce heard Azoth shout, &quot;Hope you know what you're doing!&quot;<br>
<br>
And with a sweet release, a bolt of energy lanced out of Deuce's hand, lighting up the trees nearby.<br>
<br>
A branch of pine above them sizzled and fell slowly to the ground, as the needles burned back like incense sticks.<br>
<br>
A clap of thunder sounded overhead. <br>
<br>
One of the mechs was separating from its shoulder assembly in a flurry of sparks, spraying the ground with molten steel and rubber.<br>
<br>
Before Deuce could gather his thoughts for an appropriate comment, he could feel the energy rising through his feet again. This thing was on auto-pilot, and he knew he wasn't going to stop until he had downed every last mech that was scouring the forest for them.<br>
<br>
At least, unless they found him first.<br>
<br>
As he poured another blast up into the darkening sky, Deuce felt a voice in the back of his head... almost a whisper. A voice he recognized.<br>
<br>
Liz.<br>

I mean, mechas.</span><hr size=1> Everything seemed so unreal. The setting sun only helped create the atmosphere by casting eerie shadows on the land. The now diming sky was illuminated by light produced by the approaching mechas who currently were developing into a certain threat. <br>
At the current moment Liz and win sat leaning against the side of the car, Win's eyes darting around searching for any object that might be headed in their direction as Liz, brow furrowed, concentraded on contacting Deuce. The connection wasn't strong, but there none the less, she only hoped he could here her message.<br>
<br>
The message was rather simple, the mechas were attacking. Their only goal though was not to just kill. They're plan originaly to capture herself and Azoth, but when the blast of energy ripped from Deuce's hand, they began to rethink. A human able to use an alien weapon such as that was unheard of,so why not capture the human as a specimin so as to see why such an idividual could use a weapon as such when others could not. So the three of them were to be captured, hopefully without damage. End of story.<br>
<br>
The only thing diffrent though was whoever controled the mechas didn't expect their enimies to know the battle plan. <br>
<br>
&quot;from the left..&quot; her mind's voice whispered,&quot;their coming from the left. Hit them in the center. The weakest point is there,&quot;<br>
Liz began breathing quickly. This effort was straining her mind and begining to cut off her oxygen. If she wasn't careful she might faint, and become only a burden. <br>
<br>
&quot;Be quick, and careful. They mean to capture you both and will go to any means to do so,&quot; with every word her mind's voice became dimmer as she lost energy,&quot;Hit the largest one. The one with the big cannon. Get rid of that one and they should all fall,&quot; Liz breathed heavily. That was all the information they needed. She closed her eyes,hoping to get a moment of rest shen she felt Win's hand urgently shaking her arm.<br>
&quot;We have to hide. I think they discovered our position,&quot; Win motioned with his other hand to a few mechas who had strayed out of the herd. They were flying low to the ground, darting between trees and any sort of obstruction as if looking for something. <br>
&quot;Come on!&quot; the two of them jumped up into a run. One of the mechas spotted them and barreled down in their direction. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uazoth30k.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Azoth30k</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/27/01 11:46:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=249.topic&index=89>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.home.com/assassinsguild/azhead.jpg Height=86 Width=70></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Attack of the clo... I mean, mechas.</span><hr size=1> It was like an experiment in complete chaos. The setting had turned from a rather normal forest to a surreal landscape with the orange and red flickering light from fires burning all around. This was too much. Valerio wanted him far too badly. Azoth couldn't deal with this sort of thing right now. It was time to go. <br>
<br>
There was one of Valerio's mechs moving through the trees. It was looking at the ground, not at the branches. Stupid. It's partner was also a good two hundred feet away. Really stupid. When the mech was alongside the tree Azoth jumped. He landed like a cat. Quietly and on his feet. The pilot didn't even notice.<br>
<br>
Smiling to himself Azoth moved down the back of the machine using his hands. He was looking for the emergency hatch opening and, after thirty long seconds of praying that the mech's partner wouldn't notice him, he found it. From that point on it was a simple matter to open the hatch, shoot the clone piloting it (they were redheads now) and take control of the mech. Now came the hard part.<br>
<br>
To effectively get away Azoth was going to fake a radio and system failure that would allow him to return to base. Of course he wouldn't return to base but rather run like a bat out of hell after shutting down the location transmitter in the mech. He would then have to get in contact with Graydon. <br>
<br>
Pulling off the panel to one of the control units he exposed the locator. A quick pull and he no longer had a homing signal. Putting the panel back in place he pushed the body of the clone down onto the floor of the cockpit. Wiping some blood off of another panel he found the radio. A quick jab and that was offline. Almost immediately a message came up on the main screen telling him to return to base. A short thruster jump and he was clear of the trees and flying.<br>
<br>
As Azoth flew over the battleground he could see the havoc being caused. Several mechs were closing in on Deuce. The alien energy flashed into the sky every now and then as another mech dropped. Crossing the road Azoth saw the man and the girl running, too bad that they were being cut off by a squad of six mechs. But then he didn't have to worry about that now. He was clear and that was what mattered. Azoth gained altitude.<br>
<br>
It took him two minutes. Two minutes to realize that he couldn't run and that somewhere along the line he had developed a conscience. It took him one minute on the way back to realize when he had developed it and the last minute to develop a plan.<br>
<br>
Smiling a much nastier smile Azoth thought of Valerio. He was a dead man. <p><br>Cannot forget.
