It was cold, well the air wasn’t, but the concrete floor of the parking garage on which I was laying when I woke was in the extreme. You have to ask yourself several important questions when you find you are lying on your face in a pool of your own sweat in a rundown cheap parking complex. Chief among these questions would be of course, where the hell am I, which leads to the second question, how did I get here and inevitably leads to the third and final question, why am I lying face first on a cold concrete slab of a floor? As I pondered these important questions my head began to swim, it appeared that I had a forth question, why did my head hurt so much? It occurred to me that perhaps I should stand up and assess the situation. At first my right leg had decided to be a bit stubborn but after a bit of coaxing and a promise of a hot bath and a soft mattress it decided it would cooperate. As soon as I reached full extension, my leg decided that now was the appropriate time to inform me that there was a bullet that had somehow found its was into the area just below my knee. Upon receiving this trivial bit of information my mind decided that it agreed with my leg and then informed it to collapse on the spot. So here I was once again lying on the concrete, my leg and head throbbing and my mind attempting to cope with the current situation. Suddenly I became aware of everything around me. It appeared that while seedy, rundown and extremely cold the garage was not empty, it contained a Volkswagen Beetle, a Honda Accord, a Toyota pickup and a bullet ridden beat up jalopy that slightly resembled a Honda Civic. I stuck my hand in the pocket of my soiled bloodied suit pants and produce a set of keys, a business card, a Zippo lighter, and a crushed pack of Marblo cigarettes. I decided that if at any time in my life I was going to destroy my body by slowly killing it with tar, now would be the time.  I lit the cigarette and inhaled. Once again I looked around, and took into account my surroundings and informed my leg that I wasn’t putting up with its mutiny any longer and it was time to get down to the business it was created for. So slowly I stood up. I gritted my teeth, took a deep breath and propped my self up on the nearest car, which was the Toyota pickup. I took another drag of the cigarette, and decided that perhaps it was time to find out which car if any the set of keys in my pocket belonged to. Common sense dictated that they belonged to the truck I was leaning on, so I slowly moved to the door, inserted the keys and was rewarded for my hard work with absolutely nothing. It appeared that common sense did not apply to this situation. I looked around to the next closest car, it was the beetle. I shuffled over and inserted the key, once again nothing happed, it was at this point I started to become a little uneasy, the thought had slipped into my mind that only 2 cars remained. So slowly I made my way over to the Accord, and after unsuccessfully attempting several times to force the key to work, I released a string of curses that would have dropped a catholic priest from 300 yards. So now obviously the only car remaining was the civic look alike. I hobbled over and inserted the key. Bullet holes riddled the door, there was a broken back window, and a missing side view mirror. Holding my breath I turned the key hoping that they belonged to none of the cars in the lot. It appeared I was @#%$ out of luck. I opened the door. Inside the drivers seat was covered in blood, there was a destroyed Styrofoam coffee cup, and a silver colt .45 in between the seats. I sat down, cursing my luck. I took another drag of my cigarette and started the engine. It choked at first but finally, obviously against its will rumbled to a start. I pulled out of the spot and decided I’d stop by the hospital. If worse came too worse at least I could steal some painkillers. I took another drag, flicked the butt out the window and putted off.  <br>

Let me know what you think, and if I should post the rest of the novel, so far its about 11 chapters. Hey and if someone wants to draw a pic of this guy, I'd be very greatful. PEACE<br>

<br>
CHAPTER 1: THE MAN IN THE BROWN SUIT<br>
<br>
I parked the bullet ridden Civic look alike a block away and hobbled to the emergency room entrance. Inside there was a bustle of activity that would have rivaled any airport. I stepped inside. God I hated the smell of hospitals, so clean and sanitary, it made me sick. I thought about just leaving when my leg decided it would remind me of the bullet. So off I went, slowly making my way through a sea of sick and injured people, some of whom had every right to give in and collapse in death. The receptionist looked up at me from her computer screen. She wasn’t that old but, well she wasn’t that womanly either. “Do you need emergency services sir?” She practically barked it. “Well I haven’t got all day, as you can see there are plenty of other patients who need our help as well so spit it out.” <br>
“Uh, well I’ve been shot, in the leg, and it hurts quite a bit, and I was wondering if…” she didn’t let me finish.<br>
“A shooting huh, in the leg you say, doesn’t sound all that urgent. Here fill this form out and wait over there to the left of the room.” She motioned over to the never-ending sea of men, women and children to the left side of the huge room. My face visibly paled. It would take hours, and even though I didn’t know why exactly, I had a feeling I didn’t have hours. I grabbed a space against the wall farthest from the reception desk and closest to the doors leading into the hospital itself. Next to me a homeless man with a nasty looking cut on his head amused himself by talking to a plant. God I hated hospitals. Across the room my eyes locked onto a little kid sitting in her mother’s lap, she had a bottle and she looked content. But her mother looked worried, most likely her husband was inside the emergency room. Suddenly a tall man in a brown suite brushed by her almost knocking the kid out of its mother’s lap. He moved quickly up to the desk, talked with the receptionist for a few seconds, and then she pointed directly at me. Reality hit me like a ton of bricks falling from the Empire State Building, I quickly looked around. The closest exist was into the hospital itself. I looked back over at the man in the suite, he was moving closer. I darted for the door. I didn’t know why it hadn’t occurred to me before, I guess it was because my brain was hazy It made sense that who ever filled my car with bullet holes, and put a bullet in my leg probably wanted to put a bullet in a slightly more debilitating place. I looked around. There was a long white hallway, a water cooler and 2 doors, one said supplies and the other was to far down the hall to read. I needed some relief for my leg, but I also decided that for right now I would need some relief from that man in the suit. The supply door was to close, he would check there first, it seemed my only option was to make my way down the hall. It turned out that the second door was a set of service steps. I pushed the door open and started to stretch my leg. Before my foot hit the ground a shot rang out and the water cooler exploded. I dove into the stair well. Who ever this man was, he sure was anxious to finish the job. I hurled my self down the stairs. My bad leg took this opportunity to have some fun. It decided it would trip me up on one of the turns and send me flying down the stairs head over heals. I heard the door slam, it was followed very quickly by a few more air cracking shots. As I tumbled down the steps paint from the walls, and sparks from the metal stairs flew through the air. God I hated hospitals. I hit the bottom wall, and immediately sprang into a standing position, gritted my teeth as my leg shot a large amount pain up my side and back and then threw myself through the door. Apparently the stairs had led to a sub basement that housed ambulances and repair vans. I decided to take cover behind the closest van. When I was finally stationary behind the rear wheal of the van I had to bite my lip to prevent my mouth from screaming in agony, it seemed that my leg decided it was time to begin worrying about it now. I had to make the difficult realization that I would not be able to run from the man in the brown suit again, so I looked around for a weapon of some kind. As luck would have it, now was the time it decided to repay me for sticking me with the civic, about 5 feet away in the back of a truck lay a large wrench. So large in fact it could only have been used for two things, tightening ludicrously large bolts, or bashing overgrown thugs in brown suits in the head. I tightened my fist around the wrench handle as I heard the door close. I heard the steps of over priced dress shoes coming toward me. Peeking around the corner of the van I saw the man in the suit looking under cars and vans, waving his black hand canon around every time he came up with nothing. I ducked behind the corner when his head started to turn toward me. Well leg, I said to my extremity, don’t fail me now or so help you god I’ll hack you off my self. The man in the suit was about 4 feet away. I turned the corner at a speed I didn’t think was possible raising the wrench above my head as I flew across the floor. For once in my life I had to thank my leg for not following my orders, it collapsed just in time for me to dodge the bullet coming from the muzzle of the gun pointed directly at my face. With all my weight flying forward at a speed that couldn’t have been tracked by radar, I fell to the ground and by another stroke of unbelievable luck the wrench landed heavy end up, right on top of the mans knee. He yelped in pain and dropped to the ground. As if suddenly becoming enlightened he looked up at me as he raised his gun. I took these precious seconds to raise my wrench. Like a bad, low budget action film he leveled his gun, and I allowed gravity to do what it does best. The gun fired, concrete flew into the air, there was a sickening crunching noise, and the wrench bounced off the ground. The man in the brown suit lay crumpled and unconscious in a heap on the ground, his gun still in his hands. I stood up, brushed off my suit, and decided that perhaps it was time to find some painkillers and get the heck out of Dodge. <br>

<br>
I popped some painkillers, and dug into my pocket and took out the cigarettes and the business card. I inhaled the smoke and stared at the white piece of cheap paper I had in my hand. It read<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp JACKSON SOCRATES PRIVATE EYE<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp        132 POLLOCK DRIVE  <br>
         575-2323 FAX: 575-5749<br>
         JACKSOC@BINET.COM<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “WE NEVER SLEEP, ON WEEKDAYS”<br>
<br>
I had a slight recollection of the name Jackson, but could not place it. My brain still hadn’t recuperated from what ever had happened before the garage. Well I told my leg, now that your numb, perhaps we can go see this Jackson fellow, perhaps he could enlighten us. I started the engine and pulled away just as the flashing lights of the N.Y.P.D filled my review. I chuckled to my self, the man in the brown suit was gonna be waking up in jail. I cruised down the street and the painkillers turned the headlights of passing cars into long trails of never ending light. I hated hospitals, but the goodies they had inside weren’t bad. I watched a minivan pull to the side of me and stop at the light. A kid with a baseball hat on backwards looked out the window at me and made a face. Now either the kid naturally looked like a gargoyle, or maybe I had taken a few more painkillers than your average practitioner would have recommended. It pulled of and I sat there for a few seconds composing myself after seeing what might or might not have been the son of Satan. I whipped around the corner and pulled up in front of a converted warehouse building. I light another cigarette and pulled out the business card. This was the address, but it didn’t seem as if the guy was home, or that he seemed to be doing much business. I walked up to the door, all the lights inside were off, and the sign on the door was practically worn off, either with age or the fact that it was put on with cheap paint. I knocked, no answer, I knocked again, still no answer. I turned to leave, but then decided I’d try the keys. I popped one in. Nothing happened, so I moved onto the next one. Bingo. The door swung open and the smell of old cigarettes and cheap alcohol filled my nostrils. I liked this guy already. I stumbled around in the dark for a while rubbing my hand up and down on the wall searching for a light switch. I finally found one after stubbing my toe about six or seven times. The overhead light flickered on and showered the room in a faint yellow light. Now picture this, the office was strait out of a Dick Tracey dime novel, files and ash trays covered the floor, filing cabinets overflowing with papers, and an empty bottle of Jim Beam lay on the heavy oak desk. I flicked on the desk lamp, and suddenly the overhead light exploded in a cascade of sparks, apparently this guy hadn’t invested in high end light fixtures. On the desk lay a file with a picture of a knock out blonde. Her name was Angelica Keys. Apparently this P.I. had been tailing her or something. Next to the folder lay a key ring with 2 small keys on them, I guessed they belonged to the safe in the corner. I picked them up and limped over to the safe, I inserted one and then the other. After turning them I was rewarded with a solid sound of a heavy locking mechanism sliding out of place. Inside lay a pile of cash, another bottle of whiskey and a few clips but no gun. I stood up and walked back over to the desk and sat down. This guy was a slob, but he had style. I took another drag of my cigarette and leafed through the file of the lady with the great smile. She was 27, and enjoyed dancing and the night club scene. Her father was a wealthy real-estate tycoon, who decided it was time he found out what his lovely young daughter was up to. I poured myself a large glass of Jim Beam ignoring all the advice I had heard in school about not mixing sedatives and alcohol. I sat back sighing stretching my leg out. The hospital goodies had completely numbed it not to mention the rest of my body, and for the first time in a few hours I felt almost good. I stared at the picture of the lady and watched it slowly dance around on the manila folder. I drank the last of the whiskey and stood up. Just before I collapsed I saw a picture on the filing cabinet behind the desk. The face looked very familiar, very familiar. Oh well I though, then the world turned black. <br>

<br>
CHAPTER 3: BEAUTY AND THE BEAST<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp When the world came back into focus the sun had come up and I was staring strait down the wrong end of a large revolver. “Get up Jackson, its 10:30” the voice had come from the knock out blonde from the file. If it weren’t for the gun I would have had to say that she looked better in person. “@#%$ it Jackson get up!” I sat up as she put the gun away. “What the hell happened, you were supposed to be at the club last night.” <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “What? I’m not jackso…” The dejavu from the night before and the picture came back. I was Jackson Socrates the slobish private eye with the dime novel office. No wonder I like his style so much. “What happened?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “How should I know, you were the one who didn’t show up, and what happened to your leg?” the pain suddenly shot back like a bad memory. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Well, it appears I’ve been shot, now if you don’t mind could you reach into my coat pocket and get me that bottle of pain killer, it hurts quite a bit.” She walked over to the coat and threw me the bottle. I popped a few less than the night before remembering the kid with the hat, and pulled myself into a standing position. Letting out a long sigh I ran my hand through my hair, I need a shower not to mention a change of clothes. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Lets go Jackson its not safe here,” she looked very adamant about the fact that this was an unsafe place. With the gun away and the painkillers starting to take affect I was almost speechless staring at her. I saved face by managing to stammer ok, let me just see if I have any other clothes around here. I hobbled over to the closet and found a black suit and a red tie. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Hold on a sec,” I said walking into the bathroom. I changed into the new suit and ran some water over my face, and then looked into the mirror. Once again I had to question my state of mind as I found a man in his early 30’s staring me back in the face. I was strait out of a dime novel myself, black hair, weathered face and a five o’clock shadow that looked like someone had inked it on. I opened the bathroom door and was greeted by the lovely angelica sitting on my desk. She had nice legs, very nice legs. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Ok, finally done. You look better now, not so dead looking, did you find anything else out about my fathers plans?” she asked. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “No” I said. Kneeling in front of the safe I took out the cash and the clips figuring they belonged to the gun in the car out side. Never know, I might need em if the guy in the brown suit ever got out of the slammer. We walked out the door to the car and got in. “Well, the truth is Angelica.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Please I already told you call me Angel” she said with a smile that would give a old man a heat attack. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “OK Angel, the truth is that I don’t remember much before last night, it’s kind of a blur.” No sooner had I finished my sentence than a large black Cadillac pulled up across the street. The door opened and the figure of a large man in a brown suit accented to full height. “Oh @#%$.” I push Angel out of the car and dove after her just as what was left of my car was ripped to shreds in a hail of gunfire. Glass flew through the air and the sound of metal folding under extreme pressure filled my ears. Suddenly Angel stood up and fired 3 shoots from her large revolver. The Cadillac’s passenger window exploded and the other two shots implanted them selves into the door. She grabbed my arm and pulled me back into the office just as I saw my cheap sign shatter. We crawled on our knees to behind the desk.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Ok Jackson now would be the time to use that piece you got there” and with that she stood up and fired through the window at the advancing thug. I noticed before he ducked behind the ruble that was my car that he had a bandage on his head, I got a little satisfaction out of that. For about a minute the area around my office was like the scene of a gang war, bullets flying all over the place, wood chips flying glass shattering, paper being thrown all over the place. “Quick out the back” yelled Angel over the crack of multiple shot. I got up and fired a few shots and then we ran top speed out the back door and into the alley. “Hurry, I parked my car over there.” We sprinted to her bright red Mazda Miata, it seemed to fit her well. It had a black leather interior and smelled of fruity perfume. As soon as I shut the door we were off flying down the street as fast as the car could. We ripped around the corner at about 75 miles per hour and I saw that brown suit thug spin around and raise his gun. But we were already down the street and around another corner. “That was close, I told you it wasn’t safe in there.” It appeared she was right, and she did look better in person.<br>

<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It was about lunchtime when we reached the diner/ pastry shop on Belmont Ave. Inside it smelled like a mix of coffee, doughnuts and eggs. There were about 13 people in the building including a waitress and the chef. Angel and I decided on a booth near the back and ordered some of the coffee that was wafting through the air. I light a cigarette and looked over the beauty sitting across from me. She was just like in her file picture only more stunning, long blond hair, slim face and body and nice legs. “So what happened Jackson?” she asked.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “No idea. All I know is I woke up in a run down parking garage with a bullet in my leg and a bad hangover.” She didn’t look surprised. “I have faint memories of what happened but nothing really concrete or conclusive. Say what did you ask me earlier about your fathers plans?” <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I asked if you had any new leads, you were supposed to meet me at Club Beau at 12:30 but you never showed. You said you had some news you wanted to share. Something about the buildings on 12th street my father had just acquired.” I took a sip of coffee and mulled it over in my head. According to the file her father owned just about 14% of the entire city of New York, that included all the suburbs. The coffee was warm but that was its only attribute. “So you really don’t remember anything before you woke up in that garage?” she asked.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “No not a thing, until you showed up this morning and put that gun to my face I still hadn’t known my own name. Well I had an idea but, well it wasn’t a solid lead if you know what I’m saying.” I took a large sip of the brown stuff in the cup supposably called coffee and then another drag from my cigarette. “I remember you father though, tall fat guy with an expensive suit, and walks with a cane, right?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Yeah that’s him, he always said he liked to dress like a tycoon, said it made him feel powerful. I think he just looked old.” She lifted her cup and took a sip. My eyes moved over the room slowly, contemplating the information I had been given. There was an old couple sitting about 3 booths from us, the lady had hair that had a tint of blue. And the old guy was smoking a pipe. The only thing worse than hospitals was the thought of growing old. “That’s crazy, it’s like right out of a novel or something.” Angel was talking about my amnesia again, but I had slipped into another world with thoughts flying all over the place, wild speculations and theories of what had happened a night ago. Suddenly I snapped back into reality as the second ton of high velocity bricks in the past day slammed into my head. There was a cop, big fat, brown hair, and a scared pocked face standing in the door. I had a vision of him standing next to a man in a gray overcoat laughing. He looked over at me and paled. “What is it Jackson” asked Angel, she turned and saw the large cop heading toward us. “Oh no, its Max, one of my dads friends.” Another vision exploded before my eyes of Max’s monstrous hand falling down on me. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “We’ll hello there friend” Max bellowed as he sat down next to Angel sneering at me, “I’m glad to see your upright and moving.” I fingered my .45 under my coat, but decided I was only going to use it if absolutely necessary. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Nice to see you as well Max” I said almost spitting when I said the name. “I’m sure you slept well last night.” That fat bastard almost laughed. “Of course, but not as well as you I’d say.” I ran through my mind the thought of pulling the piece and putting a hole in his forehead, but after looking around and seeing all the witnesses I decided against it. “How’s the leg?” Max said, once again sneering. An image of a man in a brown suit appeared before me holding his hand canon. I saw a flash of light, and heard an explosion, in the background stood a man in a gray overcoat and a fat police officer.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A cold sweat had formed on my brow, “Is there a problem, friend?” asked Max in an evil tone. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “No, no, none at all. Lets go Angel.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “No stay enjoy your breakfast Jackson,” said Max, “I suggest the eggs, they aren’t fresh, may not even be eggs but there better than the coffee.” And with that Max the fat ugly cop got up and left. I hated cops too, but the coffee was worse.<br>

<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We flew down the freeway in the bright red Mazda at speeds of almost 80 mph. The sun had hidden itself behind a thick covering of clouds and it was beginning to rain. Aside from the knowledge that Max the overweight cop and the thug in the brown suit were working together, I had nothing. Supposedly Angels father had some plan for some property he had just bought, and my guess was that the plans were big. Big enough for him to send three goons to make sure I didn’t ever tell anyone what those plans were. So far I’d have to say he was doing a pretty good job. I mauled over the images I had seen in my brain for what seemed like ages. The man in the brown suit firing his gun, Max beating me to a pulp and that man in the gray over coat who’s face I couldn’t see who was laughing the whole time. It was like being trapped in a prison with no walls but still no sunlight or a way out. I lit another cigarette. The painkillers had started to ware off and I was becoming a little irritated. “So where are we going then Angel dear?” I asked snidely. &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Calm down Jackson and take some painkillers, we’re going to see my father’s empire up close, perhaps that will jog your memory.” And so on we drove into an ever-increasing rain, it was strangely fitting somehow. By the time I had started on my second cigarette we had made it to 12th Street. Standing before us stood 6 large sky scrappers with scaffolding sticking out the sides. “So this is it, in all its glory, a 10,000,000,000 dollar square block. If I didn’t resent him so much I might even be impressed.” She said it with what might have been mistaken for respect. I puffed on the cigarette enjoying the numbness of the painkillers, it really was an impressive sight. “So this doesn’t jog your memory at all? Not even a little?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Afraid not Angel, maybe we should take a look around.” We walked across the street and into the lobby of one of the buildings. It had a huge stone almost gothic look to it. Stone statues of angels and gargoyles covered the walls. “You’re dad have a thing for religion?” I asked, partly because the figures freaked me out and partly because I figured anything right now was better than nothing.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “No, he just likes the way it makes the lobby look, at least that’s the way I figure it.” We looked around slowly, examining everything. After searching the whole ground floor of this newly acquired building we decided that maybe we should see what was up farther. We stopped the service elevator at the 12 floor. This floor still had white painters sheets covering the floor and walls, buckets of white and brown paint lying about and surprisingly no workers. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Looks as if they’re on break” I said, looking around “nobody’s around” I was right not a single soul inhabited this floor, not a painter, not even a Foreman. I brushed it off as the painkillers making me paranoid. Well this floor sure isn’t bringing back any memories, good or bad. I stepped to a big floor to ceiling window and looked down, people were going in and out of all the buildings, except this one. In fact the only activity I saw coming from this building was a group of 7 men leaving, in a hurry. A thought began to cross my mind but before I could finish, a long silver and black Rolls Royce pulled up and from the back door stepped a man in a gray overcoat.<br>
