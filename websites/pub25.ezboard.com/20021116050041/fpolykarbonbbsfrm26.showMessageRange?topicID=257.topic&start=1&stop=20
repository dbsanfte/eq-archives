<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In the 30th century, man has moved off earth and out of its home solar system to a new one, one that is not dead.  The new solar system that man inhabits is called Bria after the 27th century scientist Martha Bria that found the new system that was capable of human habitation.  In this new system there is 2 planets capable of supporting human life:  Agis, and Felkos.  On Agis the human race did all the things right that they did wrong on earth.  Pollution is not a problem because of the discovery of the Kiskov engine.  This new engine transmutes carbon dioxide into energy (actually it forces the oxygen and carbon atoms into each other separating them in and giving off much energy).  The downside to this is that matter is used up and that it gives off much heat.  Agis is a bustling metropolis filled with many gigantic cities.  Overpopulation is not a problem because all families are only allowed to have 2 children, although some very rich families have found ways around this.  As you might have guessed there is allot of treachery and the whole government is full of evil and determined to only have a perfect race and world.  The planet of Felkos was humanities first try at new population of a planet.  When humanity first started to poor onto the planet new cities were being made and once they were all up and ready for habitation they turned on the new Kiskov engines.  However there was a bad chemical reaction and gigantic holes were formed in the planet turning into a deformed mass, also throwing its gravity into an unpredictable twirl around the sun in a sort of oval shape.  Felkos has many deserted cities on it, and in the explosions, the atmosphere was also blown to pieces so the planet is not livable on without support.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp On Agis there is a group of rich evil Business men with a dark passion for a sort of twisted war game much like the Gladiators of Rome.  The game consists of gigantic humanoid machines called Cidals that are very ornate and include various weapons that are used on other Cidals.  These machines run on Kiskov engines so they are very powerful and produce immense heat making them impossible to be used on a populated planet.  This game often referred to as Gladiator Fights, or CB Games takes place on the deserted planet of Felkos where the unpredictable gravity makes for a fun match.  These battles get very serious and have much evil plots involved.  So evil are these that sometimes a Cidal will be equipped with a self-destruct mechanism just so the opponent is not left alive.  As you also may have guessed there is much money involved in these CB Games and betting is a key part in the fights, so much that more money is made in betting than in Prize money, and Cidals are very expensive to maintain.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The evil syndicates and businesses of Agis are not the only things to worry about.  Just before global warming overtook the entire planet a computer was left running with a special program on it.  This program was one that gave the computer a willing to survive, reproduce and prosper.  Over the centuries that humans have been gone from the now uninhabitable Earth the computers have developed intelligence and machines to take over other planets and have already taken over the entire system that Earth was in.  The humans from Agis have found out about these intelligent machines at the same time that the machines found out about the humans.  The thing that was actually sent out to earth was a group of Cidals that were to have a fight on the Earth; it was to be the CB game of the century!  Therefore, the first thing the computers saw was these Cidals and the best thing to fight one of these mammoth humanoid machines would be more Cidals, so the machines created there own Cidals and they swarmed the human vehicles and destroyed every one.  The whole of Agis was sent into deep shock.  They now had an enemy they were not even sure that they could compete with; there only hope was to make something to battle these insane Cidal toting machines.<br>

Characters could differ from Cidals pilots to leader of the rich evil empire to civilians involved involountaraly... You see what I mean. There's a lot to be done with this... but you should be careful not to just go berserk about it... You should build a center plot with some other mini-plots revolving around it but don't go too far... Start with something simple and commun... A guy, a girl, an evil scheme... blablabla blablabla... understood? Anyway, it would be real nice working on something that well imagined and planned... We should talk about it further more... <br>

They achieve wonderful things with less animations, backgrounds and cuts... but everything looks so dynamic and transcends so much emotion that you can't look at these and stay insensible about it... Emotions, actions and humanity... those are the three GREAT! characteristic of the japanimations... <br>
<br>
I think that this idea is a great one and that it can't go unnoticed in a world where animations start to look all the same in scenarios, characters and content... This one looks like a fresh one to me and it tends to keep good ingredients like giant robots... wars... lost worlds... treason... vengeance...  and I'm sure we'll be able to put some other great characters element in there... love... friendship... partnership... name it we'll have it... <br>

I am also glad that you think that my story stands out from the rest of anime stories out there.  Gundam did the same thing when it first started, it broke away from the usual boy meets robot, boy saves the universe plot.  There was very in depth characters, and some people on each side were evil and some on each side were good.  There was such a variety that it was hard to find a &quot;Good&quot;  and &quot;Bad&quot; guy in all of the series. <p><center><font size=3> <b>Check out the</b><br>  <a href=http://pub80.ezboard.com/bbattlingseizurerobots> <image src=http://homepages.bigassweb.com/mrmecha/bsrbbs.gif border=0></a>__<a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/bjobocreations>..</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=neko>Neko</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_star.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(7/30/01 8:08:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=257.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://kuraineko.tripod.ca/Neko.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ummm, 3CB?</span><hr size=1> Ok...

with the kiskov engine...due to the law of conservation of mass...you can`t use up matter...it just changes...that engine sounds something like nuclear fission...I would think there would be more advanced techniques...like fusion...or maybe Matter-antimatter engines...I`d like to know more about the engines<br>
as well over population would eventualy be a problem since for every 1 couple you`re creating 2 1/2 couples...a better solution would be to give a tax break to people with less children...it`s sounds much more demented and seems to fit anyway...as well you forgot to mention if the other planets are used for anthing like mining...you could have agis be 3 times the mass as when the planet started by building straight up and straight down...<br>
you should go into a bit more detail on the cidals...are the sleek and fast...are they big and slow...<br>
I think the computer designed ones would be more efficient and quicker...maybe a little weaker...and the human ones would be limeted by their controller (do they have pilots or are they remote???)<br>

(Actually the better idea i had which was wrong was that normal calcium would be given off, but i didn't realize that carbon dioxide had 2 oxygen and 1 carbon, for the calcium to be given off it would have to be 2 carbon and 1 oxygen, damn you titanium getting in my way!)

'cause I'm kind of in a crises here... Lookin for jobs and trying to survive at the same time... hi hi hi... So the writting takes a little longer then I first planned... <br>
<br>
another thing is that I'm always trying to go for a story that is well braid... see what I mean. I like to have like 2 to 4 character with different destiny meating each other by some twist of faith and then having your story unfold bit by bit with a lot of ah oh and hiiiiiiii! And right now I'm just trying to make a little synopsis of all that... It's not alway easy or hard... but it always takes time and a lot of wits... <br>
<br>
See ya soon...<br>

I'm not a nuclear physicist...but I believe with fission they use uranium 235 (an isotope of uranium)...basically because it's a little unstable and is easy to crack open...but fusion I can see in the future it's a lot more efficient (not at the moment though)...they can't do cold fusion yet...maybe they won't be able to...which could explain the heat...I don't believe you can fuse 2 elements to create another...I'm not too sure how fusion works though...<br>
But I could explain a bit of what I got from chemistry...first off...neutrons don't matter (excuse the pun)...except in weight...they weigh they same as protons...neutrons are what makes isotopes...protons are what determines the element...and electrons the charge (changed by gaining or loosing them)...in the normal state an element has equal numbers of all of them...<br>
Chemical reactions go like this... a + b = ab ... ab+c = ac+b...ab+cd = ad+bc<br>
(I think that's right...it's late and I'm doing it from memory...)<br>
I can imagine fusion might go something like this...you might also make a chemical reaction engine...the physics of chemistry are pretty solid but there's enough there to have fun playing with...keep in mind they're always discovering new elements...nobody is saying you cant add a couple more (gundamium)...You can make anything you like with your own stuff...maybe your fusion engine could work...just not with todays elements...maybe a chemical reaction engine could work...or maybe get really creative and have an engine that feeds off the pilot...causing pilot fatigue and problems like that in the begining but once pilot and mech become more used to each other those problems become less (the engine evolves to be more efficient)...<br>
As well if you were going to have it output titanium...it should be titanium vapor...you wouldn't have to deal with extra weight and it would make sense due to the heat...and it could fall to the planet in rain to be mined...(Mmm..titanium raindrops)...<br>
Just some random ideas...remember to be creative...in the future you can totally shake off the past and people won't hate you for it...I'm just being really nitpicky... <p>--

PS. I knew that neutrons don't matter, thats why i called it Titanium, but i just said it would be odd because of its abnormal amount of neutrons (by the way, does less neutrons make for a less stable element?  or more stable because there is less neutral and more of opposite forces, therefore wanting to stick together more.) <p><center><font size=3> <b>Check out the</b><br>  <a href=http://pub80.ezboard.com/bbattlingseizurerobots> <image src=http://homepages.bigassweb.com/mrmecha/bsrbbs.gif border=0></a>__<a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/bjobocreations>..</a></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showMessageRange?topicID=257.topic&start=21&stop=26>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showPrevMessage?topicID=257.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showNextMessage?topicID=257.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=257.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.polykarbon.com/bbsimage/addreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.emailToFriend?topicID=257.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.threadControl?topicID=257.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=257.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=257.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub25.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="polykarbonbbsfrm18">PK-BBS Rules and Regulations!<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm27">Board F.A.Q.s<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm3">News and Updates<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm2">Photoshop and Art questions<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm4">General Manga/Anime Discussion<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm5">Japanese Language Help<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm23">art in progress<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm13">Black and White Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm14">Color Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm19">Member's Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm17">Moderators Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm6">Member Photos<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm31">Help, Hints and Cheats<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm20">Challenges<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm21">Matches<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm26">Writer's Forum<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm32">VG Discussion<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm33">PolyKarbon CCG<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm35">Member Created Tutorials<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm36">Best Tutorials</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#336699>- </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs>Polykarbon BBS</a><font color=#336699> - </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26>Writer's Forum</a> <font color=#336699> - </font><a href="http://www.polykarbon.com">Polykarbon: Manga & Photoshop</a><font color=#336699> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM ARTS AD SCRIPT -->
