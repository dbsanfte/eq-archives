<br>
----------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Elijah shuffled down the corridor with leaden feet and his neck buckling under the sheer weight of the thoughts swimming through his head. His friend Riana bounded along next to him, remaining in his peripheral vision as he burnt a hole in the floor with an intense yet distant stare. A string of sarcastic comments rolled off his tongue and his ears were filled with the familiar, fantastic sound of Riana’s laughter. Yet there was no hint of a smile in Elijah’s misted grey eyes, as he castigated himself for having left it so long to say what he needed to say. <br>
<br>
They entered the lift and, as the closing steel doors incarcerated them, the flitter of light conversation left their presence like a startled sparrow. A climate of forlorn resonance filled the void, and impelled Elijah to the corner of the cubicle. His feelings strained to burst through his chest but, each time he opened his mouth, were snatched from his will and reduced to wasted air. The lift may have been going up, but his soul was far from uplifted. There seemed to be no resolution to the situation, but the bitter shell in which he had resided during this trancelike eternity was suddenly shattered, as the doors parted. <br>
<br>
An old man stumbled in, accompanied by a heavy stench, giving the two unsettled faces that now met his gaze more than enough clues as to how he’d been drowning his sorrows. The back of his waxed coat was sprinkled with bits of straw, but no one was about to ask why. He appeared to have a problem with his left eye, which darted around furiously, in stark contrast to his general morose manner. On occasion it would, disconcertingly, revolve around to the extent that it appeared to be peering inside his head. Somewhat ironically, Riana now did not know where to look, and took a step closer to Elijah - who consequently felt significantly more uncomfortable. The thought that he had missed his chance was inescapable, and he began to harbour an irrational hatred towards this man. No words were exchanged between the three people; each wanting more space, each wishing for the walls of this prison to fall away. The glowing red numbers passing by heralded the coming of the moment when they could escape. But, despite the best efforts of the world’s most renowned physicists, time was slowing.<br>
<br>
The old man had been born Theodore Mosley, though seldom was he known by that name now. Forsaken and forgotten, he had little purpose in this life, and dismissively drank it away, waiting for the next. The paradigm of his pint glass revealed to him a world of strangers and enemies. Neither did his beer goggles reflect too kindly on the two youngsters he found himself with. The boy had a shifty look about him, and the girl looked a whore with all that muck on her face. The future wasn’t worth holding on to if people like this were going to be our politicians and bank managers. Hundreds of little clichés were stewing away inside him, but were released only as incoherent mumblings. At any rate, unbeknown to him, ‘What is this country coming to?’, ‘Young people nowadays…’ and ‘When I was your age…’ had already been said.<br>
<br>
Elijah started to become conscious of his heavy heartbeat and breathing. He did not want to exhibit any sign that he was scared of the man, or moreover, of Riana. His mind handed the responsibility of motor control over to his subconscious; his left arm moving across his chest, his right hand covering his mouth and rubbing his nose. His eyes wandered, but were wrenched back as if on a leash, when he thought he felt a slight jolt. He quickly gauged the reactions of his two shipmates and decided he must have imagined it. At that moment, the boat rocked again. <br>
<br>
Theodore was knocked off his feet and cursed loudly at the ceiling as if it were some sort of mechanical deity. His clenched fist took on the intensity of a raging bull as boiling blood coursed through his tired veins. Riana, in an attempt to relieve her tension, almost sang the words - ‘What’s going on?’<br>
Elijah was paralysed, save for a spasm in his hand. Like a lone pillar amid an ancient ruin, he stood, as Riana clutched his arm in a futile bid for reassurance.<br>
<br>
The faint electric drone that had been the soundtrack to Elijah’s unease was now replaced by a sickening symphony of crunches and whirring. As if by some demonic composer, it appeared to be building to a horrendous disharmonic climax. Riana gave thought to the fact that she never had liked lift music, but lightening the mood didn’t seem possible by now.<br>
There was a thud, and then an uncanny hush. Elijah felt the hairs prick up on the back of his neck, and a shiver flash down his spine. Was this the eye of the storm? He forced himself out of his corpse-like demeanour and, attempting to loosen his neck, noticed the pitiful figure of Theodore sobbing. He was hunched into the corner of the cubicle, burying his sodden face in his coat. Elijah got the impression that this man had not cried for a long time. He was torn between wanting to comfort him or hit him, but of course acted upon neither.<br>
<br>
Nothing seemed to be happening. They were cut off from civilisation. This did nothing to inspire hope in Elijah’s overactive mind, which was now unceasingly indulging in macabre fantasies. Riana’s grip on his arm tightened to an extent where he would have been in pain had it not been numbed by fear. <br>
A distorted voice from someone, somewhere, broke the awkwardly subdued air. “We are having slight technical difficulties with lift A2. Hudson and Hudson would like to apologise for any inconvenience this has caused to the people using it, and to let them know tha -” It was interrupted by silence and darkness as the electronics failed. Three hearts swelled to bursting point with dread. Elijah and Riana instinctively engaged in a fierce embrace. He had always loved her touch, and as all hope of living past this moment left him, so did his inhibitions. <br>
<br>
It all happened in a second. His last breath was drawn as the final cable snapped, and he moulded it into his last three words. Above the cries of a stranger and the grating screams of a dying machine, Riana heard ‘I love you’.<br>
<br>
Her lips touched Elijah’s cheek as the lift hit the ground.<br>
<br>

That's it, any thoughts, suggestions, opinions, criticisms, minor faults, anything - would be greatly appreciated.<br>

There's some brilliant metaphor's in there but I think that maybe a few too many; it's like a sea of metaphors and similee. And also you have a few too many mixed metaphors: the lift is a ship, Elijah a statue, demonic composers, startled sparrows. <br>

Not that they aren't persuasive in their tone, but I'd cut them down and rather than tell the reader what the characters are thinking let their actions show their emotions. Let the reader discover how they are feeling.<br>

They stepped into the lift and the thick doors clanged shut, signalling the end of conversation.  Elijah stepped into the corner of the lift. He drew a breath, glanced at Riana and static filled his mouth. Steading himself, Elijah prepared for the lift to leave its moorings and force his body up through the air. Ding! The doors slid open again but the static in his mouth did not wash away.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=hammy311@polykarbonbbs>hammy311</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(1/27/03 11:34:49 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=900.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.psionicdesign.com/phpBB2/images/avatars/d986eff43e1b538c9b8d0.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Good.</span><hr size=1> I agree...
