Ok... it's just a show. That's all. If people like it, then I say let them like it. Having a problem with people liking a show is like trying to tell them how to live their lives... you just can't do it. Some people like the show, and you don't. It's that simple, and there's no need to try and convince people otherwise. Maybe I like it, but maybe I don't. I'm not going to say because it doesn't matter. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ualucard1515.showPublicProfile?language=EN>alucard1515</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator <img src=http://contest.polykarbon.com/badge1.gif></span><br> <font color=#336699>(3/8/02 4:56:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1424.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.undeadart.com/forum/alucard.gif width=100 height=94></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Does DBZ deserve it's popularity?</span><hr size=1> No one said you shouldn't like he, he's just having a discussion about it.

Now when I say this, i'm talking about dragonball Z not the original Dragonball.  I loved that series, it had a strong stroy line and wasn't repetitive.  Notice how they only used the dragonballs once?  Now they're like, &quot;Woops, I cut my finger while I was making breakfast.  Damn, that hurt.  Hey, LETS FIND THE DRAGONBALLS!!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
While the story line is slow moving and has no point,(seriously, what's the pint, to get stronger?  If i wanted to watch that, I'd buy the tae bow video set!) The theory behind it is cool, like the supersayin levels and fusing and stuff.  At least you get into DBGT, EVERYTHING in that blew chunks.  SSJ 4?  what a piece of turd.<br>
<br>
The music isn't that bad, gets annoying after a while, but not bad.   The best movie that came from any anime was the music from FF7.  Also, FF7 has the best storyline. (i know that what I just said isn't about dbz and that its a vid game, but I couldn't resist!!)<br>
<br>
The fighting is cool for the first couple of battles, then it just gets boring.  Kamehameha again?  LEARN A NEW MOVE!!! and its not just goku, everyone uses that damn fireball.  and when they fight hand to hand, that's just gay.  I mean all that's happening is a bunch of scribbley lines going across the screen.  Or they draw two people fighting for 3 sec then repeat the same three sec over and over again.  And when they power up, why do their shirts come off?<br>
<br>
And they characters are pretty damn stupid, like, they could have ended the entire series with the frieza battle, but everyone in that show is an idiot.  Freeza was stronger then all of them for like, 20 episodes, why did he just kill all of them when he could?  No, I think I'll wait untill one of them get strong enough to beat me so I can lose.  Yeah, whatever.<br>
<br>
All in all The idea was a good one, but it was worn thing with nothing backing it.  Semi good drawing and semi good ideas will not keep this anime afloat for long, at least not in NA.  Especially, when all these stations are too cheap to buy episodes so they keep playing reapeats.  Every time they get to a new section in the story, they start over.  they loose more of their audience than they think when they do that.<br>
<br>
Anywayz, pretty crappy show, crappy games too, haven't seen the movie but I've heard that they are pretty crappy to.  It's a shame of what they did for the sequel to an amazing series.  Oh well, whatever. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ualucard1515.showPublicProfile?language=EN>alucard1515</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator <img src=http://contest.polykarbon.com/badge1.gif></span><br> <font color=#336699>(3/15/02 11:05:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1424.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.undeadart.com/forum/alucard.gif width=100 height=94></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_thumbsdown.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Does DBZ deserve it's popularity?</span><hr size=1> Okay, for all the first part, that's opinion, so whatever, but as for this: &quot;Semi good drawing and semi good ideas will not keep this anime afloat for long, at least not in NA.&quot; You couldn't be more wrong. I don't know where you've been, but the show is insanely popular, in fact it's Cartoon Network's highest rated series. And it's near the end of the series, so it's not like it hasn't lasted already.<br>

Okay, why doesn't anyone understand this? They're not too cheap to buy new episodes, they already have rights to the whole series. But it takes a while to dub the show, and they already come out with about 50 or more episodes a year. What other show do you know that comes out with that many a year? The dubbing's bad enough without them rushing it.<br>

Ha. Yes, I'm sure they do lose some people, but I think you're the one overestimating, and not them underestimating.  <p><table width=100% border=0>

I don't know why, but they were forced into saying this because of the many children writing in and complaining.  Which brings me to my second point<br>
<br>
When you say: <br>
&quot;I don't know where you've been, but the show is insanely popular, in fact it's Cartoon Network's highest rated series. And it's near the end of the series, so it's not like it hasn't lasted already.&quot;<br>
<br>
First of all, its at the beginning of the Buu series (in canada at least)  And I know for a fact that this will take quite a while too finish!  And when you say insanely popular, insanely popular with who.  I'm in grade 10, and therefore, I go to highschool.  &quot;If you mention DragonBall Z at my school, you will be laughed at and then have your ass kicked.  Except for 3 ppl I know, All my friends hate it.  I would like to ask Cartoon network to take a survey and ask the people who watch the show how old they are.  They take all the swearing, nudity and violence out ON PURPOSE to market the show to little kids.  On teletoon (again, a canadian station) They used to play the original DragonBall at like, 11:30 at night, with no censoring, along with the spawn and max cartoons.  This was to get older audiences watching the show for all of its goodyness<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    But on YTV its on at like 5:30, which is in the middle of a segment known as &quot;the zone&quot;  Specifically for children in elementry school.  Ironically, it comes right after PokeMon and Digimon and after it, comes another childrens anime called metabots.<br>
<br>
So, wow, what a fanbase.  Kids start out watching teletubbies, move onto barney, then go onto DBZ.  Me?, I'm still waiting for teletoon to start playing a decent uncensored anime again,. Hopefully Kenshin, which is a much better anime to begin with.  When these children wake up and realize that they've been watching a show about people can go blonde at will, I think they will move on, just like everyone else with half a brain has.<br>

<br>
Yeah, us North Americans have such high standards for our television.  That's why we would never let stuff on tv like a show where celebrities box and beat the crap out of each other.  Oh wait.....<br>
<br>
Um, Alucard already said it was very popular and the highest rated cartoon network show.  You seemed to skip over the &quot;highest rated&quot; part.  That is a fact.  Yeah, so it's mostly younger teens watching it.  So what?  That wasn't the point of the argument.<br>
<br>
You seem to have the attitude that these kids should be watching Spawn or the Maxx or other adult anime.  Why?  They're around the age of 10.  I wouldn't want them watching that stuff.  It doesn't mean they're dumb, it just means they're young.  If you think you're too mature to watch it, then don't.  It doesn't mean it's a dumb show just because younger kids are the main ones watching it.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> So, wow, what a fanbase. Kids start out watching teletubbies, move onto barney, then go onto DBZ.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
isn't that how it's kind of supposed to work for everybody?  Were you watching uncensored anime when you were 8?  I doubt it.  You were probably watching stuff like sesame street or at most probably gi joe or transformers.  I don't remember any uncensored stuff in those shows, do you?  <br>
<br>
If you don't like the show that's fine.  But that doesn't mean it doesn't deserve it's spot as a popular show.  It's just popular among younger kids.<br>

I watched uncensored anime when I was like six (I remember one about a little kid, and some train, it had a space pirate, his mother had died and he ran away or something...and he found some cyborg that looked like his mother...at the end she took him to this large...uhhh....building where there were all these bodies preserved in the building...kinda like that sap stuff does with prehistoric bugs. And she explains that everyone there is there because they were all termenally ill, some plague had struck the planet, and her body, her real body, was in there somewhere) it's a foggy memory, like i said, i was six....perhaps even younger.  My grandmother was the one that used to get them for me...I don't think she realized what she was doing.<br>
<br>

DBZ HAS to advertise to a younger fan base because older kids won't watch it, censored or uncensored.  Big deal, more blood.  A little swearing.  Probably some nudity, but nothing like, I don't know, SMARTER CHARACTERS AND LESS REPITION!!!!  Censored or uncesored, the show is still basically the same, therefore, it still sux.  I've watched the uncesored ones, and there isn't much more in it other than the words @#%$ and dammit.<br>
<br>
And it's not a very violent show, I've seen way better action and fighting scenes in MANY other animes.  KENSHIN RULZ!!!!  Well, many of my points still stand, like crappy storyline and crappy theories.  And no offense to akira toryama, but the stuff that is good from the story, isn't even his.  The &quot;son&quot; in son goku and son gohan and the extending stick and the turning into a giant ape thing are all part of ancient chinese/japanese mythology. Don't believe me?  He's not the only one to use these myths.  Son Son from MvC2 is based on it as well.  Go to www.Gamefaqs.com and look up the faq for Son Son and it explains everything.  I still think DBZ should quit while it's ahead.<br>

I'm talking about Cartoon Network. Funimation is based in the US, and Cartoon Network is their primary network to air them, so I'm going by that. And I was not wrong in saying it's almost over. The Buu saga is the final saga of DBZ and it's already aired halfway through. There's only about 50 episodes or more left, and they'll finish airing it next year.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> And when you say insanely popular, insanely popular with who.

You do realize that the world doesn't revolve around your school? When I went to high school, a lot of people loved it, and a lot of people hated it. That doesn't mean my high school is representative of everyone, just like yours isn't. If it wasn't popular, do you really think they would have aired as much as they have? Do you really think they would have went back and redubbed the original Dragon Ball episodes if it wasn't popular?<br>

I can't stand people like you. Everyone is entitled to their opinions. People aren't stupid because they like a show you don't. I'm sure you like a lot of things that people don't like either. That doesn't make you an idiot, it just means you have a different opinion.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Censored or uncesored, the show is still basically the same, therefore, it still sux. I've watched the uncesored ones, and there isn't much more in it other than the words @#%$ and dammit<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Actually, that's not true. You might still not like it, but it is not &quot;basically the same&quot; at all. If it were only cuss words, brief nudity, and blood that was cut, then it would be basically the same. They do that in addition to changing music (which changes the mood of the show completely), changing and adding dialogue (making the characters seem completely different, so that actually does play into the &quot;smarter characters&quot; thing), etc. <br>
<br>
And yeah, it is based off a Chinese legend, but so what? I can't count how many other series or movies are based off of mythology or legend.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I still think DBZ should quit while it's ahead.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Um... you do realize that Akira Toriyama hasn't done anything with Dragonball since he finished it? That was many years ago. Then the DBZ series ended around 1996, and he only served a minor role on DBGT. If you mean in the US or Canada, why? That wouldn't make any sense. Why would they end it before it's complete? <p><table width=100% border=0>

While on the computer, my brother felt compelled to show me his response to the question &quot;does dbz deserve its popularity?&quot; and then naturally, he showed me the responses that you complete idiots wrote. When i say complete idiots, i am of course including my brother in a sense. Not only is it dumb to watch the show, its even dumber to waste your time arguing about it (i'm quite ashamed that i'm on this as well). Why would anyone take time out of their day to argue about it? Now i know that everyone is entitled to their opinion and that there are many loyal and devoted fans of the show (even though i don't know why), but there are many things is this world that are more important to talk about, NOT about whether or not the shows come out too slow because it takes time to dub or whether or not the characters are stupid. Please for the sake of humanity, spend your time on something more worthy. I assume that a lot of you are my brother's age (15) and i will admit that when i was 15 i watched cartoons (i'm 19), heck i still do now, but please, go outside, call a friend, have an intelligent conversation, but for the love of GOD, stop being complete damn idiots and make yourselves productive.<br>

I have to thank DBZ for being crappy.  Because it was one of the first animes i was exposed to, and because it is SOOOOOO damn bad (my opinion),  it makes all other GOOD animes look so much better.  Comparing the fight scenes of DBZ and Kenshin.........KENSHIN KICKS ASS!!!  <br>
<br>
<br>
So, thank you DBZ, for all your crappy drawings, characters, storylines, fight scenes, music and WAY unrealistic everythings.  I thank you from the bottom of my heart.<br>

And Shrapnel, just stop posting. You're just trying to push people's buttons now, and you're not even discussing anything intelligently. If you keep posting crap like that, they will be deleted. <p><table width=100% border=0>

How are my arguments stupid?  Name one way how they're stupid, other than you misunderstanding them.  BIG WOOP, its highly popular with VERY impressionable 8 year olds, that doesn't mean its goo.  This topic is if it DESERVES its popularity.  This means if it was well made and proper thought, which I have argued no to, and supported well.  Just like you say my high school doesn't represent everyone.  The age group that watches Cartoon Network does not represent everyone.  When they start to show another GOOD anime on cartoon network (which will never happen), i'd like to see what happens.  PLEASE, PLEASE tell me how my arguments are wrong, oh great lord that knows all, LORD SMARTASS!!!<br>

However, I have to reiderate the question of 'why did you post?' you tell us doing this is a waste of time then you do it too....If you tell us you're gonna shoot yourself in the foot, then you do it, it still doesn't change the fact that you shot yourself in the foot.<br>
<br>
If how we chose to spend our time bothers you, then the problem lies in you, not us. I don't think it's possible to be productive all of the time, sometimes you just have to do 'stuff'.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>"Some people call 'em swirlies...others call 'em baptisms."</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ualucard1515.showPublicProfile?language=EN>alucard1515</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator <img src=http://contest.polykarbon.com/badge1.gif></span><br> <font color=#336699>(3/17/02 8:38:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1424.topic&index=40>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.undeadart.com/forum/alucard.gif width=100 height=94></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_thumbsdown.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Does DBZ deserve it's popularity?</span><hr size=1> Shrapnel, I could sit here all day and show you just how entirely and completely idiotic you are, but you'd never listen to a word I have to say. You'd just reply with something even more idiotic than your previous post, and it'd go on and on. So instead of countering your brilliant, supporting &quot;arguments&quot; (ie &quot;Comparing the fight scenes of DBZ and Kenshin.........KENSHIN KICKS ASS!!!&quot;), I'll just not worry about you, and discuss this with people far more intelligent than you. So basically, anyone else. <p><table width=100% border=0>
