Shedding the blackness of night like snow wavering away in a bonfire, the hidden thing revealed itself. <br><br>A simple ring, it seemed. Size indeterminate, but only for a moment. Flaring with light from its center, it seemed to grow and dilate, the spark contained within seeming to grow brighter but shed no light as the ring stretched and thinned ever further.<br><br>Then the shock came, the spark flaring as something passed through, but not through the far side of  the construct. <br><br>Like a titan rising from the earth, a giant of the stars slipped through the portal ring, massive bulk quiescent as it was wreathed by the energy of transference.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *<br><br>&quot;Soh'tak!&quot; Ra'Kolan shouted into the darkness, senses tingling as he strained to identify any tangible effects of the transfer. As always, there were none but the split-second glimpse of the threshold, a ghostly wall sweeping down the length of the ship as it passed from place to place.<br><br>Around him, Law-of-Anarchy rose from slumber to hunting-status, the massive ship signalling wakefulness with a change of the battle-drums. Cocking one pointed ear to better catch the tempo, Ra'Kolan felt the calm of relief wash away under the steady march of the computer-generated war song.<br><br>&quot;Ju'ka, status?&quot; He barked, grasping the textured arms of his command couch to give himself a sense of control where he knew he had none.<br><br>&quot;The temporary point will disappear with the passing of the comet in a moment. I see no sign of alarm from any planetary defenses.  The Heresy-of-Innovation is present and Instrument-of-Chaos is finished shifting... now.&quot; The sensing-officer responded, his niche of consoles the only ones on the bridge remaining powered, and only at half.<br><br>&quot;Te'va. Let us proceed, then.&quot; He mused, knowing well they were already underway, drifting at transition-speed toward target. It simply felt better to fill the empty air with noise, but Shipself responded nonetheless, perhaps also feeling the need to fill the air. Machine perhaps, but no less a being, no less a Taiyan-Kerrahi in soul to be birthed by forge and nanite than the coupling flesh of parents.<br><br>&quot;I stand ready, Ra'Ko'lan! Our charges lie eager in their assault pods and aerospace craft, waiting only to be loosed on the poor pitiable bastards below us. Weapons and defenses remain well prepared but unpowered.&quot; The air responded in a melodious but echoing voice, the Ship-self flavoring its' words with confidence and agression as it made report.<br><br>&quot;Engagement farpoint reached. No response whatsoever.&quot; Sensors pronounced eagerly.<br><br>Cat-slit pupils glowing in the red-lit darkness of the command deck, it seemed every Taiyan aboard bared their canines in a feral, predatory grin at that announcement...<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *<br><br>Aboard the Instrument-of-Chaos the sensation was similar, but more acute. The tempo of the battlehymn was faster, matching the pulses of the crew as they imagined the predatory lines of their ship, blind and unpowered though it was, slipping silently between the bulks of the slower-moving battle carriers.<br><br><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;Chu'koleh sha'ha, mweh kell.&quot; </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->One of the Kerrahi intoned, making the ritual left-to-right, top-to-bottom, inverted L shape of a war blessing in the air before his face, and then bowing his head and repeating the gesture over his console to renforce his luck with the luck of the ship.<br><br>The Taiyan near him held no faith in such superstition, but all restrained their cynicysm, and a scattered few born beyond the portal mirrored the gesture, while others gleaned their own reassurance fingering trophy-necklaces or Marks. Many others recited the Law of Ascendance. A single thought that could result in the extermination of an entire colony. <br><br>And a just penalty for a hienous crime.<br><br>&quot;Nearpoint reached. Reactor to power, passing stasis point now. Aerospace-fighters charging and readying for release. Point-defense-ready. Offensive-Systems ready. Sensors prepared to activate, scan-and-acquire pattern ready. Target resolution vectors and probable course adjustments calculated.&quot;  The shipself announced, the battle music mixing with more drumbeats and tempos, pulsing deeper and louder as each system added its' status to the cadence.<br><br>&quot;All systems to power!&quot; Ta'Reja commanded, his voice the thunderclap that triggered an avalanche of action.<br><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;Gunnery online!&quot;<br>&quot;Point Defense online!&quot;<br>&quot;Contact aquired, firing single-shot seeker munitions from tubes one and three!&quot;<br>&quot;Contacts aquired, five inbound interceptor-fighters, Nau'kel size or lighter...&quot;<br>&quot;Thrusters online, inertial decoupler engaged. Engineering straight green.&quot;<br>&quot;Reactor at nominal, ready for combat power-load! Ninety percent now...&quot;<br>&quot;Incoming volley, displacement singularities tracking and defending at nominal...&quot;<br></i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>As the whirlwind grew, Ta'Reja relaxed into his armature, bringing up the interface. Around him, the armature projection field blotted out the bridge, replacing it with a view of Outside. Ticks and whorls more felt than seen became his universe, flowing motions of his hands stroking and gesturing in the computer-projected ether silently translating to hundreds of directives to as many parts of his great ship. Slight movements of his fingers drew turrets from their blisters on the hull and oriented them on the incoming fightercraft like a piper entrancing a cobra from its den. <br><br>The hull of the ship seemed to vibrate as cannons opened fire, rapid-firing plasma beams and magnetic hyperacellerators sweeping a narrow path through the blackness with imperceptible viciousness, lancing out to sear the incoming fighters. The tempo of the war-song rose, drumbeats synchronized with reload/recycle times, the weaponsfire a symphony, a pulse, the song of death and war as the ship shook and jerked like a living beast as the salvo vented. Then it grew quiet, it's rage spent and the enemy passed. The enourmous energy discharges of the plasma and tremendous impact forces of the gauss projectiles had left only floating drops of molten metal and ceramic, drifting into to the blackness of empty space. The battlehymn slowed momentarily for their passing.<br><br>Silvered teardrops spinning in the dark void as the predatory shape of the Chaos slipped past the tumbling corpses, as uncaring as a razorfish as it passed the twisted wreckage of it's former prey and continued toward the spinning orb that was its intended target.<br><br>The battle was joined.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *<br><br>Watching carefully as the pips denoting turrets flashed from sullen yellow back to eager blue, Ta'Reja gestured their fire arcs to cover the ship completely, mortaring the chinks between the shielding displacement fields with the lighter gimballed cannon, while also focusing heavier weapons outward, to intercept threats before they could close to strike.<br><br>&quot;Ready skip-torpedos!&quot; He muttered aloud, tapping the empty space before the projection of their ship, directing the powerful but high-emission active sensor webs sweep the designated space. Like nighttime insects revealed by a searchlight, a cluster of traces appeared, and at his barked command the ship shuddered and the ventral launchers spat their offspring into the blackness.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *<br><br>Like newborn sea creatures, searching for a parent to suckle, the torpdoes tumbled from the launch canals of the Instrument-of-Chaos, seeming seemed to hang for a moment and gather their bearings as their inertia kept pace with the Instrument-of-Chaos. Then, resolving their targets, sped toward their victims on pillars of plasma flame.<br><br>Streaking into the darkness, several of the missiles suddenly went dead. The flames quenched, and minute masking fields engaged. They simply disappeared, even as plasma and particle beams lanced their former positions, trying to intercept them with no avail.<br><br>But safely within the masking-fields, the antimatter-warhead torpedos engaged their tracking drives- miniaturized inertial decouplers such as on their long gone parent ship. Silently, the decouplers diverted the missiles inertia, slewing them clear of the chaff bursts, running their downloaded sensor data through predictive algorithms. Then, one missile decloaked, sending forth a loud electromagnetic pulse, and dove forward at the targets.<br><br>Immediately, laser and point-defense cannon tore it to shreds. To little avail, as the warhead shielding failed. Antimatter and matter erupted into a mutispectral flash of heat and light, so great a torrent of energy that it burned active sensors and eyes alike, and stripped away the masking fields on the remaining torpedos.<br><br>Unfortunately, their targets were blinded, and the torpedos had no need of their own sensors anymore. The pulse of the first ship had illuminated their prey, allowing them to passively aquire without revealing themselves.<br><br>And so they struck, and ships evaporated in the hellish fires of antiparticle anihliation. Many of the first explosions detonated other missiles, but only one explosion would have been enough detonating in the midst of the blinded and crippled fleet, mere thousands of kilometers apart, and the fractricide only ensured there would be nothing larger than a speck left to impede the approaching troopships.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;Insertion corridor clear!&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Sensors screamed, risking an active-detection pulse during the explosions.<br><br><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Ready for orbital bombardment! All hands stand ready for assault manouvering!&quot; </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->Ta'reja screamed in response, firing the combat drives for the first time since transition. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Like the roar of a roused demon, the shrill booming screech of the plasma torches filled the pressure spaces, the entire ship vibrating from their fury as tons of hyperplasma was jetted and diffused from the stern and belly of the ship, hurling it into a slingshot trajectory around the planet while pointing the most powerful powerful spinal and dorsal weapons down at the target. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Immediately upon assuming bombardment orientation, the bridge lights increased from the dim red of battle to clean yellow-white light, and gunnery rang with barked orders in battle speech and common.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Fire ranging volley.&quot; The gunnery-leader boomed, the space around his command armature filled with a targeting map of the surface and the numerous crosshairs of the surface-attack capable weapons.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp With noiseless flares of light and energy, the <br>Instrument of Chaos shuddered and released a barrage onto the surface dwellers below.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Adjust for atmospherics and prepare for full bombardment!&quot; The gunnery-leader shouted to his charges, straining against his seat-straps as he roared orders and shifted his armature from station to station with such force it seemed it would snap.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Gunnery, anti-emplacement saturation fire. All dorsal batteries!&quot; Ta'reja shouted, in accord with the deathmaster gunner. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Once more the ship shook, this time a prolonged rocking as what seemed round, harmless drops rained down to the suface like fat rain, bursting with harmless splashes on the green globe below. In truth, however, gigajoules of energized plasma were lancing forth from the Instrument-of-Chaos every second, thirty charged-plasma cannon vomiting forth wave after wave of destruction at the surface, methodically eradicating the fledgeling antiaerospace defenses of the world below, the harmless 'splashes' actually rock-hard shockwaves of compressed, superheated air laced with shattered debreis.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Retrothrusting! Stand by to release insertion vessels!&quot; Ta'reja informed his bridge, unconsciously wrestling the intangible holographic controls of his ship as though it were resisting him with the might of a roped Akila-Kila.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Heresy-of-Innovation and Law-of-Anarchy readying for drop orbit. Report all systems to Blue Light status. Repeat, Blue Light. Commencing drop deployment.&quot; Communications announced, changing the hue of the glowing status panels across the bridge from cream-white Ortillery status to the light blue strobe of drop stations.<br><br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Remind me again why we chose 'Crash-Landing' as the designation of our vessel, &quot; Koba complained sarcastically, slamming his lanky, red-brown Kerrahi self back against the bulkhead of the Ragnarok dropship with sufficient force to engage the restraint clamps and secure his powerarmor in place.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Shut up, male.&quot; Serra'ki, Kajuka-Ranag and Kajuka-Nemera responded in chorus, similarly filinging themselves against the claustrophobic walls of the assault transport. Secured, all three Taiyan relaxed and hung limply from the clamps, enjoying the strange lack of localized pressure that came from being suspended by their power-armor as they checked lucky tokens and emblems on their suits.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Serra'ki took it one step further. Her helmet open despite the regulations against it during combat conditions, she busily anointed her facial Marks with the sap from a crushed termaka berry. Millenia of superstitious lore and some ancient but well-documented occurances said that termaka could react with darksteel-ink tatoos and positively affect the wearer, but Serra was the only Taiyan Kajuka on the Instrument-of-Chaos to honor the practice. After critically examining the resultant smears of sap, she snapped her helmet shut and rolled the pulped rind between the armored fingers of her right hand.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Why do we even let B'channi order us around? She is a secondrank, after all.&quot; The Bweth-Koh Kerrah argued despairingly.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>&quot;I said shut up, male! You'll never truly outrank B'channi. She's a female, and you're a male, and so you'll <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  always </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->rank after her.&quot; Serra responded mockingly, bouncing the berry off the Kerrah's helmet visor.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  Unfazed, the support trooper continued his cynical monologue. &quot;Just think- our sister ship is the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Controlled-Fall!</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Doesn't that seem a bit more... hmm, how to put this... I don't know, reassuring?!&quot;<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Lit'tle cow'ar'd! At lea't we are not t'board the Near-Miss!&quot; R'djag jeered, coming up the hatch ramp in his full Kjho Dhjengha battlesuit. The Korluth paused in the threshold, noticing that his companions had not yet boarded. Even with the massive girth of the Korluth support trooper recessed in the large support-weapons niche, loading any other armored troopers became a difficult exercise in gymnastics everyone was willing to forgo in favor of patience. Even during a battle drop. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Fortunately, Ta'Kjass scampered up the hatch, followed closely by the slithering tangle of arms that was their Mw'juma scout, Rhyekki. Both clamped in before anyone could issue a complaint about their tardiness.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Grunting as he squeezed himself into the final berth like a cork in the rectum of a fish (what a lovely metaphor, Serra'ki noted wryly), R'djag triggered the hatch control, sliding the half-meter of armor plate over their only exit.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp From now until the drop point, their lives depended on the pilot, the Kajuka-Kerra B'channi. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Ka-ju-ka.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> What a strange term in the Common. Before-from-childhood. Or tankmeat, as they themselves, as well as others, often jokingly referred to them. Often artificially engineered, usually gestated for between three and fifteen years in a life support pod, and fed sensory data through nanite-constructed pathways literally integrated into their brains, Kajuka were symbolic of the Taiyan way.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp With a lurch, the dropship began to move. Massive servocranes outside were shunting their transport to one of the two main launchers of the Instrument-of-Chaos.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The Assault Destroyer was decidedly not a carrier-ship, and the inertial retrograde/magnetic induction launchers mostly served as plasma-stream accelerators and gauss cannon barrels, but they could nonetheless launch and recover internal fightercraft and dropships.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Still, literally being shot out of cannon, and a combat weapon cannon rather than a dedicated ship-launcher, was not reassuring, even when she linked to the external sensor web with her neural interface. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Serra'ki<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> , she reflected. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Serra-bor</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, the order-syllable at the end of her name, like all females, but denoting something unnatural. Once, the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> 'ki</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> had meant abnormality of birth. Rarely, there would be the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> 'kih</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> 'keh</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> of first-twin and second-twin, but <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> 'kii</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> held the lifelong stigma of a forced birth, be it from very early labor or ceasarian from a dying mother.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>But now, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> 'ki</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> was honorable, even worthy of respect and envy by common <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> 'ra</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> 'ta</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> 'ka</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. Neural interfacing had to be done early in childhood and under strictly controlled conditions, and thus was only possible for those whose birthyears were sacrificed to become Kajuka.  <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>Beside her, Ranag and Nemera were relaxed, trading infomation with their mentors Mejiki and Kolreijj, artificial sentiences that had served as reality, parent, and conscience during their decade in the tanks.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>In that, she was grateful she was Serra'ki. Better abnormal and with a family than the loneliness-in-numbers that was the lot of a full Kajuka. Her mother deserved respect for allowing the medicants to transfer her from womb-of-flesh to womb-of-steel, never to experience each other's touch until she was almost in her second year of growth.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>But now... Now she was the epitome of the Juka warrior. The old teachings that stressed the synergy of physical coordination and discipline, the lifelong support of a tight-knit circle of extended family, and full use of ones' inherent biological ability amplified by the advantages of knowledge and technology.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>She was not a creature of selected-genes, born without kin beyond her own kind! She was Ka'Juka Stormtrooper Firstrank Serra'ki, Clan Saddak, of Dena'ra by Ta'Arak! A two-year artificial-gestate, empowered with a level three cyberneural integration, allowing her to wear Marauder assault armor, and interface a combat ship! <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Let the gods wither and the universe rage against, for she was strong!</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> She thought defiantly, knocking her armored knuckles together impatiently.<br><br>The litany of her history and capability reassured her, building the spark of righteous arrogance that would grow and reinforce her confidence in battle.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  And with that reassurance, she felt the ship move, the shock of acelleration hitting like a hammer despite the even distribution across her body due to the impossibly close fit of her armor and the best efforts of the ships' small inertial decoupler.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp With her mechanical minds' eye, she watched through the interface as the barrel snapped past and they were hurled into the blackness.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp For a moment they seemed to hang, the diffusion effect of the inertial decoupler bleeding the kinetic energy from their launch into them at a safer rate. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Then the ship shuddered, and the roar of atmospheric friction filled her senses, digital and pysical singing with the fires of atmospheric friction and the ages old war chant of bloodlust and vengeance once more sung by the pilot and crew.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Smiling to herself, she withdrew from the ship, opening her eyes and raising her voice to the glorious song of battle.<br><br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Second wave is loaded. Dropships One through Twenty are fueled and armed. All Stormtrooper-Commanders report full readiness!&quot; The Korluth war-party-leader roared from his post on the troopdeck, the holographic image showing the massive beast clamped into an assault shuttle like the victim of a mechanical weaverbug.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ra'Kolan once again realized just how much he truly disliked the Korluth species. Big furry creatures, slow of wit and with simple humor, they reminded him of bipedal Taquag with tusks instead of horns. Add the ammonia-and-methane stink of their supplemented atmosphere breathers, the roaring grunts of their language, and their sheer size, and they could be positively insufferable. Intelligent Taquags was not a polite comparison for him to make, but it hardly mattered so long as he maintained his honor and ensured they recieved the same pseudoequality from him as Kerrahi, as well as the additional respect due for their usefulness as engineers and heavy-weapon troopers.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Helm, standby for outer atmosphere skim-seeding! Gunnery, prepare all weapons for insertion supression and point-defensive fire!&quot; He barked, cycling the holographic displays to show a computer-generated visualization of their surroundings, englobing the entire bridge in ebon infinity stretching down to meeth the hazy green orb of the target planet.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Beneath his feet, the projection began to writhe as additional data was seamlessly superimposed inside the hologram. Courses, wind vectors, drop zones, and target sites sprung from the magnified surface like titanic vines, snaking to and from the Law-of-Anarchy.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The tension palpable as they began to aerobrake on the stratosphere, Ra'Kolan finally felt the conditions right, murmurring, &quot;Release the troopships, Stormtrooper-commander...&quot; as he triggered the master hatch releases.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *<br><br>&quot;Hold onto your asses, this'll be.. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> nrgh...</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> fun!</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot; The pilot, B'channi, shouted. The constant stream of grunts and cursing in kerrah was once again punctuated by a dull bang, as the ship was rocked by another hit or near miss.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I do <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> not</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> get paid enough for this @#%$!&quot; Koba roared, ears knotting back as he felt another round physically brake the ship, lurching everyone forward despite the inertial decoupler field.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Flak and antiaerospace fire was all the worse for ground troopers. Stuck in a can like a preserved fish, helpless, unable to even HAHO when restrained in their cocoons...<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp But once a ship reached a certain altitude...<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;India-Charlie-Zero-Two, this is One, I have acquired my insertion path.

Thankful for the indirect warning, she had just the quarter second she needed to brace.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp With only a war-cry from B'channi to warn the others, the ship suddenly dropped, slewed wildly, and began to shake back and forth, rock and jolt up and down, and otherwise seem to move in every direction possible while maintaining forward velocity.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;In the groove!&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> B'channi exhulted, followed half a heartbeat by Koba's shout of joy.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Beneath the visorlike panel of his helmet, Serra could see the Kerrahs' eyes alight with joy as the ship swerved and bucked, flinging him against his restraints with uncaring violence.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Now <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> this</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> I can live with!&quot; He laughed, feeling the dropship slalom some unknown mountain or canyon in an effortless tailspin.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The initial insertion was dangerous, with the dropship trying to cover the distance from orbit to touchdown or drop point as quickly as possible while braving antiaerospace weapons.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp But to follow a straight line in empty air would be suicide. Even a rapidly shifting course in the clear would be foolish during a combat drop, so a drop was made threefold to promote survival. Firstly, the dropship would plummet like a stone, diving for the safety of atmosphere on extratmoshperic plasma drives.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Reaching the atmosphere, the dropship continued to plummet, relying on ramjets and ablative armor for speed while shrugging off heat and damage during the wobbling vertical dive.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Finally, the dropship would reach deck-height. At a frightening five to ten hundred kilometers per hour, and only a hundred or so meters off the irregular surface, the pilot would fly the ship the remaining distance to target in nap-of-the-earth mode, wings tucked close and relying on a ground-effect shockwave for lift as he or she followed a preidentified insertion path to the drop zone.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As if the initial drop and stabilization were not difficult enough, the inerstion path seemed designed to gaurantee an adrenally-fueled heart attack, as such a course always used whatever cover available, meaning unthinkably fast runs through snaking canyons and valleys at supersonic speeds.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Avalanche, going popup.&quot; B'channi announced, as the dropship suddenly bucked and surged abnormally, though Serra found it almost funny she could tell the difference between this and the previous gyrations. Consulting her neurolink, she saw the problem only as a titanic white blur in the shockwake behind them, barely comprehended even by her implants before it had vanished behind a rock arch the size of a freight bridge.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As though the snowy slalom hadn't been enough for their pilot, B'channi voiced another this-is-your-captain-speaking announcement for her cargoes. &quot;Nearing DeeZee, cutting and riding...&quot;<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp And suddenly the engines died. While the volume inside the drop hold barely decreased, the absence of the four throaty plasma/ramjets made the scream of the wind across the hull seem louder as they began to lose velocity.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Gaining altitude for tumble, wakewash overtaking in five-four-three-two-o-&quot; Their Kerrah pilot shouted, though only Serra heard, and then only through her linkages, as the snarling rumble and sudden, deafeaning crash of the hypersonic boom overtook and tumbledtheir ship , tossing it like a matchstick in a tempest.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Then the ramjet turbines screeched to life again, the ferocity of furious roar lost among the echoes of the boom and the dizzying tumbling of the ship, the sensation only muted by the inertial decoupler.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp While the non-Kajuka half of the squad fought their stomachs, the agile and arboreal Mw'juma scout reacted differently.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;Hell yeah!&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Rhyekki burbled, his glottal tongue mechanically translated in delayed-unison, but the tearing-steel background screech of his happiness was unmistakable. Unfortunately, he also smiled. The tapered green cone of his armored head, studded with barbels and tiny black eyes suddenly snapped open, the armor and chitinous but supple skin parting and revealing all four mandible-tongues, which lanched forward to full extension and spread wide in the only Mw'juma facial expression possible, spraying sedative salivary venom across the deck at Ta'Kjass. Only a sudden slide as the ship levelled off saved Ta'Kjass from having his armor painted blue, as the globules reversed direction in midair and then splatted across the cieling as the ship executed a turbulent dive-and-roll.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Unfortunately, the excited Ck'srai also forgot himself in the behavior of his tail. While the Mw'jum was rather limited in expression, the tail was not only venomous and sheathed in powered-armor, but the primary method of expression for the Mw'jum species. Reacting without thinking, Rhyekki slammed R'djag across both thighs, the sound a painful thwap that even brought the Kajuka out of interface.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The Korluth roared in suprise and anger, spittle glazing the inside of his dome-helmet as he threw back his head and roared. There was an audiable crunch as his tusks grated against the faceplate, and the angry roars to pain as his lower lip was mashed between the synthetic diamond and his protruding tusks. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Blood began to flow, running downward now as the dropship braked, the leaden sensation of a three-gravity deceleration fully felt with the inertial decoupler now fully disengaged.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The Korluth continued his litany of curses for a moment longer, but, like the rest of the squad, gripped his weapon tightly and prepared for release. Unlike his comrades, however, R'djag's weapon was already to hand. In fact, the Retrograde Cannon was integral to the right arm of his Pyel heavy armor, and he inspected it with loving care even as blood trickled from his split lip.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Drop is blue light. Repeat, drop away!&quot; Came the barked order, B'channi disengaging the restraint harnesses and releasing the Juka like a Vaar handler loosing hounds after a wild Du'urshath. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Like the whisper that started an avalanche, her words triggered a malestrom of action. Even as the dropship began to reaccelerate and gain altitude after the plummeting braking manouver, the rear hatch sprang open. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp To Serra, it seemed the grim atmosphere of the cabin evaporated with the inert nitrogen packing gas, as the confined space suddenly roared with battlecries.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Without even pausing, Rhyekki hurled himself out of the hatch headfirst, all four arms and powerful tail propelling him into the slipstream like vanishing smoke. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hardly a half-second later, R'djag followed suit, barreling out into the empty air without fear or hesitation and disappearing after the faint green speck of Rhyekki.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Following suit, Ta'Kjass gave voice to a shrill &quot;H'rekkaaaiiieeeee!&quot; and followed after, extending his arms before him and diving into the empty air like it were water.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp With no time for fear or even a battlecry, Serra lunged from her seat, attached her weapon to her chest and then tightly grasped it with both hands as she calmly leapt out of the dropship and into the alien sky.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The shock of drop hit like it always did- a thundering slap across the back of her body, likened to falling flat-backed onto a slab of permacrete from ten meters, then a tumbling blur, and then freefall. Even with the protection afforded by her Marauder powerarmor, the force left her back from buttocks to scalp stinging with pain and the exaggerated idea that just a bit more pressure would've mashed her breasts flat.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Then, the momentary ordeal over, she opened her eyes and spun about, assuming a headfirst dive with her arms tucked as she surveyed the landscape below with her eyes and Kajuka sensors.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The terrain was excellent, a strange mixture of small, grass-covered ridges and stretches of savannah scattered with short trees.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Looking around with her suit-sensors, she quickly acquired a topo lock with her geographic map and smiled. The long dotted line formed by her cadre was almost perfectly on target, running twenty kilometers away from but almost parallel to cadre Bravo's drop line, with their target neatly sandwitched between them.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Grinning inside her helmet, Serra thought her commmunications channel open ans shouted &quot;Cadre formate, home on my beacon in echelon-forward and proceed to nav at best pace,&quot;  in her best command-voice as the ground neared.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Suddenly squaring her shoulders and extending her arms, she let wind resistance flip her upright to a semistanding posture, falling feet first.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Curling her toes inside the armored hooves of her suit, she bent her legs and spread her toes, feeling the leaper pack thrusters on her shoulders and the small of her back engage with a shrill whine.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Braking and then riding on a pillar of blue plasma-fire and supercompressed air, she unlocked her weapon from her chestplate and relaxed her legs, letting the tripod jumpjets disengage at ten meters.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feeling like an technological incarnation of a mythic Kerrahi <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Uhlat</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> in her powerarmor, she scarcely felt the shock as her combat boots slammed into the foreign dirt and her body flexed like a spring inside its shell, absorbing the impact and leaping forward at a run.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;Juka Taaaiiiyyaaan!&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> She cried, feeling the elation of adrenaline and termaka. With a thought she keyed her masking field, and a prickling sensation coursed across her skin, psychosomatic feedback from the phototropic diodes covering her suit.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Another subconscious synampse triggered her suit sensors, her perceptions synthetically widened as she fought the tunnel-vision of her organic bloodlust. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Bounding forward in a half-leap, half run impossible without the agumentation of her servomuscles and pulses from her jumpjets, she sensed movement ahead.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Cutting her leap short and plummeting to earth, she narrowed her sensor perceptions just in time to see the hovertank roar over another of the peculiar grass-dunes, it's primitive sensors lashing out with modulated EM in a vain effort to locate prey.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Smirking to herself, Serra mentally checked her armors' masking, feeling the clumsy detection waves absorb into her second skin and disappear like water in a desert as she took up position next to a tree bole.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The hovertank continued to approach blindly, stirring up ripples in the blue-green grass like a boat on an ocean, even as the great dunes to either side seemed the frozen waves of a far greater ocean.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp With an expectant gesture, Serra held her empty right hand at shoulder-height. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Courteously, her armor whirred and dropped the acelleration tube of her mortar/rocket launcher weapon into her hand.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The sensation of a third eye from her target-seeker centered onto the tank and she felt the artificial pseudohunger of lock. For confirmation, the rocket sounder beeped in her ear.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Her smirk transformed to a wide grin and she mentally chambered a hypervelocity round and settled her armored finger on the firing stud...<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The tank exploded.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Alpha-four, enemy armor neutralized.&quot; Came the satisfied report as Ranag's Marauder armor appeared over the crest of a nearby hill, the arc of his jump skimming him meters above ground.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As he landed, he was almost bowled over by another tank, the boxy thing roaring over the hill opposite him and leaping the rill on it's cushion of air while the turret swung wildly about, searching for its comrades' executioner.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp With a round already loaded, it took only the flick of her finger to make up for the kill that had been denied her, and with another bright new explosion to boot.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Gratitude-and-commendation-of-action.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Ranag signalled, sending the emotion-though in binary codeburst, Kajuka to Kajuka. <br><br><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Acknowledgement-and-return-to-task.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> She replied in kind, structuring it to carry the mental tone of approval and ending it in a pattern loosely corresponding to a grin.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Unfortunately, it had cost her precious fractions of a second. Remembering Ki'Arru, her mentor-instructor, she mentally kicked herself and resumed her charge. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Clearing the tree, she leapt again, vaulting a the ridge in a perfect skimmer, the arc of her jump matching the curve of the hill and keeping her just a few lengths from the surface. She left the masker system on, though. Caution was hereditary and stupidity was not, and for a reason. She reminded herself, in the blank spaces of her battle-pscyhe.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>Suddenly, her armor seemed to yelp, and her nanoneural flinch cut her jets and dropped her to surface cleanly, agumented senses scouring the area in a controlled panic.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>There!<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>Her infra scanners locked onto the quintet of shapes half-hidden along the ridge, armored forms shoddily masked with thermo/phototropic netting and bits of foliage.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>A faint and barely recongized sadness washed through her, as she brought her neutron pulse rifle to bear. Niether challenge for her nor a chance for them to prove their ability. Mismatched though they were, she acknowledged no illusions of a fair universe. The prey on the hill was to die.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>Moving quickly but carefully, she positioned herself partially behind a large stone boulder and fired.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>Three quick bursts, twenty-one chain-fired pulses of destruction, instinctive and mechanical at once, and the grisly roar of the neutral particles shattering molecules of air and dust and armor and flesh in a series of furious fission explosions.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>As always, in awe despite her familiarity with both procedure and result, she leapt a quarter-second later, the parabolic arc of her jump calculated to pass directly above her targets. Midair, midjump, mind reeling yet coping easily, she triggered the underbarrel of her rifle, launching an armor-piercing cluster-round of explosive needles into the remnants of her enemies, converting the char of steel and flesh into a churned crater of unrecognizeable ejecta.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>But at the apogee of her jump, she was again fully Kajuka, sensors wringing data from the environment while her conscious mind directed and body acted.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>Her sensors momentarily flickered, finding a vehicle. Ground effect, transport type. Chemical similarity to targets. Landing and leaping again, she donated a high-impact plasma charge to the personell carrier and flew onward.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>Consuming vast distance with each bound, she began to feel the sense-pressure of the rest of the assault force, a tingling organic sensation that seemed to burn in her termaka marks, rather than coldly slip through her Kajuka interface. <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>So too did she seem to feel the panic and fear of her prey, for prey they were. Helpless vermin that dared disobey the only law...<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>Another of the vicious hovertanks appeared before her, cresting a ridge just as she landed in the valley below. <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>Unfortunately, it tracked her, sensors hammering before her masking could fully reengage after the jump, scouring her digital senses as she dodged aside.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>Dirt and vegetation geysered and imploded as energy weapons and hyperkinetics lanced at her, once lucky plasma pulse splattering her breastplate before she had begun her jump-dodge.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>But once in motion she felt the highest Kajuka, her Marks burning her mind and blood with the roar of battle, her interface hissing the cold data of information, and her mindsoul twisting between the two, binding the contrasts into a stereographic whole, and reaching perfection.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>She fired, without her body even bothering to inform her as will and musle and technology worked in a zenlike unison, feeling the linear acellerator cannon on her shoulder unable to twist far enough to track, as she willed herself left/away/above, thinking her rifle target, and then feeling the weapon recoil, each blast distinct, each recoil compensated by instinct and machine, a synergy of Kajuka as the particle-lances poured forth from her weapon.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>Senses expanded and focused in unison, she felt and saw and heard, each bark of the rifle, the searing thump as it impacted the joins in the polyceramic armor of the tank, the miniature fireballs as the nuclear disintegration oblitereated vast furrows of the tank's inner workings, and the stillborn death cries of the mortals within as they were incinerated before they could sense their own pain.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A detached corner of Serra's mind felt suddenly apprehensive, expectant, waiting cynically for the fading-away of her newfound power.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp But, gloriously, it did not fade. It dimmed, clarity returning to favor where bloodlust and d'harral had once held sway, but it held, and she was Kajuka.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp For ten minutes more she continued on as she had been, vaulting the furrowed land and destroying, delivering precise death to twenty-three more infantry and four hovertanks, opening her communications for miliseconds to direct her squad, feeling the flow of the battle, the tsunami that was the forces of the Law, scouring this world of the feeble ones.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It was more than a battle, more than a rout. It was vengeance, vengeance for which the Taiyan and Kerrahi were unentitled, yet who knew the price of acceptance and the ill of inaction.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp And so the jihad annihilated, sweeping away resistance with inconcievable fury, as orbital bombardment and powerarmor infantry, aerospace tacfighters and ground vehicles, and the united soul of two-and-four peoples chastised those that would defy them.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Upon that tidal wave of vengeance, Serra rode high. A wrathspirit, an <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Uhlat</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, a Juka and a Kajuka, she embodied both the deaths-head and the faceless horde.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She felt with her senses and with the senses of her second-skin, thought with her mind and with her technology.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp More prey died. Her squad neared each other, ringing the target and grinding it down as tanks and fortifications melted beneath the onslaught.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Then, gloriously, a wall of the enclave collapsed beneath a spark-fusion warhead, and the displacement shield stuttered.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp With the casual omnipotence of a god, a plasma strike from above struck the walled fortress as the spacial distortion flickered and died.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Roaring like a thousand suns and searing with blinding energy, the blue-green energy projectile smote with such force the very ground was fused, the air hardened like hammerstrikes and the grasses incinerated in concentric rings of fire.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp And then, silence. The pattering rain of debries and molten rock, and the occasional explosion of the flash-cooling magma created by the blast.<br><br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;By the gods that never were... It is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> obese!</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot; Koba whimpered, helmet open in the green-gold twilight. His ears knotted back and teeth bared at the sight of the you'man being herded into the prisoner-transport.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Serra could scarce contain her revusion either. Despite the calm saiety of slaked bloodlust and approaching night, the globular creature being shoved into the holding pen was loathesome in every way. At least two-hundred weights, she guessed it, and none of it muscle or stature. All soft flesh, like melted wax, jiggling and straining beneath the pallid skin. There were those Taiyan that could grow fat, too, but that was beneficial, allowing them uncommon efficiency on short rations. And with full feed, they at least had the self-control to maintain their health... <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The you'mans had seemed almost Taiyan in their ways at first, she remembered. Adaptive, strong, clever, even physically similar, to a far greater degree than even Korluth. Aside from smaller stature and round pupils, they could almost be Taiyan.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Thirty Jedaja spies had even infiltrated their homeworld, and learned of them undetected for twenty local years. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp And yet, to do what they had done on this planet marked them as no kin of her race. They were <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> vermin</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. Flat-eyed, flat-eared <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> prey.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp To think, the overweight creature now finally aboard the converted troopship had been a leader! But not by any worth, or even percieved right. Simply because it had decided to lead to a greener pasture. And its kin-cattle had followed.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Twenty thousand of them. Weapons and equipment and techologies of the greatest sophistication the you'mans could create. &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp For greed. For metals.

Even for such a crime as they had commited, they did not deserve extermination after their capture. &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br><br>Quite. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Rhyekki, have you found the refugees yet?&quot; She asked, turning away from the long line of evictees and staring into the night.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Yes. Twenty-nine parts. Hidden dense thicket patch. Not your jump-jets, frightening.&quot; The scout announced, the translation worse than usual due to his hushed voice.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Confirmed.&quot; Serra sighed, then broke into a trot towards the open savannah.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The thicket bush was a green hell, brambles and spines that clawed at hair and face, and rasped against her armor.  The falling darkness compounded it, making the tunnelway into a claustrophobic vegetable bowel, scraping and scratching as she burrowed deeper.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>Even her night vision was hampered, the lack of light and heat giving her only dim impressions of the tunnelway.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>Fortunately, a goodly twenty meters into the brush, she began to sense light ahead.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>Nervously, she crawled onward, toward the nest space. In preparation, she began to practice the translation matrix as she emerged from the tunnel and into the dome-shaped dwelling area.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>Shrieking in fright or suprise, two of the natives leapt away as she emerged, while several more leapt forward, levelling short spears, some with metal blades, at her.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Of all the stupid ideas...</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> She thought to herself, painfully aware that with her helmet open she was vulnerable to even such crude weapons.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>While they were only around three-fifths her height, the diminutive natives were hardly defenseless in their own territory and with blades near her throat.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Still, she was Serra'ki, Kajuka, Taiyan, warrior, D'harral steward. She had no choice but follow through.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;No hurt! No hurt! Talk!

They anger the gods!&quot; The creatures babbled, until one began to quiet them. Unlike the other natives, this one was larger, with a comb of flanged scales and intricate beaded necklaces, containing bones and rocks as well as metal deritus and trade baubels from the you'man settlement. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Diplomatically, Serra dropped to the dirt floor and sat crosslegged, trying to appear nonthreatening. &quot;Talk to you all;&quot; she announced, trained tongue following the guidance of the language program.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp With a jangling and clinking of adornments, the chief mimiced the gesture, folding it's double-kneed joints beneath it and sinking to the ground like a small reptillian Kerrah. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Indeed, where the Kerrah had risen from small-pack savannah predators, these creatures were pack scavenger-gatherers, reptilian Taiyanoids with tails, but still posessed of a primitive culture. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Which was her task now.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Who-what-why-purpose-danger?&quot; The elder interrogated immediately, clutching a bone staff with one arm as it gestured at Serra.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I am <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Serra'ki</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.

But they made their shells and learned their 'magic' on their own.&quot; She replied levelly, using a hand gesture to indicate that she conceded to his argument<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br> &quot;You do not understand. You are weakened by their magic.&quot; Serra intoned resolutely, meeting the elders' gaze and holding it.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>There were murmurs of fear from the gathered pack, and one spearhunter screamed and threw his metal-tipped weapon to the ground.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>&quot;They make you weak. If you did not have to find food, and had all the food you needed when you wanted, you would become a weak hunter. The you'mans would do the same, and more, and make you weak.&quot;<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>&quot;But how will we get their magic? You-people destroy the you'man things with fire from the sky and your own magic, and the metal-things you ride find the bones-pieces and take those away too!&quot; he asked, the translator annotating that his posture indicated strong confusion.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>She made the gesture for unavoidable-fact at the elder. &quot;Learn your own way.&quot; <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>&quot;And we will be strong like you, like the gods?&quot;<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>&quot;We are not gods and we have no gods.

Of Serra or the idea, the translator could not specify, and she turned back to the long tunnel of the greenery.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>Once outside, she could hear the rapid babbling of the native creatures, though it was too far away for the translator to render intelligible. <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Sighing to herself, she nodded her head, sliding her helmet down into place. She had done all that could be expected of her. The you'mans had broken the Law of Ascendance, polluting the ck'srai of this world with their influence and technology while stealing their inheritance. It was for a reason that the Dark Sun empire colonized only through terraforming, and no Taiyan nor Kerrahi could forget the Godbones and the Hullstones that were monument to the Law.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>Raising a small object in one gauntleted hand, Serra triggered the electromagnetic pulse bomb and faded into the night.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *<br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <br>Historical Appendix:<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp On the forty-fifth day of the fourth quarter of the year TKI 1057, a massive battlefleet consisting of one Razorfin Destroyer rigged for orbital bombardment and two Wardmatron Carriers laden with Taiyan, Kerrahi, Korluth, Gupek, and Mw'juma marines laid siege to the fledgeling human colony on Mrada Jilan B. In under a local day, the entiritey of the twenty-two-thousand person colonial population had been captured and deported or killed during the assault. It was also, despite their recovery of fragmentary evidence supporting the existance of other species, First Contact for the human race.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp All traces of human interference and technology were removed or destroyed, and the human colonists deported back to Sol system aboard fourteen drone troop transports. <br><br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp While the human government was wracked by factionalist reactions to the shock of first contact, and the ferocity of their defeat, the Dark Sun Empire celebrated. When the first communication was established between governments by the Taiyan-created human 'Jedaja' agents, the only information exchanged was that the Dark Sun had claimed Mrada Jilan system as 'ward territory,' inviolate until the maturation of its' species into an ascended race, capable of faster-than-light communication or travel.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In TKI 1062 Kajuka Stormtrooper Firstrank Serra'ki accepted the call of her lineage and left active duty to bear a Kajuka daughter and twin truebirth males.  <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp On the fifth day of the third quarter of the year TKI 1282, stealthed early warning beacons emplaced around the Oort cloud of Mrada Jilan detected two jump-out signatures from the beta LaGrange point. As per their programming, all sixteen probes self-destructed upon reciept of their message.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Two days later, Jedaja intelligence reported a combat-capable vessel of unknown configuration had razed the Human colony world of Ney Vesta. Imperial intelligence had little effort drawing a conclusion as to the origin of the attack, as Ney Vesta was one of only three planetary bodies with jump-points leading to Mrada Jilan system.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The following day, the Imperial Navy scoutship Imperceptable Change recorded jump-in of a similar vessel, which displayed a level of technical sophistication moderately in advance of Imperial development. The vessel then proceeded to hail the Imperceptible Change while the scoutship remained fully stealthed.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Spectral and metallurigical analysis confirmed that the unknown vessel had likely originated from Mrada Jilan, and Captain Ta'Shota cautiously decloaked his vessel and returned the hail.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The commander of the vessel greeted the Imperceptible Change with near awe when communications were established.  Providing similar opportunity for Ta'Shota, evidencing a suprisingly thorough knowledge of the sociologic and territorial balance of power in the area as he proposed alliegeance with the Empire on behalf of his race.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Serratti.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Incidental Listing of Taiyan Ships:<br><br>Instrument of Chaos (Flagship Destroyer)<br>Incorruptable Ideal (Destroyer)<br>Effortless Accomplishment (Destroyer)<br>Inconsequential Action (Destroyer)<br>Satiated Vengeance (Destroyer)<br>Law of Anarchy (Carrier)<br>Heresy of Innovation (Carrier)<br>Stability of Perfection (Carrier)<br>Unattainable Goal<br>Orderly Universe<br>Inherent Rights<br>Peaceful Existence<br>Irrefutable Theory<br>Nonsubjective Fact<br>Educated Guess<br>Logical Foundation<br>Hypothetical Condition<br>Friendly Fire<br>Ease of Simplicity<br>Inflexible Structure<br>Conditional Surrender<br>Inherent Stability<br>Selfless Idealist<br>Free Lunch<br>Absolute Certainty<br>Superior Substitute<br>True Equality<br>Equal Rights<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>Controlled-Fall<br>Crash-Landing<br>Near-Miss<br>Sterile-Parent<br><br><br><br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=vaarok>Vaarok</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(3/13/02 7:34:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=553.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ?</span><hr size=1> No comment?<br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uinfestedmatrix.showPublicProfile?language=EN>infestedmatrix</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(3/14/02 1:10:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=553.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ?</span><hr size=1> i read a little but i am gonna print it out and read it. <p>Everyone has an infested soul inside,The transformation is quick.
