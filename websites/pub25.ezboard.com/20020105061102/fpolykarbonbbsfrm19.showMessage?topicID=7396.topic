<br>
I draw a lot. If I'm not satisfied with a drawing, it doesn't even make it to the Art in Progress forum. If it's a good idea but a poor execution, I post it in a thread no one reads at KTFOT, or if not, I stuff it in an ever bulging folder where I keep all drawings I do. If I'm really happy with something, and I see very few errors, I post it up for help.<br>
<br>
Why is this good? Often, what I thought was wrong isn't even mentioned, and what I thought was right needed lots of work. That's the beauty of a C&amp;C board. When we think our artwork is pretty good, it gives us specific areas to work on, in that drawing and in the future.<br>
<br>
If you post a lot, I beg you to do a lot of (quality) C&amp;C work for other people. The posting activity in those forums can be very high, so long as everyone who posts chips in, at some point. If not, people complain about not getting enough replies. @_@<br>
<br>
That being said, I'm going back to a pikter I was working on. ^^ <p><img src="http://www.spikescafe.com/shellt.gif"> <a href="http://www.spikescafe.com/index.html">Sprinkles Spike</a> (Thanks to...? I don't know! Sorry!! X_X)<BR><table width=464 height=64 border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0>

And yes, if you post often, it would be nice if you critted others as well. No one is going to force you, but it would be the considerate thing to do. <p><table width=100% border=0>

I do my best to go through the ones with few replies and when I keep seeing some of the same names popping up it's a bit frustrating.  In all fairness I would like to be able to do crits for as many individuals as possible but it's hard to do so when there are (for example) four people that have posted mulitple posts with different pictures.  <br>
<br>
It's been suggested that you post one pic per forum per day ... but I can't help but wonder about someone who is posting multiple pics per day or even week.  It's important to practice and get input ... but how much time are you spending applying those tips if you are posting up that many drawings?  Are you taking the time to really look over your own work and correct mistakes BEFORE posting another pic?  <br>
<br>
Hmm ... I hope I'm not coming across too harsh but it occurs to me that the sheer volume of posts to wade through every few hours is more than I can handle.  Because I want to be fair ... and because it's so hard to do so ... I may give up on critting again.  It's just too hard to keep up.<br>

It seems to me that even under those circumstances you could still stage them out instead of posting them all at once.  No matter though (and this is just the way I am) I still do not want to crit more than one drawing for you/anyone per day because there are other people that want crits as well, and though they may have the means to post they may not post that often.  Would it be fair to that person to have their post bumped and possibly overlooked because someone else for what ever reason posted more than one pic?<br>

<br>
staging out the pics also has its downside....even at one per day, people will get annoyed, thinking that that person didn't put much much consideration in their pics, as you also mentioned. spreading it out much father than that results in massive delay of much needed comments on a pic, given that the pic has been drawn a week before. <p><a href=http://darkreaver.freeservers.com> <img src="http://liquid2k.com/darkreaver/images/bannner.jpg" BORDER=0> </a>

It's unfortunate when someone has to deal with these kinds of circumstances.  I'm not trying to knock you or anyone else ... just merely tossing my frustrations out for all to see.  There are people that have post a couple of pics a day everyday for a while ... and there are people that post a new pic every day and they aren't dealing with any kind of circumstance and that is where the real problem is for me.<br>
<br>
Someone asked Spike the other day why he gets so many replies to his pic posts.  The answer is simple ... it's obvious that he really takes the time to consider the comments that are posted.  He doesn't post and get a crit only to come back say thanks and post up another drawing for crit.  He responds back and takes the time to try and apply suggestions.  Yes, his threads get a lot of replies, but a lot of those replies are his own and many are people that go back to see the progress.  It's not that everyone on the board is going to see his pic thread because (as asked) he's a mod.  <br>
<br>
I think anyone who with the same attitude would get just as many replies.  I can think of a few others that get a lot of replies for the exact same reason.  They post one pic and stick with it until there's nothing left they can really change or that needs fixing. <p><br><br><p align=center><a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/uanyte.showPublicProfile?language=EN"><font color=red><b><i>Read my profile </b></a><font size=1>and find out what kind of top secret stuff I've been up to.

X) I have a lot of respect for people that do that, and (I'm not gonna mention names) I always try to take time out to crit people that do do that. It's nice to see art work it's way from a flawed sketch, to a much better, &quot;correct&quot; sketch, to lineart, to better lineart, to a really sweet colour work. I think that was the original intention of the crit forums, helping people get their work looking as good as possible, and I also think it's the fastest and most effective way to improve (ie, keep plugging at it over &amp; over till it looks perfect; then, when you go to draw another from scratch, you won't make even half the mistakes you made in the last one)<br>
<br>
As for the posting it all in one thread: I dunno, I personally don't like critting more than two pics per thread, 'cos you feel obligaed to crit all the pics in the thread, and therefore they would be less in depth. Heehee, I don't have all day....XD I'd select the two pics you're having the most difficulty with, and post just them, stating a preference in the thread as to which one has priority, so if we don't have much time, we can just crit the one. :) Not that I'm knocking putting a few images in one thread, but it is kinda hard to point out all the stuff that's wrong with 4 or so images, and the chances are you've made similar mistakes on all of them anyway. You might as well post just post one or two, see what's wrong withit, fix it, and then draw another pic (bearing in mind the problems of the last one) and post THAT for crit, so you can progress. <p><a href="http://www.buttonpusher.net/kindamanga">KINDAMANGA!</a> <BR>

This is not to say I won't crit newbies, but I have a tendency to ignore threads where it's obvious that almost no work went into the drawing. If they're not serious about their artwork, they probably aren't serious about wanting to improve.<br>
<br>
But, I, personally, don't really see the point of posting something that is far below what you're capable of. It's only on our best work that comments can help us avoid a mistake we didn't think we were making. <p><img src="http://www.spikescafe.com/shellt.gif"> <a href="http://www.spikescafe.com/index.html">Sprinkles Spike</a> (Thanks to...?

but i think its good to post a lot of work, because as a developing artist it helps me to catch MORE of my mistakes before i develop a habit of them <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uanyte.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Anyte</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(12/9/01 4:44:39 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://liquid2k.com/anyte/photos/snap22.jpg width=120 length=195></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: question regarding the art forums</span><hr size=1> So .. you think it's good to post a lot of drawings with the same mistakes so you can be told over and over of the same mistake ... instead of doing only one drawing and working on correcting the mistake with that drawing before attempting to do another drawing??<br>

wow, i worded it pretty bad in my last post<br>
<br>
well, what i mean is that i think its good to post a picture of a character, draw it over a few (mabye 5 to 10) times after incorporating the crits recieved, and then compare the two drawings to see if youve improved in your problem areas<br>
then, if you know whats wrong from previous comments, you dont need to post it at all.  But, if theres something you still cant get right, i think you should post and ask for specific help in that area.<br>
<br>
also, if you are drawing different aspects like one pic of the female body, another of some male character in an action pose, and another of a mech, then i would post all three.  you will get specific crits (hopefully) that will be different and helpful for these different areas.<br>
<br>
am i making any sense?<br>
i am working on a lot of different aspects right now such as folds, anatomy, hands, backgrounds, shading, and faces... so i will post different drawings that have problems in those areas... not a great quantity, but my fair share<br>
<br>
i also am glad to see a lot of people asking for criticisms.  i am glad to take 5 min to help somebody... if someone's serious and wanting to improve, i dont mind doing a few critiques for em <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showMessage?topicID=7383.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showMessage?topicID=7369.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.emailToFriend?topicID=7396.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.threadControl?topicID=7396.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=7396.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=7396.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub25.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="polykarbonbbsfrm18">PK-BBS Rules and Regulations!<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm3">News and Updates<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm2">Photoshop and Art questions<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm4">General Manga/Anime Discussion<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm5">Japanese Language Help<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm23">art in progress<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm13">Black and White Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm14">Color Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm19">Member's Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm17">Moderators Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm6">Member Photos<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm22">How to use Fight Club<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm20">Challenges<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm21">Matches<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm25">Pose Forum<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm26">Writer's Forum<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm27">Board F.A.Q.s</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#336699>- </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs>Polykarbon BBS</a><font color=#336699> - </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19>Member's Lounge</a> <font color=#336699> - </font><a href="http://www.polykarbon.com">Polykarbon: Manga & Photoshop</a><font color=#336699> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.4 b8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
