   I was an arse.  Complete, total and unoquivical arse.  To anyone and everyone, I hope that your feelings were not hurt because of my demeanor.  Further, it was not my intent to hurt feelings at all.  If yours were then you do have my apologies.  That feeling is not fun and is something that I will always apologise for.<br>
<br>
<br>
   How was I an arse?  In the drill-seargent manor.  Heh, mah friends, whenever we do this type of raid, there is always a big turnout.  I insist upon it.  If we do not have an uber turnout then I cold-call till we have one.  Heh, this one was a little too big of a turnout.  How do you handle such a large number of people?  Militarily.  There is no other way.  No, I do not display a sense of humor.  Yes, I seem to ignore tells (in truth, they got lost in the flood of other communiques).  Yes, I scream at people, and yes I do call you out by name in front of everyone else.  The alternative?  We get killed more.<br>
   There is a reason for &quot;the wall&quot; and a reason I act that way.  If we had the luxury of having a physical wall just like Verant put in for the Arena with the big door that no one can float over, then I would not be an arse.  Why?  Because &quot;the wall&quot; would be physical instead of virtual.  As it is, &quot;the wall&quot; is nothing more than Alzuun's pet and Alzuun's voice.  Those who attended know it, anyone else reading this post here's what it is: mine is the only pet allowed in the zone-in portion of the raid.  Everyone must stay behind it.  The pet is positioned right at the very corner of the wall and I get massively anal at making sure he is exactly in line with that wall.  Then I /shout, /ooc, /tell, and /plead for every person other than: the chanters, main tank (and he, only when it's fight time and only for a short while), the pullers, and the &quot;cc paladin&quot; (and he only when it becomes necessary) to stay behind me and that, single pet.<br>
<br>
  Then the deck system works.<br>
<br>
   If you do not have that then we get wiped out.  Case in point: three times we were totally wiped out Saturday night.  We never got wiped out the time-before last and the last time it only happened once, the time,time before last it happened once (but we weren't using the deck system and all got wiped out at zone-in per design).<br>
   Why did we get wiped out three times Sat. night?  Because when the pullers pulled, we had a big train (no big deal).  The ones who are exposed ON the deck got wiped out (believe it or not, no big deal.  that's by design).  Then there were people on the deck who shouldn't have been, the mobs came around the corner to attack them and saw everyone else hiding behind &quot;the wall&quot; (big deal.  it's why we were wiped out).<br>
<br>
   Later my demeanor changed (as evidenced by an uber rare event: Alz singing country music).  That was because people started listening.  I don't like to shout.  I did it way,way more than I had to and no, it wasn't because of the sheer numbers.  It was because people weren't listening.  When people did listen, I shouted no more, we killed Maestro in RECORD TIME --seriously, I would put that stat up against the UBEREST of guilds because we dropped dat piano-playin freak FAST--, y'all repeated our sell-out performance to the hand and everyone walked away with more friends.<br>
<br>
   The sad part to my story: Scrat.  He and others got their feathers ruffled from my demeanor.  I can count at least 5 who truly were offended by me that night.  Scrat was the biggest loss.  <br>
   Those of you who know me know that the worst possible thing to me is getting bad press for my guild.  Scrat leaving was just that...but I don't care a thing about the bad press.  I hate that he left.<br>
   I kept a log that night.  I don't want to devulge the amount of times I asked, begged and then warned him to obey the rules.  I will devulge them if I have to, but please: it's painful enough as it is.  I say to you all that he left and I was the cause of it.  If you need more information, please ask me in game (general thoughts/comments about my demeanor, please post here).<br>
<br>
   So now you know who/what/and why.  In the case(s) of questions as to, &quot;ok, who is this and what has he done with Alz&quot; now you know.  In the case(s) of people who got their feelings hurt, you do have my apologies.<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
<br>

I was not at the raid this week (I cannot play on Saturday<br>
nights due to real-life).  So, I cannot comment on this<br>
most-recent raid.<br>
<br>
But, I will comment on Alz's &quot;wall&quot; performance from the other<br>
raids I have been with him.<br>
<br>
<br>
He isn't strict enough.<br>
<br>
<br>
In several of the raids, I have seen people over the line, and<br>
I personally had to tell them to step back.  And, I had to<br>
repeat this several times.  And, to top this off, for the most<br>
part, when this did happen, we did not stop the pulls (but<br>
that is partly my fault too - I should have stopped the pulls<br>
once this happened).<br>
<br>
I remember my first Hate raid when we were guests of VE.<br>
They ran a very tight show.  They stopped pulls whenever<br>
the crowd went over the line.  They gave 10 minute long<br>
speeches on the line.  That took a lot of guts for them to<br>
do, and I applaud it.<br>
<br>
Remeber why we are so strict - there are 35-50 people<br>
up in Hate when we raid.  The acts of 1 or 2 of those people<br>
can cost hours of corpse-retrieval time for the rest of the<br>
group.  Those are fairly severe consequences, and demand<br>
accountability for individual action.<br>
<br>
<br>
So, keep it up bro, and become a bigger bastard.  While<br>
it may ruffle a few feathers, in the end that discipline will<br>
result in more overall accomplishment and more overall<br>
goodwill towards our guild than continual wipeouts ever<br>
will.<br>

I was one who left the raid...NOT due to Al or lozers demeanor...But due to the demeanor of those jumping in my tells griping....<br>
If you notice those in charge are yelling....nagging...whatever perhaps you should check yourself be sure you are not part of the problem if so then correct it and watch wait for things to calm.dont assume you are not part of the problem checkyourslef first then check others around you i know i wanst the problem i checked myself durring each shout and when i found myself near a bad spot i moved yes at times i was stuck on say an ogre or barb i simply waited till they moved i stayed in the center of the croud and yes heh it sucked cause i was usually standing right in the fight trying to keep my target on an ench.and watching my groups bars...<br>
folks dont send people tells with complaints try to solve the problem by making sure you are correct if we all keep ourselves in check then there wont be such problems.yes it was small and tight and yes tough to fight like that but if your told to move find a way to move <br>
we are a team can't be a team if we all do as we please not following protocall<br>
there im done lol<br>

<br>
I wanted to let Alzuun know that while I don't know what happened in great detail. I personally don't feel you owe an apology for your actions. The whole time I felt you were completely professional. I also felt that the raid as a whole was well planned and organized. From the forming of groups, to the debriefing of raiding classes. <br>
<br>
The guild's instructions on what to do was quite simple and clear. If anything it has made me realize more that I am glad to be part of CDO. I too believe that this game can be both well organized and fun, and you proven that to me this past weekend. <br>
