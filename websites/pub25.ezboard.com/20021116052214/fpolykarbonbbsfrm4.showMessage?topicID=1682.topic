When he transformed he looked more and more masculine and strong. His English voice was done by a woman for some reason, but his original voice wasn't. And Zarbon was the only other that looked even slightly androgenous, and not even that much. He had long hair, and that's about it.<br>
<br>
Magus? He just had long hair, and the characters are tiny sprites made of a limited amount of pixels. If you ever saw an actual, drawn picture of him, you wouldn't mistake him for one. But as a young kid, since it's before puberty, males and females look basically the same anyway, and the long hair just makes him look more feminine. But then, if you've played that game, you should know Magus turned out not to be the villain anyway. Flee said he was male, though obviously he didn't appear as one. He wasn't human anyway, so I guess he can appear as he wishes.<br>
<br>
Not too familiar with Sailor Moon, but I do know they do that a lot.<br>
<br>
Kefka doesn't look that androgenous from the pictures I've seen. He wears makeup, but he looks more like an insane clown than he does androgenous.<br>
<br>
Now WHY the people that made the characters made them that way, I dunno. I don't live in Japan, and I'm not familiar enough with what it's like there to really even guess as to why they'd do that. <p><table width=100% border=0>

Actually, I wouldn't mind seeing more female villains. You don't see that too often at all. The only one I can think of that is fairly recent is the vampire woman in VHD:BL. She was pretty bad ass. I wouldn't mind playing the role of a female in an RPG either. The only RPG's that I have seen recently that star women aren't my type of game. They're the Baulders Gate-esque games where you can choose from a man and woman, and just don't appeal to me. The last game that did was Valkrye Profile. Maybe they should give FFXII a twist and have you as the role of a female. That would spice things up a bit. Well, anyways, no, I'm not sexist if that's what you're implying.

I don't remember his name. I'm not quite sure what you're confused about here.  You are talking about villains and androgeny. One of those villains that I am not fond of is the particular &quot;Bad Guy&quot; in IX. No, the fact that he looks female does not make him any less evil. However, in my mind, it dulls the fact that he is so evil when I'm more distracted at why he looks like a woman, rather than a man, when he is infact a man. I'm not saying that the fact that he looks like a woman means that I don't think woman can be evil. I am saying that I don't find men who look like women, in IX's case, to be the best choice of the main villain. When ever he performs an act of evil, I'm not thinking &quot;oh man, that guy must be really mean.&quot; I'm thinking &quot;man, that is a man, who looks like a female.&quot; As for flea in Chrono Trigger (and Cross if you count his one battle cameo), I am not sure about what's going on there but since he was not in the game long enough for me to notice or care if he was a female or not, it wasn't a problem for me. As for magus, he had long hair, but I didn't find him to be femanine at all. Freiza looked like a woman in his first form, and even had a femal voice actor in America atleast (don't know about japan), so I really did think that it was a she for a while. The other henchman of his, Zarbon I think, also looked like a female for four reasons. He had long, well kept hair. He had a headband tiarra thing. He had two earings. And lastly he had arm covers, that look very femanine. Then he transformed though, so it wasn't a problem. Freiza transformed, so that wasn't a problem. However, the guy in FFIX did not transform, and remained a thong toting, long haired, female-esque man who seems more worried about his sex-appeal than causing hate and discontent. I've rambled long enough, and have no ending statement to summarize what I've said. I have no underlying point, but am trying to clarify as much as possible on what my opinion is on things, no matter how highly you might hold it. Well, I'm out.

And you need to get some glasses if you ever considered Zarbon a woman. His voice is masculine, and he's very muscular. He looks nothing like a woman, even with long hair and earrings. <p><table width=100% border=0>

Yes you did.<br>
<br>
And I didn't say you were fixated on a villain, just on the way they dressed. <p><table width=100% border=0>

Zarbon looked like a male for four reasons, but looked like a man for three. He looked like a female because blah blah blah blah. He looked like a male because he had a very muscular build, a males voice, and did not posses breasts. Yes I am fixated on how they dress, but also how they look and appear, and the only one I am fixated on is Kuja. I just used broad terms to generalize his type. Maybe to have made it more clear, is should say &quot;I don't like the one crossdressing villain&quot; rather than &quot;I don't like crossdressing villains&quot;, but if another one were to arise, I most likely wouldn't like him. It's my personal prefrence.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4.showPrevMessage?topicID=1682.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4.showNextMessage?topicID=1682.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1682.topic&index=16><img src=http://www.polykarbon.com/bbsimage/addreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4.emailToFriend?topicID=1682.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4.threadControl?topicID=1682.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1682.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1682.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub25.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="polykarbonbbsfrm18">PK-BBS Rules and Regulations!<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm27">Board F.A.Q.s<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm3">News and Updates<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm2">Photoshop and Art questions<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm4">General Manga/Anime Discussion<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm5">Japanese Language Help<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm23">art in progress<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm13">Black and White Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm14">Color Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm19">Member's Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm17">Moderators Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm6">Member Photos<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm31">Help, Hints and Cheats<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm20">Challenges<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm21">Matches<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm26">Writer's Forum<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm32">VG Discussion<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm33">PolyKarbon CCG<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm35">Member Created Tutorials<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm36">Best Tutorials</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#336699>- </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs>Polykarbon BBS</a><font color=#336699> - </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4>General Manga/Anime Discussion</a> <font color=#336699> - </font><a href="http://www.polykarbon.com">Polykarbon: Manga & Photoshop</a><font color=#336699> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM ARTS AD SCRIPT -->
