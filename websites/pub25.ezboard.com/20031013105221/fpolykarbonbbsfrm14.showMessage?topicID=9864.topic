To explain, look at the lips; the undershadow is extremely strong and makes the lips seem to float. Now this isn't actually a problem when everything is the pic is high contrast lighting, but in this case it's not (the hair is evenly lighted and some other things arn't quite lit properly). My suggestion would be to go back and darken everything a lot that isn't being hit by light directly, or un darken those things that are dark. <br>
<br>
Also I'd remove that secondary lighting on the jaw line, or go and apply it to everything else as well. <br>
<br>
It's a nice piece of coloring, but has problems. <br>

The crit I would offer has to do with the hair... I think that the way you have the part done and the top edge of the hair- it's just too much, too high... the skull is too high.  <br>
<br>
Right now the part is like a hand of a clock at 12:15... I think if it was more like 2:00 or 2:30...and if the hair that is in shadow ended only about 1/3 of the way into that shadow... (meanng you could cut off 2/3 of the shaded part of the hair and not really miss it) I think it would be a more natural volume.  I think right now the hair is overbalancing the facial features.<br>
<br>
I feel bad to pick on the hair becuse it looks like you spent a lot of time rendering it, but maybe you could just try a new layer with it blocked out-- just to see.<br>
<br>
Another thing that you might want to change that would not take a lot of reworking- the shadow- it's laying over the scene like a frame mat- but if that light is coming in through a square window- it is going to hit your subject at a different moment than the wall in the background.  I think that the wall down the left edge could be all dark-(the shadow edge should be obscured from our view by the subject) and the shadow behind the head could be dropped down a little so it's not at the same line as the shadow in the hair (which you might consider bending- and also breaking up along the lower edge- like wrapping over the shoulder)<br>
<br>
I really love the color of the eyes you captured blue eyes in glaring sun just so amazingly well- really neat! It's really meloncholy.... I am so curious about what your seris is about!<br>
<br>
<br>
Do you mind if I ask you what kind of tools you used when you made this piece?  i am very new to computer art stuff and I don't know how these effects are worked.<br>

You're all right! I'll correct all those &quot;details&quot; you saw.<br>

MightyQuest: I didn't do the shadow on the collarbone because I saw my own collarbone and I discovered the shadows shouldn't be that strong in there. Maybe I applied some &quot;weak&quot; one. The eyes? Hum... If I add more shadow on the eyes it would seem like an alien, haha.<br>

I agree with the comments about the darkness under the lips and nose.  And those two clumped hair pieces to the right of the face don't seem to as realistic as the rest of the hair.  Perhaps they don't follow gravity as well?  I dunno.  It's most likely just me.

Your hair is very detailed, lots of strands, even the little sticky outy kinds...which is super-cool, except the rest of the image sems to be done in a softer, fuzzier bent. If you're trying to make this conceptually realistic, as if it were almost done photographically, you'd never find those together....portraits are usually done either soft or sharp, not both. To fix it, I'd recommend something akin to a really soft blur (soft=not a whole lot, just a little) on the hair, so that you can still see how gloriously it was done, but not quite so sharply. Otherwise, if you were to sharpen everything to go with the hair, you'd want to show any wrinkles and lines in the skin. Right now there's a hint of that about the mouth, but if you sharpen it you'd need all those natural lines, like in the forehead, slightly sharper smile lines (and probably the dip between nose and mouth somewhat), that sort of thing. Overall though, it looks smashing. I'm excited to see the next installment!<br>

P.S. A good example of soft photography would be to find some photos of Marylin Monroe (sp?)...I noticed the other day that she had very very soft photos taken of her....it was quite cool, they look like paintings. :) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mightyquest>MightyQUEST</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.s-a-w-s.com/quest/realm/triforce2.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(8/21/03 10:11 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm14.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=9864.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.s-a-w-s.com/quest/[Q]logo.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re:</span><hr size=1> About the detail, softness level.<br>

The hair is fantastic.  With a few little minor it qualifies as pq. <br>
<br>
Here are my two cents;<br>
1)Define the neck, it could use some musculature.  i know women don't have adam's apples, but you might want to play with the shading to get rid of the cylindrical look (The neck is actually triangular rather than round).<br>
<br>
2)Fill out her right cheek a smidge (that's a very technical term I know).  The jaw &quot;V&quot; should give way to the cheek ridge instead of making a straight line for the outside of the eye.  Also, give the cheeks some shading, that will help too. <br>
<br>
3)The shadows under the nose and bottom lip shouldn't be as dark as the ones for the jaw, take these down a few notches so they don't look so sunk-in. <br>
<br>
4)Give the left side of the jaw some more shape, there are no such things as straight lines <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  The jaw just loses it's definition when it's that straight. <br>
<br>
That's all I've got, great work!<br>
