Endlessly pressing buttons, hardwired into the chair, it didn't notice as the door slid open behind it. It didn't even notice as the pulsing beam of energy neatly bisected it. The black-clad warrior pushed the scrap away as he started to reprogram the consoles. Within moments chaos erupted in the spaceport as the automated security systems relentlessly gunned down civilians. Laughing with delight, the mysterious assassin tracked gunfire across the latest ship to enter Martian space - a sleek military cruiser. Then, his mission complete, he ripped a tooth out of his jaw. His laughter echoed around the empty room as the disguised micro-neutron bomb detonated, tearing the top of the control tower free, obliterating both him and three square kilometers of spaceport.<br>
----------------------<br>
The ship shook as the defence system struggled to transfer the power running through the hull. Suddenly the turbulence stopped. 'Hull power transfer complete' spoke a soulless, mechanical voice from the bulkheads. 'Initialising self repair circuits'.  The passenger hold gradually grew back to normal, the fires were extinguished and the smoke was vented. 'Well,' now the voice was female, and human, 'looks like we're here. I'm setting us down'. The pilot turned around in her chair. 'Kale, are you sure Miss Reine said here? There's nothing but scrap!'<br>
<br>
(Krein Halcyon? Hmm, I wonder where I've heard that one before! I like the attempt at disguising the lightsabre, though.

She stood in front of the doors she had come out of for some time, tapping the barrel of her shotgun against her thigh, contemplating the situation.<br>
<br>
The sudden disapearence of such a large city, let alone the Martian capitol was simply unheard of. She had best send down a crew to investigate, but who out of this mess of soilders should be sent?Caron thought for a moment. Of course! She had the identity numbers of all those on board in a small managing device(PDA) and with a quick push of a button, 3 randomly numbers would pop up, and thus the solution of who would go would be solved.<br>
<br>
&quot;Listen up men!&quot;she shouted suddenly. A few heads turned in her direction.<br>
&quot;I am your supperior and therefore you are obligated to follow my commands. All who do not follow this shall be disposed of immediatly!&quot;Once more, few payed attention.<br>
<br>
Being in no mood to put up with these soilders, she fired a loud shot into the ceiling, which left a nice smoking hole. Everyone's attention was on Miss Reine.<br>
&quot;It seems you finally figured out who is in charge! Now, 3 ID numbers will be chosed at random. Those 3 will then investigate a site,&quot;she pressed the button on her PDA.<br>
&quot;The first number is 875! The next is 464!The final number is...&quot;Caron's face dropped. The number, 341 was her own. Caron bit her lip. This was not supposed to happen! <br>
&quot;The last number is 341,&quot;She turned away, her back to the crew. She had gotten out of many similar situations but this she could not find a loophole in. She had already sent the data to headquarters and if she would back out, who knows what charges they might press!<br>
<br>
She turned back to the crew. &quot;If your number matches up to the one's called, you are to meet by this door within 2 hours, fully equiped! That is all!&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=neoangel>NeoAngel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(5/25/02 12:20:16 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=626.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Re:Angel+ByTheGun RPG</span><hr size=1> '875?' said Zak.

He stood up from where he was lying, drew both his swords and, with a flick of his wrists, sent energy humming through the blades. With another practiced motion he shut them off, sheathed them and hefted his pack. From it he pulled out a small case. 'Just a little insurance' he muttered as he opened it. Satisfied with what lay inside, he clicked it closed again and slid it into his pack once more. Shuddering as the glandular hypoinjectors inplanted under his skin filled him with adrenaline and a cocktail of drugs cooked up to combat his madness, he raced towards the door.<br>
----------<br>
<br>
Down in the ruins of the city, a small group of people moved through the streets. Each one was masked and wearing black, and carrying a hi-voltage energy rifle. Moving like black shadows of death, they ghosted towards the sleek, gleaming lines of the only ship to have survived the cataclysm...<br>

In almost complete unison, they raised their energy rifles and aimed. As the door slid open, they emptied their clips into the hatchway, then lowered the rifles and walked away. All of a sudden, one collapsed facedown in the dirt. As another leaned over his body, a rifle spoke again from the airlock, the armour piercing shell punching straight through the assassin and dropping him lifeless to the floor. Zak leaped out of the hatchway, drawing his blades as he went, and with a single smooth motion tore the throat out of another black-clad figure. <p>'It's better to light a candle than curse the darkness, and better than both to remain unseen.'- NeoAngel. .................

&quot;I am not a martian.&quot; the figure spoke. The sound of more assasins could be heard marching down the streets. Zak looked up.  There was a pause, the air began blowing fast.  everything was quiet.  He looked at the man, to see him reveal a large, gatling gun, with a laser sight.  All in one motion, the strange man whipped around and pulled down the trigger, sending out explosion tip bullets.  The bullets flung threw the still air and into the bodies of the assasins.  The shells popped in their bodies, shuting down their lungs, and made them take their last breaths.  The figure whipped back around and took a step forward.  <br>
&quot;I am Infestedmatrix, here to help on your journey&quot;<br>
He was a tall man, wearing a black tactical suit, with a black long trench jacket.  <br>

All of the armored men ran to the airlock, guns in hand.  Matrix, pulled his large gun, ready for battle.  There was another explosion, the airlock door was swept away into the rain of bullets.  The area was now open for all sorts of fire.  Bullets flew into the hold,  the men ran for cover.  Running to the side walls, for protection from the firepower.

He reached down and pulled a small, marble like object off his belt.  He regarded it for a moment, then tossed it into the crowd of assasins. <br>

Something had to be done.  Infested turned from the side wall, aiming his large gun into the crowd.  While holding the trigger, bullets ripped threw a few of the masked bodies.  There is no time to waste, he said calmly to himself, as he took out a small, computer-like gadget.  Typeing a few buttons, a large blue bubble, began streching around the ship.  <br>
&quot;Everything that comes threw will be in slow motion, and easy to take out.,&quot; he yelled.<br>
Right after that an assasin walked threw, and was slowed down.  The men fired upon him, and quickley dropped his slow-motin body to the ground. <p>Everyone has an infested soul inside.

His blacc-clad cronies slowly broke the motion field around the ship, and resumed their firing. Three of them stepped around a corner, coming face to face with Decker and Caron. Raising their rifles, they squeezed the triggers...<br>
In a blinding blur, Zak was stood before them, his whirling blades throwing crackling energy into the bulkheads of the ship whenever they met each other or a bullet. The assassins slowly backed off as they saw the spatters of molten metal that were once armour-piercing rifle rounds land at his feet. He leaped forwards, his shorter blade seeking the throat of the lead assassin, his longer sword driving the other two together with a series of flickering feints. As the first corpse dropped to the ground, he finished the other two off with a deceptively slow slash that dropped to waist height as his wakizashi met the skull of the final remaining thug. Lifting his face skywards, he let out a long howl and shuddered as the adrenaline boosters over his adrenal glands quadrupled his power, his face flushing as the oxygen gland located in his throat increased the oxygen supply of his blood. With barely even a look backwards, the psychotic swordsman dashed off, his weapons thirsty for the blood of more victims. <p>'It's better to light a candle than curse the darkness, and better than both to remain unseen.'- NeoAngel. .................

We've got these guys on the run.&quot; yelled Decker to his men.  &quot;Lets hunt them down and make them pay for the damage to our ship.&quot;<br>
<br>
Decker opened the armor storage closet and began tossing Assault shields to his men.  He took one up himself and slowly began marching down the passageway and out the hatch, firing at anyone who got close from behind the safety of his shield.  <br>
<br>
The rest of the men followed suit, marching in rows of four out the door and into the heart of the battle.  The ranks of assasins began gradually dissipating, and they began to retreat.<br>
<br>
Soon the area was clear, leaving the men to awe at the destruction of their ship, and wonder what wasteland Caron had dropped them on.<br>
<br>
&quot;Alright, everyone...listen up!&quot; The chief gathered his men's attention.  Caron watched from just inside the ship, leaning against the hull with her arms crossed.  <br>
<br>
&quot;As this was our first battle,&quot; he continued, &quot;I'll now apoint my commanding officers.  Caron, as you all know will be my advisor and second in command.&quot; A few disgruntled sighs went up from around the group.  &quot;Don't worry, I'll teach her to use her weapon before our next encounter with the enemy.&quot;<br>
<br>
A tired laugh came from his left side, &quot;You'd better, I may not be able to block those bullets next time!&quot;  Zak bent down, resting his hands on his knees.<br>
<br>
&quot;Which brings me to my next officer, Zak will act as my covert opperations commander.  We all saw him prove himself during the course of this, hell...he saved most of our lives.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Krein, with the kind of weaponry you carry, I want you at cheif engineer.&quot; he moved towards the young human as he began to protest. &quot;Look, I know this isn't your area of specialty, but the engines of this ship are hyraclion, just like your swords.  Get a group together and fix our ride fixed up.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Zorbus, I know your still uneasy about this mission, but I'd like you to be my psyonic weapons and defence chief.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The rest of you, break up into your command groups and get to work!&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ubythegun.showPublicProfile?language=EN>By the Gun</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pre-Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(6/10/02 2:37:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=626.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://liquid2k.com/nitetimehero/shotgun.gif height=160 width=130></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Re:Angel+ByTheGun RPG</span><hr size=1> OOC:  Hey Gothic Chaos!  I always love playing with your characters, I wrote with you in the last RPG, I used the character known as Night, the one who first wanted to kill your character. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
The repairs had just begun when Decker called Zak to his side.  &quot;I'd like you to take a few men and go after our attackers.  Gather any information you can...chances are they know something about this new trouble.  Report back within 24 hours...and try not to draw too much attention.&quot;<br>
<br>
As Zak hurried off to gather his supplies and men, Decker stepped backwards, turning towards the ship, almost running Caron over.  &quot;Oh, hello...&quot; he looked her over.  Overall, she seemed to have escaped the battle unharmed.<br>
<br>
Misunderstanding his look, she turned bright red.  &quot;Just who do you think you are.  First you call me YOUR underling and then YOU decide the groups...HA!  And now I catch you checking me out!&quot;<br>
<br>
A few chuckles came from the repair group.  Decker made a half hearted attempt to ignore them.  &quot;Look, my decisions were based on kills, how many kills did you have princess?&quot;<br>
<br>
He looked over to where Matrix sat alone.  &quot;Matrix, Caron and I will see you in her cabin now.  We need to discuss why it is your here!&quot;  He moved towards the hatch.<br>
<br>
&quot;Wait...whatdya mean my cabin!  That's my private living space....I'll...&quot; she trailed off, following the two men. <br>

The room was a mess ,chairs were turned over, the desk was covered in paper, and spilled ink.  Matrix raised his right hand over the chair, without touching it, it slowly rose off of the ground.  He grabbed it and put it in correct position.  Calmly sitting in it he glanced at the other two, as thier faces drew a blank.<br>
&quot;Who is really in char...?&quot;<br>

He was already in his arena gear, the touch of the stealth suit against his skin bringing back memories. A large, bright place, where Trogian scientists did unthinkable things inside his body... it was as though a steel door had slammed on the memories, and he thought no more of them. Belted at his waist were a pair of wakizashis, a larger katana slung over his back. He shrugged the leather bands into a more comfortable position, before checking his pouch. It was fully loaded with smoke and gas charges, each pill-sized bomb capable of giving out enough cyanide gas to drop an elephant.<br>
'And now, the piece de resistance' he muttered, as he slid a syringe into the covered metallic port in his neck, replenishing the drugs that kept him alive. Under his skin, the glandular implants clicked and whirred as they accepted this new dose of life.<br>
Turning, he shouldered the pack full of demolition charges and supplies, and addressed his men. 'OK, people. This is gonna get tricky. We don't know who or what is out there. I want each man to remain in constant communication, both with the rest of the squad and with the ship. I know they're jamming our comms, which is why I smuggled aboard those highly illegal narrow-beam radios you're holding. Remember, none of you have seen ANYTHING, those things could land my ass in real trouble if we go out of the ruins.'<br>
He spun towards the door with a cry of 'Lets move out!'. <br>
<br>
-----<br>
Meanwhile, in the depths of the ruins, a group of black-clad figures manhandled something out of the darkness in the wreckage of the Terran embassy. <p>'It's better to light a candle than curse the darkness, and better than both to remain unseen.'- NeoAngel. .................

<br>
Carron began picking up her things as Kale entered the room.  &quot;My lady, everything is moving along as the commander ordered.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Excellent!&quot; she looked pleased that someone was finally giving her attention.  However that quickly faded as Kale began talking with Decker and Matrix.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey, lughead!  Make yourself useful and get this room cleaned up!&quot;  she puffed up with her arms crossed as she moved to Decker's side. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ubythegun.showPublicProfile?language=EN>By the Gun</A> at: 6/13/02 2:02:44 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uinfestedmatrix.showPublicProfile?language=EN>infestedmatrix</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(6/14/02 2:11:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=626.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Re:Angel+ByTheGun RPG</span><hr size=1> &quot;I was sent to look for &quot;the chosen,&quot; matrix said, looking at Decker and Kale.  &quot;If you will take me on board that is.&quot; <p>Everyone has an infested soul inside.
