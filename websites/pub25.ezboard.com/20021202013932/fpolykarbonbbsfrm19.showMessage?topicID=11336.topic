<br>
Interestingly enough, I'm a bit interested, but the fact that there are so many blanks for you to fill with your request, along with the fact that this isn't a professional environment, leads some people to be skeptical. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=terminalspiritdisease@polykarbonbbs>Terminal Spirit Disease</A> at: 10/23/02 8:59:29 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=chikin>Chikin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(10/24/02 7:44:17 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11336.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://homepage.ntlworld.com/spoonofdoom/dogtopus.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: !</span><hr size=1> Also, if this is a serious project, you'd probably be better off asking artists personally rather than having it open. That way you know what you're gonna get, and the artists may even feel honoured that you asked them, which is a step in the right direction. Also you can include more details, like what exactly oyou want them to do. XD From your description I have no idea what would be expected of me; how can I be interested if i don't know what the project is? (this isn't a dig, btw. :D) Tell us what the project IS (online manga? Offline manga? Computer game art? Advertisements? Pinups? Character design?), in what vein (fantasy? Scifi? Slice-of-life?), how much work there is (one pic? Several? 4 years work?), what YOU are going to be doing and at least a basic description of what this awesome idea is. And asking us to send you examples of our work? The majority of use either have art up here right now on this board, or have a website on which our work is exhibited. You go look, and get back to who you like. 'cos you want OUR help, right?<br>
<br>
But yeah, like TSD said, we get a couple of posts a month exactly the same as yours. We've become jaded cynics, and I reckon artists on other boards have had this before too; so try and stand out. Actually make it happen rather than waving your arms about. ;) <p>&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;<br>

Thanks for the CONSTRUCTIVE criticism.  I apologize not to the individuals, but to the board for the &quot;jokers&quot; comment.  I just feel strongly about this idea and was offended by their cynical remarks.  I'll give more info below.<br>
<br>
Required from the artists:<br>
All work will be online based at first, with original character designs in whatever veins you choose (variety is better).  The amount of work depends on what you would like out of it, this is a money making opportunity, but it will also be fun and something very new. <br>
<br>
My side:<br>
I will do all of the programming backend work for this project, also design and layout.  As well as support issues which may arise.  Your only responsibility would be to continue to create characters and to keep in contact with me.  <br>
<br>
Thanks again for the suggestions TSD and Chikin, hope to hear from more of you now. <br>

Sure, if someone had the html skills of a gnat (and there are some artists like that, admittedly) then having someone else design the site is probably a good thing. But the chances are that's not gonna happen. By &quot;idea&quot; I thought you meant you'd scripted something, or at least had some kind of inspiration for a story or theme. Not &quot;I'll help you build a webcomic&quot;, which would be more appropriate. This seems kinda backwards to me. but yeah, not knocking you man, it's just that these kind of requests always tend to rub the wrong way, it comes over as &quot;you do all the work and I can share the credit&quot;. It may not be what you mean, but it's what it sounds like; maintaining a site isn't anywhere near as much work as creating, scripting, pencilling &amp; lettering a manga on a regular basis. :\ But yeah, I say you have a look around various boards, find an artist that looks like he/she needs you, and email them. You'll probably get better luck and better responses that way. ^^<br>

You don't have to ATTACK someone because they didn't give as much information as you'd like. Ask them questions instead of jumping down their throat. <p><html>

And BTW chikin, I never said I didn't have anything scripted.  I understand the lack of info confuses you, but believe that there is MASSIVE amounts of backend programming for this to work.  I appreciate those of you who have sent me info on yourselves.  I am looking over the work right now and I'll send alot more info to those of you I'm interested in.  <br>
<br>
This IS NOT some webcomic idea, it is not an &quot;I want to take and not give&quot; idea.  It is a great idea, that believe it or not through my research on this I have not found a single instance of anything like this.  If some of you wish to continue flaming me with your semi-intellectual rhetoric, go ahead.  For those of you who have legitimate interest and questions about this, feel free to ask. Thank you. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showPrevMessage?topicID=11336.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showNextMessage?topicID=11336.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11336.topic&index=18><img src=http://www.polykarbon.com/bbsimage/addreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.emailToFriend?topicID=11336.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.threadControl?topicID=11336.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=11336.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=11336.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub25.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="polykarbonbbsfrm18">PK-BBS Rules and Regulations!<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm27">Board F.A.Q.s<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm3">News and Updates<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm2">Photoshop and Art questions<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm4">General Manga/Anime Discussion<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm5">Japanese Language Help<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm23">art in progress<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm13">Black and White Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm14">Color Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm19">Member's Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm17">Moderators Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm6">Member Photos<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm31">Help, Hints and Cheats<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm20">Challenges<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm21">Matches<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm26">Writer's Forum<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm32">VG Discussion<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm33">PolyKarbon CCG<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm35">Member Created Tutorials<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm36">Best Tutorials</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#336699>- </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs>Polykarbon BBS</a><font color=#336699> - </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19>Member's Lounge</a> <font color=#336699> - </font><a href="http://www.polykarbon.com">Polykarbon: Manga & Photoshop</a><font color=#336699> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.0.92<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.<br>Accelerated By <a href=http://www.wbs.com/ezboard.html>JXEL</a></center></body></html>
