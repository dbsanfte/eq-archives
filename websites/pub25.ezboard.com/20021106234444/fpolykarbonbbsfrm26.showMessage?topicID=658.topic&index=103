<br>
It looks like the weight has been shifted/<br>
its like an angel has come/<br>
and the eagerness has uplifted/<br>
off of my shoulders/<br>
the holders of this beam has been broken/<br>
if i spit any harder then my throat will start chokin/<br>
this emotoin that bottles up deep inside of me/<br>
makes me spit ryhmes and wanna try to be the best/<br>
i was contained, waitin for the rest to post/<br>
that was the most/<br>
rediculous spit i think i ever heard/<br>
now i got double the trouble/<br>
so im'a work on my word/<br>
and ill attack/<br>
sendin timmy the tooth/<br>
outta tha booth/<br>
some might say im uncooth/<br>
but ill rap, until u catch tha news/<br>
then ill snap/<br>
and after that nothin will cruise/<br>
face it u loose/<br>
cus u choose/<br>
to give me ammo for my gun/<br>
now dont run/<br>
back through the door/<br>
Its complexity u say, so ill give u some more/<br>
looks like i get to spit against timmy the great/<br>
sorry kid ur nothin more than a 8, next to the 9/<br>
i told u im'a spit out wine/<br>
i rewind, to sin/<br>
ur nothin more than a ten/<br>
sometimes i tend, to begin to confuse myself/<br>
if i ever loose a shelf, of confi-dence/<br>
ill jus speak in present tense/<br>
the fog of my lyrics is to dense/<br>
so comense/<br>
u and ur 2 man team/<br>
its me and Zo's dream/<br>
to take down the queen/<br>
but even if Zo dont show/<br>
i better let u know/<br>
it'll be 1 on 2/<br>
cus no matter what happens, i told u ill never be through/<br>
im not scared and im  not gonna run and hide like u/<br>
cus im the best/<br>
and i dont even need a rest/<br>
this battle will be the test/<br>
who can play checkers, and who  can play chess/<br>
its the quest/<br>
and infested has gone behind enemy lines/<br>
so pull ur nines/<br>
if u think u can put up a fight/<br>
i got the right/<br>
to charge into ur base/<br>
its up in ur face/<br>
ur not bringin haste/<br>
and ill never flee from my castle/<br>
its the hastle, of havin to read ur young words/<br>
ill prolly never get the compition i ever deserve/<br>
so swerve and dodge my attacks/<br>
ill take it farther than the racks/<br>
iv done alot to p*ss u off/<br>
and get u off/<br>
causin u to turn blue/<br>
i knew once i started spitting this ryhme/<br>
that it would be my time/<br>
to shine/<br>
if ur whatchin my every tread/<br>
then i would already be dead/<br>
and u would not have to go through the trouble/<br>
of fixing ur sh*t/<br>
i wont quit/<br>
sendin out little attacks/<br>
ill do the grande fanally/<br>
when u got ur backs, turned/<br>
i think i jus burned/<br>
u and ur timtim crew/<br>
so now im through/<br>
spit it to the best of ur knowledge/<br>
then ill agknowledge/<br>

feeling in your pulse, my vocal bassline/<br>
here is my sound to make you feel real fine/<br>
bringing it to you, live action, in real time/<br>
I only be done, when you hear the loud bell chime/<br>
sin bringing havoc thats off the meter/<br>
you my invader/<br>
Im the gate keeper/<br>
to you Im giving;Up middle finger/<br>
blow up your mind with a heat seeker/<br>
smacked up again, your getting weaker/<br>
hitting again, Im getting stronger/<br>
You are the qeustion, I the answer/<br>
You are the floor, I am the dancer/<br>
you are the angel, I am the eva/<br>
you are the misser, I am the dodger/<br>
Im the main man, bad-boy H-Lector/<br>
this is my zone, get out my sector/<br>
this is my throne, all shout selecta/<br>
stabbing you up, my lyrics will kill ya/<br>
<br>
*loud bell chime*<br>
<br>
Im sorry my friend, but thats not all/<br>
better and stronger, sword ready for duel/ <br>
faster and longer, sinfire will rule/<br>
when you lose your heat, i keep my cool/<br>
before we go on, you need your school/<br>
cos so far,  you is da fool/<br>
you want to be better, but can only drool/<br>
comflex and sin now in the room/<br>
making an impact, sound set to go boom/<br>
we're pissed off now, so except fatal doom/<br>
your the floors dirt, and I got the broom/<br>
sending you to hell, boxxed in your tomb/<br>
Feel my power -- karate kick/<br>

if you keep up attempts, you'll fall down dead/<br>
Just like my old man said/<br>
things come to those who wait/<br>
grudge war is on, so lets make it a date/<br>
enemy you be, and losing's your fate/<br>
your gonna lose, cos winnings my trait/<br>
What we got going now, will be called hate/<br>
in the forest of the sick thats where I live/<br>
in the forest of the thick thats where you live/<br>
in the alley of the evil thats where I fly/<br>
in the alley of the evil thats where you die/<br>
theres no time for your redemption/<br>
theres no time for your protection/<br>
theres only time for my ressurection/<br>
theres only time for heart disection/<br>
evil spitting, pure mic correction/<br>
evil shouting, pure mic attraction/ <br>
when im coming, you be running/<br>
needles poking inside your brain/<br>
sinfires cure will be your pain/<br>

<br>
All I know is if my ass is playa hated/<br>
Someone's ass'll get obliterated/<br>
My colors never faded/<br>
And my view was never jaded/<br>
I have many friends/<br>
And many more enemies/<br>
Who side are u on?/<br>
Well you can't get rid of me/<br>
I'm forever like eternal/<br>
Your sh*t's infernal/<br>
All my rhymes built up inside my internal/<br>
Structure/<br>
Your ass is mine to puncture/<br>
With sharp ass swords/<br>
So be careful who you mess wit' Muthaf*cka/<br>
Dan't you know I roll with matrix we always win/<br>
And crush little bastards like that cat timtim/<br>
You have know idea who you just stepped to/<br>
I'm rubber you're bamboo/<br>
What bounces off of me smashes through you/<br>
Cuz I'm a regular predator/<br>
I run @#%$ like the senator/<br>
I'm the landlord and I said this tah/<br>
Even more punks your ass is tresppassin/<br>
Pay up the rent or your ass'll be gaspin/<br>
For your last breath/<br>
Before you see death/<br>
knockin at your door/<br>
You failed in life you get an F/<br>
I aced every test that life has thrown at me/<br>
I face all opponents with unparralled animosity/<br>
So this @#%$'ll hit you hard at a high velocity/<br>
When I'm done they'll say what a damn atrocity/<br>
To come against me you couldn't possibly/<br>
Think that I'd go away back to the shadows/<br>
I come back piercing your throat like bows and arrows/<br>
Lyrically burn you from teh skin to bone marrow/<br>
I'll choke you so thin your throat will be narrow/<br>
I've been gone for a while but now I came back/<br>
For all you punk ass MC's who though it was safe to attack/<br>
All my credibility/<br>
My uncanny ability/<br>
To abort MC's like a fetus with low fertility/<br>
You morons are killin me/<br>
This thread's a war so be careful where you tread/<br>
Cuz you'll get torn up badly before you end up dead/<br>
I gotta make this mad long cuz I ain't spit in a while/<br>
You soft ass punks are gonna see that I'm vile/<br>
And smash you up like cheap tile/<br>
Cuz that's my style/<br>
I never hit and run/<br>
I stay right with you and have a little fun/<br>
And I don't need any guns/<br>
Cuz I have the most powerful weapon/<br>
My mouth that vanquishes jerks who get to steppin'/<br>
Cuz I'm reppin'/<br>
The clan of all who have real skills/<br>
The assassins who rack up more than 50 kills/<br>
In less than a half an hour/<br>
We possess supreme power/<br>
The Microphones signal will constantly shower/<br>
Your ears with abuse/<br>
Cuz you think your ass was cute/<br>
Trying to tell me I can't f*ck with you?/<br>
I'll give you the boot/<br>
Just leave while you can/<br>
Be a smart man/<br>
And tell all teh haters in your crew/<br>
Don't mess with Zodawg's clan/<br>
And that's why I'm king and you punks duck like daffy/<br>
So when you wanna rhyme don't ever ask me/<br>
Hey Zo how bout a round you can't get past me/<br>
Cuz your ass'll get chewed up like friggin taffy/<br>
<br>
I have no direct beef with sin...but if his lackeys are gonna test me then they are gonna get shut down.  I didn't say anything to anyone but if the war drags me in....I'm in.<br>

<br>
Stand up on your feet/<br>
It's time for you to meet/<br>
The f*ckin executioner/<br>
The pro-retributioner/<br>
I'm the comeback king/<br>
So get out the ring/<br>
Of pro killers and mad rhymers/<br>
A little lessons for you first timers/<br>
We go off like explosions/<br>
Let me give you a notion/<br>
To not include yourself in this war/<br>
Cuz your's skills are too poor/<br>
And with you I'll mop the floor/<br>
Before I kick you out the door/<br>
<br>
TIME TO GET BRUTAL.......<br>
<br>
I'm on a  one way crash course/<br>
With an untameable force/<br>
The shogun mic gripper/<br>
Slashin like Jack the ripper/<br>
But you can call me ZO/<br>
It won't matter when you go/<br>
Straight down six feet/<br>
Cuz you couldn't take the heat/<br>
So all amatuers take a seat/<br>
while I murder this f*ckin beat/<br>
I repeat/<br>
Me and infested have taken over/<br>
Your out of luck we got the clover/<br>
But it's really cuz of skills/<br>
That make you fakers pop pills/<br>
To combat depression/<br>
So you better learn a lesson/<br>
Anyone talking sh*t/<br>
Won't have a chance for confession/<br>
Just a little session/<br>
With the masters/<br>
To take out you little bastards/<br>
We do it ten times better/<br>
And 20 times faster/<br>
<br>
This'll be my last transmission/<br>
From this little prison/<br>
I like to call my mind/<br>
But then again I find/<br>
The demons make me stronger/<br>
And able to rhyme longer/<br>
<br>
Enough for now........<br>
