Yes, just like I said...<br>
<br>
By the way, I hate him for that. I hate that character (well, all the characters sucked), and making him the Nemesis is just retarded. I'm supposed to take him seriously now? I'm supposed to be afraid of him now? Please. I don't WANT to know who the Nemesis is, it's not important. No one cares who all the other mutated monsters are, why Nemesis? That's what makes him frightening. You know nothing about him other than the fact that he wants to bash your skull in. <p><table width=100% border=0>

It ruins him.<br>
<br>
I like the version of the Tyrant from RE2 (I hate calling him Mr. X) better than Nemesis too. I thought he was a lot scarier. He looked almost human, and he kept his cool. He'd just walk up to you as slow as possible as you unloaded a clip into him, and running away through the halls. He was just really intimidating and frightening. I like Nemesis too, but they really overused him. He was on your ass the whole game, so he stopped being scary, and started being annoying.<br>
<br>
Annoying? Sure. But weak!?! You're insane. You had to shoot him about 60 times with the handgun to &quot;kill&quot; him.<br>
<br>
I like the game, but I agree it's the worst of the series. (from the main series) It's more action oriented, and it's got a few interesting elements, but the game is really short, has less replayability than all the others, and it doesn't add too much to the overall RE storyline. Sure, it adds a few bits, but nothing as major as any of the others.<br>
<br>
And as far as Tyrant (RE1), I'm almost glad they skipped him. I'm not a big fan of his design. And having your heart on the outside of your body probably isn't exactly an advantage. <p><table width=100% border=0>

He could come out of nowhere. And since he wasn't constantly following you the entire game like in Nemesis, it almost always caught you by surprise. He'd come out in the most unexpected places.<br>
<br>
I remember this one room that was nested in a U-shaped halway. You had to solve some puzzle in there, and after you did, BAM he busted through the wall. Scared the crap out of me, but took care of him. Left the room and was moving on when he busts through the OTHER wall. I was definitely not expecting that since most of the fights with him are spaced out. And it made me paranoid for the rest of the game.  <p><table width=100% border=0>

He had the big eye on his shoulder and you'd fight him in both game A as a slightly humanoid thing and game B as a huge blob.<br>
 I found the Mr. X to be the scariest monster in the resident evils I've played. The first time you meet up with him, all you hear is his big heavy footsteps. Then you just see this ten-foot-tall man in a trenchcoat come around the corner.<br>
Alucard, I'm just wondering. Have you beat the remake of Res 1 yet?<br>
Because you find out where Nemesis came from there (or could have been from)<br>
The last time you fight Lisa Trevor in the dungeon, a bunch of very Nemesis-ish tentacles rip out of her. While fighting her she jumps around alot like Nemesis, rather than just slowly walking around like any most other T-virus creations.<br>
Just because they say 'put him in the nemesis project' doesn't mean he's necessarily Nemesis in the games.<br>
I always thought they used a dead Stars member to be Nemesis (because he pretty much knew the names and faces of everyone on the team (since he was hunting down survivors and all that)<br>
But anyway, the movies I guess aren't meant to be particularly accurate anymore. While playing RE3 I never ran into anyone named Alice. So there's that.<br>
In Re1 you read a file about how Umbrella's security force was wiped out trying to fix a biohazard. So, that 'could' elude to the movie that was made. But that could be any security force.<br>

Whoever said he was? I said he was going to be the Nemesis in the movie. <br>
<br>
And I already know there's more than one, everyone who's played the games should know that. I mean, the very first time they appear is in RE2, and it's obvious there's more than one considering they dropped him out of a huge canister, and had several others attached. Not to mention there were tons of them in Survivor (though I haven't played it yet). Also, Survivor already explained how they make the Tyrants, and &quot;Mr. X&quot; (god I hate that name) is just a different kind of Tyrant. <p><table width=100% border=0>
