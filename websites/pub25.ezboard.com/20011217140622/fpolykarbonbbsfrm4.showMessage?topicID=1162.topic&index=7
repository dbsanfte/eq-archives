I don't draw to express some creative side.  I'm not a creative person.  I'm a person with a keen eye and the ability to recreate what I see before me.  I rarely ever draw without a reference.  I find a nice picture of a horse and I recreate that horse.  I typically remove the backgrounds from the images I recreate or alter them in some way to maintain a focal point.  I copy copy copy ... and I guess that makes me less than an artist.  I guess that just makes me a nobody loser.  But I challenge the lot of you to shade the way I do.  I don't DRAW in details ... I shade them in and that does take talent.  <br>
<br>
Why does being an artist mean having to create something new any way??  The masters painted their surroundings.  They painted the people they saw and new.  The painted and sculpted models that posed for them for hours on end.  They are great and all they did was copy everything they saw ... <br>
<br>
... guess that's not good enough for the art world any more.  Let's just rip all the copied garbage out of the museums and throw it away becuase it's not creative and not artistic and it's worthless.  <br>
<br>
Think I'll sit here and mope now until it's time to go home ... and when I get home I guess I'll just destroy that worthless copy of a horse that I have been working on.<br>

That's because they don't know any better. A lot of them only know what they see here on the net, or in anime, mangas, and comics. There is more then one way of creating art just because your way is not mine doesn't make it less art, and you will learn this if you study other things then the before stated. Go check out <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.timbradstreet.com/abouttim/index.shtml">Timothy Bradstreet</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> site to see how he creates is work, his drawing are all from photos he takes himself. <p><center><font face="Impact">

<br>
I copy a LOT of stuff when I'm trying to learn how to do accomplish something. Anatomy and proportions are the easiest thing to learn from people or other animals by drawing life. I PREFER to not use reference if I don't need to, but I don't look down on people that do. I still don't think that copying stylized works is the best way to learn, at least not as your ONLY means of learning. Again, that's just me. These are all opinions, and no one has to agree.<br>
<br>
Do I think you can't be creative when copying pictures? Of course. Trust me, it gets on my nerves just as much as yours when people are put down (and I've seen it done on this board) for using photo reference. Telling them that they aren't being creative, that they are somehow lesser of an artist. It would be ridiculous for me to sit here and insult anyone for doing it considering I've been using photos constantly for all my art projects lately that required me to draw a person. I don't see how it's any different than drawing from real life (besides the fact that your subject won't move).<br>
<br>
I do realize I said that it inhibits your creativity to rely on photographs too much, and I still think it does sometimes. I think the best way to use photographs is to take them yourself, so at least that way you get to determine the positionings and content. That doesn't mean it's wrong to use photographs, whether you take them yourself or not, and even if I or anyone else thought it was: so what? You say you do it for yourself, then who cares what other people think? We shouldn't even be a factor.<br>
<br>
And just because I don't think it's the best way to learn or whatever, that doesn't mean I factor that into my critique (if I were to critique). I don't sit there and lecture the person on what they should be doing, I don't tell them I'm right and their way is wrong, they can do whatever they want. I just do what I'm supposed to do, critique. Obviously you can reference creatively. Like you said, you alter the photo instead of making it an exact duplication. Obviously, that's creative. And same thing with the masters. I mean, they didn't just randomly place people in their paintings. They used models, but they also placed them creatively, and put them into surroundings that they weren't in previously. Just because they used models doesn't mean they aren't creative, just like people that use photos aren't inherintly not creative. <p><table width=100% border=0>

I'd rather not put a lot of energy and time into a line drawing as the real work I do lies in the shading.  I cannot do what I do in a matter of a few hours.  Depending on the size of the drawing, how dark it is, and how many shadows are in it, it could take me a month or two to complete a work.  I couldn't tell you how many hours I put into a drawing ... I don't keep track but it's rarely more than a couple hours a day and not often done on a daily basis.  I wish I had a sample of what I really do ... but I haven't even completed the line drawing for my current project.  <br>
<br>
While I use copying for all my major works, I do take the time to hone my skills by drawing using references less and even drawing from my mind, but I still copy a lot of images just to get a feel for the way the lines flow.  That is the stuff you'll likely find on my site, though there are actually a few original and semi-original pieces there.  <br>
<br>
But yes, ALL my major works are done by copying photos and reference pics.  I have even been known to use a grid when scaling something up significantly larger than the actual reference piece.  It's it my shading that makes the image.<br>
<br>
I thought I had also stated that I am human and that I do seek the approval of others ... maybe not ... so while I shouldn't care what others think ... when so many seem to think what I do is wrong and worthless it DOES mean something.  Maybe it shouldn't ... but it does none the less. <p><br><br><p align=center><a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/uanyte.showPublicProfile?language=EN"><font color=red><b><i>Read my profile </b></a><font size=1>and find out what kind of top secret stuff I've been up to.

I wanted to have a nice discussion on what everyone thought.<br>
Most famous artists are famous for creating new styles of art or making works of art. The time you said something like &quot;let's junk all the art in the museums .. &quot; most the reason they are in a museum because they were innovative artists and took new strides that changed art as we know it.<br>
<br>
<br>
and to this &quot; ALL my major works are done by copying photos and reference pics&quot; If you enjoy doing it, don't stop because of what someone said about it. It might as well just be your style. Besides, if everyone did that, we'd all be cavemen still because of all the inventions/discoveries there is bound to be someone that opposed. Most people and artists do copy from reference, and most the time its because the audience likes that stuff. But really I think it isn't what the artist really wants to do, take my art teacher for example, he paints so he can sell his paintings at an auction/sale , not for the fun of painting.Don't get me wrong, I'm sure someone out there enjoys painting AND sells them, but most the time when someone takes it too serious and bases his/her career on it , it takes all the enjoyment out of it.<br>
<br>
I just wanted to share my opinion. <br>

I don't even take money when it's offered.  You like my drawing ... it's yours.<br>
<br>
No.  You didn't mean it to be a flame, but it comes up over and over and over again and no not all the great works of art are innovative in that the image has been changed, rather in the way the paint was applied, or the type of medium used, the colors that are used, the composition, etc.  Creativity does not begin and end with altering your reference.  I believe it was da Vinci (and I could be wrong about who) that has been noted for his ability to reproduce what he saw and give it a 3D quality.  What was most valued in certain works was that no matter how close nor how far you were from the work ... the image still maintained the desired dimensional effect.  This is a skill that not many artists are able to master.  It is very difficult to produce something on a large scale and have the detailing look as good and has as much dimension from both near and far.  This is something that I am able to do.  This is something that I worked very hard to master.  My drawings don't just have a photo realistic quality to them, they have dimension.  <br>
<br>
Again, I am human, what others think will and does matter to me at times and this is one of those times that it matters.  I worked hard to be able to do what I do and I constantly hear how wrong it is.  Knock someone else who is only copying and not really producing anything ... knock those who have struggled to acheive a specific goal ... but don't knock an entire group of people for something you don't really know that much about.<br>
<br>
Again, I understand that you were not trying to flame anyone, so there are no hard feelings from me.  I am frustrated with the whole mess but I'm not angry with anyone. <p><br><br><p align=center><a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/uanyte.showPublicProfile?language=EN"><font color=red><b><i>Read my profile </b></a><font size=1>and find out what kind of top secret stuff I've been up to.

I explained myself, and I even said that I do a lot of the same things you do, even the grid thing. There's nothing wrong with it, I wasn't saying there was. And I still think that copying a LINE drawing as the only means of learning is wrong, not to mention is really has nothing to do with you since you're copying photos, so I don't understand why what I said upset you.<br>
<br>
I like drawing from photos, I do it all the time, especially for art class. And what you are doing (adding or altering portions or the whole picture) is creative. But I'm sorry, copying an photo exactly, whether line or shaded, is not creative. That doesnt' mean it's bad, but it isn't creative if you are only reproducing something exactly as it was. Let me repeat that I am NOT talking about what you said because that's not what you're doing.<br>
<br>
And keep in mind, no one was trying to hurt any feelings, but we are all entitled to our opinions. I'm sorry if you still disagree with anything I've said or are even offended, but it is only my opinion. <p><table width=100% border=0>
