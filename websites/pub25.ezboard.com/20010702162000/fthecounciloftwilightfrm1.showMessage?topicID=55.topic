<br>
This is a sad tale that I have been requested of to repeat on these forums.  After repeating it twice in guildchat, others joining in later missed most of the story.  So I will recount here what I told then.  Grab a brew (or 10), as my story is long, but will hopefully keep you entertained and informed.<br>
<br>
Upon hearing the news that it was now possible for me to acquire and cast the spell Spirit of Wolf, I awoke from my resting point in Warsliks Woods, where I had rested since our excursion to Dalnir's.  I also found how much easier it was for me to track, so I shouted out with enough force that all of Warsliks could heart, &quot;I can actually track now&quot;.  Upon this, I was messaged by a level 10 Iksar Shaman by the name of Slikis.  He said to me, &quot;Could you track me some money?&quot;.  I told him I was not that advanced in my tracking skills, but realized that since he was a shaman, he could get my SOW scroll from the Cabilis Shaman Guild, thereby saving me a necessary trip to Kelethin.  I told him I would give him the equivalent of 26p in coins to get the spell for me, but he had made his way to the Overthere.  He then wanted me to show him the way to the docks and he said he &quot;was scared&quot;.  So fine, I head to the Overthere, whereupon he tells me that he's just discovered a level 51 SK is giving away his equipment, but we had to find him. WHAT?!?!  Not thinking all too clearly at this point, and slightly motivated by greed, I set about on tracking a level 51 Reaver by the name of Shadowlancer.  Come to find out that the Reaver's girlfriend had possessed his soul, and wanted to encourage his retirement from his dangerous profession, by giving away his equipment.  At this point, I knew this was terribly wrong, this witch was making him act against his will, but Slikis was encouraging her all along, telling her what to do.  By the time I realized the items were just being dropped to the ground, I hastily made room in my inventory and picked what I could, before the trickster Slikis could get everything.  I picked up a Crested Helm (AC10 6str, some other bonus), and a Hooded Black Cloak (AC10 5str 45hps, worth about 10kpp).  At this point, I knew not if when Shadowlancer regained control of himself, if he would indeed retire, leaving the possessions for who got them, or slay the witch and want everything back.  There was also a necromancer with us, named Sojan.  Slikis had promised him a share as well, but of course once he found the boat, he ran as fast as he could.  Sojan seemed very nice, for a DE necromancer, and my cousin Marken had dealings with him before.  I gave him the Crested Helm to hold onto, and if Shadowlancer did not want his possessions back, he would give it to his lovely Shadowknight girlfriend.  But he also understood what had to be done, if need be.  At this point, I decided to head off to Faydwer to get my spells, and keep my ears open for the arrival of Shadowlancer back into the lands.<br>
<br>
I arrived in Butcherblock by taking the boat from Firiona Vie, and the shuttles to the docks in BB.  I did my usual stop at Peg Leg's camp, to give him some payback from when he cut me down at a young age.  I also found another old enemy of mine, Corflunk on tracking.  I decided to go hunt him down.  He started attacking a young monk that had journeyed over, and had the help of a goblin shaman, oddly enough.  I got Corflunk's attention off the monk, and slew the goblin while Corflunk tried to hit me.  I then killed them both, and went about my way.  I reached my home of Kelethin, and quickly found the new scrolls I needed, Spirit of Wolf, Firefist, Endure Cold and Panic Animal.  I scribed my spells, tested them all out, except for Panic Animal, and started casting SOW on everyone in sight.  I heard a shout for help at the orc hill, so went over there quickly to break things up.  Happy that all was well in G Fay, I decided to go to Steamfont Mountains, to get my cousin Yatreas a Minotaur Horn for his upcoming skills.<br>
<br>
While passing through Lesser Faydark, I caught the trail of one Thistle Underbrush.  Galadhriel and I had hunted him around the level of 25, to try to get his Braided Ivy Cords, but we were only successful in killing him, not getting the Cords.  Thinking I might be able to take him by myself now, I followed his trail and let in on him.  My first strategy was to remove all of his enchantments he placed on himself, especially the damage shield which made it painful for me to cut into him, especially using my fast weapons.  It was a close fight until I was able to remove his shields, then he wasn't too difficult from that point out.  The nastiest part about him after that was that he heals himself a fair amount, and it was just a matter of time of dwindling his hit points away faster than he could heal.  Once he fell, I was at about 20% health and mana, so I checked to see if he had the Cords.  He did not, and i wasn't sure if I wanted to try again, but a friend of mine came along, so together we decided to give him a try.  He seemed a tougher fight with my friend actually, draining him down to 20% health, and me to 50%.  My friend was a bit less seasoned than I though, as a bard of the 26th note.  Again, no Cords, and I know Galadhriel would really like some also.  After this, we arranged for Galadhriel to give him a port to Tox forest and to West Commons.  And I was on my way to Steamfont.<br>
<br>
I found my way to the minotaur caves, and decided I would rather just kill one slaver with a horn, than trying to kill everyone I see.  So I scouted some, and found the Minotaur Lord.  He appeared formidable, but I felt like I could take him with little trouble.  And if not, I did have my Spirit of Wolf spell in place. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   So we fought and I emerged triumphant!  I also helped some young mage who seemed to have more than he could handle at one point.  I then found a minotaur that hand a horn, deep inside the caves.  I knew what passage to stay away from, the one that holds Meldrath and his guards.  I could tell through my tracking that Meldrath carries powerful forces, they filled my eyes with red.  Killing the slaver that held the horn was easy enough, so I departed with my cousin's gift quickly...<br>
<br>
Now it was time for me to head back to the lands of Kunark, and on my way back picked up an extra set of spells for Gilraen.  Once I was back in Butcherblock, I caught wind that Shadowlancer was back in the lands.  I sent him a friendly little &quot;Hail&quot; and he sent one back.  I then proceeded to outline the story as I set it here, in my earlier paragraph.  He was actually surprisingly not angry with me, even though I am the one who tracked him, and maybe none of this would've happened without my role in it.  I told him of Slikis and Sojan, and that Sojan seemed honorable, but Slikis was a rat.  I told him I wished to return his cloak, which he later offered to reward me for my honesty.  He did seem rather happy that his Ceremonial Iksar Breastplate (19ac, effect: regen), was not missing, so maybe everything else was just relatively trivial.  Once I arrived in Kunark, I started back to the Overthere, but once I got into Warsliks Woods, found he was no longer in the lands.  So I went back to Lake of Ill Omen and joined up with Gilraen and Galadhriel, who were hunting by the lake's shores.  I showed each of them the cloak, and there was much drooling and slobbering. Shadowlancer then was back on, so I got in touch with him again.  He told me to keep the cloak for now, that he was divining with the powers that be, to see about the rest of his stuff.  Okay, twist my arm, I'll have fun with it for now. =)<br>
<br>
So that concludes my story for now.  I shall post a follow-up as more unfolds with the cloak.  For now I will enjoy it, as Shadowlancer demanded.  Thank you for putting up with my long story, but that bard cousin of mine is rubbing off on me.  Fare thee well, my friends.<br>
