This is ALWAYS the rule if you're serious, though. Anything stylized is based on realism, and it's never the other way around. If you're trying to teach him manga-style, the problem is that it's a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> style</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, and it varies greatly from person to person.

Now tell him or her to flip the picture he or she picked up upside down,and trace the lines. Do not look at the picture as a drawing, but as line. Usually my suggestion is to pick an easy artist like Jhonen Vasquez,or Akira Toriyama;not Rob Liefield. This will help him be in the infamous R-mode which will enable the students' art-side. When finish, and if done right the student should be impressed with the work and making him to continue drawing. If that doesnt work read a lot of How to Draw books of any type(Manga,Real Life,Cartoon,Animals,etc). This exercise will help the student understand what art is like tell him that drawin is nothing but lines and the way it is set up. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uleelo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Leelo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(5/29/02 3:43:23 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3665.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: how do I teach my friend to draw?</span><hr size=1> funnything is I did that exercise and it just made him alot more angry because he couldn't get it right at all.

It also sounds like they are getting agrivatted and being to much of a perfectionist which while wanting to get it right is good but fighting with it too much will make them get so aggrivated they just say screw it and quit trying.<br><br>I suggest teaching them how to draw very simple things like a cup or a bowl. This will do 2 things IMO, it will teach them how to look at things to see the shapes they are made up of and give them something they can do and actually say &quot;Hey, it looks like a bowl&quot; (as long as he was drawing a bowl) and it should build their confidence. Nothing makes me want to draw more then when I draw something and it looks exactly like I wanted it to.<br><br>I hope this helps.
