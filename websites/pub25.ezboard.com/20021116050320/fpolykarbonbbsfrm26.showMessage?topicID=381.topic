He was Rome's finest general.  The emperor orderd that he capture East City.  In order to do this Vain had to march his troops through enemy territory and fight many battles on the way.  <br>
<br>
Vain marched his troops into battle and was able to easily overtake the enemy.  It was the same strategy every time.  He would march the army in two straight lines and have a second line take cover, be it by forest or mountian range, and go around behind the enemy, and outflank them.  This trap would catch them every time.  There were very few casualties on his side.  This strategy worked every time because all of east city's generals were not able to catch on, or when they did it was too late.  <br>
<br>
After some time Vain became very conceited.  Before each battle began the great General Vain thought he had to look the part.  Every time, before battle he would have to follow his elaborate, unbreakable ritual.  He would have his uniform pressed, shoes polished, hair combed, have to take a bath, his horse groomed, his sword sharpend and polished, he had to be able to see his face in his Breastplate, and the feathers on his helmet had to be perfect, or he would throw it on the ground and have his aid start over from scratch.  This ritual was his hubris.<br>
<br>
On the battlefield he looked almost the spitting image of Appalo, the Sun God.  His armor shone in the sunlight almost blinding enemy troops.  His sword was so brilliant it looked as if it had never seen a battlefield.  The fearhers lining his helm were vibrant flashes of color.  Each decoration and medal were in exactly the right place.  Each strap and buckle looked as if it had been freshly tanned and dyed.  General Vain thought he was the most glorious looking mortal in the empire.<br>
<br>
One evening Vains troops arrived on the outskirts of East city.  He tells the troops that this night they can rest, but to be ready when he sounds his trumpet.  That night he decided to work on a new strategy.  He will attack the city in the early morning between 3 and 4:30.  This way the people will be sleeping most soundly.  He will have darkness and suprise on his side.  When it was time to attack he got the troops with his trumpet.  He then told them to get ready.  The attack needed to be at precisely the right time or the sun would blind his army.  <br>
<br>
When going through his morning routine he noticed the aids had not done thier job the night before.  He smacked his aids to wake them up so they would do thier jobs.  The aids got up and with welts upon thier faces began thier jobs.  They would have his uniform pressed, shoes polished, hair combed, have to take a bath, his horse groomed, his sword sharpend and polished, he had to be able to see his face in his Breastplate, and the feathers on his helmet had to be perfect, or he would throw it on the ground and have his aid start over from scratch.  He would not go into battle without proper attire.  These preparations delayed the attack 1 hour.  General Vain did not care, because he thought so much of himself he had to look great. Unbenownst to him the sun was beginning to rise.<br>
<br>
Sitting astride his horse properly dressed, he looked himself over then began over the hill to the city.  It was now 6:00 in the morning.  Once over the hill the army marched towards the city.  When they got to thier mark the sun rose over the city walls blinding him and his troops.  The East City general burst out of the gates and impaled him with a pike.  The troops saw the great general fall and at that retreared. Thus the great general was undone because of his own vanity, his nemisis.<br>
