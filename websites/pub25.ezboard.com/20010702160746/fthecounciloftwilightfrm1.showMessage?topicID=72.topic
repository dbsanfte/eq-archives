I thought I'd share what happened to me while waiting to board the boat bound for Freeport. I was just minding my own business sitting at the docks daydreaming about the adventures awaiting me in North Ro. I suddenly heard the shouts of a flustered mage, asking if anyone had seen Walnan. He had apparently been searching all of Butcherblock Mountains for her, and after four days was just beside himself with anger and frustration. In his desperation, he offered 100 platinum to whoever could help him find her. After hesitating for a moment, I decided to search the path leading to the docks, since 100 platinum would indeed be nice for some new clothes. Suddenly in the distance, there she was strolling along the path, dressed in a beautiful violet robe. I immediately sent word to the mage of her location and after completing the quest we went to the bank so that I could collect my reward. I discovered that this mage was indeed an ARCH mage (he made sure to point that out... hehe) of the 60th season who belonged to the Seekers.<br>
<br>
Cha-ching!<br>
<br>
But wait, the story does not end here! Read on....<br>
<br>
I sat down in the bank, trying to decide if I should call it a day since I had already wasted a good amount of time helping this poor guy out. Then in the corner of my eye I noticed that he is changing clothes over and over again. I complimented him on his vast array of robes and he said he wanted to be sure to pack the right gear for his next journey, blah blah blah. We continued with the small talk for a few minutes (and yes, Master Feldros, I did mention you!<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) He then asked me if I knew any rogues, and I immediately answered 'Why yes!!'. He then showed me a Stilleto of the Bloodclaw and a Jagged Ice Shard. I thought he just wanted to brag a little, but he said, &quot;These are for you&quot;. I was in complete utter shock, more so over the Jagged Ice Shard because it has unbelievably good stats (12/29 piercer, sv +5 cold, Shards of Sorrow effect). We then parted our ways and I immediately set out for Freeport in search of my very distant cousin, the young rogue Sediri.<br>
<br>
So... the lesson I have learned is that I should ALWAYS try to help out whenever anyone needs assistance, especially those who are of the 60th season!  <br>

[ooc: After checking eqprices.com, I am in even MORE shock, since it says the average price of the Jagged Ice Shard is 6100 plat!!! Holy canoli batman!!!!!]  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bthecounciloftwilight.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=cashewribs>CashewRibs</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 56<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/2/01 4:17:40 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Luck be a Lady?</span><hr size=1> Excellent Sprigs!  Easily, that is the best luck a Twilighter has come across.  I remember similar stories from others, like Feldros getting a ridiculous amount of plat for his FBR, and he was naked for quite a bit after that!  Or buying items at ridiculously low prices, it all depends, right timing, right player.  Luck is a wild random factor.  And we all have it in one form another, too bad it doesn't come more often.  But that means we treasure it that much more when we get it.  I lucked out the other day, I gave someone a port to GF, and the lady gnome (cleric of 30 I believe) said she didn't have any money, and said would I mind taking a Cougar Claw Earring.  I almost wet my pants.  That's worth around 400p, and the stats are pretty good.  I'm proud of that, my second best luck in the game.  My BEST luck was getting an Oracle Robe from Oake.  But geez, once again, a big congrats to Sprigs.  She easily deserves such luck and wealth for helping out a fellow player.  May luck continually shine on us all.  <br>

Tormenter was hunting in Overthere when I intercepted cries of help from a 40th level Iksar Shaman. It took me awhile to learn what the problem was. The player apologized and said English was not his primary language. After some discussion I finally figured out that his Iksar tried to board the boat at the Overthere port and got killed by the guards because Iksars are not welcomed there. Well he died on the boat and did not realize that when the boat zones your body gets dumped in the ocean. He had been riding the boat for an hour looking for his corpse. Mind you it took me awhile to figure this out because of his broken English. I decided to see if I could cast locate corpse and fish his body off the bottom of the ocean. He gave me consent and off I went for a swim. After getting to the area where the boat zoned, I bravely dove down to the bottom of the ocean. On the third attempt and nearly out of air I see a dead Iksar. I hastily hit my summon corpse key and made a mad dash for the surface hoping to get a breath of air before I joined him in a watery grave. I panicked a bit because I was trying to drag a corpse, swim and point myself in an upward direction with very little light to see by. Well as luck would have it I survived and when I came out of the water I was still holding the Iksar's corpse. He was so delighted he tipped me 200 platinum pieces for the rescue. I went merrily on my way until I stopped suddenly. 'Damn it! Tormenter just did a Good deed!'<br>
