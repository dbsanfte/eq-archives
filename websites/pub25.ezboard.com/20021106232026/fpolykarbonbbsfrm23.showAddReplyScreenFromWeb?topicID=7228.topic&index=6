First off I am of the opinion that practicality and originality weighs heavier than style.<br>
A mecha's head must no doubt be the sensor area for the mecha and possibly contain a complex avionics package for targetting and object location and such especially if to travel through space where it would need 3D targetting.(Can you imagine being in space with no radar where you don't know where 'up' is because there is no 'up' or 'down'?)<br>
Anyway,the head should also generally have a relay compartment and such to pick and send signals and data.[unless it's fairly primitive].<br>
I'll rate my crits on these heads like this and also remembering the fact they're made for battle.<br>
1. This would suffer in battle because everything seems so exposed and volatile. However it does seem to have a wide line of sight and that pod on the side seems to be vulcans so perhaps it could be useful but what person would place powerful vulcans on the head? <br>
If solid rounds then too much space is needed for ammo and a flexible neck for recoil(if it recoils) and if beam then I don't see how that could be hooked up based on the equipment a head needs which should take up that space.<br>
Big problem with this suit is that the pilot will have two definite blindspots on either side of the mecha. If someone attacks him from left or right diagonally strong enough then he's toast without even knowing it. (I guess he could depend on sensor readouts but this is for battle; visual confirmation is always very useful in battles)<br>
<br>
2. Same as #1 without the vulcans. Not a good design. I would add more cameras and such to either the upper torso of the mecha or the sides of the head to eliminate the obvious blindspots. Antennae frame does look sturdier however. Artistically speaking perspective is a little off considering the placement of the camera.<br>
<br>
3. Not bad but generic. The visor is good because of a large field of vision but why cover part of it with that little gadget?<br>
The antennae are too flimsy looking however they are short and close to the vulcans so there's a nice balance. One big problem is the power cable to the back which I hope is short because if not that's just a weakspot shouting to be acknowledged. (Another problem with perspective with the placement of the lines near the antennae)<br>
<br>
4.I don't quite get its shape since some part seems missing however it is actually useful since if the mecha's body were shaped similar then it would probably be a stealth mecha due to the rounded frame which everyone knows avoids and deflects radar signals better than a blocky frame can. Therefore it'd be able to avoid detection. <br>
However those fin antennae make little sense to me unless made to gather larger amounts of data quicker than normal and relay them quicker due to the large surface area of the antennae. I'd say it's for aquatic use but I highly doubt. Again the powercable....<br>
<br>
5. Besides the vulcans and the ability to make its opponent go:&quot; Oooo..look at that..&quot; because it does look cool I don't see the use. That is unless the dome at the top is actually a highly sophisticated sensor relay system using the smoothness of the dome for a higher efficiency in relaying and recieving signals with higher clarity. Obivously it would have to be some form of polymer so it isn't destroyed easily but that idea would be darn cool.(wait...I came up with that all on my own...oops)<br>
I hope the four thingies are weapons. If not then please remove them because they confuse the design unnecessarily.<br>
This one looks cool if not somewhat less useful than others.<br>
<br>
6. Artistically, I don't like how it looks really but it is practical. The antennae fins on the front look like they could do the job well too though they are however exposed to be damaged easily. The field of vision seems large and I doubt there are many blindspots an opponent can effectively use.The thingies at the back look like batteries?<br>
<br>
7 &amp; 8. Sorry to say I don't see how these are any better than the others in functionality. The field of view is poorer and offensive capabilities seems off unless all weaponry is hidden.(I guess the forward attachment on #7 is a horn? If an antennae then it's really vulnerable...)<br>
<br>
9. Another very good design. Except for the bugging powercable....will fare well in battle considering the categories I'm thinking of. <br>
<br>
BTW: #4 and #8 get extra points for creativity.(the top section of #5 too but only if it's a sensor thingie)<br>
<br>
Well that's it. I hope you see those mistakes and the improvements that can be made. Sorry if you expected me to just reply:&quot;Way cool&quot; because I'm actually of the opinion that does little to nothing to help the people who post here unless they post here for recognition and to feel good about what they draw...I'd hope not. This ain't a gallery.. <br>
