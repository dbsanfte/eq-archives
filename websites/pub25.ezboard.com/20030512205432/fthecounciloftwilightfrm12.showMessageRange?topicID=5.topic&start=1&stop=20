I just came to thank you for a lovely evening in Najena.  Nothing stirs up a Barbarian's blood more than killing Bonecrusher, the Ogre guards, Elementals and Darkbone skeletons.  Gilraen and I gained an entire season with your help!  Do you think I should wrap Feldros' souvenir from Najena before I give it to him?<br>

<br>
Probably not something I should admit, but I don't like heights.  I think I get that from my father's side of the family.  Or probably plumetting from one of Kelethin's higher platforms when I was a very young Ranger in there.  Well, this is certainly more lovely than anything in Kelethin.  It has a more comfortable feel; a sense of home to it.  <br>
<br>
Oake?  Are you home?  I wanted to thank you for the exhilerating time in Najeena.  And I also want to apologize for trying to kill you and Bryn.  I was possessed by the evil Linara Parlone.  Ah, the beauty and wonders of Lavastorm!  The fear and terror in Najeena!  Many many thanks for your kindness and guidance!  I have advanced an entire season due to your kindness, and have had new experiences I will always remember.  <br>
<br>
I don't want to alarm you, but I saw an Iksar slinking around the base of the tree.  Kinda cute, really.  Friend of yours?  He took off when he saw me, but he seemed to know the area pretty well.  I hope I didn't scare him off.  <br>
<br>
Sorry I missed you.  I must go now.  I have fletching supplies to pick up, and I'm scheduled for additional training at Surefall Glades.  I'll just leave these rabbit biscuits on the plate here for you.  I hope you like them.  Thank you again.  Looking forward to further adventures!<br>

Last night, Timmaer, our guild trades@#%$ was making and selling ruby veils to his guildmates.  I was wondering if you could advise me as to what would be the best face item for me right now (a 23rd season Half elf warrior woman).  I could always use the +4 STR for my combats and the +4 (?)

You wish to cover up that cute face of yours?  Well I suppose a warrior must do what a warrior must do.  I believe the main stat that you should be looking for is AC.

Ok...I have been meaning to address this. &lt;clears voice&gt; Shaman and Clerics are not tanks!  AC is great and all, but wisdom is your god.  True, shaman and clerics can melee decently up until around lvl 25, but after that, they become more and more group reliant.  There role is mainly that of the healer and buffer and occasionally the nuker(dependent on situation).  You may be thinking to yourself, &quot;But Oake, why would they give me such pretty armor if it was not what I really needed...&quot;  well I say to that, this is armor that is somewhat easily obtainable to you in the mid 20s and very easily questable by 30.  So why would they give you your best armor at such a young age, friend.  They didn't.  Totemic will soon be replaced by other items.  Most of the shaman that I know that wear totemic do it for the looks.  &quot;But Oake, I can take hits well, how do you really know I am a caster???&quot;  Simple, you get a pet...therefore you're no longer the main source of melee power...why would they give a pet to a melee class?  &quot;Oake, you're a druid...you don't know what you're talking about...&quot;  &lt;sigh&gt; I am a druid, but I do have dreams of living a life where I was a shaman...oh I did play well at least to my 25th season...(my that was long ago).  Anyways, to all shaman and clerics(pet peeve...don't mean to harp), once you start to get older and you're grouped with that warrior, let him hit...he does it so much better than you do.  sit back and take a support role...meditate for that extra heal or that extra nuke.  It could mean the difference in the game...so in short, learn to stay out the mix and meditate when you can.  In groups at upper levels, this will be expected of you as it is me.  Our powers come from our magic...not from our muscles. (even those big barb muscles).  &lt;puts the soap box back in the corner&gt; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uirides.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Irides</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>High Priestess</span><br>  Posts: 22<br> <font color=#8A2BE2>(10/25/00 11:11:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fthecounciloftwilightfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Soap Box</span><hr size=1> &lt;looks up at the sky and thanks Tunare for bringing us such a wise druid&gt;<br>

Amen!  But I'll have to admit, there are times when the whole evening is nothing but sitting and sitting... and sitting... with only the occasional heal needed... and then soon the buffs wear off so I re-buff everyone.  And continue to sit some more.  If we are hunting something that is fairly easy, then the life of a cleric can be boring.  But instead of taking out my knife and carving little trinkets out of the peices of wood I find near me, I'd really prefer to hit a little, blast a little.  You know, get some exercise.  I will have to admit that the most fun is to be had when the whole party goes through a totally bloody battle and I have to concentrate all my thoughts on keeping everyone alive.  But it's been a long, long time since I've seen such a battle.<br>

Feldros probably heard that.  I think he is now looking on the map in search of meatier creatures for us to slaughter.

Urlek sometimes solo's and has found some success against blues. Typically he blasts things until his mana is out and then he goes toe to toe to finish it off. I can certainly understand how melee will get tougher and tougher. I can see that happening now. I wish I had dumped more points into wisdom from the start. Oh well, I do see the need to start a transition over to more wisdom based items so I don't disagree with you at all. I have read a lot of Shaman posts saying they can tank. I am not so sure these people have played high level Shaman.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uoakeheart.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Oake Heart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 28<br> <font color=#8A2BE2>(10/26/00 10:15:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fthecounciloftwilightfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What a mess!</span><hr size=1> The best shaman tactic that I have seen at your level is root, dis dot, poison dot, med...re root, re dot, and when you think you can nuke it to death safely...ICE the sucker.<br>

Someday I hope return the favor with resurrection spells. I have a surprise for you.  Since I am a cleric of the Demi God Oake, I want to start showing my appreciation by building a temple to you.&quot; Nine opens up his back pack and pulls out a pickaxe, some orange painted wooden horses, a yellow miner's hat and his magic jack hammer. &quot;Um there might be a little noise and dust for awhile. Your tree might be a little obscured due to the scaffolding. Oh yes  and there is a large crane in the front yard.&quot; Nine takes a swig of Dwarven Ale. &quot;Ok here we go. Trust me you'll love it.&quot; Nine starts up the jack hammer. Whirrrr....... rattle rattle thunk snap! &quot;Oops. Hehe I'll fix that later.

<br>
I just wanted to pipe in here and hopefully be able to speak on Nine's behalf.  Since there was the level cap imposed, Mr. Oneone has been vacationing on Kerra Isle.  I mean, you know how tough it is to squeeze in work while adventuring, but it's pretty impossible when you're on vacation!  Hmm, hope Kerra Isle has a health club on it, would be a shame if he was out of shape when he got back and couldn't physically do the work.  But who knows!  Maybe he'll come back with a refreshed attitude, and be able to turn it out in no time!  But I wouldn't hold my breath...<br>
