The song and the story are called The Man Who Sold the World. It is sloppy, and has no ending yet. It is confusing as everything I do is, but Deal with it!<br>

<br>
The alarm buzzed endlessly. David Teadows then heard the voice, the voice who once had whispered in his ear, a long time ago. &quot;Wake up David. Open your eyes.&quot; He did as the voice said, but only partially, he peeked open an eye and was disappointed to see nobody in the bed next to him. Dave sat up and stretched. 8:35, wow, it was an early morning for him. He got the mail and saw a letter adressed to him, but beside his real name in parenthesese was his nickname one person knew. His fiancee.<br>
<br>
8:34 AM, Tuesday the Third on June. 1657<br>
<br>
David Teadows was a meek man, but this journey had strengthened him both physically and emotionally. He didn't let himself get pushed around anymore. Not by anybody. Except for one person, the person he would meet in just a few moments, The Man Who Sold the World. The strangest things had happened since he had begun the journey with Altea and Bard. He had joined the two because he was looking for adventure, he joined them to go to Mount Fago to get something. Bard said it was a treasure but Dave suspected differently. On the way there, creatures started appearing, they were monsters, tearing, ripping and killing everything in sight without knowing it completely. The trio learned that it was because a fateful couple had been split apart, a mans' wife had been slaughtered by someone still unkown. Not many people knew that though. The people who did had no idea why a womans' death would have such impact. Later in their' adventures they learned from Kopan, an old wise man, that the husband had been bargained into a deal by an unkown force. It was still a mystery what the deal was.<br>
<br>
8:47 AM Tuesday the Third on June. 2002<br>
<br>
David sat down at the dining table and opened white envelope the letter came in. He smiled as he unfolded it but frowned when saw it wasn't in soon to be Alice Teadows handwriting. Dave started to read. There was no greeting at the beginning:<br>
<br>
I've walked a million hills, David. So have you, I've lost a loved one, you will too.<br>
The Heavens cracked, I tell you.<br>
And **** arose.<br>
To prevent it happening again, meet me in front of the library, you will know when.<br>
<br>
8:47 AM Tuesday the Third on June. 2002<br>
<br>
David was starting to get tired, they had been climbing up these horrible stairs in the mountain for the past ten minutes. Whatever was at the top had better be good. The three did get to the top, where a big door that was cracked open a bit was. Bard irrartionaly pushed it open. Inside there was no treasure, just a man, and an empty room. Bard cried out in rage as Altea whined and sat on the floor. &quot;Noooooooo! You!&quot; Bard pointed to the man, who wore a hat and a brown cloak, he faced opposite of them. &quot;You took it, didn't you? Hah!&quot; Bard took hold of his axe and raised it to his waist, &quot;Heh, give it here and nobody gets hurt.&quot;<br>
