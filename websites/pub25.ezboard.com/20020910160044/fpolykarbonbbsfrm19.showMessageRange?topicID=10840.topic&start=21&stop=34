<br>
<br>
These are quotes on the US:<br>
<br>
&quot;Crime and homicide rates are highest in jurisdictions, such as Washington, DC, New York City, Chicago, and California, where the most restrictive gun licensing, registration, and prohibition schemes exist. <br>
<br>
Why are homicide rates lowest in states with loose gun control (North Dakota 1.1, Maine 1.2, South Dakota 1.7, Idaho 1.8, Iowa 2.0, Montana 2.6) and highest in states and the district with draconian gun controls and bans (District of Columbia 80.6, New York 14.2, California 12.7, Illinois 11.3, Maryland 11.7)?(49) (See Graph 18: &quot;Representative State Homicide Rates&quot;)<br>
<br>
Precisely where victims are unarmed and defenseless is where predators are most bold.<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------<br>
<br>
More guns in the hands of private citizens does not directly equate to higher homicide and gun accident rates. In the 20 year period of 1967 to 1986 the number of handguns increased 173% (27.8 million to 63.9 million) but the rate of fatal gun accidents decreased almost by two-thirds and has stayed at that low level in succeeding years despite a continued large increase in gun ownership. (Derived from FBI data.) In the 20 year period of 1973 to 1992 the number of handguns increased by 110% but the homicide rate decreased by almost 10%. (Don. B. Kates, Handguns, June 1996) In the 15 year period of 1974 to 1988 handgun ownership increased by 69% (39 million to 65.8 million) while total gun ownership increased by 47% (134.5 million to 198.3 million) -- but homicides decreased by 14.2%. (Don. B. Kates, Handguns, June 1996)<br>
<br>
NO NONSENSE IN NO. CAROLINA: The 4/6/97 Raleigh News &amp; Observer reports the State Bureau of Investigation has reported that not one of the guns carried by the 20,082 Right to Carry permit holders has been used to commit a crime. Lisa Price, Executive Director of North Carolinians Against Gun Violence and wife of anti-gun Congressman David Price (D-N.C.), was quoted as saying, &quot;I still think it's bad legislation, although it doesn't seem to have turned out as bad as we thought it would be.&quot; Well, she's half right! Meanwhile, North Carolina observed its first-ever Eddie Eagle Gun Safety Week as the state legislature and Governor Hunt honoured NRA's award-winning child safety program -- yet another way North Carolinians have shown common sense on the gun issue. &quot;<br>

<br>
I am for banning gunshops/shows and not allowing citzens to own guns privately. However I think its important that places like stores are to be liscensed to have a gun _on location_ if they wanted to. But they would have to get the _single_ gun from the government or the police department which would have to be checked every month.<br>
<br>
Taking the easy way out and banning all guns for everyone but the police isnt smart. Jewelery stores for example cant be defensless, there needs to be some kind of system that protects stores from robbers.<br>
<br>
Also in reality no one is going to have time to defend themselves with a gun if the person came to rob you personally and isnt occupied with trying to get into a cash register. Do you think you are going to run across the room to grab your gun when someone bursts into the room looking for someone to shoot? Is the guy going to sit there an ponder about if he should shoot you are not? People end up getting killed trying to do that.  <p><a href="http://www.newelysium.com"><img src="http://www.newelysium.com/forum/banner.gif" border=0></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ualucard1515.showPublicProfile?language=EN>alucard1515</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator <img src=http://contest.polykarbon.com/badge1.gif></span><br> <font color=#336699>(8/4/02 9:55:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10840.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.undeadart.com/forum/alucard.gif width=100 height=94></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Letter to Congressman</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> This time period was called NAZI Germany.

Oh Jesus Christ, there's no use even continuing this. I mean, the first thing you do is comparing anything anti gun to the Nazis, then it's pretty clear you're not going to listen to anything. If anyone did ban guns, do you HONESTLY think they'd go to those measure, or would be anything like Hitler.<br>
<br>
You guys are right, BANNING guns probably won't do a whole hell of a lot because people are too attached, and it might end up doing more harm. Yet no one in here even said anything about banning guns, just restrictions. And restrictions on guns that are made with the intent of KILLING PEOPLE. <br>
<br>
If you want your guns, fine. But you SHOULD have to go through a complicated registration process. It should NEVER be easy to get a gun. If ANYONE is allowed to own a gun, they sure as hell better prove that they are capable of handling it. But if if you are a person who has shown themselves able to handle a weapon, then in the end, you will get one, so I don't understand why people are so against restrictions.<br>
<br>
Okay, resume bringing up completely irrelevant articles comparing everyone else to Nazi Germany now. <p><table width=100% border=0>

Thats what the columbine kids did. That might be illegal but its not black market illegal since the person is buying the gun at a regular gun shop. Its the same as a kid getting a &quot;cool&quot; adult to buy them cigarettes, it happens constantly.<br>
<br>
I.E. an easy procedure would be to:<br>
-Get money from someone, buy them their gun from Longs &amp; Drugs or Wal-Mart<br>
-Give them the gun<br>
-Report the gun stolen.
