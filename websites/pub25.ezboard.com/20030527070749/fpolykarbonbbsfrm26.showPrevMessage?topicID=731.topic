                        *EDIT* New part of story<br>
<br>
Part 1 of Book 1:<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
Loki's Adventure<br>
To Space - Part 1 of 5<br>
<br>
        It was a dark and gloomy day as it often was in Neo-Tokyo. It was raining. Not normal water, but putrid water. Water that smells as bad as the sewer systems. Just like the rest of the slums. It was a hard life living there. Murders every day, people stealing, liers, cheats, and swindlers were haveing a field day. Everyday infact since the Wave of refugees left over from World War 3. Almost all of them homeless and jobless. They were just as bad as the thiefs ans liers though. Some of them at least. There was now three fewer countries in the world. Russia regained controll of Ukrain, Cuba was a crater, and New Zeland was filled with radio active gasses and was all but abandond. Numerous islands in the south end of japan were gone. Midway was gone, Hawaii was gone, California had split in 2 and half of it fell into the ocean killing millions. The world was in a wreak. The two remaining super powers were wary of each other. Japan And the U.S. watched each other like hawks though kept a grudging truce. Japan had launched nukes at the US. One was shot down but it got to close to the mainland and was the cause of California's destruction. The tidal wave that came from the blast took Hawaii. Japan was also responsible for Cuba, fearing they would launch a nuklear strike. The US however had launched a nuke that took out many island in south japan. US and Japan held the truce because they had Almost no means of fighting and it wasn't worth the risk of loseing more lives, and money to go to war.<br>
<br>
        Yes the world is in a mess, Loki thought looking at a news paper he had taken from some passerby. Loki stood about six feet tall. He had blue eyes, hed hair, but what made people shy away from him was the fact that he openly carried weapons. One was a katana, it looked well used due to the fact the colored cloth on the handle was faded and the scabbard beat up and worn. There was also the matter of the pistol he wore of his left side. It was a huge fifty caliber Deasert Eagle. It too was well used. Next to hime stood a woman. Her name was Mai, Loki's older sister. She stood there boredly. She stood at roughly the same height of her younger brother. She had on a long trench coat that flared out slightly around her thighs. she had Brown hair and piercing green eyes. She carried no visible weapon.<br>
<br>
        &quot;Oh hurry the hell up Loki, this is boring&quot; she said looking around at the differant people passing by. She was bored too. She had started taping her feet while her arms were crosed.<br>
<br>
        &quot;Ok, ok. Nothing interesting in the paper anyway.&quot; He tossed the paper away it landing in the street and was swept into a storm drain from the steady flow of water from the rain. &quot;Err... What are we doing out here again?&quot;<br>
<br>
        &quot;Ugh, how many time do i have to tell you? We are looking for a bounty&quot; she hissed to him, keeping her voice low.<br>
<br>
        &quot;Oh yeah, forgot. Well miss intuition where is he?&quot; Loki looked at her with a raised ey brow.<br>
<br>
        &quot;You know that look disturbs me Loki.&quot; She frowned at him then said, &quot;We're looking for a man known as 'Raven', or so he calls him self.&quot; At the mention of that name some passerbys ran for there lives. Mai grind at their reaction. &quot;First we're going to go to some dive he was said to frequent&quot; she said in disgust.<br>
<br>
        Loki grinned. &quot;What's so wrong with dives? Ha ha. Well? Lead the way. Don't look at me like that!&quot;<br>
<br>
        Mai wallked off heading for the dive. It was named the Hive, Loki discovered after the ten minuet walk it took to get there. &quot;Well? Shall we?&quot; Loki's said as he enterd the Hive. It was even darker in here then it was out side. And it smelled like a compost heap. Loki's nose cringed at the offending smell. Various of the customers sneered at them as they entered but they both ignored the sneers.<br>
<br>
        They walked over to a table and sat. A few minuets later a drunk man stumbled over to them. The drunk grined at Mai. She ignored him but he said &quot;hay lady lesh go back to my plash?&quot; He reached out and grabbed her by the color trying to force her up.<br>
<br>
        Loki looked at his siter and said, &quot;You want this one or can i have him?&quot;<br>
<br>
        Mai replied, &quot;No i can handle him.&quot; Suddenly before the drunk knew what happend, Mai had stood up grabbing his hand twisting it. The drunk was dubled over to try to lessen the preasure. Mai shoved the drunk foward and tumbled into a table. She then sat down calmly as if nothing happened. &quot;Some people....&quot; she murmerd. Then the waiter came over and they ordered their drinks.<br>
<br>
        When the waiter left Loki comented, &quot;You barley hurt him. You should've broken his arm or something.&quot; Loki grinned. He enjoyed breaking limbs. Ecspecially those of thugs and members of gangs. He also enjoyed shooting things. He was rather good at that as well.<br>
<br>
        &quot;That weakling? Not worth the trouble or questions.&quot; The waiter came back with their drinks. They waited a few hours before they decided to leave figuring 'Raven' wasn't going to show. Mai looked at the description of Raven one last time and at the patrons before walking to the door. Before they could get to the door it burst open. A man stood there with an evil look in his eye.<br>
<br>
        &quot;I hear you two are looking for me.&quot; he said staring at Loki and Mai. It was Raven... <p><center>

Does it have a chance?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> Sure, but the devil is in the execution.  Nameless top-secret government agencies trying to snuff witnesses is a common plot element (<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://exploitationnow.com">exploitationnow.com</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> makes lots of hilarious in-jokes about them).  Machine empathy is a cool power - I've not seen it that often.  Did Loki get bathed in whatever it was that made Danni a machine empath?  <br>
<br>
Am curious how the supporting characters fit in, especially the rival.  Will he narc Loki and sis out, and be given some gov't minions to assist him in 'retreiving' them?  Will he put aside his differences and assist them long enough for all of them to get into space, then resume his rivalry?  What's he competing w/Loki about any?  <br>
<br>
Looks cool so far. <p><hr noshade size=1><center><font size=1><a href="http://www.freewebs.com/taerx/"> My FreeWebs Home Page</a> (Not a lot there)</font></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ulokixiuhcoatl.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Loki Xiuhcoatl</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(7/30/02 3:17:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=743.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.boomspeed.com/lokiart/hobbez.jpg width=73 height=132></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The story of Loki Xi (Loki's first story)</span><hr size=1> The other characters will be used mainly in the very begining, though i might hold off on gerald until there in space. <p><center>
