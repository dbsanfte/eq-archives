<br>
I've run into a bit of a wall... I'm in Culinary Arts in College now, and it's rewarding but DIFFICULT and STRESSFUL. Lately I've been feeling like maybe I wasn't ready to be on my own... maybe it's just that I started the new section in the worst possible way, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> with a big f***ing head cold</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, missing the last 2 days and only having gone a full day on the first day, when everything was crazy... therefor giving me horrible nightmares of things to come... maybe it's that my section partner for this week is the class racist and I'm just waiting for him to insult my ethnicity, too... and maybe I'm feeling vulnerable because of the exaggerations in my head... but I can't shake the feeling that, after only being off of anti-depressants for about 4 months now, and having been on them for years previously, that I can't handle myself as well as I thought. This isn't a pleasant idea, this 'neon sign' I feel over my head that screams 'basketcase' to everyone around me. I'm just waiting for the nervous breakdown to come, exposing that status to everyone around...<br>
<br>
...have you ever told someone you suffer from mental 'problems', and watch all respect that they ever had for you as a human being just fly right out the window? You can see it in their eyes. Then it makes it worse. But hiding it is no better, because then you have to bottle it up inside... only to be let out at scheduled times when you have 45 minutes to see a medical 'professional' who is trained to 'deal' with you. <br>
<br>
I hate hiding something that's such a serious problem. Even my family doesn't understand. My mother is there for me, she says that I'm more 'cerebral' than most people... so I get troubled more by things, yet all she can tell me is to 'not be so hard on myself'. She still tells me 'maybe you better not tell people about your mental health problems'... but sometimes it's needed when a situation arises that can't be covered by another excuse. I'm a terrible liar. <br>
<br>
Again with the 'troubled by stuff' thing, it's true... I take everything so seriously that I feel far older than I really am... I read something interesting on birth order... (and for the record, I'm the youngest of two kids) there's this thing called a 'functional first born'. It's when a younger sibling takes over the tendencies and responsibilities of a typical eldest sibling, when that sibling fails to do their 'job'. Considering that my nearly 23 year old brother, the majority of the time, acts like a totally dillusional, immature dipsh*t, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> I think this explains something</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. When I was younger, I was impulsive, imaginative and free of a lot of responsiblity... which, somewhere deep down, I think I still am... and I need to be, to some extent. But now that I'm older, I'm torn between what I want and need and what is 'best' for everyone involved. I'm compelled by guilt to be 'responsible'. When I don't do well at something, I tell myself that I've let everyone down... but mostly it's my own expectations that I'm trying so desperately to live up to. A big fear of mine is that I will be mediocre and ignored for the rest of my life, just being another statistic, a person who pops out a few kids, lives in a bungalow in an ugly town working in a job where they are <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> completely replaceable</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, feeling absolutely miserable with regret over the things they missed out on. If you think this sounds like a description of my parents, that's exactly what it is. <br>
<br>
I feel that I'm meant for something so much bigger. People are supposed to say that only <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> I</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> am qualified to do something. I want to be in demand. I want enough opportunities that I can pick the best and ignore the rest. They should find it very difficult to compare me to anyone else. That's what I want.<br>
<br>
Well, anyway...<br>
<br>
I'm taking steps to appreciate life a bit more and balance things out... I know that I like Culinary arts, and even some of the pressure that comes with it, but that it's not healthy for it to be the sole identifiable worthwhile activity in my life. It's not good that the only stability I have is also my main source of stress.<br>
<br>
I used to take 5 minutes in the amphitheatre at school in the morning to appreciate the sunrise... my school is at the top of the hill that the whole city is situated on. I also did this to catch my breath, because the 40 minute walk up the gradual incline, in the dark, was harsh... but now I can't do this because the neighbourhood is too dangerous... and I found out that the reason why the walk was so hard on me was because my asthma that I had dealt with when I was younger has returned, even worse.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I'm still waking up and giving myself an extra 15 minutes so that I can linger over breakfast as I check my e-mail. I try to listen to some music while I get everything else together after that. I still need to do some more things. I feel that when I don't do artwork or sing, I go nuts... I have a strong compulsion to sing, and when I can't, I get depressed. Ideas I have so far include:<br>
<br>
-contacting the multicultural society in town to find something to do (my family was active with the equivalent, in my old town)<br>
-contact the art club at my college<br>
<br>
I can't afford vocal lessons and I don't have the time to commit to a choir.<br>
<br>
I want to do some artwork, but I've been too stressed to be creative... I don't think I've finished any significant work in months. Any ideas for getting inspired?<br>
<br>
Any other (constructive) opinions on anything I've said here are welcome. Keep in mind that a big obstacle is that I have very little time during the week days to do much... and I have to travel by city bus.<br>
<br>
I feel a bit better for writing all that... this is the only place where I feel I can post it right now. I had a frightening realization last night as I was bawling my eyes out that I really don't know anyone that isn't an hour's drive and a ferry ride away from me that knows a damn thing about my life.<br>

Generally a nice person... he doesn't seek out anyone he sees as different, but he makes highly inappropriate comments and has insulted (so far) my skin colour (being as pale as I am), Chinese immigrants and anyone of African origin. <p>'I'll try being nicer if you try being smarter'</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=windblade>windblade</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(10/17/02 1:16:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11311.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Well, life is just dandy</span><hr size=1> well DUH, why do you think she posts on bbs like this all the time?<br>

Not only would it be a pretty good place to get re-inspired, but you can find a good deal of people with similar interests. (Not that hard regardless, but the club type things tend to weed out a few assholes you'd otherwise be dealing with, because they don't want to be associated with a 'club', it sounds 'goofy'. Or at least that's how it is around here.) <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Getting re-inspired is something tough somtimes. Just don't try too hard. Think back to whatever compelled you in the first place, get back to your roots. Even if it's digging out an old sketchbook, laughing at how you used to draw/work, and saying 'Wow, I can do better than that'. Redrawing old pictures is always something to do to at least stay in the habit. Watch a movie, read a book, just sit down and doodle -anything- that comes to mind. Wander the web looking for art from artists you like or look up to.<br>
<br>
It's a long road, but I know you'll find your way if you really want to. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uwhitemage.showPublicProfile?language=EN>WhiteMage</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(10/17/02 1:26:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11311.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.sphosting.com/darkhalo/spme.jpg  height=65 width=65></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Well, life is just dandy</span><hr size=1> College is a very stressful time, and I imagine a culinary school is even more so.  I can kind of relate...I've gone through a lot of uncertainty and indecision regarding where I'm going with my life and future career.  All I can really tell you is to think about what you like and what you want to be doing on down the road and make your choices for YOU, not for other people.  That was the root of a lot of my conflicts...my parents and extended family had all of these expectations for me and I could never live up to them.  I know all about having to be responsible and the expectations of being an older child...I'm the oldest of 3 and the 'rents expect different things from the oldest than the others.  I can only imagine the conflicts you're having with the youngest-child freedom fighting the oldest-child role you've adopted.<br>
<br>
It might help you if you're getting overwhelmed by assignments and requirements in class to sit down and just make a list and prioritize the things that you have to do that week or that month.  It helps me to kind of get things down on paper, so instead of being in a big jumble in my head, they become defined and limited by being written down.  Sometimes if you write it out, it doesn't look like as much as you thought it was.<br>
<br>
As far as the art stuff goes, I haven't had a lot of time to do full CG work either, but I've done a gob of oekaki pics.  You might think about trying it out, because you can spend a few minutes to a couple of hours on something and get done, rather than having this big project hanging around.

<br>
-really, I have no friends left to talk to. My 3 good friends that I can still CALL friends are so busy with their own lives, that our schedules conflict and we don't get to hang out and hardly get to talk. One is still in high school, one is going into the military soon, and one is about to have a baby. My parents are the only ones I can really phone, and that's really a temporary fix.<br>
<br>
-I can't really plan my class priorities because I usually don't have the slightest notion about what i'm making or how i'm making it until the day it's supposed to be made! <p>'I'll try being nicer if you try being smarter'</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/umisterkyo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mister Kyo</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(10/17/02 2:02:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11311.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://misterk.8m.net/avatar.jpg height=130 width=130></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Well, life is just dandy</span><hr size=1> I can relate to your situation Lina. For the last year, i felt like i was trapped in a school of people who weren't like me. While i was attempting to work hard, they'd be wasting their time unintelligently chatting loudly. They never understood this and never tried to relate to me at all. Despite this making me seriously depressed, i eventually made it through. (school is basically over for me, only the exams to go)<br>
<br>
Anyway, during the last 5 years i've taken up stuff like meditation, yoga and physical exercise in my house to fill in the time. Now the only time that i'm stressed is when i don't do them for a week. Since they worked for me, i'll suggest those things. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Don't let things stress you out <p><a href="http://pub84.ezboard.com/bprojectk" target="_blank">

<br>
Actually, that's interesting.<br>
<br>
As I'm a little older than the average member (OK, I'll be 33 this month), I'd like to comment on that. It's true that mature people tend to be more responsible, but we certainly don't take life more seriously.<br>
<br>
Actually, it's the opposite. After awhile, you lose that hyper-focus you had as a teenager. You step back and re-evaluate. You have to. If I was to live up to all the expectations placed on me when I was younger, I'd be dead.<br>
<br>
All I'm saying is that you get second chances. And lots of them. Mistakes will be made, opportunities missed, you'll even have regrets. But don't think that <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> life as it is now</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> life as it always will be</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. Not at all.<br>

<br>
It's only natural to feel alone. I think you should get a pet. Not a huge one. A bird or hamster.<br>
<br>
I would suggest a dog, but seeing the pressure you under go at school a dog I think would be too much.<br>
<br>
Anyway if you care for the pet it will care for you. You can talk to it.  It will know you better than you know yourself. You won't be alone. And soon you won't be under pressure because some will be waiting for you at home who will light up once they see you. <br>
<br>
Well thats about it from me. <br>
<br>
I hope it helps.<br>

That guy that's racist, that's a bad place to be Lina. I mean you could talk to your teacher about this, really, he could probably be booted. I honestly wouldn't want to be in the same room with a racist prick like that old guy <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Sorry for the language but you see my point right?<br>
<br>
I myself have some gerbils...that I never talk to ....and I should pay attention to them =(<br>
<br>
Also I've started to take some tutorials on the net since I have a scanner and all<br>
<br>
My recent sketch on Pk is horrible by my standards and I won't let that happen again. This is keeping my mind off of sad thing I could be thinking about...but I need to get motivation for school, and that's stressing me out. I just can't seem to get the motivaiton! So I also have some delemma's Lina =o...<br>
<br>
But maybe excersise would help, I mean when I used to excersise (years ago) it really helped me out a lot. Just do some situps every day, or whatever suits you, it'll help just that much more.<br>
<br>
My sister seems to like to bathe (not shower) when she's stressed, and she takes about an hour (&gt;,&lt;), so maybe that will help you?<br>
<br>
Yep, I did look at some of my old sketches today and laughed, I have improved a lot in a short time, it's great! So try that!<br>
<br>
Also try treating yourself to something, a few movies, a run to a fansy restaraunt, anything to make yourself feel special.<br>
<br>
Try writing poems to express yourself, they don't have to make sense, just write what comes to mind.<br>
<br>
Maybe you could try putting a pillow to your face and screaming as loud as you can, screaming and screaming to relieve the stresses of the week.<br>
<br>
Well dont' do it too much cuz someone just might here you and yah lol.<br>
<br>
Try going to a local swimming pool, that always used to help me out a lot, =) Since i'm fat and I float like a booy I can just float around all day, but since I'm self concious I no longer go =(<br>
<br>
Well that's all the advice I can offer Lina, nice to hear from you and all but I'm sorry to here your stressed/depressed, I know how you feel...just stick to it! <p>Of course that's just my opinion, I could be wrong.
