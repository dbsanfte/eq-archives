<br>
<br>
                       World’s Oldest Sport<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Stone Cold Stunner,” “Rock Bottom,” and the “Stinkface,” are popularized wrestling moves from professional wrestling. Most of the general public has never even heard of a half nelson, cradle, or leg riding. These moves are not performed by paid athletes on national television for millions of bedazzled spectators. These moves are just a few of the immaculate repertoire of moves the amateur wrestler learns to turn into reflex. Amateur wrestling, often under glamorized, is a dying sport in today’s modern American culture. There have been many speculations as to the answer; from homophobic feelings towards wearing singlets, the small spandex uniforms wrestlers wear, to fear of catching communicable skin maladies, such as ringworm. With all of these speculations, one thing can be said for certain; amateur wrestling is much tougher than just overcoming phobias - it demands three disciplines of a person: physical, mental, and social strength.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Contagious conditions, stitches, illness, sprains, and broken bones, are just some examples of the physical toll wrestling can take on one’s body. From personal experience through my four years of high school wrestling, I can personally attest to having broken my hand, tailbone, toe, and two vertebrae; as well as having suffered from a concussion, pinched nerve in my neck, partially torn ligaments in my thumb and elbow, calcium deposits in my knees, and illness from sudden weight-loss, to name a few. Physically, no sport can compare to the demands put on the body. In order to survive the ordeal, which some of us call a hobby, you must be able to endure the stress put on you on a daily basis. Cutting weight takes a monstrous toll on the body; it may be asked that you cut fifteen pounds in three days, and you are expected to do so and then compete in a rigorous two day tournament, where you must make weight again on the second day. Practices often consist of almost torturous exercise, many times in multiple lairs of sweat clothes in rooms where the temperatures exceed one hundred degrees; for example, my wrestling room would often exceed 120 degrees on cold winter nights, when it was half of that outside; sweat would poor off of everyone, including the walls, which would have a cold feel from the cool night outside, yet, they would pour warm condensation onto the mat, drenching it; visibility was non-existent, as fog gradually would fill the room until it was too difficult to even see the wall on the other side of the room. Wrestling is boot camp - you are either quickly whipped into shape or you are shipped out.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Physical injuries are easy to overcome; on the other hand, emotional injuries often leave deeper wounds and larger scars. Amateur wrestling is as tough mentally as it is physically. Wrestlers pride themselves as being abnormal. What normal person would deal with the same adversities as a wrestler and like it? Strong will is perhaps the most important attribute of a wrestler; he cannot perform if he is not disciplined enough to lose the weight, endure the practices, and muster up that last bit of energy to score the final points of a match where his knees already buckle and his hand already trembles from exhaustion. Crushing defeats often haunt a wrestler for the rest of his life; personally, I do not remember ninety percent of the wrestlers who I have beaten, but I do remember the names of those who I have lost to. Perseverance and determination are true characteristics of a wrestler in a sport where success is dependant on last-second gut checks.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Equally as important as physical and psychological fitness in wrestling, is social strength. The sport requires almost total bequeathal of a wrestler’s time - you have no time for other sports, friends, or a job during wrestling season. Participants have to dedicate four hours of their time towards practice, and all of their leisure time lifting weights, cutting weight, and drilling moves. Important to the psychological psyche of an athlete, they must have understanding and supportive friends and family. Friends and family must learn to understand that wrestlers do not have as much time to spend with them as they would normally like to spend, and that they need to be there for their loved one to cheer and support them, whenever they may need. Socially, wrestling not only taxes the wrestlers, but their families and friends as well.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Edmund Burke once said, “The nerve that never relaxes, the eye that never blanches, the thought that never wanders, the purpose that never wavers - these are the masters of victory.” Steadfast determination and perseverance are the keys to success, which I have learned through wrestling. Wrestling taught me never to quit; whenever it becomes too hard to do any more, try twice as hard. I have searched my brain and have found no more satisfying feeling than the feeling I would get at the moment I realized I had just broken my opponent’s spirit - his will to survive; that, to me, was what wrestling is all about, a battle of spirit.<br>

I know I noticed at least one such sentence. It is deemed as poor grammar and poor sentence structuring. Also, as the others have stated, it would help to know exactly what your assignment was before trying to pass any judgments. I hope it turns out well. I also noticed, and I don't know if it will make any difference, that you never referred to amateur wrestling as Greco-Roman. Personally I find Greco-Roman wrestling very entertaining and am astounded at the endurance it takes to survive...what? 8 total minutes over 3 rounds of wrestling. It doesn't sound like much to those who have never witnessed or participated in wrestling but it's an agonizing and utterly exhausting experience. Good luck, Scallywag!

<br>
I changed that so it doesnt end with a preposition already. =)<br>
It now ends with ... names of those to whom i have lost.<br>
<br>
Topic was any that i chose... Last time i had to write a paper on defining creation... this sure beats that. =P. I found out that the paper wasnt due till Monday... Serves me right to skip class... But i turned it in anyways.. =)<br>
<br>
Amateur wrestling consists of any style of wrestling that u dont see on the WWF... (WWE)... It includes Greco-Roman and Freestyle (offseason), and Folkstyle (highschool and lower)... Highschool periods are 3 periods of 2 minutes.. Offseason periods depend on ur age group... Anyone 16 and older is 2 periods of 3 minutes... And college i believe has 3 periods of 2, 3, 3... i believe... i forget tho. Staminawise, it is very much like boxing, except, i believe, a little more tiring becuz u do more than just punch. For anyone who believes 6 minutes of wrestling isnt tough, go try it. =)  Ive seen dozens upon dozens up people throw up in matches and give up becuz they are so tired... Ive even seen a few black out. (most of the time people fake injuries before that happens tho)<br>
<br>
For anyone interested:<br>
<br>
Folkstyle:<br>
More conservative style of wrestling, as to prevent injuries... It is obvious why high schools and junior high schools endorse this style. Rules for this are no throws such as suplexes and powerbombs unless u can safe lead them to the mat by placing ur knee or knees down first.... Since its impossible to lead with ur knee ona  suplex, its basically illegal.<br>
Point System- 2 point takedowns, 2 point reversal, 1 point escape, 2 or 3 point nearfall (or 4 if the opponent is almost pinned but calls an injury), and pins are 2 seconds of the peaks of both shoulders touching the mat.<br>
<br>
Freestyle: (my favorite)<br>
This is probably the most exciting style to watch and one of the funnest to wrestle if you arent very very strong upper body. Suplexes and powerbombs are very legal in this style of wrestling and are rewarded... If you preform a move where u throw somebody, u get extra points for tossing them over your head... So, litterally, if you can suplex someone 20 feet and off the mat, u will score more points than just someone taking them down and it will be legal. Locking hands is legal in freestyle (locking your hands around someones body when they are on the mat.), which enables wrestles to do gut wrenches and rolls. No headgear is required to wrestle freestyle. Also, when taken down u are encouraged to stay down and stall (stalling is illegal in folkstyle and u get penalized there)... The ref calls both wrestles back to their feet if the top man can't initialize any kind of move in approx 10 seconds.<br>
Point System- 1 point takedowns, 3 points for lifting and taking down, 5 points for throwing over your head and taking down, 2 point nearfall, 2 point reveral, and pins are touch pins (meaning u are pinned the second both shoulders touch the mat.) U also get 6 points for a throw if u have taken your opponent down, u lift him up off the mat and throw him over your head.<br>
<br>
Greco-Roman<br>
Rules are almost identical to freestyle with one major exception... No moves involving the legs... Greco-Roman is upper body only and is basically upper body throws... It is very similar to Judo to watch, except u can't grab uniforms or choke. When taken down, the same rules apply as freestyle, except u can only use upper body moves to try and roll or pin ur opponent, such as gator rolls, gut wrenches, half nelsons, quarter nelsons, 3/4 nelsons, full nelsons, arm bars/chickin wings, etc.<br>
Scoring System-<br>
Exactly the same as freestyle except u get penalized for using legs...<br>
<br>
Hope this was informative to anyone who wants to know... Of course there is a lot more to know, but i dont want to kill ezboard. =) <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/flottdrinalfrm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=806.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/flottdrinalfrm1.showNextMessage?topicID=806.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/flottdrinalfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=806.topic&index=6><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/flottdrinalfrm1.emailToFriend?topicID=806.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/flottdrinalfrm1.threadControl?topicID=806.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/flottdrinalfrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=806.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/flottdrinalfrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=806.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub25.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="lottdrinalfrm1">The Courtyard<option value="lottdrinalfrm2">Ters'Tai Barracks<option value="lottdrinalfrm11">The Library<option value="lottdrinalfrm13">Applications<option value="lottdrinalfrm3">The Great Hall<option value="lottdrinalfrm14">Epic Might<option value="lottdrinalfrm8">Ters'Tai Marketplace<option value="lottdrinalfrm12">The Treasury<option value="lottdrinalfrm4">Council of Lords</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/blottdrinal>Lords of the Ters'Tai - Drinal</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/flottdrinalfrm1>The Courtyard</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.terstai.net">Lords of the Ters'Tai</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.0.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.<br>Accelerated By <a href=http://www.wbs.com/ezboard.html>JXEL</a></center></body></html>
