<br>
The Matrix and Terminator r 2 of my fave movies so the influence for this came from them.<br>
<br>
Backstory: AI has advanced thousands of years past what it is today.  It has advanced so far that AI can now create human beings.  these human beings r cyborgs.  they have all the traits that humans have.  they need air, they need to bathe and so forth.  the thing that's different is that cyborgs have ungodly strength and they can't die by getting old or getting sick.  The catch is that AI can't create DNA so it needs to borrow the DNA of dead people to create these cyborgs.  So to collect the DNA AI builds androids, and the androids r the pawns of AI.  Androids go out and collect the DNA needed to make the cyborgs by any means necessary.  Androids mimick humans, therefore they can be distinguished from humans.<br>
<br>
Main Story:  The world has been taken over by machines.  One third of the world's population is now androids and cyborgs.  That number is growing everyday.  The machines r hunting down humans and eradicating them so that they can have the perfect world.  A world without death, pain, suffering, and prejudice.  The humans fight back, but it's a losing battle.  The machines r too strong and each passing battle brings heavy losses for the human race.<br>
<br>
America is no longer called by that name.  It is now called &quot;New Haven.&quot;  The reason being that is has become a haven from the battling.  New Haven has a barrier around it that the machines cannot breach.  It is in New Haven that rumors start to circle that a long time ago a child was born that had the powers of the machines, but was a human.  But as stated, it's only a rumor.<br>
<br>
sorry for the length.  i'm workin on characters and after i get feedback on this i will need criticism on the main characters too. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=thesilenthero>the silent hero</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pre-Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(6/2/03 1:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm40.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=44.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re:need ideas to make this story original</span><hr size=1> keep the rumor a rumor nothing more noting less <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=acrisp>acrisp</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_bluespot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(6/2/03 2:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm40.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=44.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Re:need ideas to make this story original</span><hr size=1> Hm... I have some questions about this setup: consider this &quot;food for thought&quot; - the answers might help to generate more ideas.<br>
<br>
1. Why, when, and how did a machine race take over?  What is the origin of the machine race - common labourers, sentient networks, military machines, or something else?  Was the takeover violent or peaceful?  If violent, who struck first, and why?  <br>
<br>
2. Why do the machines need to recreate humans?  The Matrix used the &quot;living battery&quot; idea - so I strongly suggest you avoid that concept like the plague.  And why do the machines need to &quot;enhance&quot; the humans they are recreating as cyborgs?  <br>
<br>
Corallary/minor quibble: the machines are described here as having advanced thousands of years beyond the present day, yet they cannot create DNA and must get DNA by using androids.  This seems a little contradictory - even we humans in modern times know the chemical makeup of the four nucleotides that make up DNA as well as the supporting structures.  The Human Genome Project, which wrapped up a couple of years ago, has a complete map of all genes that make up <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Homo Sapiens</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  It seems very likely that we will have the ability to create not only new genes, but whole new genomes and new organisms, by the middle of this century at the earliest.  Machines which are far superior to us in technology and intelligence would find creating human DNA from scratch to be child's play - no sampling required.<br>
<br>
3. In essence, we have not two, but THREE distinct species here: humans, the machines, and the cyborgs the machines are creating.  There clearly is some hostility between the humans and machines, but what's the outlook of the cyborgs, which seem to be between both organic and synthetic intelligence?  After all, if our creations eventually saw us as enemies or as &quot;obsolete&quot;, does it not follow that the creations of the machines might start thinking similar thoughts about their creators?  <br>
<br>
4. What is the nature of the field protecting &quot;New Haven&quot;?  Is it a passive defense (some form of energy field and if so, how does it work and what are its limits?) or an active defense (a massive combination of early warning stations and weapons emplacements designed to shoot down hostiles?)<br>
<br>
Another minor quibble: aside from some possible ego-stroking, is there a plausible reason why the United States has become humanity's last refuge?   <p><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;Humans are the destroyers, be it of themselves or others.&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

<br>
Robots were just robots.  they weren't labourers or anything else but everyday robots.  humans kept making AI smarter and smarter, until one day AI didn't need humans anymore.  AI functioned completely on it's own.  Before the war against the machines, there were small squabbles between humans and machines.  the leaders of both races tried to have peace talks but there were those machines that felt that they didn't need to coexist with the humans.  this bad faction attacked the peace talks and killed the human  and machine leaders.  at the same time this faction attacked other places on the globe and this was the beginning of the war.  and the reason for the attack was that this faction felt that the world would be better without the imperfections of the human race.<br>
<br>
i chose america as being a haven because it is away from the rest of the world and surrounded by water.  well south america is also considered &quot;New Haven.&quot;  the barrier around the barring (sp?)straight is where the defense is the heaviest being that there is only 50 miles of ice between alaska and russia.  the actual defense is those robots who have decided to fight along side of the humans.<br>

<br>
New Haven is surrounded on all sides by a defense barrier.  these posts consists of heavy artillery and the posts r shielded by EMPs.  these post go out as far as 250 miles off of the east and west coasts, and the post increase in numbers the closer you get to the shores.  <br>
<br>
New Haven now consists of not only North America, but South America as well.  A point of interest and a point where defense is the heaviest is Alaska.  being that there is only 50 miles between Alaska and the former U.S.S.R.<br>
<br>
the reason for the machines to create beings that rely on air is for them to blend in and mix with their environment.  the machines do not want to humans to be able to distinguish machine from man.  therefore it makes panic and confusion in the human race.  sorry for the length but i have a lot of other things that have been running through my mind that would make this story more understandable.  i will post those up later. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=armartin>ARMartin</A> at: 6/18/03 7:10 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=agentcryrid>Agent Cryrid</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(6/21/03 7:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm40.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=44.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Re:need ideas to make this story original</span><hr size=1> I can see them being designed to breathe air, but not having to &quot;need&quot; it.  <p>--The only things I want to give you are orders. </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=otakunothing>otakunothing</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(6/22/03 8:27 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm40.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=44.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Re:need ideas to make this story original</span><hr size=1> sorry but the basic idea of the story is way too unoriginal to do anything with it.  i reccomend to start over.  one thing that seems to help me when im writing a story is to get an idea of what message you are trying to get across to your viewers, once i have that then it's ussually really easy to come up with original ideas.  i dunno, it works for me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>-----------<br>
