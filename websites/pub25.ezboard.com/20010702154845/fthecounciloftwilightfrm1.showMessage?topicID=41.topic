Being KOS with the druid rings does not necessarily mean you're KOS with Surefall Glade.  They are different factions, but tied together on a few quests.  The Surefall Glade faction is JaggedPineTreefolk, and the druid rings are ProtectorsOfPine.<br>
<br>
First thing you'll want to do is make sure how badly your Surefall faction got messed up.  Heading into Surefall with invisibility up, go find the first person in there right by the entrance.  Select him as your target, head over near the zone, drop invis and con him.  If you're not being scowled at, or have people glaring at you threateningly, find Vesteri Nomanoi and try talking to her.  She may give you a quest to head over to Qeynos and give a claim ticket to Nesiff in South Qeynos.  Give him the claim ticket and he'll give you a wooden statue, mostly good faction, except down with the Qeynos rogue's guild.  Give that back to Vesteri and you'll get the valued Surefall glade and druid ring factions, but down with Unkempt Druids.  Only place I know of Unkempt druids are in Rathe Mountains, so they're not really essential, plus you got a lot of faction with them while killing the treants.<br>
<br>
If you don't have enough faction to do the quest, head over to Blackburrow and slaughter a few hundred gnolls.  The quest part seems easy, just probably tedious and boring.  If you really don't care about your druid ring faction and can be careful about it, skip it or do it a bunch if you have the time.  I guess the Surefall faction doesn't matter too much if you don't go into Surefall, except for probably a few NPCs in Qeynos Hills and Qeynos (Holly Windstalker being one of them).<br>
<br>
So I wish you luck in your decision whether or not to fix your faction, but it definitely seems possible if you want to.  Hope this helps!<br>

I WILL fix my faction with druids, SureFall Glade, etc.  I'm pretty sure my SureFall Glade faction is down since one of the factions hits was QRG.  Doesn't that stand for Qeynos Ranger Guild hence SureFall?  I don't know, I had 4 bad hits.  Guards of Qeynos, Protectors of Pine, QRG, and something else.  Killing gnolls seems to be the way to go, and maybe a few bandits.  Are unkempt druids only found in Rathe Mountains?  Aren't there bad druids in EK?  I will atone for my sins, I do want to do this.  Remember, powers that we cannot comprehend moved my hand into killing treants.  Not an excuse, a reason!  But thanks thanks!  And thanks to Oake!  <br>

Castersrealm.com lists all the factions possible.  GuardsofQeynos and ProtectorsofPine I can fix by killing gnolls.  JaggedPineFolk and QRGProtectorsofAnimals from what I've read, I cannot fix.  Those two tie into SureFall Glade.  Is that a loss?  Not really, I have no point in going there, if I need something, I can ask someone or just create a mule.  But I just wanted to be honest!

But the loot and exp. is unbelivable.  I played about 4 hours last night and I easily made 100p killing them.  And now that I constantly check to see if a banker is needed there, am I soaked with blood money as well?  Maybe sometimes I have to stray into the darkness, to truly realize how wonderful the light is.  <br>

And with the zone to Dalnir so close, it's not that difficult to flee if things get sticky.  Well, for faction, I guess more killing of Blackburrow Gnolls is in order, so good luck with that!  Who knows, that might open the doors to do the courier/statue quest.  Well, I hope I gave you an outlet for alternative hunting, the brutes are rarely camped, so it's quick and fairly easy exp.

Thanks for the concern!  I feel the love! I do!  I know there's always alternatives than to killing treants.  I got caught up in the moment.  Yeah, I know Skulking Brutes give exp still at my level, but as Ribs, I was getting very little when I reached 28.  I'll have to bring him out, he's currently in the evil city in Overthere.  29 is another big level for him, new spells, and my pet can start dual wielding.  But maybe I'll bring him out when the others come out and play and level up.  Quite a few of us have characters in their early 20s, we can't forget them!  Opus, Brynhilde, Urlek, Stabb, and I see Marken rising up quickly.  I suggest we rise them up, when we feel like it to 25 or so.  Some of the others are still 25 or so, and it'd be great to have standby heroes when we all can group again, if that's possible.  With Feldros and some of the others out of the loop, I know they would want us to level.  Leveling together is very hard, and believe me, I'm all for it, it makes for great grouping, but we all have to spread our wings and truly soar.  <br>

Like I said in an earlier post, powers that none of us comprehend, move my hand.  I know not why I kill treants, or why I continually bank for tree killers.  Do I have a will of my own?  Most assuredly.  But...at times forces in the universe move us in mysterious ways.  So while you may want to gut me and do vile things to me, I have nothing but pure love for you, always!  It never unwavers, well, maybe a few times here and there.  But I stay the course!  I must!  For your cheeks do flap in a glorious way, that even great Tunare would approve.  And I do atone for my sins.  The Qeynos guards do like me. The druids I'm sure like me better once again. Surefall is another matter entirely.  <br>

I have atoned for killing treants, and continually do so by killing raiders and gnolls.<br>
My heart is still pure (most of the time) but like I said, and it's not an excuse, but there are mysterious forces in the universe that pull and tug at us.  Call it part of the great Pattern (some of you will understand that reference).  And we do things accordingly to the Pattern, but at times we change the Pattern ourselves.  And if my killing treants was al part of the Pattern, then that's just the way it goes.  I have admitted my wrongness.  And I can't feel shame all my life, that won't make me a better wizard, a better fighter, a better person.  <br>

I'll kill more gnolls in BlackBurrow when I have downtime.  Sigh.  <br>

Easy kills, but great faction hits.  I love killing them!!  Anyway, I'm running to where the raiders are parked, when I see druid NPC's.  Then one of 'em starts attacking me!  NNNOOOO!!!  Sigh.  I zoned to SK.  I knew I was KOS, but to actually be attacked by them...yikes, it puts things in perspective.  I have go kill more gnolls in BB if I want to fix faction with them.  Maybe when I have super downtime....bah, maroons whoever pulled druids!!<br>

I made my way from Oggok through the Rath Mountains and into South Karana. There I met up with a buxom barbarian wench named Brynhilde. We spent a night hunting birdmen and horsemen. These petty creatures were entertaining but the next night I found my way to the fabled Treants. Here I met up with a group of friendly Ogres, Trolls and Dark Elves. I also located my friend Curlington and convinced him to join us. At first he was afraid of the wrath of the Druids but I appealed to his EVIL instincts. He gave in to his lust for wealth and glory. Oddly another high elf enchanter and a halfling cleric joined us too. Perhaps not all the 'good' races are so 'good' after all. I tried to convince the wench Brynhilde to join us. Why would Barbarians care about what a few Druids or some petty Qeynos guards think? Alas she was fearful and chose a lesser path to follow. <br>
<br>
Well we formed our death squad and in the next several hours we must have killed over a hundred of these creatures. I was covered in tree sap and chunks of splintered wood but I didn't care! These creatures carry much gold and silver. I made 150p in the time I was there. I had to convert the coins with the Ogre banker but it was worth it. Innorruk awarded me with level 24 and I quickly progressed through this level and now approach level 25. I kept a souvenir wood heart as a trophy of this great slaughter. I really HATE these creatures and I must kill some more of them very soon. The Dark Mistress will be proud of me!<br>
