I liked it better than T:2, and that is saying something for me.  It follows the 'sequel' rules, in that it outdoes T:2 in every respect.  Bigger this, and faster that.  It was slick.<br>
<br>
What I Liked:<br>
<br>
It progressed the plot much more than T:2.  There is a lot more development in this one.  Also, I feel it gets down to the roots of what an action movie should be.  That I will explain when this thread is open to spoilers.<br>
<br>
What I Didn't Like:<br>
<br>
Again, no specifics till people are talking about spoilers.  There are just a good handful of examples where the suspension of disbelief is too difficult.  There are just a few things that are incredibly unbelievable.  No, I am not talking about the fact that robots are traveling through time to save the military commander of mankind.  Nothing like that.  That would fall into the genre plotline.  I am talking more about technical oversights. <p><br>

The pacing was rather fast, and a lot of the scenes didn't feel real, where I remember the T2 cyberdyne scene felt a lot more realized than a lot of the scenes in this film. <br>
I'd go into it more, but I think you'd just have to see it for yourself. <br>
<br>
I'd also hoped a little bit stronger of a plot... but instead the movie writers played God and set some rules up (mainly concerning time). <br>
<br>
Also the T-X was just not... cool. :/  <br>
<br>
I was pretty dissapointed, but still entertained.<br>
I have a feeling James Cameron will shake his head at this one.  <p>Sorry... try again<br>

<br>
First off, the movie is just not on a serious dark tone as with the other Terminators.  Every chance they get, they try to make the Terminator into a fool, with stupid lines, and even dumber things he does.  I don't want to ruin anything so no specifics.<br>
<br>
However, the intro consisted of a black screen, with white text that reads &quot;Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines&quot;  with NO music.  Um, if correct me if I am wrong, but shouldn't it have flashy intros with the Terminator theme?<br>
<br>
Which brings me to the next part.  There were rarely any music in the movie, even action chase scenes.  All chase scenes are shot in daylight... so NOT terminator like.  The T-X was put in the movie to mainly entertain the male audience. <br>
<br>
This is just not a Terminator flick, it was a bad Arnold flick, most people laughed throughout the whole entire movie, including me... then when I stepped out of the theatre and realized that Terminator genre wasn't suppose to be funny.<br>

Hell, this one didn't have much of a plot when you really think about it.  I mean really, bad T model comes to kill, good T comes to save the day, same as T2.  That's fine and dandy but don't just make the destruction bigger and FX cooler, give me more, dammit.  To me, this movie to me was just a remake of T2 with a new cast (minus Arnold), that's all.<br>

In alot of ways, this is the way I kinda wished T2 would end. Instead T2 kinda took the happy ending where everything ends up ok. <br>
<br>
Also this time T is COMPLETELY outmatched. He really never stands a chance save for some kickass weapons and a little luck. Yes, the T-1000 kept me awake at night worrying that my closest of kin would suddenly stab me through the head with their arm knives while I was drinking milk... But in this case a suspense was built in the fact that the Terminator was nothing more than a shield and the cannon fodder humans pretty much needed only to run. The situation was much more grim (now that I think about it, grim on the same level.. Still trying to stop Armageddon..)<br>
<br>
On a visual level I think that T3 pretty much bests the other 2. The camera angles and visual candy are far more impressive. With modern technology the director could capture some of the 'unbelievable' action much better. The scenes where Arnold and TX are whomping the @#%$ out of each other in the bathroom is not an image I can recall being impacted by as much in the first film.. You really believe these are two 2000 pound robots going at each other. Also in terms of plot differences I think that the overall goal and premise was the same: Stop the end of the world; stop bad Terminator. But aside from this I also enjoyed the story of John coming to terms with his own inevitable fate. We get to see how no matter how hard he tries he cant stop his fate.<br>
<br>
Also I think the Conner actor in this film was much more tolerable than the preteen conner of old. The old actor was far too whiny and '90's cool' for me. They tried WAY too hard to make him seem badass. In this film he's not so much badass as he is paranoid and unwilling. Having the origins of Skynet and to a lesser extent the idea of his generals was a good turn. <br>
<br>
Finally, without spoiling anything, the ending surprised me as to what was going to happen. I was expecting a T2-like ending with a definitive, story ending um...ending. Though some could say the last one had something akin to this, I expected it moreso now. The final shots of the film are very grim and left a very funny impression on me. That's pretty crazy whats happening and you wonder if something like that could ever get that bad. <br>
<br>
In conclusion I also enjoyed the acting. Arnold was a machine, good. Conner was believable and never over the top, something many people dont seem to find in other big movies of the time in their hero (ie Neo in Matrix where some dont too much like Keanu's acting). And Kristina (I think) was a very good Sarah Conner character, not believing any of the situation until half of her close relations were dead. <br>
<br>
Overall: Good as a Terminator movie. Exactly what people were looking for. Action plus a discernable plot line with some obvious draws to its former roots. <p>~Trunxx</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=trunxx647>Trunxx647</A> at: 7/3/03 1:24 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kwiix>Kwiix</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://bestanimations.com/Balls&Buttons/Buttons/Button-06.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>R</span><br> <font color=#336699>(7/3/03 6:32 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12519.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.pacbell.net/kwiix/RFightBlack.gif height=104 width=105></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> R</span><hr size=1> It's kewl that people liked the movie.

Ok, this is what pisses me off, and I mean <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>pisses</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> me off.  The title of the damn movie is rise of the machines.  The trailer (teaser?) showed the robots stepping outta a body of water, the floor of the pond/lake is made up of skulls.  Why couldn't they tell the story from after judgement day?  <br>
<br>
Let's see the battle between machines and humans.  Show us Conner sending T models back in time.  Continue the story from there.  Time travel back if you want, but don't just insult us by trying to redo old stuff.  <br>
<br>
T2 was a better movie in terms of expanding the story.  We learned that the technology for these robots came from Arnold's arm from the first movie.  The movie was dark and the T-1000 was <br>
kewl at that time.  It was one of the first big computer fx movies (watching him go through cell bars was badass at that time and watching him come up outta the checkered floor was insane).  Everything about that movie was fresh.<br>
<br>
This one?  The only thing new we learn is that Conner is gonna get married.  That the dad of his future wife is the one that heads the early Terminator projects, including Skynet. That he's gonna get killed in the future by XXXXXX.  That his kids are important.  Blah.  Hints of things, that's all.<br>
<br>
What, it would have cost them too much to CG skeleton Terminators for long periods?  This movie cost $175 million.  Guess that all went into the destruction of cars, buildings, and stuff, which was kewl.  Nice fight in the bathroom, I agree.  Funny one liners too.  <br>

<br>
What I mean is that if everyone had just seen the ending to T2, then everyone would believe, as Sarah Conner did, that they had averted Judgement Day. Basically it wasnt going to happen. This movie built on the premise of what if it did still happen?<br>
<br>
All in all T2's ending left you feeling like all the loose ends were tied up. This descision was most likely made by PR people who thought audiences wouldnt be satisfied with an ending more akin to this one. Not that I know for sure, but it seems that when you listen to audio commentary on DVD's directors are always saying how they wanted something one way, but the higher ups made it another, more 'audience friendly' way.<br>
<br>
Basically I meant that this one had a much more open ended finale and T2's could have been left at that and the series could be over. Thats what I'm trying to say. <p>~Trunxx</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=p1zzaman>P1zzaman</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(7/3/03 10:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12519.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.zhenglongrestaurant.com/payne.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: R</span><hr size=1> I believe that the whole movie Terminator 3 made Sarah Connor's struggle completely worthless.<br>

I might have missed a scene of them getting into the base since I had to run out and make a phone call.<br>
The movie is a good matinee retelling of the second movie. Someone mentioned above that this is how the second movie should've been and I agree.<br>

<br>
First off, not everyone is going to like this movie but I beleive its mainly because they themselves miss alot of what it has to offer. <br>
      Everyone complained because ol cameron wasnt going to make this movie that its gonna blow, well in my opinion cameron can go $%*# a cow. Although T2 was awesome this one is paced much more in an enertaining fashion.<br>
<br>
For one thing the ending....Cameron tried to cop out on it by taking a &quot;happy&quot; approach that everything ends up ok....I always hated that for the simple fact they destroyed one building.....woopty do there where probably 50 backup research facilities across the country. Blowing one up doesnt stop it...just slows it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Although for the time the T-1000 was cooler, but in the middle of the movie he is nowhere to be seen, you almost forget about him, so much for tension there. The TX was one persistant mofo and completely outmatched the t-800 model making things a heckuva lot more dynamic.<br>
<br>
Although there was a slight lack of character depth, everything worked. Not to mention the actor that portrayed conner in T3 was brilliant.<br>
<br>
To add another complaint ive seen is the fact that people wanted this movie to be about the future war, this movie explains how the future war will happen and quite brilliantly might i add. This is how terminator 2 should have been <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I have alot more to add but i wont bore anybody.<br>

God, if there had been something with Vault-tec on it, I would have spooged.  Seriously, it was fallout right down to the washing machine sized computers!<br>
Anyways, the movie was okay.<br>
Not quite as thought provoking as the others, and definitely not as noir.<br>
Although, I must say, the &quot;Talk to the hand scene was damn funny.<br>
And Kristanna Loken is damn hot.  I suppose that opens the door for all kinds of bad humor. (She could terminate me, har har har)<br>
*Spoilers ahead, but if you have gotten this far down the thread I should not have to say this*<br>
In response to it voiding Sarah's struggles, remember that she buried all the heavy arms in her coffin.  Would someone who thought humankind was safe do that?<br>
The final area out in the desert was not skynet, as was explicitly explained.  Just some place for the prez to hide when the sh!t hits the fan.  Although, why not NORAD?<br>
Loved the scene when Ahh-nold crams the power cell in TX's mouth.  Mua ha ha!<br>
It wasn't better than T2, but it was more entertaining.  This one was dumbed down to be merely an action film, and succeeded.  I don't think that anyone was not impressed with the crane scene.  And I laughed my ass off when he kicked the fire fighters out.<br>

<br>
wtf is this? Where in the movie (T2) does it ever say &quot;the war will not happen&quot;... hell, infact there was an alternate ending that was shot for T2, in which it jumps to 1997 and shows Sarah explaining the war the didn't happen. THAT is your so called &quot;happy&quot; ending. The current ending of T2 says nothing on whether or not the war will happen, the writer left you to decide on what will happen for yourself.  <p>Sorry... try again<br>

<br>
Technically they don't really need Arnold...<br>
<br>
I mean, scenes where they send him back in the past would need Arnold, but we already know that happens, and we don't really need to recap on that idea. Say it in text, and get it over with, stick to new areas of the story. <br>
<br>
Personally, I don't need a T4. But if they want to make Terminator 4, make it a new license, as it won't really be about Arnold the &quot;Terminator&quot;. <br>

Plain and simple.  Without ahh-nold, there is no reason to go.<br>
<br>
My theory with removing the second cell was that it was like getting shot in the heart, you already are dead, but you have about 30 seconds to say goodbye.  And that was his big goodbye.  Although it makes one wonder why the TX couldn't have had a weapon using that technology.  It would have been far easier to kill John if she could have just thrown a bomb that he had no chance of outrunning the blast.<br>
And why didn't they use some sort of EMP bomb?  They had it right with the magnetic field from the particle accelerator, but a good blast of EMP should take out any terminator.<br>
Oh well, that just means more for T4.  (It had better have Arnold, Dammit)! <p>I wish I had a Kryptonite cross, because<br>
