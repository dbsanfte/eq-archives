<br>
I guess that would be another senario. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     <br>
<br>
As I had promised waaaay back about 20-somethin posts ago, here's my char's stats-<br>
<br>
Name-Aisya Blue<br>
Age-About 19 <br>
Height-5'7&quot;, 5'8&quot;<br>
Weight- somewhere around 120-130<br>
Fur- Light Brown w/ Black Stripes<br>
Hair- Jet Black<br>
Eyes- Very Light Blue<br>
Attributes- A very tall, mystical character.  Personality wise, she seems to be quiet by nature, but is known to be a fiesty character.  Not known for strength, but has cat-like agility and is very skilled in the area of martial arts.  Knows how to control her chi, and use it at will.  <br>
<br>
Backstory- Born in an old-fashioned small forest village, Aisya was subjected to old-fashioned ways.  She was raised to fend for herself and live off the land.  Being trained since early childhood in the form of martial arts, not only is she very skilled, but also she is the best in her class by far.  <br>
<br>
In a time not too long ago, a frantic turn of events changed her once set-coursed life forever.  Due to severe droughts and attacks other tribes, her agriculturally-driven villiage suffered from a lack of crops which led to more troubles.  With villagers both broke AND starving, the village elders had no choice, but make a one-ended deal with shady dealers to keep their home from certain destruction.  <br>
<br>
As times went on, the dealers became more violent to the mistreated villagers who were unable to pay their debts.  Soon enough, the villagers (including Aisya) became more restless themselves (with their only way of life in jepordy) and eventually rebelled.  Though a valiant effort, unfortunately all was in vain.  The opposition, admiring her abilities, took Aisya away and forced her to work for them.  She hated it, but with her village on the brink of destrution and the burden on her shoulders, she reluctantly complied.<br>
<br>
Now working for people she detests, she constantly is trying to find a way to destroy them and save her village she loves so much.<br>

Wanted to become an adventure cause its a family thing. Got hooked up with Terry Silentblade, a rogue who used her to extract payments.

<br>
Only because neither of your character seem the killing type.<br>
<br>
The &quot;prove herself to him&quot; is a great idea, but I don't think would ever happen.  Soldier Boy's head is to tripped up on chivalry ideals to ever let a women fight on her for what ever reason.<br>
<br>
Plus Ever Moon finally proves her self to him on her own by beating the snot out of him (showed him how little she was <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>
<br>
Worse yet the back story you just made for your character, Kai, SOLDIER be it Lydon/Ever Moon or another team of soldiers would have eventually swarmed your town and helped it out.<br>
<br>
If not that, they would have eventually come and help, or my characters after hearing of your characters plight would want to help.<br>
<br>
Now that doesn't mean we still can't come up with a good solid reason for the conflict, but it is important to know the psychology of my characters to keep good substance in the story.<br>
<br>
But I do like the way this is developing, we'll make it work. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=psychosoldier>Psycho Soldier</A> at: 1/31/02 4:45:31 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ukai321.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kai321</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(1/31/02 7:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=503.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.namcoarcade.com/icons/icon_t4mlaw2.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: *snickers*</span><hr size=1> Psycho Soldier: <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     Hmm...she may not be the killing type (unless she was pushed around hard enough), but considering her backstory, I would guess that she could be the *cripple to almost dead* type...I dunno.  <br>
<br>
Speaking of backstory, we could say that SOLDIER did in fact, come, but at that time the damage was already done, but they would stuck around to help pick up the pieces for awhile.  But sooner or later, the SOLDIERs would have to leave for another job, and then that's how the *ahem* &quot;opponents&quot; (<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    ) keep their vice grip on the village (which is why Aisya still works for them).  Will that work?  I dunno...We'll figure it out.<br>
<br>
Andrew Rouge:  Just cause your story isn't overly lengthy and convoluted like mine, doesn't mean it's bad...*I* even like ur story better than mine (because urs had more thought behind it).  There's much that I envy about ur story, such as the rich deep chars such as Kiyone and the bastard sword, lol (which my story lacks).  <br>
<br>
Oh yeah, go ahead and keep drawing...don't let us stop u.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <br>
<br>
<br>
P.S.  I'm stuck in an artistic rut when concerning my backstory...who should the &quot;opponents&quot; be?  A corporate business?  Another village?  A band of rogues (no pun intended, Andrew)?  One really evil sinister dude (like Sephiroth) with a gang of evil, backstabbing ruffians behind him?  Some kind of syndicate or something?  I need an idea.<br>
<br>
P.S.2 (ha)  I like the way this story's going...this has the potential to become something big.<br>

Excellent though <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<br>
And, I may have an idea. Okay, so Soldier came and bailed out your town. Now, any Evil Corp would be quite POed that they got beat back from their goal. So of course they returned, and this time they struck with an even greater vengence. This time, soldier wan't around and Aiysa couldn't beat them herself. So, since no adventuring party could be hired under the iron hard grip of Evil Co. Aiysa was forced to serve them. <br>
<br>
So of course, Evil Co. is P.O.'d with Soldier and selectively uses Aiysa to handle them at times. She hates her service but its her only chance to protect the village. So, she does her best to save her targets, but sometimes has to beat them within inches of their life.<br>
<br>
Sooooo, she ends up in the village where Kiyone is, on a mission to get Moon and Soldier Boy. So, this gets us a lil tighter fight. She annoys Kiyone, and Kiyone draws her sword to start a brawl. So (I'm using this word too much <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) Aiysa stumbles into your classic mistaken identity syndrome (perhaps Aiysa only got a vague description of Moon). Brawl starts and people start fleeing cause its scary! Moon and Soldier see this and walk in to see what's happening, and being the goody goodies that they are, come in to break up the fight. Aiysa is starteled by their appearence, knocks Kiyone down and goes for them. <br>
<br>
Now Kiyone's confused and can't figure out what to do. So her heroic tendencies kick in and she attacks both parties, since she can't figure out who to help. <br>
<br>
As far as soldier, maybe he gets knocked out by a lucky shot? Kiyone has had some moments of stupid luck (killing ogres with thrown bastard swords, knocking people around with thrown things). And even the greatest hero has bad luck. Maybe Kiyone hurls one of the shelves at the group and hits Soldier? Kinda weak and a lil comedic, but it could work. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=psychosoldier>Psycho Soldier</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(1/31/02 11:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=503.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Oh!</span><hr size=1> Knowing me I have a few minor quarks about that idea, but hey we all need to be flexible <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Hmm, couldn't get mine to load up? I'll have to take a looksie and see what's wrong.<br>
<br>
And yup, I was working on the first pages. Should be around a week for me to finish.<br>
<br>
I figure order would probably be- Me, Kai, Psycho. <br>
<br>
Now, a semi-important question. Should I sort of open to where Kiyone challenges Aiysa? That could lead into a flashback scene for you to explain a bit. Then I assume it'd move to Psycho and he'd, uh, do something... Hard part now is getting this all to flow.<br>

<br>
Which conveniently works REALLY well.<br>
<br>
See as it goes, SOLDIER has out-lawed mercenarism and guilds that promote advanced training in an art that hasn't been sanctioned by SOLDIER.<br>
<br>
It's steep in a bunch of red tape and propaganda that it's to prevent the wrong type of power and influence ending up in the wrong type of person's hands.<br>
<br>
Well my friend (which I'm also fighting <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) has a mercenary guild that's training methods rivals even that of SOLDIER.  In our fight my Soldiers get into a heated fight with a set of his mercenaries while they were conducting an investigation.  --one to many &quot;illegal&quot; actions on the guild's part that calls for a more a direct approach in gathering information to get the guild shut down (again red tape)--<br>
<br>
So, there lies the problem with the guild, highly trained individuals which act on bias of money, not what's right or wrong.<br>
<br>
See the grand master plan here only get's better, because...<br>
<br>
1) it's more fuel for the story of one of my other fights...<br>
2) they're strong opponents, which would explain how your character got so strong, which could make it easier to under how she could take on the greatest of SOLDIER.<br>
3) it just works to damn well not to do it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
I, of course, should my friend if it's all right, but I'm sure he'll say it's okay, hell, he'll even probably give me some characters we could use.  Characters, being the faces we see that are suppressing your town Kai.<br>
<br>
--note-- this doesn't mean the mercenaries are doing this on there own time, they're being paid, the actual group paying for this, well I still don't have a idea for you on that one.<br>

Actually Soldier (the story) is based in a Fantasy/Sci-fi setting.  But more inclined to fantasy on this bias...<br>
<br>
Sci-Fi has a lot more distance fighting (I.E. beam guns) and universal destruction.<br>
<br>
So, as far as my little world goes, science for better or for worse is infantile.  But science produces more efficient killing devices, guns (ballistic), air ships, etc.  Also science produces medicines that are far more reliable, but harder to come by (ones that work that is).<br>
<br>
But science and magic have their benefits, and that's what I love about a world mixed with the two, remember Moon is the bastard child of both Science and Magic MHWA HA HA HA! <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=psychosoldier>Psycho Soldier</A> at: 2/1/02 9:55:20 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uandrewrogue.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Andrew Rogue</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(2/1/02 10:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=503.topic&index=39>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ...</span><hr size=1> So, maybe sort of a high fantasy, low tech world?<br>
