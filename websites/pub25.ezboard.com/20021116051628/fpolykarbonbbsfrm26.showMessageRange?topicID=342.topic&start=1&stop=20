And chaos hmmm i like the supporting character and i like the villian.  The hero should be like 007.  He should be a man of many woman and shorta nice. Not really aroogant.  The city, in space sure not a bad idea but lets make it just a normal fantasy city, not a broken down town.  But good job.  Now i had an inspiration last night but wasnt at home, so i had to remember it.  Ok now.  Our main character was being held hostage and was part of a huge expirement.  Our villian, was running test on him.  He gave our hero powers like super speed,force fields charged up with his mind, and other neat powers.  Our hero was given so many powers he escaped the underground lab and the mad docter. The docter builds these super biengs(like agents) and starts to hunt down our hero. while outside of the lab he meets someone.  This someone does not no it but he is kinda like the one (but we cant call it that)  In his mind is the plans for some big space station or something. The only way to get the plans is to hook him to a computer or something.The plans were given to him by the Ruler of all space(a good guy).  The evil docter wants to maintain these secret plans. So he kidnapps him.  It is up to our hero to get his friend back.  And well that is it all in a nut shell. Tell me what yall think. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uinfestedmatrix.showPublicProfile?language=EN>infestedmatrix</A> at: 10/7/01 4:26:40 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ufalcondelta.showPublicProfile?language=EN>FalconDelta</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(10/7/01 9:36:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=342.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://hipolymer.virtualave.net/images/Delta.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Team of fantasy/action writers</span><hr size=1> ( this is a long string, but i outline the basics of a story, sorry if there are typos, I didnt have much time to proof it)<br>
I kinda like the space city idea. It gives more leverage to touch on political issues of our current societies, such as city pollution, over crowding, etc etc. The broken down fantasy city is good, but hackneyed. I agree the space city idea isn't anything novel either, but it would allow the razor to have a sharper and more defined edge. Also your superhero is a bit cliche, not a bad start, but its not quite realistic enough. He's got skill, women, and super powers...its fantasy, but that alienates the reader way too much, no one could ever relate to that. That sort of character would work well if we were writing a sort of satiric-comic in which we present the main character as someone who thinks he is super-human, but as we find out in the story he encounters one mishap after another. If we have a comic in our midst this may be an angle you want to take, but most likely the protagonist will have to have a slightly more realistic back. <br>
 Here is the idea I had, <br>
We start out on the space polluted whatever city, per gothics suggestion, the opening scene is our main character sitting in some classy type bar, but he's in the back corner, amongst a more subdued lighting, not dark, but shadowed. This gives a sense of ambiguity. He's inbetween being in total darkness and being fully in the light. This can be at times used to mimic both his physical and mental state and can be incorporated as a motif. He is unsure of the life he wants to live, hence he is now traveling the middle road, but the road is an over-used way to show this, I much prefer the light-dark method, since it can have other implications which are applicable to our story. The main character is an assasin, but he hasn't killed anybody in a while, he's a bit out of practice as a first encounter shows, but quickly gets back into the groove. He's the descendent of some Earl on the planet so he has money, when he's out he dresses well ( i.e. clean pressed suit, tie, etc) and attracts women constently, but since he is an assasin he can never have any of them. Usually his encounters in this way are brief, lasting one or two nights only. ( we can use this to touch subtly, on the frivolity that exists between men and women in society now adays.) We find out that his rich business type brother has just been killed, and he is out to get the killers. This however is only a sub-plot leading to a much larger one. He is somewhat alienated from the rest of his more aristocratic family, hence his location in such a city. The business with his brother is that he got involved with a syndicate and the deal went south. When our main character gets finished takin out the people that killed his brother, he meets a woman who has heard about his family and is on intimate terms with the lads uncle. She's the main character's age, and by intimate i mean she knows his uncle well, they're not invloved sexually. Anywho, The main character is always wanting to get back to his family again. This woman offers him a 'connection to the past' essentially. We learn that our protagonist somehow left his family with his brother of 15 years senior, for some reason in the past. At this time the protagonist was too small to know the real reason. Now after meeting this woman he begins to find out more of the story about his family's past, but why he left and why he can't get back is still unclear. After his uncle reveals some troubling information about the past, (his family controlled by subvert assasination the politics of a planet for several centuries and it was fated that one day one of two moons would bring down the family) the one of two moons is our protagonist but he doesnt know this. As his uncle is about to reveal the nature of the protagonists exit from his family, he is killed. Leaving the girl hurt, she falls back on the protagonist for housing and protection. But he feels that it is difficult to provide this due to the nature of his work and this becomes a real burden for him (at this point he stops seeing other women, because he feels he has an obligation to the girl), Things happen, he kills a few more people, and finally ends up in the old imperial city, run by a group known as the Pendants, touching on a frendship made in the initial chapters to a syndicate member, our protagonist with his friends help goes after the Pendats, soon he descovers however that the Pendents and his family are one in the same. The climax is he has to decide whether or not to kill his own father and the woman he had cared for, turns out she was leading him on all along (i.e. set up by the Pendants, although she is low on the food chain) She confesses that she loves him and but feared for her life all along and had no choice but to continue to obey the Pendants, since they were always watchin over anyway. The protagonist admits this to be the truth and accepts her love, as she never caused him any real harm and was on the most intimate of terms with him. However, he can not deny the atrocities that his family has comitted and assasinates the leaders of the Pendants, (his mother died helping he and his brother escape) he learns a few more things, the ending scene is he and the woman looking off from a hill on his estate into the distance. The implication is that they will still be together, but will never marry.<br>
Let me know what you think of this...<br>

Love that metaphore you were talking about. Nice outline, but there would have to be a few little sub-plots two get things moving.<br>
<br>
It seems though with the ideas i posted befor confused people. What i was trying to do was give diffrent examples on how something could be set up. Like &quot;something could be like this....or this....or perhaps this?&quot; But it seems it didn't matter, you guys seem very adaptive. <br>
<br>
As for the main character, how about he appears very sauve but underneath there is some dark secret or some sort of medical condition? Like a weakness? Next up is to develop this character further..<br>
<br>
Now on to the female character you mentioned. Being female i hate those type of women who are weak and such, and i've talked to other girls about books containing such characters. They didn't like them at all. So perhaps to get a better response, mabey she should excel at something rather difficult. Perhaps she could be an excellet fighter, or a intelligent scientist? Lets think about that.<br>
<br>
One last thing, as for the set up for the world. I like that space idea. Perhaps due to over crowding ect. people had to move out farther. There could be diffrent colonies on planets, each with there own diffrent enviroment, as well as large ships used for housing, transportation, buisnesses,schools ect.  If we did that there would a lot of contrast.<br>
<br>
I know i said the paragraph would be the last one but i lied....only one more okay? As to get action into this, Falcon's idea of the Pendents could give quite a few fight scenes. Along with that, since things will be in space there could be super nova's, black holes ect. in which our hero must escape. Also...a little humor relief would be nice, such as in a sarcastic backround character. One musn't be seriouse for to long. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/umylak.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mylak</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(10/8/01 1:16:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=342.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://mylakovich.homestead.com/files/pics/ngpclance.gif height=66 width=75></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> a few supporting ideas</span><hr size=1> well, lets see, if the character is an assassin, but he's rich and sees a lot of women, what kinds of things does he own? does he have a spaceship, or hoverbike, does he relate to poor people or does he always sport around in style?<br>
and if he is an assassin, that means that during fight scenes he should be able to waste a lot of generic thugs. what weapons does he use, and how does that relate to his personality. What devise will you use to give background information to the character, and what supporting characters are there that bring out certain characteristics in him? What stylizations will you include to make some things have more visual effect, you mentioned the light and dark, what other ideas do you have?<br>
<br>
i agree that unless this is esentially a generic love story, you should have a stronger female character.<br>
<br>
the synopsis is good, and provides the skeleton for what may become the story. adding a few details and making a list of the essential things that must be included would be helpfull to focus your ideas. <p><BR>

My original idea was for her to be an assasin working for the protagonists uncle. You see the uncle actually is on the main character's side but he doesnt know it. He thinks his uncle is out to kill him but he's working against the Pendants. The girl is actually a double agent, she was raised by the protagonists father and then left to live in the city with his uncle. They knew the Uncle would turn out as a lemon so they set the girl up with him. She is super good, better than the main character, and the Uncle while he thought he was eliminating part of the Pendant circle was actually being used to knock off some local syndicate members who were acting up. The female assassin is very good. The problem I ran into was that she has to work with the main character. I broke down when i couldnt figure out how to have them get closer to the Pendants while still having the girl cary on the image that she is genuinely trying to help him. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uinfestedmatrix.showPublicProfile?language=EN>infestedmatrix</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(10/8/01 6:21:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=342.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ok lets work out the kinks</span><hr size=1> Falcon, First off thanks for the input. I loved it.  There are just a few things maybe that we can change.  <br>
<br>
-first,off i agree the character is to traditional, maybe we can have some defect to his fantasy like powers.  When something happens he starts to hurt. or something like that.<br>
<br>
-second,ok i like the plot of the story but it is kinda like a love story.  Like he falls in love with this girl who really is out to kill him. I dont know if u have seen Antitrust but that is sorta like the same thing.  <br>
<br>
-third,There needs to be more action.  Like on the way home from the bar in the begining he is drunk and really loses his mind.  A couple of (Agents) created by the enemy highjacks his car and brings him to thier base to expirement on him.  Like i said in the other thread.  They give him his fantasy powers.  Using these he becomes smart and escapes.  Then the enemy (agents) are searching for him.  ( The main theme is that usually he is the hunter, the assasin, but now he is the hunted.)  Having no place to stay he visits his uncle then finding out the history of his family, he becomes mad.  Stuff happens he gets in a few fights, and is chased around.  The girl teams up with him, so he can get his life back and be normal.  If she is a scientist then she can bring him back to normal.  Then well i am not sure what happens next.

We might use it as one of the sub-polts for i think it has relevence but as far as the entire theme goes i think we should forego it. I think identity crisis would be a better theme, he thinks he is one person but realizes after talking to his uncle that his past is much larger than even he himself realizes. This is troublesome and disorenting for him. As far as drinking and going mad, this isnt an angle we should take. Its not really feasible that an assasin would degrade himself to this sort of level. Its just, i dunno, i dont like it too much. He'd be crap as an assasin if he were always drinking and mad. It needs to be a sort of internal conflict, he is trying to bring light to the darkness that resides in his soul.<br>
<br>
I did see anit trust and no i wasnt thinking about it at the time when i concieved the relationship between the girl and the main character. I agree it needs to be reworked a bit. I was inbetween having her as a double agent and simply unaware of what is going on. I think a love story is important to the message of the text, however. I wanted to show that even though there is an apparent hate for the world that love and hate can be simultaniously found.<br>
<br>
I think I should scratch the double agent idea. I'm beginning to think of it as a lemon. Maybe it would be better if she were some how connected with the family, but unaware of what was going on. How about this, she was the daughter of a rival syndicate and in a raid by the Pendant special team she is abducted. Very young she does not really remember her parents. The Pendants set her up with the main characters Uncle who essentially acts as her guardian, she trains with the Pendants for a while but she is loyal to the uncle. She doesnt remember her parents and she loves the main characters uncle like her own father. When he is assasinated (by the pendants) she wants revenge. It happens that she and the main character are after the same thing. Although there is an initial animosity they find themselves joining forces then falling for each other near the end. That way we can have a subtle love story, its a sub-plot not the major plot. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uchildprodigy11.showPublicProfile?language=EN>childprodigy11</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(10/10/01 3:36:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=342.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Team of fantasy/action writers</span><hr size=1> the planet that he lives on could be sorta like a waste land where buisness groups like the mafia are in control.<br>

Try a group of people, who have been powerless their entire life, and have tons of emotional baggage, suddenly coming into unbelievable (god-like) powers. And then make THEM your villains. Power is one of the most dangerous features any antagonist can have, and when one has never had power before, abuse of power is thrice as deadly.<br>
<br>
You can definitely base this around scifi themes. I know, because several of my unpublished works are futuristic and logically scientific. You can do pretty much anything with an enormous leeway on physics.<br>
<br>
Just a suggestion. I've been thinking about a balance of power theme for a while, and if you don't want to use this idea, I'll gladly take over. The balance of power theme? Your &quot;villains,&quot; the people who come into power, have a rivalry between each other, due to natural varying levels of aggression (this is proven psychiatry, THE main reason for every argument you've ever had with someone. Now imagine being in an argument with someone, and you have the power to completely massacre the opposition). Their rivalry will most certainly become devastatingly catastrophic.<br>
<br>
Heh. Like I said, you can use this idea if you want. If not, I'll use it, since I've been developing the plot for almost four years now.<br>
<br>
I might decide to sign on with you guys, if you want. I've been screwed over with my latest project, since it so happened to be on my computer when my hard drive was wiped out *growls*. SO I'm free to do some work now. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :hat --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/pimp.gif ALT=":hat"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><b>Gaealord Gabriel Angelo Maokai III</b>

You said very succinctly, what we can use as a key theme. If you take the time to read my post I was sorta going along those lines. The 'Pendants' our villans are essentially the type of group you describe, people that were once powerless that now have emense 'god-like' power the main character is tied to these people, but has been seperated from them. Read my posts, I think you'll find we have similar ideas.<br>
Also I have read the Crucible...If you are aware of the history that book was written to parallel the red scare and McCarthyism of the 1960's, The author had some communist affiliation. I'm sure your well aware of this, though. Although the power issue is prevalent in the story it also has a lot to do with people own fear and the ways in which we prejudge others. Anywho I could go on for hours on that so I'll stop here...<br>

<br>
I was referring to how people react to gain power, which is what happened during the Red Scare <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> and</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> the Salem Witch Trials. They used the power given to them by simply being there as a witness to turn people against each other, and betray friends who defy them, and cast vengeance on those who were in their way. And murder, if needed.<br>
<br>
Just a way to look at things when involved in the matters. Don't make the villains antagonists because they can kill people, make them antagonists because they can turn others against you, ruin your ability to return to society, and then kill you. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :hat --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/pimp.gif ALT=":hat"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><b>Gaealord Gabriel Angelo Maokai III</b>
