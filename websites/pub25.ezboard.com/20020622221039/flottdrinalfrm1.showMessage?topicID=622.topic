Courtesy of oakthorne@livejournal.com<br><br><br>&quot;This always works in the movies&quot;<br>The MM says that staking a vampire kills them, but there are no called shot<br>rules and undead aren't subject to coup-de-grace. So you can't actually<br>stake them.<br><br>&quot;We don't need thumbs here in the Abyss&quot;<br>By the MM errata, all outsiders with an Int of 6 or higher are proficient<br>with all martial weapons. This includes Hellhounds, Howlers, and Nightmares,<br>among other quadrapeds.<br><br>&quot;You backwoods Dwarves still dig, what ever for?&quot;<br>Wall of Iron produces real iron as an instant spell (so it can't be<br>dispelled and is non-magical) and by the price guidelines on PHB 96 &amp; 114<br>and the Avaibility guidelines on DMG 137, you can hire a wizard to cast a<br>spell that produces roughly 1800 gp worth of iron for only 500 gp in any<br>small town or larger settlement. And yet iron mining supposedly exists in<br>the game world.<br><br>&quot;Like, you know, like that.. an stuff... anat, right?&quot;<br>Simulacrum produces a creature that has among other traits 51-60% of the<br>&quot;speech&quot; of the original. Does that mean that it leaves random words out of<br>... or do it just use small words when talk?<br><br>&quot;All the commoners round here always die off at the same time every year&quot;<br>The extreme heat/extreme cold rules render much of the real world<br>uninhabitable as everyone in Fairbanks in winter or Phoenix in summer takes<br>enough subdual damage to render them unconscious in just a few hours.<br><br>&quot;But I'm as strong as Heracles, made my save, and was carrying a Spade of<br>Digging..&quot;<br>Regardless of size, strength, tools on hand or reflex save result, anyone<br>caught in the bury zone of an avalance is pinned and must wait to be rescued<br>rather than being able to dig there own way out.<br><br>&quot;So that's what those pointy bits do...&quot;<br>The 20th level Expert Trapmaker with Search, Profession: Trapmaker, Craft:<br>Trapmaking, Knowledge: Famous Traps and Knowledge: Magical Traps all at 23,<br>cannot attempt to find a trap if the Search DC is over 20, but the 1st level<br>rogue with none of those skills can.<br><br>&quot;I know he fled into the woods, but first, we'll check at the inn&quot;<br>A Successful Wilderness lore role to Track lets you track somebody for up to<br>1 mile indoors, and in fact you get to retry more frequently indoors than<br>outdoors.<br><br>&quot;................................ouch.&quot;<br>Since according to PHB 121, free actions can only be performed while taking<br>another action, and since you can only take an action on your initiative,<br>and since by Table 8-4 on PHB 128, &quot;Speak&quot; is a free action: By a strict<br>reading of the rules, you must wait until your next action to cry out in<br>pain after being hit in combat.<br><br>&quot;Wall of Orca&quot;<br>Running away from someone? Need to block a passage? Well, have we got a<br>solution for you! Summon monster V allows you to summon a celestial orca.<br>The critter has (on average) 85 hit points and it can thrash around and<br>attack anyone trying to get through. Much better than a wall of stone. And,<br>since it just goes back to its home plane when it &quot;dies,&quot; you don't really<br>have to feel all that bad.<br><br>&quot;I'm not exactly feeling myself today, and neither am I&quot;<br>A small spellcaster with a tiny familiar can use Polymorph Self to turn back<br>into himself. And he can use Share Spells to have his familiar also turn<br>back into &quot;himself&quot; at the same time. There aren't many spells that<br>specifically allow you to break the normal constraints English grammar has<br>on reflexive pronouns.<br><br>&quot;Wow, I didn't realize dragons beer-goggled that heavily&quot;<br>The various &quot;half-&quot; templates can be applied to any corporeal creature<br>(Alignment permitting).

How?<br><br>&quot;Transmute Rock to Stone&quot;<br>Type elemental provides immunity only to poisons, sleep, paralysis, stunning<br>and critical hits. So it is still possible for a Gorgon, Medusa, Cockatrice<br>or Basilisk to petrify an Earth Elemental.<br><br>&quot;Trees; you can chop 'em down, but you can't change 'em with magic&quot;<br>As per MM 6, plants are immune to polymorphing. Presumably this includes<br>Polymorph any Object, even though the spell description uses &quot;vegetable&quot; as<br>a classifier.<br><br>&quot;So much dropping a GP off the Empire State building&quot;<br>An arrow fired from a bow or flung via Telekinesis deals 1d6 or more damage,<br>yet the same arrow dropped from a great height can never deal any damage,<br>since it weighs less than one pound (DMG 89, column 2)<br><br>&quot;Azathoth's Gibbering Explained??&quot;<br>Deities are capable of casting Contact Other Plane to converse with<br>themselves - but they &quot;resent such intrusion&quot; and even have a flat<br>percentage chance of lying to themselves.<br><br>&quot;All things are not equal...&quot;<br>50ft of chain = 10lbs. 50ft of hemp rope = 10 lbs.<br><br>&quot;Mad cat!&quot;<br>A house cat, accoring to the MM, can deal 3 damage with two claws<br>and a bite. (Minimum damage is 1 HP for an attack.) And a peasant has<br>1d4 HP. So don't tick off kitty!<br><br>&quot;It's Big, It's Heavy, It's Wood!&quot;<br>Since a club costs 0 gp, a Limited Wish spell can create an infinite number<br>of clubs, causing the plane to collapse into a black hole.<br><br>&quot;Why yes, I did bring weapons for the entire army&quot;<br>Since the sling has both cost 0 and weight 0, and you can generally find<br>ordinary stones for free, there is no mechanical reason not to carry a few<br>million around in case you need to arm a peasant uprising.<br><br>&quot;Dagger, Greatclub it's about the same&quot;<br>The MM errata failed to amend the Tarrasque's Swallow Whole ability to<br>mention the usual stipulation that you can only cut your way out with a<br>&quot;light slashing or piercing weapon&quot;<br><br>&quot;If the horses ever catch on, we're in trouble&quot;<br>A whip cannot even deal subdual damage to any creature with a +3 or better<br>natural armor bonus. This includes all horses, which makes you wonder about<br>coachmen and the use of riding crops.<br><br>&quot;It's all in the trunk&quot;<br>Dire Elephants, as described in MotW, have a +23 skill bonus to Climb, and<br>are listed as having speed 40 ft., Climb 10.<br><br>&quot;It's Not So Good Up Close When They're Standing Still&quot;<br>Although it ignores armor (as it normally requires only a ranged touch<br>attack to hit), and is specifically noted as creating a &quot;magical arrow&quot;,<br>Melf's Acid Arrow cannot be used to perform a Coup de Grace against an<br>adjacent foe in the manner a normal bow can (PHB 133). For that matter,<br>neither can a sling, although a hand crossbow works<br>just fine.<br><br>&quot;Never trust a used weapon salesman&quot;<br>Despite the really cool part about the ability not allowing a saving throw,<br>that's just clever advertising intended to distract you from the fact that<br>the complete destruction effect of a Mace of Smiting only functions when you<br>deal a critical hit to a construct - which are not subject to the effects of<br>critical hits. And watch out for those vorpal weapons too, they have to be<br>fabricated using a spell that doesn't exist in 3rd edition.<br><br>&quot;Butter-fingered Balors&quot;<br>Balor's vorpal sword is only a +1 weapon... This means that it's almost<br>entirely useless vs most other demons and devils. Why don't they simply get<br>a +5 keen or defending weapon? Is that so that they don't accidently cut<br>themselves?<br><br>&quot;He's just faking it...&quot;<br>Despite being blind, Grimlocks have a Spot check of +3.<br><br>&quot;Class-ical Blunders&quot;<br>Apprentice-level paladins have lay on hands as a class ability, but have an<br>effective level of 0.<br><br>Wizards, druids, and monks do not have Unarmed Strike as a weapon<br>proficiency and the druid loses all abilities for 24 hours if she tries to<br>punch someone, or if she Wild Shapes into an animal and bites them.<br><br>A Cleric with the Water Domain can turn Fire Creatures like a normal cleric<br>turns Undead. So Clerics with the Water Domain can turn Red Dragons. In<br>fact, the only dragons that cannot be turned are white, the weakest of all<br>colors.<br><br>&quot;In the eye of the beholder&quot;<br>Hill Giants are described as &quot;oddly simian&quot;, who &quot;seldom wash&quot; and carry<br>&quot;filthy, and stinky&quot; possesions.
