<br>
As for this being a futile argument, because I believe that is what sounded most condescending, I say that in the sense that I can see this going somewhere (or rather, nowhere) where opinions will stick, and people will be set in there ways. Something for which I don't want to bother contributing to the escalation of, in terms of posts. So I bow out of the actual argument, itself. If, of course, it comes to character, that is an area I will leave open for my own defense. <p>Disclaimer: All opinions voiced by Lina may potentially be only so-much-B.S.

I've seen alot of children, raised alot of different ways.  I've come to the conclusion that a child truly doesn't need spankings.  Children who do not listen to their parents can seem unbearable.  But, put that child in the care of a parent who is not afraid to be firm with the child, and suddenly the child's behavior will change for the better.  Children are not emotionally developed, and their personality isn't fully developed either.  A child doesn't know anything about the way society works until someone shows them.  In short, a talking to is as, if not more, effective than a spanking. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ualucard1515.showPublicProfile?language=EN>alucard1515</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator <img src=http://contest.polykarbon.com/badge1.gif></span><br> <font color=#336699>(12/12/01 9:46:18 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.undeadart.com/forum/alucard.gif width=100 height=94></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: anoyign brats shoudl be SHOt</span><hr size=1> Your opinions are not always pegged down as wrong...<br>

If you only choose to remember the times that someone disagrees with you, then I can't help that. But do not tell me I always single you out as wrong. In fact, I even said that I wasn't on one side or the other, so technically, I wasn't even really disagreeing with your opinion. The only thing I disagreed with was the way you talked to Hiro, and yes, he could have worded his post better as I said.<br>

You're not being singled out, you are not being pegged down as wrong all the time.  <p><table width=100% border=0>

Personaly, think my mom did, and is doing a great job.  especialy since she did it mostly by herself.  I was spanked if i did something wrong...though because it hurt her hand, she'd use a wooden spoon.  It didnt realy hurt...just a little sting, but enough for me to get the idea taht what i was doing was wrong..and next time i'd think twice. (or try reealy hard not to get caught.  heh heh.)   And, freinds of mine who's parents didnt physicaly discepline them have common traits.  though there are always exceptions.  <br>
little kid having a tantrum because his parents wouldnt buy him this new toy...and they say, &quot;quiet now&quot; and they get home, the kid's still kicking and screaming, &quot;now now. that's not nice&quot;.   never a finger laid on his bratty behind.  now he's breaking every rule, no respect for his parents, and jumped out of a moving car on the way to the airport...<br>
that doesnt necesarily happen to all kids if they're raised like that.  but it happens to a lot.  all that i've seen.  I think that &quot;spanking&quot; is hitting, but it's different then hitting in anger.  You dont get disceplined because your parents dont like you, or because their angry at you (usualy.  the occasions in which things happen otherwise are most unfortunate) but, usualy, because they love you, and they'd rather not have you go through life with the hot stove technique.<br>
somebody tells you a stove is hot.  so?  do you believe them?  maybe, maybe not.  and you touch it.  ARGH! THAT HURT!  learned you somethin good didnt it?<br>
if at an early age, you dont share your toys with your younger brother...and you beat the crap out of him.  and all your parents do is waggle their finger at you and say &quot;stop that. that's not nice.  go sit in the corner for 5 minutes&quot;...your gonna have a tantrum, yell and scream, and most likely do it again.  then, in most cases, if you dont have any other positive outside influences or roll models, you'll grow up to be mean and selfish.  Key word, most cases.  i'm sure there are people raised like that who turned out fine when they got older.<br>
<br>
Parents have different ways of disceplining their kids, some work better then others, some dont.  some work better for other kids then others, and you can't tell until you're too late.  my little half-sister (my sister.  nuf said) is easy to get along with...luv her.  But, every other weekend she spends with her dad...my ex-step dad.  Every other weekend she comes back almost as bratty as my older sister, whom i like to refer to as satan.  he spoils her rotten, she has a tantrum and he abides her wishes.  then she comes home and is suprised my mom doesnt obey her every single little command.  and when she has a tantrum, she gets slapped in the but once, and sent to her room.  after a day she's fine again.  once she gets used to our rules again.<br>
<br>
The way i see the distinction between hitting and spanking is this.  <br>
-My Mommy/Daddy Spanked me!<br>
-what did you do?<br>
-i came home realy late<br>
-are you gonna come home late again?<br>
-no way.<br>
<br>
-my mommy/daddy hit me! (i know the difference...x step dad)<br>
-WHAT!?  did it hurt!?<br>
-a lot!<br>
-any bruises?<br>
-RIGHT HERE!<br>
<br>
...er...something like that.  i dunno...seems like a bad documentary to me. &gt;_&lt;<br>
<br>
so there you have it.  realy long, but i have nothing better to do.  have a nice night. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uearlofchaos.showPublicProfile?language=EN>earl of chaos</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(12/12/01 10:37:21 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://pyrodesign.xoasis.com/temp/pyro4.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: anoyign brats shoudl be SHOt</span><hr size=1> we hope he's not talking about us. we were just going to say we recognized <br>

<br>
My dad used to spank/beat me when I was a kid, my mom didn't. I think that is one of the reasons we don't get along at all now. I can't talk to him about anything, I don't trust him with knowing anything I did, good or bad, and I basiclly see him as some sort of thug who can't discuss something, and has to go to violence to solve all problems. Which is the feelings I think a kid might get if they are spanked, that violence is the best solution to your problems. <br>
<br>
Because, you get beaten up by a bully at school, you don't respect this kid, you don't want to act better so he'll like you, you want to avoid this kid, and you hate this kid. I think the same can happen with your parents.<br>
<br>
And in my experiance, no matter what you try after you spank your kid, they will remember it. My dad hasn't touched me in years, but still, whenever he gets angry, I always flinch whenever he makes any hand gestures, because I alway's think he's getting ready to punch me in the face or something.<br>
<br>
It's basically like &quot;You hit your sister, that's bad, i'll hit and tell you how bad it is to use violence&quot; It just comes out hypocritcal.<br>
<br>
<br>
Again, just my opinion and based on my experiance and what I read. <p><p>
What? Is Man merely a mistake of God's. Or is God merely a mistake of Man's.

From my life 2-6 or 8 ?, Spankings scared the poop out of me.  Just the threat of one till it didn't hurt any more.  Its not beating your child if you give them one or two &quot;big&quot; whacks on the bottom.  It built into my mind that if I did whatever I did the last time I'd get spanked again.  The effectiveness of a spanking depends on the childs age, maturity, and size.  This is like that kid in singapore, I think.  He got caught spray painting like 20 cars and for it was cained.  He deserved every lash he got, Its common sense to stay off of peoples property and if you don't you pay the price.  Yeah... <p>"Squally Poo!"- Amanda Antilla</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/unaveenfoxthorn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>NaveenFoxthorn</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_star.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(12/13/01 3:14:47 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: anoyign brats shoudl be SHOt</span><hr size=1> geez, i think since i kinda started this i should put reason behind why i think ya should spank your kids. <br>
no offense to anyone on this, but it seems that the people that are against it are confusing spanking with abuse. personally, i was spanked AND beatin as a child. i got belts, shoes, fly swatters, small tree branches, you name it my @ss came in contact with it. my mom used 2 warnings first, if we did it again we got a spanking. <br>
my father was the opposite. he'd wait until we broke something or did something really bad. then he'd throw the bible at us (not litterally) then beat us with a belt usually. for that, i hated my father. quite honestly, i still do for placing that unessesary  hatred in me. he DID hit us out of anger, not because he loved us...<br>
with my mom, i learned respect, as well as love...kinda. today, me and her are on good terms most of the time. <br>
so you understand both sides, here. IMO: Beating=Abuse=wrong<br>
Spanking = disipline = ??? (i dont want to use the word love here, but you get the idea)<br>
but where i grew up, getting spanked/beatin was the norm(kentucky), so im probably biazed with 'enviormental beliefs' er something like that... <p><A HREF="http://www.grafixsguild.homestead.com"><IMG SRC="http://grafixsguild.homestead.com/files/sigpic.jpg"BORDER=0></A> </p>

<br>
It would seem that most of us know first hand the difference between a spanking and a beating.  <br>
<br>
Once my step mom (having fragile hands), broke her hand while spanking me.  Didn't hurt me a bit though.<br>
<br>
But I also remeber the last time my dad ever hit me.  I looked so bad that I stayed out of school for a week.  I was 12 at the time.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showMessageRange?topicID=7481.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showMessageRange?topicID=7481.topic&start=41&stop=49>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showMessage?topicID=7496.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showMessage?topicID=7507.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.emailToFriend?topicID=7481.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.threadControl?topicID=7481.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=7481.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=7481.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub25.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="polykarbonbbsfrm18">PK-BBS Rules and Regulations!<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm3">News and Updates<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm2">Photoshop and Art questions<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm4">General Manga/Anime Discussion<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm5">Japanese Language Help<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm23">art in progress<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm13">Black and White Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm14">Color Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm19">Member's Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm17">Moderators Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm6">Member Photos<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm22">How to use Fight Club<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm20">Challenges<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm21">Matches<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm25">Pose Forum<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm26">Writer's Forum<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm27">Board F.A.Q.s</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#336699>- </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs>Polykarbon BBS</a><font color=#336699> - </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19>Member's Lounge</a> <font color=#336699> - </font><a href="http://www.polykarbon.com">Polykarbon: Manga & Photoshop</a><font color=#336699> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.4 b8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
