I'd like some input and any better ideas you can come up with. It's kinda long, and this isn't the entire story, so prepare yourself! :P<br>
<br>
The story begins with a flashback of a man in a jungle. As he is working his way through the thick brush, he notices a rat. Thinking it to be harmless, he continues along his way. However, the rat emits a high-pitched squeak and within moments the man is covered with rats from head to toe. He screams for help, and the bird that was pirched on his shoulder flies off and squawks as loudly as possible. Far away, in a village, a young <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Taksha</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> hears the squawk and runs through the jungle to find his father. He arrives too late - the man has been completely devoured, leaving the half-starving rats still hungry for food. Then, in an instant, all the rats turn into a fine black dust that starts chasing Taksha. He runs as fast as he can, until a man jumps out from the brush to divert the dust. Taksha makes it home safely, but never sees the man again...<br>
<br>
Then we jump ahead. Taksha is now a grown man who searches for relics and artifacts and peddles them to the rich. On his way out to search for more ancient items, he drops by <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Tshakka</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->'s tent. She is an archaeologist employed by the government to search for ancient machinery. (<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.silenttransit.com/gallery/tshakka.jpg">here</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> is her character sketch) Taksha tells her that he's heard rumors that there is a buried city to the east, near where his father was killed. He tells her he believes it was called &quot;Times Square&quot;. (no, that's not a corny, planet of the apes-esque plot twist. you'll see the significance.) She wishes him good luck on his trip and he sets off. Moments later, her shovel hits a box, which she digs up and opens to find various trinkets.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, the emperor is in a meeting at the Ministry of History and Literature. They have become aware of the rumors about the buried city and want to see it for themselves. The emperor says that it is the &quot;Final Imprisonment&quot; and that they must send a team immediately. He makes a note to an assistant to fire Tshakka, saying it would be too risky for her to know about the mission (but we have no idea why.)<br>
<br>
Searching through the box at her tent, Tshakka discovers a letter. She opens it and finds that it is addressed &quot;My dearest Tshakka&quot;. The letter is from her father, who died many years ago. She begins to read it.<br>
<br>
It says that many years ago, machinery was used almost incessently to help people. A research company eager to find ways to further use machines to make people's lives easier developed a new type of nanomachine the size of animal cells that could arrange in clouds of various shapes in sizes. For example, the nanomachines could become a chisel, only to reconfigure at command to become a brush. They could even duplicate themselves. The only drawback was that they required living cells for fuel. This was fine for a while, as they were slowly fed plants. But something happened, and one machine became corrupted. It began seeking living animal cells and reproduced very quickly.<br>
<br>
These corrupted cell-machines found their way into the food supply and infected people from the inside, slowly taking over their bodies. Eventually, the entire human race collapsed, and was taken over by these machines. They were called the Darkness and the few survivors made it their lives' mission to take the world back from the machines, and to ensure they were never reawakened. They succeeded for the most part, and people once again became abundant. Darkness outbreaks were few.<br>
<br>
Tshakka is a direct descendant of one the guardians, the letter says, and it is her duty to prevent the Darkness from awakening to cause a major outbreak, just as her father's job was. Then he tells her in the letter that he became infected with the Darkness saving a boy from it in the jungles to the east, and was soon to die. He tells her that all of the remaining Darkness was imprisoned in a buried city to the east, named &quot;Times Square&quot;, and that it is imperative that she prevent it from being discovered.<br>
<br>
<br>
*bum bum bum*<br>
<br>
I'll post the next part of the story, where things really get hairy for Tshakka, a little later. Until then, I'd appreciate any response to what I have so far. <br>
<br>
Thanks! <br>

<br>
*edit: i should add that i really would like to develop Taksha a lot, as he is technically just as important as Tshakka, but i'm trying to condense all of this into the size of a comic book (~30 pages). also, a really big plot twist will happen to him, so the reader needs to have developed a deep sympathy for him. i really need to figure out how to eliminate the chatter about the history of the dust.*<br>
<br>
and yeah, i should have known darkness would be taken. what else could i use... *ponder ponder*<br>
<br>
also, thanks for your feedback. it probably took forever to read that :P<br>

Not really...when you write a lot of short stories and scripts, you have to read them to proofread them (and even though I'm not the fastest reader out there, reading's part of the game...research, proofreading, reviews, critiques, and then all the fun stuff out there to read too).<br>
<br>
I think your idea is a bit much for a single book if you want to develop both characters really well; however, comics do provide a good format for taking shorcuts.  Place your characters in some carefully crafted situations that make the key parts of their personalities stand out.  Also remember that every time your character utters a word of dialogue, let their personality come across (the words they choose, how they say it, how they carry themselves when they say it, etc). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ujefm.showPublicProfile?language=EN>jefm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(12/30/01 12:25:16 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=437.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: story synopsis - The Darkness</span><hr size=1> It's pretty interesting...<br>
I like it...but comics need dialogue and action as well...<br>
thats where character stuff comes in...<br>
I guess I'm just retyping what darkora said...<br>
but I'd avoid sticking it in one book...when you've got the story mapped out write a script...<br>
a page is usually at the most 9 panels...and you need some action and some dialogue to carry the story...the art will take care of the action but to convey how characters think you'll need dialogue...<br>
with just what you've got I can see more than one book <p><pre>

I talked it over with DarkOra, and he gave me a great idea. The story will be split into 4 books - each of the first three will develop one of the characters and give their motives for wanting to go to the city to find the nanomachines. For example, there will be a book just about Tshakka, describing how she discovers the box and stuff. There will also be a great deal of character development, lots more than there was here (I was trying to make it as short as possible)<br>
<br>
Finally, the fourth book is when they all meet, which has the main climax and the resolution. It'll be fun! :P<br>

The last thing I like to do is read a comic that is full of word boxes that in turn is full of small type explainging a complex history.<br>
<br>
I'm a patient man, so where I don't like to do that I probally would anyways in the end.  My point is other people wouldn't want to becasue the story is &quot;boring&quot;.<br>
<br>
So, my suggestion is to think of a way to have you characters doing something, may it be exploreing the jungle for &quot;time square&quot;, and have something like falsh backs or other character encounters that force the initial person to explain why they are here.<br>
<br>
The thing is you have a lot of history to give and it would be a bad idea to give it to the reader all at one time.  IMO it would be best to give it to the reader a little at a time.  Make the reader curious why the hero is doing what he/she is doing and curious to what exactly the past is like.<br>
<br>
Though, I do like your concept and story idea.  The end result can be very good if the story is told right. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ugrandxduke.showPublicProfile?language=EN>GrandxDuke</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_greenspot.gif" BORDER=0> at: 12/30/01 9:31:35 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/utenyaku.showPublicProfile?language=EN>tenyaku</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(12/30/01 1:10:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=437.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: story synopsis - The Darkness</span><hr size=1> Yeah, I've pretty much revamped everything and I figured out a way to get around that.<br>
<br>
The first book, the book of Taksha, will focus on Taksha's life and will look into his relationship with Tshakka a little. A major chunk of it will also be him looking for Times Square.<br>
<br>
The second book, the book of the emperor (as of yet unnamed), will mainly focus on the brighter side of the history of the darkness, giving the reader a glimpse at why the nanomachines were originally so useful, and as such, why he wants them. I haven't figured out the meat of this book though, since that will only take a few pages. It will probably mainly consist of the emperor's troops looking for Times Square (with lots of action as they fight off beasts in the jungles). Also, this book will probably take a closer look at Taksha and Tshakka.<br>
<br>
The third book, the book of Tshakka, focuses deeply on her relationship with Taksha at the beginning. Then the focus changes to the darker side of the darkness when she discovers that box with the letter from her father, so the reader learns the second half of the history. Then, she takes off to find Times Square before anyone else.<br>
<br>
Finally, the fourth book will begin when they all meet at the final imprisonment of the darkness, and the chaos that results. My secret for now <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Does anyone have any ideas for the second book? It's very important to everything else, but I've still got to figure out the meat of the story for that book.<br>
<br>
