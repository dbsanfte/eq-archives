With the Cassini space probe set to enter Saturn orbit next year, I'm hoping to use information gleaned from it as well as the Huygens lander to provide good background data.  <br>
<br>
I've also wanted to do a &quot;human future&quot; kind of story - something showing our species at a point when it faced with a decision of maturity vs. extinction.  In essence, a sort of &quot;2001&quot; meets David Brin's &quot;Earth&quot; story.  <br>
<br>
I've tried a few different concepts and so far this is what has emerged as a viable candidate.  I'd like your thoughts.<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
AD 2047: Almost forty years have passed since the last time the world was threatened by global war.  While some nations (the United States, China, and more recently Brazil) still dream of and struggle towards military dominance, the vast majority of nations in this era rely less on massive military might and more on cooperation with their neighbors for mutual defense, and thus are able to free up funds and manpower for more productive projects.  The African Reconstruction of the '20s is one example of such projects.  Some things still don't change though: Afghanistan is still suffering under fighting from its warlords and the Middle East remains embroiled in age-old hatreds.  Despite such setbacks, a very fragile <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Pax Humana</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> has begun to spread across the Earth.<br>
<br>
Human presence has begun to expand into the Solar System, at a rate that some consider too slow, and others consider too fast.  The advent of muon-fusion propulsion in the early '30s allows for spacecraft to reach the inner planets in weeks, and the outer worlds in months.  Colonies on the moon and Mars are just now emerging from the state of small, semi-isolated bases, though where the lunar bases are highly industry-centered and expanding, the Martian bases are more science-centered and have suffered funding losses in favour of new outposts in the Jovian moons.  <br>
<br>
A year before, a European probe to Saturn has reported an unexpected find: photos taken during a flyby of the Saturnian moon of Tethys have revealed what appears to be a crashed alien spacecraft on its surface.  Analysis of Pioneer, Voyager, and Cassini data suggests that the spacecraft is a recent arrival.   The United Nations Space Exploration Agency, currently the largest civilian space program (what national programs that survived to this date have either gone military only, such as the US or China, or have relegated themselves to near-Earth commercial efforts, such as Japan) hastily assembles an expedition to investigate the spacecraft.  Concerns from the UN Security Council lead for information about the alien vessel to be kept secret, though in this age of transparency this proves impossible.  Word leaks out to the world.<br>
<br>
The old superpowers see this as an opportunity - technology gleaned from the spacecraft might allow them to thwart the UN-backed &quot;peacesats&quot; that prevent each from gaining any significant advantage over each other or the world community, and the threat of &quot;alien invasion&quot; could be used to shut down the UNSEA and the gradual escape of their best and brightest in favour of the high frontier.  The Martian colonists see the alien spacecraft as a threat: if their plans for a self-sufficient and terraformed Mars have been delayed by the Jovian expansion, then this new expedition would kill future funding for them.  A cadre within the Martian colony concludes that the alien ship should be destroyed.  <br>
<br>
All of these plans are further complicated when it is revealed that the alien ship is no mere derelict: for the ship's crew is emerging from their cryogenic modules to discover that they are NOT where they were supposed to be... and the best hope they have of returning to space may lie with the strange bipedal invaders that have descended on them.<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
So ends the premise.  I'm a little unsure where the story should start: during the training phase, where we can introduce many of the human characters and human plotlines in a more &quot;leisurely&quot; format; or when the expedition is launched, to jump to the action faster and introduce the aliens sooner.  And of course the premise itself needs refining here and there, characters - in the expedition crew, back on Earth and Mars, and the alien crew - need to be fleshed out, and viewpoints decided upon.  The problem of subplots - how many and where - also needs to be considered.<br>
<br>
Your thoughts?<br>

<br>
Revised Premise: The year remains the same as does much of the basic background: US, China, and &quot;new kid&quot; Brazil are the big military powers, with each having a near death-grip on their populations but not much else.  A revised UN serves as a balance against the superpowers, with the transfer of power from the dissolved security council to the general assembly, an independant - but severely constrained - military force, and a network of reconnaisance satellites monitoring global hotspots and regions under world sanction.  <br>
<br>
Space exploration remains much the same as in the original premise with a few modifications: Near-Earth space is divided among national and corporate interests, with the Japan-dominated space tourism industry and coalitions of European-Japanese-Chinese lunar mining bases.  At L5 is the Avalon colony, which was built by a utopian conglomerate, and is now the largest advocate for a colonization proposal opposed by the old superpowers and other repressive regimes.  Outside of near-Earth space, the United Nations Space Exploration Agency is the primary force of human expansion, maintaining refuelling stations in strategic orbits matching Earth's, and building research colonies on Mars and the Jovian moon Callisto.  Weapons - beyond basic station and colony security - are forbidden outside of Earth's atmosphere by treaty.<br>
<br>
The fragile &quot;pax humana&quot; that exists in 2047 is threatened when an alien ship crashes on Callisto.  The vessel, and its crew, become first pawns - then players - in the sociopolitical<br>
<br>
Primary Characters (both good and bad guys): <br>
Alexandria Markham - scientist at Nar Base on Callisto<br>
Micheal Langstrom - robotics engineer, Nar Base<br>
(name TBD) - Chinese Space Force captain, currently spacecraft pilot at Nar Base<br>
(name TBD) - American General (three stars), US Space Force<br>
(name TBD) - American Vice President and member of the &quot;Cabal&quot;<br>
(name TBD) - UN Secretary General<br>
(name TBD) - Avalonian council member<br>
(name TBD) - Avalonian citizen<br>
(name TBD) - Alaskan governor<br>
(name TBD) - alien &quot;commander&quot;<br>
(name TBD) - alien crewmember (highly xenophobic)<br>
<br>
Plot Structure as it stands now (very sketchy)<br>
<br>
Act 1:<br>
We are introduced to much of the primary characters - some only sketchily, and to the problems facing those characters; the overriding issue being the colony proposal put before the General Assembly.  Some characters see it as good, some as bad, and act according to their own agendas.<br>
<br>
The alien ship crashes, and Nar Base begins to conduct research, unwittingly awaking the aliens and contact is made.  The news of contact ripples through the human sphere of influence, hastening a shady alliance between ambitious persons within the old superpowers.  Rumours circle within military circles of a new superweapon, known only as &quot;Archangel&quot;<br>
<br>
At Nar base, on Callisto, the pilot is suddenly recalled by his government - he is unable to say why, but he is convinced it cannot be good.  <br>
<br>
On Earth, the General learns the true nature of Archangel - a massive network of high-powered laser satellites - and after some digging, learns their horrible purpose.  He is too late, however, to stop the plans of the Cabal, who arrange for a little &quot;regime change&quot; of their own, by some careful assasinations and using Archangel to gut the UN by destroying key buildings.  So ends Act 1.<br>
<br>
Act 2<br>
The Cabal spreads its influence out by sending forces to sieze the refuelling stations, as well as the settlements on Luna, Mars, and Callisto.  Archangel, after its flashy debut, is down for the count while certain satellite systems have to be replaced.  In response to the initial invasions, Avalon colony unveils a small military force they had been building in secret, and uses it to counter the superpowers.  Alex, Mike, and the rest of Nar base are increasingly worried by the news from Earth, but, being unable to do anything about it, concentrate more on the aliens, who are themselves torn between their fear of the humans and their increasingly desperate need for help.  <br>
<br>
The Avalon-Cabal war heats up and splits down the middle as American and Chinese members of the Cabal turn against each other - but still the fighting remains confined to space, for now.  Other nations become concerned enough to tighten up defenses on their own borders, and small flare wars break out.  Remnants of the UN try to reorganize and at the same time try to end the smaller wars.  The General is now a fugitive, and unlikely guardian for the Secretary-General, who was among the few people to escape the destruction of the General Assembly in Act 1.  <br>
<br>
At Nar Base, halting steps towards cooperation between human and alien are dealt a massive blow as a Cabal mole is uncovered just after sabotaging part of the main drive for the alien ship.  Through this incident, the aliens get their first good look at the chaos brewing insystem.<br>
<br>
The fighting spreads to Mars, where the pilot finds himself among the Chinese force sent to &quot;secure&quot; the colony.  <br>
<br>
Act 2 ends with the invasion of Nar base by Cabal forces.  The aliens flee, with Mike as passenger/prisoner.  Alex and the others are captured and sent back to Earth for interrogation.<br>
<br>
Act 3 - the resolution - remains unplotted.<br>
<br>
Critiques are requested.<br>
