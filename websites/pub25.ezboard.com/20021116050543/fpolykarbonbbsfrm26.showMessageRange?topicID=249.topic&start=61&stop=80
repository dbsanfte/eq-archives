Liz opens her eyes slowly and looks around. A surprised Win stands off to the side and a boy lies crumbled at the bottom of a large mech. Liz rubs her throat carefully,it feels like somebodys' been trying to choak her. She looks up at Win.<br>

<br>
Vick reached into his pocket and produced a cell phone. He triggered the direct connect. &quot;Ross, what's your '20?&quot;<br>
<br>
His partner answered with indecipherable static.<br>
<br>
Deuce shrugged at Vick as he gave him a quizzical look.<br>
<br>
&quot;They're tearing this town apart! What the hell are they doing, here?&quot;<br>
<br>
Deuce bit down on his lip. He could taste blood. Must have gotten his block chopped somewhere back there.  &quot;They're looking for something.&quot;<br>
<br>
Vick tried his partner again, but got no response.<br>
<br>
&quot;Where do you think they all are?&quot;<br>
<br>
Deuce called out over another blast of energy in the distance, &quot;I can't think with this racket! Let's get out of the weather!&quot;<br>
<br>
He led Vick around a shattered concrete fountain, high-stepping through deepening puddles. They splashed across the courtyard towards an anonymous official building. With a wide swipe of the butt of his Browning, Deuce opened up the glass of the front door, and they stepped inside.<br>
<br>
Rainwater dripped from Deuce's bangs in a stream. His ears were still ringing. Permanent hearing loss.<br>
<br>
&quot;Bastards.&quot;<br>
<br>
Vick screwed his brows together. &quot;What?&quot;<br>
<br>
Deuce gestured his thumb back out the door. &quot;Think your partner's still alive?&quot;<br>
<br>
Vick shrugged. &quot;Probably quivering under a desk somewhere.&quot; He maintained his gaze. &quot;What are YOU doing here, anyway?&quot;<br>
<br>
Deuce snarled. &quot;Trying not to get my ass blown off!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You know what I mean. You're not FBI. At least, not anymore.&quot;<br>
<br>
Deuce tensed his shoulders, and lifted his stare slowly up to Vick. It was his warning sign... but Vick wasn't budging.<br>
<br>
&quot;This means you are?&quot;<br>
<br>
Vick shrugged innocently.<br>
<br>
Deuce sighed. &quot;Who's your A.D.?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Morgan.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Jesus, he made Assistant? Ass kisser. He couldn't find his dick if he had to take a leak.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;How long have you been out of the circuit?&quot;<br>
<br>
Deuce released his clip and fished through his pockets for ammo. &quot;Five years come November.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What happened? What turned you?&quot;<br>
<br>
Deuce found a full clip's worth of rounds and began to plug them into the clip.  &quot;When one of your operatives risks his neck to protect your reputation and your job, you just don't send him up the river without an explanation. You just... don't. Anyway, the bureau's got this thing against vendetta.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;So you're working for the mafia? The Arabs? CIA?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Little bit of each. Whoever signs the paychecks, you know? Actually, I still turn some tricks for the Bureau. Morgan may be as straight as you lace them, but A.D. Cocker isn't above alternative methods.&quot;<br>
<br>
Vick smirked. &quot;Morgan's not so straight-laced. He's the one who's opened us up to psychic testimony.&quot;<br>
<br>
Deuce froze. &quot;...Liz. You're here for Liz.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;She's a primary witness to the Chapin murders.&quot;<br>
<br>
Deuce nodded, clapped his clip, and slid it into the Browning.<br>
<br>
Vick continued, &quot;You said these aliens were looking for something. What if they're looking for Liz, too?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Why would they?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, if she's a psychic... and if they're psychic... maybe she's picking up on their thoughts.&quot;<br>
<br>
Deuce winced. &quot;Pretty thin.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, what about you? What's your interest in the girl?&quot;<br>
<br>
He shrugged. &quot;I don't know. No agenda. Unlike you and our friends up there...&quot; He sniffed. &quot;She's kind of cute, kind of dangerous... my kind of girl.&quot;<br>
<br>
Deuce chambered a round, pulled back the hammer and jammed the barrel at Vick's forehead.<br>
<br>
Vick returned a cold stare. &quot;The hell?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You're in possession of more information than I'm comfortable with. So, when this is over, and we're all still alive... I want you to remember...&quot;  Deuce gently slid the hammer back and lowered the gun. &quot;...I could have killed you.&quot;<br>
<br>
Vick exhaled. The cell phone in his pocket chirped.<br>
<br>
He thumbed the direct connect. &quot;Ross?&quot;<br>

If you don't mind of course))<br>
<br>
Across the street from the front of the police building and the saucer a lone figure was hunched against the wall of a store trying to avoid as much of the storm as possible. He was tall, probably six foot six if you had to guess, and firmly built with short cropped silver hair. His eyes never left the saucer as he reached into his trench coat and removed a small ovoid device. With a faint beep the ovoid split in two with a faintly glowing rectangle between the halves.<br>
<br>
&quot;Graydon, you there?&quot; He called glancing at the com unit, &quot;We have a bit of a problem down here.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;What? Az, what kind of a problem do we have?&quot; A slightly annoyed voice came from the device accompanied by the image of a man in his early thirties.<br>
<br>
Keeping his eyes on the saucer Azoth quietly reported, &quot;We have at least one saucer... I think they're Greys... that I've visually confirmed. I think they're after something here, they're not just grabbing people like they usually do. They're hunting.&quot;<br>
<br>
Graydon got a puzzled expression on his face. &quot;How do you know they're hunting?&quot; He received a look from Azoth for that. &quot;Right, I know, you're a hunter too. You recognise these things. Blah blah blah.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Exactly.&quot; Replied Az with a grin, &quot;I'm moving in.&quot; He started out from his cover when a shout from the com stopped him in his tracks.<br>
<br>
&quot;Wait! What have you got on you?&quot; Graydon queried.<br>
<br>
With a faint smile Az went down the list of equipment he was carrying, &quot;Let's see... I have my AGS-356 anti-mech pistol with three rounds, but I doubt I'm going to find any cymechs down here, then there's my twin KKV-3 plasmas with eighty rounds each, my GN-5 holdout with twenty rounds, a WSTE-M5 combat shotgun with five rounds, four fusion grenades, my monosaber, and twelve small throwing knives. That's about it.&quot;<br>
<br>
It was a moment before Graydon replied with a quiet &quot;oh.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That's right, I've got my mask too,&quot; Az ammended, &quot;so I sould be good to go&quot; So saying he slipped an obsidian mask marked with twin slashes of red onto his face. When it locked down with a faint hiss the eyes lit up into a faint red. <br>
<br>
Putting the com unit back into his pocket he slipped out into the thrashing wind and rain. They didn't bother him much, the wind and rain that is, both were much worse where he had spent most of his early life. He had headed back behind the store that was his cover. It wouldn't do for the aliens to see him coming. <br>
<br>
Circling around the squat building he headed across the occupied street at the next intersection. Now he was on the same side of the street as the police building and, fortunately, the aliens. <br>
<br>
Ducking and weaving around both garbage cans and dumpsters that had been thrown around in the storm Azoth came upon the Police building. The discharge of alien weaponry was growing louder in the distance. Sparing a quick glance for the street that intersected the alley he was in Azoth stopped dead in his tracks. <br>
<br>
&quot;Maybe I will need the 356&quot; He said to himself. For standing there in the street was a decently sized mech. There were also three people by said mech; one was doing a decent impression of an unconscious human while the other two were looking at each other in shock. They didn't notice the three aliens, no they weren't Greys, sneaking up on them around the legs of the mech. <br>
<br>
They didn't, but Azoth did.<br>
<br>
Unholstering his KKV's Azoth clicked the safeties off on the plasma pistols. Thinking twice he deactivated the laser sights, they wouldn't be needed with his mask. The aliens didn't pay any attention to him, they were focused on something else... The girl. They were all headed for the girl. <br>
<br>
Stepping away from his cover Azoth let the lead one have it in the chest with two plasma bolts. One down. The girl and her friend snapped out of their trance at the sound of the weapons fire and headed for cover. The second plasma pistol spoke and a second alien dropped. Two down. The third managed to level some kind of weapon at its attacker. With a clap of thunder a bolt of electricity connected Azoth and the alien. For Azoth, time stopped, everything went black and then there was a strange sensation of flying. Of course he wasn't paying too much attention to that, the searing pain in his chest was where he was focusing most of his awareness. A jarring thump followed, though he didn't feel it much, and there was still no light. <br>
<br>
It took several seconds for the mask to reboot, it had never crashed before, so for those precious seconds his world remained dark. His mind was muddled, he wasn't sure who he was but he knew that he was in danger. He had to get up. But he couldn't see anything and then there was that ringing. With the snap of a flash the world returned to him. The rain was sleeting down leaving large drops on his field of view. Then Azoth's memory returned. With a gasp he sat up, realised that he was at least thirty feet from his previous position, and looked for the last alien.<br>
<br>
It wasn't hard to find. In fact it was standing there out in the open approaching the girl. It was ignoring him and the man the girl was with, it didn't consider them a threat. That was a mistake. It was while Azoth was leveling his one remaining plasma pistol, he must have dropped the other, at the alien that something truly remarkable happened. The alien took to the air in what was a very similar flight to the one that Azoth had just taken. Shrugging inwardly he shot it out of the air, it didn't matter much if it was moving or not, a target's a target. It landed on the ground in a crumpled smoking heap.<br>
<br>
Finding and picking up his other pistol, Azoth wearily made his way over to the man and girl.<br>
<br>
&quot;I suggest we get out of here,&quot; he gasped, noticing for the first time that he was short of breath, &quot;there are probably more of them...&quot;<br>
<br>

<br>
Well well well,here comes another into the fray. Things were getting out of hand here,first theres this big storm,then the creatures land,next comes so pysco in a mech followed by some guy with a big gun and a glowing mask. Whats the world coming too?<br>
<br>
  Liz shook her head. Things couldn't get any weirder could they? She stood up to her full height,which was only a mere 5'3,standing up on her toes as best to look this new person in the eye. She squinted her eyes ,placed her hands on her hips and gave him an acusing stare.<br>
&quot;so..who are you? Another type of alien that landed here just for the fun of it? Because to the best of my knowledge no on this planet has a mask,weapons or hair like that,&quot; She lowered herself back down to her normal height and crossed her arms.<br>
&quot;and how can we belive you?With all this strange stuff happening,you could be on the side thats causing all this trouble. So,we could either belive you or choose not to,it all depends,&quot; Liz smiled confidently. Someone couldn't get around questions like that( or so she belived) but a thought struck her. What if the same was done to herself and end up revealing to much information. <br>

'Great,' she though,i've gone and messed things up again. She looked up at the silver-haired man. He remained silent,trying to catch his breath. Liz looked back at Win questionly. So far he had known all the answers,mabey he knew what was going on? Even if he didn't,others would have an answer. Or so she hoped.<br>

He didn't respond until she slowed down and glanced at her partner as though she were looking for advice. Holstering his KKV's he reached up and popped off the mask. Bending down he focused his bright blue eyes on the girl.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, seeing as how I've completely blown my cover, &quot;He paused for a fraction of a second, trying to decide what to say, &quot;my name is Azoth. I'm from Earth, just not this one and I haven't asked you to believe anything. I only suggested we get out of here.&quot; So saying he replaced his mask and moved up against the wall of the police station and quietly made his way to the front. <br>
<br>
Seeing no aliens in the immediate viscinity of the saucer he made his way back to the trio of humans. On his way he stopped briefly to examine one of the dead aliens. Tall and thin like Greys but these guys had pale blue skin, almost white. On one hand was a clear red faceted gem. Too light to be a ruby. Reaching for his back he pulled a gladius like shortsword from a concealed sheath. With a swift motion the alien's hand was no longer part of its body. The hand went into a zippered plastic bag, taken from an inside pocket, and the body lay on the ground oozing dark, thick blood.<br>
<br>
While the girl and the man talked Azoth took off his trenchcoat revealing the armored jumpsuit he wore underneath. He was also covered in weapons. The two conscious humans counted at least six guns of some sort, quite a few knives and the sword he had just used to remove the alien's hand. the hand was in its bag and was attatched to the belt at his waist. Azoth raised the coat in the air and fiddled with some straps and zippers of some kind. When he was done he handed it to the girl.<br>
<br>
&quot;Here, this should keep off any more of the rain.&quot; He said dropping it into her hands. It was remarkably light but also quite warm.<br>
<br>
Az moved over to the unconscious man lying by the mech.<br>
<br>
&quot;Is this a friend of yours?&quot; He asked pointing at the man. Not really waiting for a response he picked him up and put him over one shoulder. &quot;He's human I guess. No sense leaving him here for them.&quot; Glancing at the two he asked, &quot;So do you have some mode of transportation? Or are we sealing the frisbee out front?&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/usempaisloan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SempaiSloan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(8/30/01 12:16:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=249.topic&index=73>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Behold as I tie together the loose threads...</span><hr size=1> Deuce sprinted after Vick, who plunged headfirst into the downpour. The crashes of energy in the distance faded, but the noise of their saucer engines still hung above the leaden clouds.<br>
<br>
Vick lead Deuce into the shed behind the restaurant. Deuce gritted his teeth, hoping they didn't have to go inside. As they rounded the corner of the shed, a figure stepped out of the shadow into the rain. Deuce had his gun at arm's length and was ready to fire when Vick held up a hand.<br>
<br>
&quot;Wait! It's Ross!&quot;<br>
<br>
Ross was pale, and it looked like he had puked on himself. Deuce smirked, blinking at the drops of rain pelting his face.<br>
<br>
Vick and Ross had a quiet parlay as Deuce stepped against the restaurant, trying to edge his way underneath the eave.<br>
<br>
As Ross was being inspected by Vick for injuries, Deuce called out, &quot;So, what is this thing you saw?&quot;<br>
<br>
With a trembling hand, Ross pointed across the square.<br>
<br>
Deuce wiped his face and squinted. He saw the shadow of the police station... and beyond the police station, towering above it...<br>
<br>
He swore sharply.<br>
<br>
Vick took hypnotic steps forward. &quot;Wh... what am I seeing?&quot;<br>
<br>
Deuce growled, &quot;It's a mech.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I... I thought Reagan put the kibosh on the mech project.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah, and Dubyuh put the kibosh on human cloning, but Velario's doing that, too.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Who?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You work for the government. At least you think you do. But the government isn't the one in control...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, Christ! Don't start with the shadow government crap.&quot;<br>
<br>
Deuce snarled, &quot;It's not the government, it's the money. Velario connects into sixteen transnational corporations, including every single Japanese megafirm, Microsoft, US Steel, Time Warner... money makes the world go around, and he's the one who throws the switch.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Whatever.&quot;<br>
<br>
Deuce thrust a finger at the mech. &quot;You think the people who can't launch a Space Shuttle on a cloudy day can SERIOUSLY build a mech that size?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Can Velario?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm not sure. Maybe. Don't remember anything that big, though.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;So, you've been on the inside with this Velario?&quot;<br>
<br>
Deuce shook his head. &quot;Best damned contract I ever landed. And the worst. If I were sane, I'd have never taken it... but only a fool could have passed it up.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Assassination?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I knew he had better security than the President, but Jesus!&quot;<br>
<br>
Vick snickered. &quot;Couldn't touch him, could you?&quot;<br>
<br>
Deuce stared at the mech. &quot;If his technology is here, then he's involved with the aliens, somehow. Great. Just great.&quot;<br>
<br>
Ross coughed. &quot;Some kid jumped out. Attacked that girl.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Liz?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah. He was going nuts!&quot;<br>
<br>
Deuce nodded. &quot;Clones. Velario's not above an end-run with the government. There were sounds about manning vehicles with 'expendible units'. He's decades ahead of legitimate science, but he still can't produce a stable clone...&quot;<br>
<br>
Ross interrupted, &quot;She threw his ass against the mech like a dead cat.&quot;<br>
<br>
A smile lit up Deuce's face. &quot;Where are they?&quot;<br>
<br>
Ross shrugged. &quot;Some guy took them.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;...the hell?&quot;<br>
<br>
Vick interjected, &quot;Which way, Ross?&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ugothicchaos.showPublicProfile?language=EN>gothic chaos</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(8/30/01 12:54:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=249.topic&index=74>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Behold as I tie together the loose threads...</span><hr size=1> Whoever this Azoth guy was,he seemed to have a plan.

Ross barked, &quot;Yeah, it's them.&quot;<br>
<br>
Vick turned back to Deuce with a questioning glance. &quot;So? Come on.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Wait.&quot;<br>
<br>
He pressed his hands against the shed behind him. He could feel a vibration.<br>
<br>
&quot;Do you feel that?&quot;<br>
<br>
The feds looked at one another, and shrugged. <br>
<br>
Electricity flowed across his feet. He shuddered.<br>
<br>
Vick called out, &quot;What is it?&quot;<br>
<br>
Deuce sucked in a breath and listened. The quick lances of energy passed over, and he felt a rumbling overhead.<br>
<br>
&quot;I think something's...&quot;<br>
<br>
As he tried to finish his thought, all of the noise in his mind vanished. The vibration stilled. The electricity stopped. <br>
<br>
There was calm... quiet. Only the sound of rain misting the puddles by his feet, and his own breath pushing in and out.<br>
<br>
Vick muttered, &quot;Hello?&quot;<br>
<br>
Deuce couldn't move. He was fixed. The rain kept falling. There was no wind. No distant blasts of energy. No thunder.<br>
<br>
A voice called out from across the courtyard. It was Liz.<br>
<br>
&quot;Come on!&quot;<br>
<br>
Ross began stamping through the puddles of the courtyard, and Vick took a step or two. &quot;Come on, it's clear.&quot;<br>
<br>
But Deuce was frozen. This was wrong. Something told him to stay put. <br>

Instinct.<br>

Two of them were moving towards Az and the others. The third wasn't moving. Their eyes met. They recognized what each other was and they both knew.<br>
<br>
Something was wrong. <br>
<br>
The light from the saucer behind Azoth dimmed. There was a faint rumbling, he could barely feel it. And it was quiet. Except it wasn't.<br>
<br>
There was a faint humming coming from his waist. The gem in the hand in the bag was pulsing. A sickly blood red light burst forth every second. <br>
<br>
Azoth had been stupid. He had thought that their weapons wouldn't have locators in them. He was astoundingly wrong. He was also a great big beacon telling them where the girl was. <br>
<br>
Grabbing his holdout Azoth flicked off the safety and pressed it into the man's hand. He didn't have much time.<br>
&quot;I'm not sure if they'll follow me or not. If they don't just point and shoot. There's no recoil so you shouldn't have a problem with that. You have twenty rounds, make the best of them. Now when I say go, you head for any cover you can find. Okay?&quot; Not waiting for an answer he dropped the still limp m ech pilot on the ground and sprinted for the opposite side of the street. <br>
<br>
Az passed the two men who had been running the other way at a dead sprint, he needed the speed. Luckily his footing was sure enough that he didn't break his ankle (or any other body part for that matter). <br>
<br>
Azoth was just about under cover when the aliens opened up. Thunderclaps and lightningbolts slammed into the ground around Azoth. This time he wasn't giving them a stationary target to shoot at.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/usempaisloan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SempaiSloan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/4/01 12:14:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=249.topic&index=79>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> I am beheld to the unraveling threads...</span><hr size=1> That familiar steel, that familiar weight.<br>

The familiar bark of gunpowder and smoke, that familiar press of recoil.<br>

Single shots. <br>
<br>
Deuce was running out of ammo.<br>
<br>
The corrugated aluminum of the restaurant shed was perforated by glowing energy blast marks. Shadows moved behind the aluminum. Once he got a line of sight...<br>
<br>
One shot.<br>
<br>
One dead alien.<br>
<br>
But there were dozens.<br>
<br>
They were being seiged.<br>
<br>
As Deuce turned, he zeroed in on a figure sprinting past the feds. One person... one memory of the past. One face that made Deuce grin, and filled him with fear. The one man that kept Deuce awake at night.<br>
<br>
And this was the one man Deuce would want on his side when gunning down aliens.<br>
<br>
The most dangerous man in the world.<br>
<br>
Velario's mystery man.<br>
<br>
Deuce's hunter.<br>
<br>
Azoth. Azoth pulled a long, dangerous-looking rifle from the gearbag slung across his back. He centered the scope of the weapon directly at Deuce.<br>
<br>
Better to be nailed by Azoth than a bastard alien!<br>
<br>
A brilliant white light lanced past Deuce's nose, through the aluminum. A minor explosion within the shed rattled Deuce's teeth and sprayed him with black ooze.He recovered in time to find another alien poking a head around the corner. <br>
<br>
One more shot, and the carriage of his nine millimeter slapped back and stayed. Out of bullets.<br>
<br>
Azoth lumbered down beside Deuce, who began to fish in his pockets for bullets.<br>
<br>
He released the clip, and turned to Azoth.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why am I not surprised?&quot;<br>
<br>
Azoth peered at him from behind the mask. His voice fuzzed, &quot;I made a mistake.&quot;  With a flurry of motion, Azoth pulled a throwing knife from a belt, and hucked it behind Deuce, dropping an alien.<br>
<br>
Deuce shook his head. &quot;Think we're going to survive this?&quot;<br>
<br>
As he reached into his left coat pocket for bullets, a pain shot through his palm, like someone had shot him through the hand. Deuce hit his knees and yelped.<br>
<br>
Heat rose up his arms, and he flailed back against the aluminum, swearing repeatedly.<br>
<br>
He pulled his arm from his pocket. Tendrils of hot metal burrowed up his sleeve, digging into the skin of his arm. He turned his palm up to his face. <br>
<br>
There, seating itself into a bed of clotting blod, was the pulsing red gem-weapon.<br>
<br>
The gem stopped pulseing, and the tendril quieted. He could feel them wrapping up into his armpit, digging into muscle.<br>
<br>
His head grew light with pain.<br>
<br>
He saw Azoth reach for his hand with a knife, and Deuce batted him away.<br>
<br>
The gem began to hum as he motioned at Azoth. He felt like a river of energy was flowing from his extremities to his arm. He managed to point it away from Azoth before it discharged, blowing off the corner of the restaurant's roof.<br>
<br>
As the energy settled back in Deuce's body, he shook his head, and stared at his smoking palm.<br>
<br>
Through raspy grunts, Deuce said, &quot;I knew...

I like...))<br>
<br>
&quot;Now you have one.&quot; Azoth said simply, &quot;Just try not to point that thing in my direction.&quot; Then he grabbed Deuce's lapel and dragged him down the street. &quot;We need cover.&quot;<br>
<br>
Scanning the street Az watched as the two feds fought off a couple of the aliens  and basically hid. Then there was the sharp electronic report of his holdout. Down the street by an old, large car the man was standing by the girl the weapon in his hand outstretched. At their feet was one alien. One alien of many. Dropping the anti-mech rifle, he was out of rounds anyway, Azoth pulled his KKV's. <br>
<br>
&quot;Can you use that thing or am I going to have to lend you a gun?&quot; He asked Deuce point blank. <br>
<br>
&quot;I've still got my Browning.&quot; Deuce replied, voice still raspy with pain. He pulled a magazine from his coat. &quot;So until I get this thing worked out, It'll do.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Good, let's go&quot; So saying Azoth stepped out into the street. He kept close to the wall of storefronts for cover and to keep his back to a wall. He couldn't help but smile at Deuce's reaction to his appearance. It was a surprise to the assassin. <br>
<br>
They had met several years earlier. Deuce had tried to kill Azoth's then-employer Valerio. It had been a setup. Valerio had wanted Deuce out of the way; so Valerio had one of his many disposable flunkies approach Deuce with a proposition he couldn't refuse. Deuce hadn't refused and Azoth had been tasked with killing him. Fortunately for Deuce he had smelled a trap. Azoth had been unable to kill him, not for a lack of trying mind you, and that had put Azoth in Valerio's bad books. Valerio had informed Azoth that if he didn't bring in Deuce's head in a bag, Az would never work for Valerio again. <br>
<br>
Azoth knew that 'not working for Valerio again' was a polite phrase signifying Az's death. That would never do. Already disenfranchised with his employers tactics, Valerio liked to pretend he was a mastermind while he was little more than a thug with his fingers in lots of pies, Azoth decided he would make an attempt. Or at least it would look like an attempt to Valerio. Azoth just used it as an excuse to get out from under Valerio's watchful gaze. Every &quot;mastermind&quot; has his blind spots, Valerio's were just on a global scale. Az had used those spots to reconnect with his previous employers, the Trinity, and they were more than happy to have him back. He was a walking showroom of their technology after all. He had just completed his contract negotiations with Graydon when this storm had come up.<br>
<br>
Snapping himself back to the present Azoth squeezed the triggers on his KKV's and sent two of the aliens to their deaths. Deuce was behind him lone claps from his browning dropping aliens with deadly efficiency. <br>
<br>
Azoth and Deuce were almost to the man and the girl when a squad of the aliens came around the building in front of them. Az quickly grabbed what looked like a thin metallic gel capsule off of one of his web belts and threw it at the aliens. Deuce was already behind the cover of a brick wall when Azoth jumped to join him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Grenade?&quot; Asked the former FBI agent.<br>
&quot;Grenade.&quot; Replied the masked man in concert with a rather large explosion. <br>
<br>
The pace resumed. The two were walking death to any alien that approached. They reached the girl, who Deuce identified as Liz, and the man. Looking at the car hurriedly Azoth asked if it would run.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's got a full tank of gas.&quot; Deuce chimed from the driver side door. &quot;But it's locked.&quot; Deuce was smiling. That was a good thing. While Azoth and the man held the aliens at bay Deuce picked the lock.<br>
<br>
When the door opened Azoth pulled Deuce out of the driver's seat. &quot;Let me drive. I can see.&quot;<br>
<br>
