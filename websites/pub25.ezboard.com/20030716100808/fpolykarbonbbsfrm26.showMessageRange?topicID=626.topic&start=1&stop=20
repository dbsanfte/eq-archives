In the year 2500, humanity has evolved into 3 separate races. The Terrans, those who stayed on Earth, are mostly unchanged. The Martians, who altered the planet Mars to terraform it and make it habitable, have developed psionic powers to the extent that their physical bodies have atrophied. The Trogians, who left the solar system to colonise the planet H-137J5, have become physically powerful at the cost of their latent mental powers, leaving them strong but with no psionic talents.<br>
Crime and chaos are beginning to spread across the once pacifistic galaxy, and the scientists of Earth seem to be ignoring this problem. However, a small team of scientists on Mars have observed this trend, and dispatched a unit of mercenaries to investigate and, if possible, stop whatever is causing the problems.<br>
<br>
OK then, first up is to choose Ur character's race, gender and specialities. I'll leave it up to you. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ubythegun.showPublicProfile?language=EN>By the Gun</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pre-Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(5/13/02 10:44 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://liquid2k.com/nitetimehero/shotgun.gif height=160 width=130></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Angel+ByTheGun RPG</span><hr size=1> The freighter shook as a portal opened in hyperspace.  Bo was shaken, but he quickly composed himself.  As a well decorated human soldier, he had been chosen to lead these few warriors into planet H.  <br>
<br>
Bo Decker stood 6'4&quot; with an average build.  His hair was messy and dark brown.  Not much told him to be different from anyone else there, save the piercing blue glow in his left eye.<br>
<br>
One could guess this implant to be a battle scar, cybernetic operations were normally reserved for military men, on duty.  But Bo's truth was far more tradgic...<br>

**He was just out of the military, the sun was shining as he walked up his driveway, greeting his wife and three year old sun.  They exchanged hugs and he looked around at the neighborhood.  &quot;We need to move to a safer area&quot;***<br>

The words haunted him, thinking of how his family was murdered in the night, and how he was wounded trying to save them...                 <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ubythegun.showPublicProfile?language=EN>By the Gun</A> at: 5/13/02 10:51:20 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uzachius0zubar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zachius0Zubar</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.pocket-bishonen.com/dex/images/603a.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pre-Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(5/14/02 7:37 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Angel+ByTheGun RPG</span><hr size=1> Standing in a narrow hallway in the frighter was Zorbus Del'Kaon, a 5'11&quot; frail Martian soldier who had recently defected to the Tarrans. Now he found himself as a new soldier amoung the ranks of the friendly and often boisterous Terran millitary. Howerver, none of that kindness had ever been extended to him. He saw the way that the Tarans were appaled by his weak and frial body, and how much they mistrusted the gifts that his heritage had given him. Sometimes he would look back and wonder what could have possibly been bad enough to drive him into this, away from his own people. <br>
<br>
That was the thing though, he couldn't remember. For some reason he had no memories of anything that happened before his arrival on the Earth. All he knew is that he never wanted to go back to Mars again, even if it meant that he had to let these filthy terran barbarions expliot his superior mind. <br>
<br>
As the ship kicked into hyperspace Zorbus was all but thrown across the hall, his weak legs unable to absorb the shock. Zorbus reached out and caught himself however, using his mind to push off against the walls and floor. Yes, this was going to be a long campaign.    <p><Br/>                       </BR>

Her, Caron Reine, was to supervise this 'trip'(if you could call it that)to stop what ever trouble was happening. Though this may take a bit of messy fighting(something she was never to happy about) there was most certainly a chance of capturing an enemy ship, which would contain an enemy ship with a quite valuable cargo.(Which she would claim, as she was also the secratary) Caron appreciated nothing more than a than such a thing as valuable cargo.  <br>
<br>
She switched on the moniter of her private compartment, watching the soldiers who had been sent on this little trip. One she instantly reconized, a highly regarded soldier by the name of Decker. He was one to watch most carefully. She must also be careful that he not get to big for his britches, Lord knows what might happen if such a nuisance occur. <br>
<br>
Another being caught her attention, what appeared to be a martian hiding away in a corner, obviously shaken from the blast into hyperspace. 'Poor creature' she though. Martians never did get along well with people from Earth. But then again that really wasn't her concern, was it? Her only objective was to gain as much money out of this mission as possible. <br>
<br>
She signaled to her bodyguard, a man(if you could call him that, based on his ancestry) by the name of Kale to come to her side. His Trogian ancestry was quite obviouse, but such qualities made him the perfect bodyguard.<br>
&quot;Make sure to watch over these mercenaries. Some of them may not be exactly of the greatest moral standings, and if anything should happen to me, my father would be sure to have you executed. You do know who my father is, correct?&quot;<br>
Kale nodded solemly. EVERYONE knew her Caron's father was. If they didn't well, they didn't deserve to be called a Terran!<br>
<br>

The stench of blood and smoke fills the circular arena. A tall, powerfully built human stands in the centre of the blood-soaked killing zone, surrounded by the bodies of his comrades. Before him lies the corpse of a Trogian XenoSaur, a cybernetic being created only to kill.<br>
<br>
Zak smiles to himself as he bends down to wipe his blades clean on the still twitching body of the XenoSaur. For three years now he has lived as a slave on the Trogian colony 317-K, fighting to stay alive in the slave pits. The years of slaughter and torture have left their marks both on his body, the whip marks still standing in harsh relief on his back, and his mind. He giggles to himself as he recovers his empty rifle where he dropped it, and glances upwards as a squadron of Trogian fighters fly overhead.<br>

Only a slight difference in the silvery hue of the walls marked the doors to the basic amenities, and a larger gate through which the few warriors would disembark once the ship reached its destination. Tremors ran through the hull at regular intervals as the ship hit patches of hyperspatial turbulence, caused by the passing of other ships along galactic trade routes. A humming noise was coming from one side of the room as a small, frail Martian directed waves of energy to keep himself upright, and a quiet giggling echoed around the hold as the obviously mad swordsman obsessively polished his blades.<br>

The images on her monitor had proved her first opinion of this crew. They were either easily shaken or in 9 out of 10 cases, simply barbaric. <br>
<br>
She streched and rose from her chair. She turned to face Kale, an arrogant smirk on her face.<br>
&quot;I do belive it's time to go present myself to these..oh what would one call them...these..blue collar men,&quot; Kale remained silent. <br>
&quot;Well Kale, what do you have to say?&quot;Caron asked with hands on hips.<br>
&quot;It's your decision miss,&quot;he replied in a blunt tone.<br>
Caron smilied. &quot;Your damn right. Now come on, grab my shotgun,yes the big one, I want to give these folks a jolt,&quot;<br>

With the large weapon in one hand( built light enough but still packing power) and Kale the respectable 3 steps behind her, Miss Reine went through the automatic doors and into the passenger hold. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ucommcorranhorn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Commcorranhorn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pre-Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(5/22/02 8:00 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Angel+ByTheGun RPG</span><hr size=1> Krein Halcyon, Special forces to the Human Military. He walked down the martian streets, weaving his way, gathering as mush information in a short a period of time as possible. <br>
<br>
He gazed down at the ground, hardly touched by the Martians who usually floated around. He had a slim build, perfect for his mission. Find a weakness in the Martian planetary defences.<br>
<br>
Concealed weapons of extreme power and elegance ran under his tunic. Concussion grenades to a Hyraclion sword, pulsating with energy when activated by the wielder. This was his expertice, hand to hand or close range combat.<br>

Endlessly pressing buttons, hardwired into the chair, it didn't notice as the door slid open behind it. It didn't even notice as the pulsing beam of energy neatly bisected it. The black-clad warrior pushed the scrap away as he started to reprogram the consoles. Within moments chaos erupted in the spaceport as the automated security systems relentlessly gunned down civilians. Laughing with delight, the mysterious assassin tracked gunfire across the latest ship to enter Martian space - a sleek military cruiser. Then, his mission complete, he ripped a tooth out of his jaw. His laughter echoed around the empty room as the disguised micro-neutron bomb detonated, tearing the top of the control tower free, obliterating both him and three square kilometers of spaceport.<br>
----------------------<br>
The ship shook as the defence system struggled to transfer the power running through the hull. Suddenly the turbulence stopped. 'Hull power transfer complete' spoke a soulless, mechanical voice from the bulkheads. 'Initialising self repair circuits'.  The passenger hold gradually grew back to normal, the fires were extinguished and the smoke was vented. 'Well,' now the voice was female, and human, 'looks like we're here. I'm setting us down'. The pilot turned around in her chair. 'Kale, are you sure Miss Reine said here? There's nothing but scrap!'<br>
<br>

She stood in front of the doors she had come out of for some time, tapping the barrel of her shotgun against her thigh, contemplating the situation.<br>
<br>
The sudden disapearence of such a large city, let alone the Martian capitol was simply unheard of. She had best send down a crew to investigate, but who out of this mess of soilders should be sent?Caron thought for a moment. Of course! She had the identity numbers of all those on board in a small managing device(PDA) and with a quick push of a button, 3 randomly numbers would pop up, and thus the solution of who would go would be solved.<br>
<br>
&quot;Listen up men!&quot;she shouted suddenly. A few heads turned in her direction.<br>
&quot;I am your supperior and therefore you are obligated to follow my commands. All who do not follow this shall be disposed of immediatly!&quot;Once more, few payed attention.<br>
<br>
Being in no mood to put up with these soilders, she fired a loud shot into the ceiling, which left a nice smoking hole. Everyone's attention was on Miss Reine.<br>
&quot;It seems you finally figured out who is in charge! Now, 3 ID numbers will be chosed at random. Those 3 will then investigate a site,&quot;she pressed the button on her PDA.<br>
&quot;The first number is 875! The next is 464!The final number is...&quot;Caron's face dropped. The number, 341 was her own. Caron bit her lip. This was not supposed to happen! <br>
&quot;The last number is 341,&quot;She turned away, her back to the crew. She had gotten out of many similar situations but this she could not find a loophole in. She had already sent the data to headquarters and if she would back out, who knows what charges they might press!<br>
<br>
She turned back to the crew. &quot;If your number matches up to the one's called, you are to meet by this door within 2 hours, fully equiped! That is all!&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=neoangel>NeoAngel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(5/25/02 12:20 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Re:Angel+ByTheGun RPG</span><hr size=1> '875?' said Zak. 'Hmm, I wonder, which lucky devil is that one then. Oh yes - me. See you lot in the capital, losers!'. <br>
He stood up from where he was lying, drew both his swords and, with a flick of his wrists, sent energy humming through the blades. With another practiced motion he shut them off, sheathed them and hefted his pack. From it he pulled out a small case. 'Just a little insurance' he muttered as he opened it. Satisfied with what lay inside, he clicked it closed again and slid it into his pack once more. Shuddering as the glandular hypoinjectors inplanted under his skin filled him with adrenaline and a cocktail of drugs cooked up to combat his madness, he raced towards the door.<br>
----------<br>
<br>
Down in the ruins of the city, a small group of people moved through the streets. Each one was masked and wearing black, and carrying a hi-voltage energy rifle. Moving like black shadows of death, they ghosted towards the sleek, gleaming lines of the only ship to have survived the cataclysm...<br>

In almost complete unison, they raised their energy rifles and aimed. As the door slid open, they emptied their clips into the hatchway, then lowered the rifles and walked away. All of a sudden, one collapsed facedown in the dirt. As another leaned over his body, a rifle spoke again from the airlock, the armour piercing shell punching straight through the assassin and dropping him lifeless to the floor. Zak leaped out of the hatchway, drawing his blades as he went, and with a single smooth motion tore the throat out of another black-clad figure. <p>'It's better to light a candle than curse the darkness, and better than both to remain unseen.'- NeoAngel. .................

He held up his blade, but it was knocked back down.  The figure stood looking at zak.<br>
&quot;You are a Mar...&quot; he was quickly inturrupted.<br>
&quot;I am not a martian.&quot; the figure spoke. The sound of more assasins could be heard marching down the streets. Zak looked up.  There was a pause, the air began blowing fast.  everything was quiet.  He looked at the man, to see him reveal a large, gatling gun, with a laser sight.  All in one motion, the strange man whipped around and pulled down the trigger, sending out explosion tip bullets.  The bullets flung threw the still air and into the bodies of the assasins.  The shells popped in their bodies, shuting down their lungs, and made them take their last breaths.  The figure whipped back around and took a step forward.  <br>
&quot;I am Infestedmatrix, here to help on your journey&quot;<br>
He was a tall man, wearing a black tactical suit, with a black long trench jacket.  <br>
&quot;Now who is in charge here?&quot;<br>

'They're in the ship. But I'd lose the killware, there are a lot of soldiers in there, and if you even think of waving that toy around, you will die very quickly.'<br>
He turned towards the open hatchway. 'Miss Reine! Decker! You got a visitor!'<br>
Suddenly, a puff of dust exploded into the air by his feet. He leaned down for a second, saw the glinting metal, and grabbed hold of Infestedmatrix as bullets hurled down the street, richocheting off the hull of the shuttle and the rubble all around them. 'Excuse the rough treatment' he muttered as he dragged Infestedmatrix into the ship, sealing the airlock behind them.<br>

'Very nice, very nice. Fire putting-out first, psionic discussion later' Zak shouted as he smashed open a panel and hit the emergency sprinkler system activation. A hissing sound echoed through the ship as water rained down from above and carbon dioxide spread through the ship, clinging to the ground and constricting the air supply of the fires. Within a few seconds the only noise audible was the booming of the automatic external guns firing on the besieging forces. <p>'It's better to light a candle than curse the darkness, and better than both to remain unseen.'- NeoAngel. .................

All of the armored men ran to the airlock, guns in hand.  Matrix, pulled his large gun, ready for battle.  There was another explosion, the airlock door was swept away into the rain of bullets.  The area was now open for all sorts of fire.  Bullets flew into the hold,  the men ran for cover.  Running to the side walls, for protection from the firepower.  The assasins had tripled, they had more power, and the advantage.  But something had to be done, or the men would become space dust. <p>Everyone has an infested soul inside.

<br>
With that, he cocked his shotgun and turned.  He spang over the bench, firing 4 shots.  By the time the first of his victims hit the ground, he was already hiding behind a locker next to Caron.  She was crouched in the corner, hiding with her eyes closed and her shotgun griped over her head like a shield.&quot;  <br>
<br>
&quot;Ok sweety, this may be your daddy's game, but I'm not getting paid to sit around.  As long as we are in danger, I'm calling the shots!  Wave your little gun around as much as you want...just understand, when there is real work to be done...leave it to the guys with the know-how.&quot;<br>
<br>
He reached down and pulled a small, marble like object off his belt.  He regarded it for a moment, then tossed it into the crowd of assasins. <br>
<br>
A huge explosion rocked the hull of the ship as it exploded, killing several more of the attackers.  Meanwhile, Decker called to Zorbus, &quot;Can you use those mind powers of yours to make some kind of energy shield?  We need some temporary cover!&quot;  <p><P><hr color=blue>
