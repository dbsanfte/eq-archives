I find it rare to see an artist hit the scene with some art that i feel can trully be attributed to skillz.  <br>  FEK that, ill say what i mean.  HOW CAN ANYTHIN FROM DREAMWAVE PRODUCTIONS GET PUBLISHED!!!!!!<br><br>  All of their promotions for new series rock.  Then the book comes out and its FEKED up proportions and OVER USE of photoshop effects.  I mean when they show their pencils in the back arent they ashamed.  They are flat and bland and show little ability.  I find it sad that the strongest thing that i can say about Dark minds is.........the buildings always look nice.....<br>  <br>   Shidama ( or whatever) that book has some pages that are so bad its painful.  I have given them MORE then enough chances to live up to their promotion art, but they ALWAYS fail.  I was deeply hurt at the pencil molesting that Transformers recieved.  Quite frankly, it was little better then the butchering that Fox did to those badasses of cybertron.<br><br>  Warlands...DOWNHILL...all the spin offs of Warlands...DOWNHILL.  Half the fan art in the back is better.<br><br>  Props to my man on Ban Knights, hes doing it real big and i like that.  Still not as good as promotion.  ATLEAST hes consistant.<br><br>  A fianl note, who do i think are real artist:<br><br>  J.Scott Cam ( great pencils, did wonders for female anatomy)<br>  Joe Mad ( gave a NEW approach to hands and lips and EVERYTHING)<br>  Masamune Shirow ( The only thing he cant do is fly.....he paints, pencils, inks, colors, AND DAMN if u read his books....try not to fall in love with them) check out these: Appleseed, BM m66, Ghost in the shell, Man mach Interface (GITSII),  TANK POLICE (dominion), Intron Depot, Exxon Depot.

BEST SPIDER-MAN ever!!  Savage Drag, SUPER PATRIOT.<br> Todd Mac: eh, good creativly, he needs work on his fights....as in he NEVER does them...lets face it, spawn was a good story but boring as hell.<br>  TEX EARA (sp)  NICE PUNISHER, and a ghostrider that made u wet your pants.<br>  Bachulo (sp) Action gawd, his Marrow made my BONES shiver.<br>   my personal fave: The boys at capcom, art is so simple yet so crisp and in character...rock on peeps.<br><br>  LASTLY: ANYONE on this board that picks up a pencil and does it their way and does it REAL BIG.

To a SERIES OF 18 BOOKS PLUS SPECIALS THAT HAD NO ACTION except for an occasional chain whip or or spawn hurting himself.  Would lord of the rings be popular if the entire set was about Froto whining about how he was from hobbit city and picking his damn feet????  NO <br><br>  How many issues of spawn ( done by todd, which i clearly stated i was talking about) ended in him picking up guns and bullets and charging up.....just to hav it fall off into crap vill......i count 4, and one more when he was taking on overtkill.....worse draw action panels in the world.<br><br>  Sorry if i seem upset but i dont appreciate someone saying that i said something i didnt.

It takes a comic book like 20 issues to discuss what happens in 1 chapter of a book, so you only got to the end of the first chapter and threw down the book. He gets into a lot of action later in the series and his counter dissapears cuz he finds a way to replenish it, merely by decaying himself. It has a truly immensive story and you just hung around for the prologue. <p><br><A href="http://www.liquid2k.com/bogey"><img src="http://www.liquid2k.com/bogey/banner1.gif" width="375" height="50" border="0" name="Image_sig"></A</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ufithy1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fithy1</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.boomspeed.com/the1stdragon/tg2.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(6/10/02 11:32:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10231.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.boomspeed.com/the1stdragon/tg2.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Grrrrr</span><hr size=1>   WHAT DID I SAY...<br><br>Todds stuff was DULL NOT THE BOOK.

I have the first 75 issues of Spawn and Todd ended up just boring me out of purchasing the book anymore.<br><br>It seems as if Todd would start a story or plot line, later decide it was dumb, and then would just make it disappear.

Don't be the first.<BR><a href="http://www.rocketpig.net"><img src="http://www.rocketpig.net/images/Rocketpig-Button.jpg" width="200" height="92" border="0"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ualucard1515.showPublicProfile?language=EN>alucard1515</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator <img src=http://contest.polykarbon.com/badge1.gif></span><br> <font color=#336699>(6/10/02 12:10:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10231.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.undeadart.com/forum/alucard.gif width=100 height=94></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Grrrrr</span><hr size=1> Well, I don't think it's unfair to say it was boring while he was drawing it, but he's admitted he didn't do the best job pencilling the comic numerous times. He was busy with writing and the business aspect, and that's why he passed the pencilling on to Capullo.<br><br>I admit the book does kind of jump around sometimes. It takes on one problem, then forgets it within a few issues and doesn't come up again until many issues later, but I still enjoy the comic. They've gotten better about continuing the story now, and it's changed drastically now. Wanda, Terry, etc haven't even been mentioned since issue 100. That was supposed to be a change of direction for the series, and he hasn't done quite so much brooding. But that never bothered me anyway... I mean if I came back to life as a super deformed demon who was damned to hell and was greeted by my wife marrying my best friend and having a kid, it might take me a while to get over it too. I know he admitted he forgot the counter in the comic before, but he also said that some of his powers don't drain the bar, so he's not always forgetting, sometimes he doesn't need to show it because nothing changed. Besides, since issue 100 when he killed Malebolgia, the counter is gone completely.<br><br>About the Dreamwave books, I have to agree with you. I don't mean to put them down because they CAN do good artwork (like their covers and promo work like you said), but the pages inside of the books are sloppy and are not done to the best of their abilities. I was going to start collecting warlands when it first came out and when I opened the book I couldn't believe that the same artist did the pages as the cover.  <p><table width=100% border=0><tr><td>Thomas Bonvillain<br><img src=http://www.undeadart.com/temp/banner/banner.gif><a href=http://www.undeadart.com>undeadart.com</a></td><td><a href=http://pkimage.dhs.org/crit/crit.htm>Click here</a> for a broken link!<br><br></td><tr></table></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=camcreationz>camcreationz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(6/10/02 12:26:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10231.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Grrrrr</span><hr size=1> John Nguyen for the upcoming Perfect Limit.<br>Terrific pencils.

There's bending rules, then there's breaking them. And the seven heads thing and rules of proportion are simply guidelines. Those are IDEAL proportions. That isn't to say that all characters should follow those proportions, but it's a good rule of thumb. Anything too far away from those guidelines will look grossly innacurate though.<br><br>Dreamwave is basically a group that does Japanese styled artwork. Pat Lee is one, but I can't remember the names of the others. Darkminds, Warlands, uh... those are the only two comics of theirs I can think of right now. <p><table width=100% border=0><tr><td>Thomas Bonvillain<br><img src=http://www.undeadart.com/temp/banner/banner.gif><a href=http://www.undeadart.com>undeadart.com</a></td><td><a href=http://pkimage.dhs.org/crit/crit.htm>Click here</a> for a broken link!<br><br></td><tr></table></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showMessageRange?topicID=10231.topic&start=21&stop=33>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showNextMessage?topicID=10231.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10231.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.polykarbon.com/bbsimage/addreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.emailToFriend?topicID=10231.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.threadControl?topicID=10231.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=10231.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=10231.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub25.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="polykarbonbbsfrm18">PK-BBS Rules and Regulations!<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm27">Board F.A.Q.s<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm3">News and Updates<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm2">Photoshop and Art questions<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm4">General Manga/Anime Discussion<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm5">Japanese Language Help<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm23">art in progress<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm13">Black and White Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm14">Color Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm19">Member's Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm17">Moderators Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm6">Member Photos<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm30">News, Reviews and Rumours<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm31">Help, Hints and Cheats<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm20">Challenges<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm21">Matches<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm25">Pose Forum<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm26">Writer's Forum<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm32">VG Discussion<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm33">PolyKarbon CCG</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#336699>- </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs>Polykarbon BBS</a><font color=#336699> - </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19>Member's Lounge</a> <font color=#336699> - </font><a href="http://www.polykarbon.com">Polykarbon: Manga & Photoshop</a><font color=#336699> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.8.5.4<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
