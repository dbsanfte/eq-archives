<br>
The Ranagom Saga!!<br>
<br>
Chapter 1: Death of Friends<br>
                I sat there on the ground. Shiva was dead, Nemes was dead, and thirteen of my soldiers  also. Selian lie in the dirt, its blade dimly glowing. What  was I to do? It  was year 7 of the Plemarien domination and I sat in the Field of War thinking. My wounds were bleeding deeply as the crowds roared, I knew I hadn’t much time. <br>
            Oriom drew closer,  along side of him his 8 remaining War Men. He was a huge man with a long beard and great muscles,  his black eyes watching all around. I drew my sword Selian from the dirt  and its glow grew brighter. I stood at  about 5’9” and had bright golden hair, my ragged, torn clothes covered the bruises on my side and back.  My muscles tightened, my thoughts sharpened, and only one thought crossed my mind. I have to survive.<br>
           Axe drawn he signaled his War Men to halt. “Hmm, he wants to fight one on one.”  I thought. <br>
           “HA HA HA HA! Pitiful scum Tremesk, I shall drink your blood and feast on  your flesh! Are your ready for your death!? “ Bellowed Oriom. I stood there, saying nothing, but focusing on his thoughts, and feeling his blood rise in temperature . <br>
          Like a flash his axe swung, sending waves of pure energy straight  at me. A simple tilt of the head was all needed to dodge this poorly thought  attack. I retaliated quickly, charging at the brute with Selian glowing brightly above my head.  <br>
         Twice our weapons met, clanging loudly until I saw  opportunity, and swung for an unguarded area. I knew I was successful at the site of blood gushing from a deep wound at his side, and because a cry of pain that emitted from the barbarian.<br>
         “ AAAGGHHH! Curse you Tremesk! War Men! KILL HIM! “ The eight men seemed to activate and began their march towards me. A sly smile and idea formed in me, as the barbarian dropped to the ground with a massive crash! I hurled Selian into the air as high as I could, and it’s blade sung and glowed high above me, I began to move my hands and fingers while chanting a spell taught to me long ago.<br>
                “Flames within the chasm below, scold and fester upon the foes, that they may perish from the pain, steal their souls and forever reign!” With my final word and gesture, Selian hurled towards the ground, directly in front  of me. It halted while glowing in a deep red and spun flames from the blade. Massive blasts of fire shot at all the War Men, the ground and the ceiling. <br>
               Screams of pain, blasts of destruction, and scorching blazes were all that could be seen and heard. Along with all the remaining War Men and Selian I dropped to the ground, my body exhausted from the casting.  The dust settled and the flames burnt  away, the crowds roared and stood clapping. I gathered what strength I had left to stand and grab Selian. Looking behind to the Grand Skybox, I saw the Plemarien King Yyalern stand. He was a tall creature, slim and quick, like all Plemariens, and had light gray skin and no hair on his oddly circular head.<br>
               “ Well, well. Nice job for a Silph. Perhaps I underestimated you?”<br>
               “You are DAMN right you did! Now, are you going to keep your word!? “<br>
The King looked behind him. I saw him whispering something, then he turned and said in his low  voice, “ Very well Tremesk, I will keep my word in Plemarien Honor. You are free to go.” With a wave of his hand, two guardsman at the east side of the Fields of War opened the ancient,  enchanted doors of the arena. Natural light poured into the Plemarien arena, and the crowed hissed and covered their eyes. <br>
               I walked in pride and caution to the doors and as I passed into the outside lands, the guards hissed at me. I saw my friend Telly sitting under a large Ennt tree outside, and she was ecstatic to see me. She had been my good friend almost all of my life. Telly  was a small person, only  5’2”  with dark brown hair and she wore a clean, white shirt, and baggy brown pants that matched her eyes and hair. Around her back was a backpack of all our gear.<br>
                     The massive arena doors slammed behind  as she ran towards me. “Hey ya! Where is Shiva, and Nemes? Don’t tell me……no….!” A look of dread came over her face. She continued in tears,  “ T-this is why you should let  m-me fight! Maybe I could have saved them!” She sobbed and dropped to her knees.<br>
                   “No, I was lucky to make it out  alive, even without the Ranagom Crystal.”<br>
I walked past her to the shade of the tree and collapsed. The last thing I saw before I passed out were the leaves of this ancient tree blowing in the wind.<br>
