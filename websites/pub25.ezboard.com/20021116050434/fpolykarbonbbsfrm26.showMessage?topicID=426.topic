MOMENT<br>
<br>
&quot;I open my mind, recall her person<br>
Her body graceful, her voice appealing<br>
Every word a message from heaven<br>
Every move an unspoken poem<br>
<br>
I open my eyelids, study her face<br>
Beautiful eyes are closed for the moment<br>
Delicate lips are gleaming with moisture<br>
Delicate hair is framing the picture<br>
<br>
I open my arms, release her body<br>
Crawl from her bed, not wanting to wake her<br>
Regret not having the courage to dwell<br>
Regret not saying a proper farewell<br>
<br>
I open her door and exit the room<br>
Silent in the shadows of morning light<br>
I wish I could talk about how I feel<br>
I will be back, my feelings are for real&quot;<br>
<br>

ODE DE MINO<br>
<br>
You tell a tale of a tasty form<br>
The neck and bosom, belly and thighs<br>
Legendary shapes catching my eyes<br>
You're a stunner above every norm<br>
<br>
A sylphlike shape collected from curves<br>
And pleasure that's covered in smoothness<br>
Too unearthly for me to caress<br>
Even more than any man deserves<br>
<br>
And on top of those means of delights<br>
Stands Your face like the sum of my dreams<br>
Gathered in a collage without seams<br>
Making you the beauty queen of sprites<br>
<br>
Dunes of hair make my eyes uncertain<br>
With a faint scent they carry a code<br>
Telling my senses they're overflowed<br>
Mesmerized by Your lovely curtain<br>
<br>
Your lips are filled with essence of joy<br>
Forming smiles that goes right to my soul<br>
Making me loose my precious control<br>
Giving satisfaction to the boy<br>
<br>
But something that's far more fantastic<br>
Is the trip that departs through Your gaze<br>
This portal of a colorful haze<br>
Is what makes You all so bombastic<br>
<br>
Those eyes are the eyes of a seeker<br>
Nailing me here as a helpless prey<br>
Making me think I'll not get away<br>
Explaining why my knees are weaker<br>
<br>
And when You slowly extend Your hand<br>
Beckon me with Your index finger<br>
I don't have the spirit to linger<br>
Instead I follow every command<br>
<br>
<br>
- * -<br>
<br>
A HINT<br>
<br>
This search for love is what makes a crier<br>
Don't ruin your life with this callow pursue<br>
Do not let them drag and bind you anew<br>
Live your life the way that you desire<br>
Then sooner or later love will find you<br>
And of all kinds of love, that one is true<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
DIFFERENT PROTAGONISTS<br>
<br>
Does no one pay you any attention? <br>
I might do.<br>
There's a reason I'm writing this...<br>
just for you.<br>
Haven't read anyone's thoughts lately...<br>
never will.<br>
I just walk the streets alone...<br>
up the hill.<br>
Do I have a bald head?<br>
A wheelchair?<br>
No, I'm the one with claws...<br>
and chest hair.<br>
You have to tell me what you want...<br>
steer my hand.<br>
But once I get your point...<br>
I'm your man.<br>
<br>
<br>
- * -<br>
<br>
SOMEONE<br>
<br>
Why does no one call me on the phone?<br>
Why do I sit here all alone?<br>
I just sit here and hear the music...<br>
If I'm so smart, why can't I use it?<br>
Use it to get close to people<br>
Instead of being a social cripple<br>
I'm sick of being the wannabe<br>
I just want honest people around me<br>
But by meeting people like you<br>
I think my dreams can come true.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
NO DEVOTION<br>
<br>
She was the sun and I was nocturnal<br>
Filling over with emotion<br>
I thought our love would be eternal<br>
But where did I get that notion?<br>
<br>
I thought the sun could only be kind<br>
But I proved to be a fool<br>
'Cause when the sun had burned me blind<br>
I could not see the she was cruel<br>
<br>
She took it beyond my comprehension<br>
To things I could not perceive<br>
I thought I knew about her intention<br>
How could I ever be so naive?<br>
<br>
Angry 'cause she used me as her slave<br>
And left me there, bleeding<br>
No more will I behave<br>
It's my turn to be feeding<br>
<br>
I'm no longer so harmonic<br>
I'm out tonight looking for prey<br>
No devotion, just erotic<br>
some woman will have to pay... <br>
<br>
<br>
- * -<br>
<br>
WALKING THROUGH THE NIGHT<br>
<br>
I wander in the park<br>
Where I first met you<br>
I wander in the dark<br>
And wonder what is true<br>
<br>
I walk the lonely night<br>
With thoughts of summer wine<br>
I want to hold you tight<br>
I want you to be mine<br>
<br>
You came to me and healed<br>
The reason I was shy<br>
Then everything you stealed<br>
An left me to wonder why<br>
<br>
I wish to shed a tear<br>
But no tears are in me<br>
I wish that you where near<br>
That you could make me see<br>
<br>
Make me see the other stars<br>
That's up there with the sun<br>
So I can end my private wars<br>
Once again be part of the fun<br>
<br>
I've done all that can be done<br>
But I still don't feel fine<br>
I'm dreaming about the sun<br>
And its summer wine...<br>
<br>
<br>
- * -<br>
<br>
INSOMNIA<br>
<br>
Twisting and turning, there's no escape<br>
No light is presented, no shadows are cast<br>
Feelings are burning as always of late<br>
Actions are remembered from the years past<br>
<br>
Cruelty an kindness, people lived among<br>
Starting to weep, those things I said<br>
Outside is darkness the hours have gone<br>
Oh, please mister sleep come visit my bed<br>
<br>

<br>
A HERO'S DREAM<br>
<br>
It's just a dream <br>
<br>
Just me and my wife wading in the stream<br>
I see her face gleaming in the sun<br>
Then she stops and starts to scream<br>
And the world falls as I start to run<br>
<br>
It rushes onto me, the reality comes<br>
I'm awakened by the sounding alarms<br>
Kept awake by the marching drums<br>
Shoulder to shoulder with brothers in arms<br>
<br>
We're marching trough fields of the dead<br>
I can feel the coming of unwanted battles<br>
Forcing me to places that I dread<br>
I hear my backbone when it rattles<br>
<br>
But then the dream starts all over again<br>
My body is a guest at the king's table<br>
This is no field of death, no warlike den<br>
This is heroes and ladies from a fable<br>
<br>
The lady at my side laugh at my jests<br>
Seducing girls takes no more than talent<br>
I pinch her breasts and hear no protests<br>
Who said that I knight had to be gallant?<br>
<br>
Then there's a flicker of dark and light<br>
And another reality is before me revealed<br>
All around me there's a ferocious fight<br>
I'm back in the middle of another battlefield<br>
<br>
Around me are frightened boys with spears<br>
Their lack of skill in combat is ignored<br>
The anger fills my eyes with tender tears<br>
And I avenge the boys with my sword<br>
<br>
When the last one has been slain<br>
No more enemies are to be found<br>
Then in my chest I feel a burning pain<br>
Instead of a heart, I can see an open wound<br>
<br>
On the bed of feathers I fall to die<br>
And the fragments of the word disperses<br>
I'm a small child in pain and starts to cry<br>
Surrounded by comfort from the nurses<br>
<br>
They say I have to be a big boy and bold<br>
That crying will never do me any good<br>
I ask them why the room is so cold<br>
But the question is misunderstood<br>
<br>
Because they grab me by hand and feet<br>
And they accuse me for a stinking liar<br>
They will dispose of my stinking meat<br>
They will toss me into the raging fire<br>
<br>
As the fire burns I try remembering my lies<br>
I am trying to find the reason for this torment<br>
When suddenly I once again open my eyes<br>
To find my body standing on the battlement<br>
<br>
The whole castle is empty except for myself<br>
And a stunning maid tied naked to a tower<br>
Beyond the wall I see Orion the mighty elf<br>
With an enormous horde, an overwhelming power <br>
<br>
Then they fall upon me like a tidal wave of water<br>
But I stand my ground below the tower wall<br>
They give me a match, I give them slaughter<br>
And the naked maid in need is enthralled<br>
<br>
Then Orion himself steps up to my face<br>
Shakes my hand in order to get my attention<br>
Then he says that this isn't really my place<br>
And then he sends me to another dimension<br>
<br>
Like this it goes on and on through the night<br>
I sweat a lot, die often, but understands zero<br>
Its and endless crusade with fight after fight<br>
The only main theme is I as a hero...<br>
<br>
It's a hero's dream...<br>
<br>
<br>
- * -<br>
<br>
WARFARE<br>
<br>
Hard-boiled men in action poses<br>
Attitude and jungle-life<br>
Girlfriends with cheeks as roses<br>
Heroes of an epic strife<br>
<br>
Can't you see the sad girls eyes?<br>
Can't you feel the burning land?<br>
Can't you hear the sergeants' lies?<br>
Can't you smell the blood-soiled sand?<br>
<br>
Can't you see what you've become?<br>
You have been played for a fool<br>
Ruthless war is never fun<br>
And you where never cool...<br>
<br>
<br>
- * -<br>
<br>
A REASON<br>
<br>
There is a reason I'm trapped in loneliness<br>
I am dreaming of the knight to become<br>
There is a reason I'm wrapped in darkness<br>
I am dreaming of the light of the sun<br>
<br>
There is a reason I'm sitting here on my own<br>
I am waiting for someone like you<br>
There is a reason I'm sitting here all-alone<br>
I am waiting for my dreams to come true... <p><a href="http://pub63.ezboard.com/bkurki" target="_blank"><img src="http://webzone.k3.mah.se/k00ah0fk/linked/linktobbs.jpg" width="200" height="49" border="0" alt="Fredrik Kurki EzBoard"></a>

I did it fine on my own<br>
I didn’t resent beeing alone<br>
Why did you make it<br>
So I fell in love?<br>
<br>
I had this grand ambition<br>
A hero on an epic mission<br>
Why did you take it<br>
In your solemn glove?<br>
<br>
You used the dream against me<br>
Tossed me in the solitary sea<br>
Why did you forsake it<br>
For another man?<br>
<br>
I guess you where never mine<br>
I was just a way to spend some time<br>
Why did you fake it?<br>
What was your plan?<br>
<br>
I was the man who gleams<br>
Why did you breake it?<br>
I had a tower of dreams.<br>
Why did you shake it?<br>

I DON'T KNOW [Lyrics]<br>
<br>
I don't know you<br>
I don't know me<br>
I don't know anything<br>
But I guess its true<br>
Its what I feel<br>
This feeling that you bring<br>
<br>
'Cause I'm so happy here with you<br>
My bright emotions must be true<br>
I've never felt like this before<br>
It feels so good that I want more<br>
I want you home with me tonight<br>
To never let you out of sight<br>
<br>
It's getting late<br>
Please cant you tell<br>
Me what my chances are<br>
So is it my fate<br>
To go to hell<br>
Or will I be your star<br>
<br>
'Cause I'm so happy here with you<br>
My bright emotions must be true<br>
I've never felt like this before<br>
It feels so good that I want more<br>
I want you home with me tonight<br>
To never let you out of sight<br>
<br>

THE MEATMARKET [Lyrics]<br>
<br>
Hear my words<br>
Hear my call<br>
Let us save these women<br>
Draw your swords<br>
Let them fall<br>
Let them have our semen<br>
<br>
Let them fake<br>
Let them taunt<br>
Who are they to resist<br>
We can take <br>
What we want<br>
Then we're gone like the mist<br>
<br>
I got a candle <br>
That's made of steel<br>
Like a rocket<br>
Explosive<br>
Out in deep space<br>
If you can handle<br>
That blade you feel<br>
In my pocket<br>
And house it<br>
In a warm place<br>
Then you can be my little chick<br>
Exclusive rights to my little dick<br>
<br>
On your back <br>
Filthy girl<br>
You are mine to conquer<br>
Lets attack<br>
Let it whirl<br>
Can't take no pleads from her<br>
<br>
We are here<br>
Come to us<br>
Give us what we're needing<br>
Shed no tear<br>
Give no fuzz<br>
Don't say your heart's bleeding<br>
<br>
I got a candle <br>
That's made of steel<br>
Like a rocket<br>
Explosive<br>
Out in deep space<br>
If you can handle<br>
That blade you feel<br>
In my pocket<br>
And house it<br>
In a warm place<br>
Then you can be my little chick<br>
Exclusive rights to my little dick <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showPrevMessage?topicID=426.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showNextMessage?topicID=426.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=426.topic&index=2><img src=http://www.polykarbon.com/bbsimage/addreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.emailToFriend?topicID=426.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.threadControl?topicID=426.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=426.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=426.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub25.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="polykarbonbbsfrm18">PK-BBS Rules and Regulations!<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm27">Board F.A.Q.s<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm3">News and Updates<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm2">Photoshop and Art questions<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm4">General Manga/Anime Discussion<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm5">Japanese Language Help<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm23">art in progress<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm13">Black and White Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm14">Color Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm19">Member's Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm17">Moderators Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm6">Member Photos<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm31">Help, Hints and Cheats<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm20">Challenges<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm21">Matches<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm26">Writer's Forum<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm32">VG Discussion<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm33">PolyKarbon CCG<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm35">Member Created Tutorials<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm36">Best Tutorials</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#336699>- </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs>Polykarbon BBS</a><font color=#336699> - </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26>Writer's Forum</a> <font color=#336699> - </font><a href="http://www.polykarbon.com">Polykarbon: Manga & Photoshop</a><font color=#336699> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM ARTS AD SCRIPT -->
