<br>
Fifteen years after the Mars, Earth war the megalopolis of Cal was declared a city-state.  The city-state spanned nearly five of the older state boundaries that were there before the rebuilding after “The Crash”.  It was contained in an enormous environmental seal that locked out the now rancid and cancerous air. Though Cal was brilliantly lit with holos and building lights, a shadow of chaos was slowly consuming the relatively quiet land of Cal along with the entire globe. Small gangs were fighting for control, buying and manufacturing weapons with sells of an incredibly destructive drug called “lightning”. The chemical acts upon the nervous system causing the electrical signals in the brain to be accelerated twenty times the normal speed.  The effects of this drug cause the body, and mind to act and react with unimaginable speed and accuracy.  The adverse effect is burnout. Much like forcing to much current through a light bulb, so is the result with the mind.  To counter this new threat the government has formed an undercover unit called “Agents”. They are sworn to destroy any threat to the well being of society.  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
<br>
The air was cooler than normal tonight it seemed to the huddled figure sitting in the ally. “Atmosphere regulator must be down again”, thought the mangy old shadow.  “Well lets get this show on the road.” muttered Preston aloud.  “ANDRIANA!” he hollered through the brain com. “Uh! Dammit Preston I told not to do that !”, came Andiana’s  mental voice from the car around the block. “What the hell do you want? It’d better be important.” she growled while rubbing her head where she had bumped it against the roof. “Sorry.” he grinned. His face suddenly became sober and darker than usual. “When do we move?” “You know damn well when. When we hear from Davis” “Yeah, Yeah ” muttered Preston under his breathe ending the brain com transmission. “I swear he lives to torment me,” grumbled Andriana as she peered through her indigo hair into the darkness. Her short colorful hair was her identifying mark among female agents.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Those two can expect a double fee tonight.” thought Davis “Moving heavy equipment was not in tonight’s plans.”  His mechanical eye glowed green as it switched to night vision.  He peered through the gloom to confirm his targets. “Just gather the intelligence we need to prosecute she said. Yeah right.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
As Preston was about to light his favorite coconut cigar, Davis’ low voice whispered into the back of his and Andriana’s minds, “I’ve secured our evidence. One ton of lightning, files containing names accounts, and equipment and chemicals for manufacturing the lightning.” “Prints?,” replied Andriana.  “Affirmative ,” said Davis. “Any firearms? ,” asked Preston. “No”, answered Davis “ But we do have enough for death with out pinning the murders on them. Anything else you two?” “No links to the murder?” whined Andriana. “Yeah I know,” said Davis “but there isn’t anything.”  “Fine,” came Andriana’s thoughts, “lets move.” She stepped out of the car and fastened her armor vest. “Hold on”, came Preston’s thought suddenly. “Where are they?” Andriana pulled up her visor. “There moving into the room directly next to your position.”  answered Andriana. Her voice suddenly became concerned as she thought of the oncoming weapons fight and the possibility of it spilling in to the streets. All though it was late and the citizens of Cal were inside due to the mandated curfew, it wouldn’t save them from a crazed thug on lightning. Especially a lightning thug with explosive arms. “I can contain them,” came Preston’s attempted reassuring thoughts. He had picked up on Andriana’s emotional waves. “What are you going to do?” asked Davis. “Just watch.” answered Preston. Suddenly the poor homeless man stood and tore off his rags, revealing Preston’s dark skin in a midnight agents uniform. Preston pulled a driver from the dumpster that was sitting next to him. He slapped a strange device to his forearm. It ignited his blood to a river of lava. His muscles tensed and then instantly nearly tripled in bulk. He spread his tree trunk legs for better balance and fired the massive weapon.  The shell bored through the steel wall, and the man’s chest that had been standing on the other side before lodging itself in the next wall.  “Aah shiat”, groaned the drug king standing closest to the shell as the counter reached zero.   Preston threw himself into the dumpster just as a cloud of fire roared into the ally and rushed out the shattered windows in front.<br>
   <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Preston!” screamed Andriana; her voice parted the blood haze in his mind. “It’s all right, I’m all right.,” his mind sighed. The patch was wearing off now his thoughts came clearer. What happened?”, demanded Andriana,  “I couldn’t see through the visor.”  “ I … I don’t know,” replied Preston. “Boolshit!” came Davis’ thoughts to Preston alone. “Don’t worry I wont tell, but you should.”  Andriana’s thoughts trickled through again, “Get to the car we’ll check in from there. Right now I need a drink. We’ll talk later Preston.”  “Yeah”, was all Preston could manage. “I’ll meet you there. I need to get this stuff to the lab first.” replied Davis.  Preston disabled, and collapsed the driver and carefully placed it in a bag along with his disguise. He walked out in to the street where Andriana met him and through his bag in the trunk. “Jeezus Preston! What do you have in there?” asked Andriana as the rear suspension sagged.  “Just some extra gear. You can never be to prepared you know.”  As Preston and Andriana drove off to meet Davis at their favorite bar, neither were aware that they were being watched by a shadow on a high building shelf of a nearby building. “Interesting,” whispered the shadow, “It may truly be time.”<br>

&quot;The Crash&quot; is really vague...A more descriptive name could help...especially since it sounds minor for a cataclysmic event...<br>
I love the idea for the drug...it borders on matrix cliche a little much...it sounds like a stronger version of crystal meth though so I guess it's cool...<br>
I don't think calling an agency &quot;agents&quot; is right...first of all it's logically wrong (I can explain if you don't see it)...it's also again borrowing from the matrix by being massively vague...You could change the agency name to a cool acronym (TEA = Threat Elimination Agency) and still call the employees agents (as they would be in an agency...I think you have to have an agency to have agents) Even cooler would be to give them numbers for identification...that would make them more vague and mysterious...and you wouldn't have to think up names for a while<br>
a &quot;TON&quot; of files is kind of vague...if they are literally hard copy files and they actually are one ton it would be strange to see in the future (it's strange now)...they would probably use the number of pages to describe it...computer files you can be more vague and just use the amount of memory...&quot;We got 3 terrabytes of files&quot;<br>
You might not want to be so blatent in saying adrianna's distinguishing characteristics...just describe her and let the reader decide what characteristics are important...strange hair would make her stand out....<br>
as well the mechanical eye thing is weird too...do all the characters have huge blatent things to point them out...Is he a cyborg...is it prosthetic...did he lose his eye by accident or was it like breast implants and done on purpose as an enhancement...as well having night vision GLOW would be a very very bad thing...anybody who has been out on a really dark night knows how the smallest bit of light that is out of place REALLY stands out...in the day time it might not matter but at night it makes a massive difference...especially long range...Having normal looking eyes would be a plus...but maybe there's a certain dead look about his eye(s) that makes them different and really bugs people...it could be some friction between him and other agents<br>
What was the gun that he used...was it some big railgun or just a powerful conventional gun...or an armor peircing anti-tank type gun<br>
Was it lightning that preston took or some other weird drug<br>
And what is with the thinking...I think telepathy is a bit much...vocal communication would be better and less confusing...<br>
Finally the biggest change...Get rid of the first paragraph entirely...that's right...the story would be better starting from nowhere and you learning the details as you go along...it's good for this quick intro that you put here...but it's too dry for the story and it flows better after it...<br>

<br>
 davis eye-- was implanted by himself as you'd find out later he lost it in the mars earth war(wich is explained also) he did this cause well he's eccentric . the eye has several functions, night vision, infared, telescoping abilities. the reason he isnt worried about the glow is he isnt around anyone. He's thorough in checking things out before he infiltrates. and what he found was not a ton of files, but 1 ton of lightning, and files, and equipment. should have written that better<br>
<br>
concerning drugs-- I dont really see what they have in common with the matrix. their pill allows them to enter the matrix or see it. Lightning is sort of a super steroid. The drug Preston used is not lightning. You'll learn about that in the next section as well. <br>
<br>
the gun-- the driver is strictly a military weapon. Preston isnt supposed to have one, thats why he collapsed it to hide from Aindriana. It has an enormouse (lack of better words) kick to it<br>
You have to be incredibally strong to use it. Why davis had to bulk up. the Military soldiers are genetically engineered to be huge. It's used for clearing rooms in an urban area just like preston did or it can be used as a sort of grenade gun.<br>
<br>
The Crash---A desperate attack made by mars that came to late. explained later.<br>
<br>
Agents--- I agree it just sucks and is gonna be changed.<br>
<br>
telepathy--- they arnt telepathic. A small transmitter is connected to the brain and acts sort of like a coded radio. origanally Preston was going to be the only one with this function.<br>
<br>
first paragraph-- I think it provides some kind of important background, but will you do me a favor jeffm? After i post the second part will you let me know if you think the first paragraph should still  go? Thanks alot for the feed back both of you. Oh one more thing.

what I meant about the similarity of lightning and the matrix was the super speed abilities...but in the matrix it's intrinsic instead...using a drug and making it accesible to the masses adds a little distance though<br>
The gun sounds like fun...I love how the car drops when he tosses it in the trunk...<br>
you explained a lot...<br>
Now that I think about it though it feels a lot more like ghost in the shell...I'm not saying stay away from cliches completely but be careful to stay original...<br>
your sig confused me when I was reading...I thought it was part of the story...that had me scratching my head :-) <p><pre>

It's a lot easier to see the whole scene this way then you can toss in things to make it cooler because you're into it and can actually feel what would make it cooler... <p><pre>
