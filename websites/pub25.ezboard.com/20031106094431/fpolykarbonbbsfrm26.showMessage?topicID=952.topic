<br>
Waking Renee<br>
<br>
<br>
PAGE 1<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 1: Exterior of a cabin deep in the woods. It is in the middle of a fairly large clearing, surrounded by a small field of corn and other crops. There should be absolutely nothing even remotely &quot;modern&quot; or &quot;industrialized&quot; about the small homestead. It is late evening. The few windows are lit from inside as a lazy trail of smoke floats out of the chimney.<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 2: Interior shot of the small cabin. Its interior is small and a little cluttered. The ground floor has a small kitchen/dining nook. A small table sits just outside the kitchen area with a wash basin on it. A ladder ascends from the center of the room, and reaches a small loft with two beds. A young boy, perhaps 11 years old, and his sister, 8 years old, are finishing up their chores after dinner. They are drying the plates and utensils they had dinner with. Remember: regarding the cabin's interior and the youngsters' garments, this is a &quot;pre-industrialized&quot; society.<br>
<br>
WILL: &quot;OKAY, MICAH, IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO BE OFF TA BED.&quot; <br>
<br>
MICAH: &quot;AH, WILL... WHAT ABOUT THE MONSTERS?&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 3: Will looks at his sister with patronizing disappointment. He tosses the rag he was holding onto the nearby table. Micah is genuinely concerned.<br>
<br>
WILL: &quot;NOW YOU KNOW BETTER'N THAT. THERE AIN'T NO SUCH THANG AS NO MONSTERS.&quot; <br>
<br>
MICAH: &quot;THAT AIN'T WHAT RENEE SAYS.&quot;<br>
<br>
WILL: &quot;YOU CAIN'T BE LIS'NIN' TO HER FAIRY TALES.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 4: Will is motioning to the ladder that leads up to the beds. Micah is looking about plaintively.<br>
<br>
WILL: &quot;PLUS, MA AND PA WON'T STAN FER NONE O'THAT FOOL TALK. NOW GET YO RUMP UP TA BED 'FORE YOU WAKE RENEE. YOU DO THAT AN SHE GO'NA HAVE YO HIDE.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 5: Resigned, Micah heads up the ladder. Will is watching approvingly.<br>
<br>
MICAH: &quot;OH, WILL...&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 6: Close-up of the inside of the cottage door. It bows inward violently as someone/thing pounds powerfully on it. The two children are startled.<br>
<br>
SFX: &quot;BAM! BAM! BAM!&quot;<br>
<br>
MICAH (whispering): &quot;Will, who...?&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
PAGE 2<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 1: A shot from waist level, looking up at Will, who is holding his finger to his lips. Behind him, still on the ladder, Micah looks at him expectantly.<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 2: Again, a close-up of the inside of the cottage door. Again it is rocked violently as someone/thing pounds on it. It appears to be splitting under the assault.<br>
<br>
SFX: &quot;BAM! BAM! BAM! SNAP!&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 3: A shot from over Micah's shoulder Will is whispering orders as he reaches for an axe.<br>
<br>
WILL (whispering): &quot;Get on upstairs. Stay outta sight.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 4: The door, still under assault, splinters violently:<br>
<br>
SFX: &quot;BAM! BAM! BAM! CRACK!&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 5: The door explodes inward, as a giant ogre blasts in. Two more foul beasts wait behind the first. Will is no longer anywhere to be seen.<br>
<br>
THE HEAD OGRE: &quot;RRRAAAAAHHHHHH!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
PAGE 3<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 1 (inset atop PANEL 2): Close-up of Micah's eyes peering over the loft edge at what transpires below. She is terrified.<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 2: A ceiling shot, looking down at the developing drama. Micah can be seen laying down on the loft, observing their visitors. Will still cannot be seen anywhere. The three ogres almost seem too big for the cabin's interior.<br>
<br>
OGRE ONE (the first to enter): &quot;URG, URM... MEATSZZ. WANTS MEATS!&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 3 The ogres begin rifling through the cottage.<br>
<br>
THE TWO OTHER OGRES: &quot;YEZZZZ, MEATZZ. WANTS MEATS!&quot;<br>
<br>
OGRE ONE: &quot;URB. HZZZZ. FRESHZZZ, WIGG'LING MEATSZZ.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 4: More ogre rifling. Ogre one, with his head up, begins to sniff the air.<br>
<br>
OGRE ONE: &quot;SLURP! URG. ZSNIFF. SNIFF. ZSNIF.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 5: The sniffing ogre whips his gaze to the top of the loft. Micah cannot be seen.<br>
<br>
OGRE ONE: &quot;FRESH WIGG'LINZ MEATZ!&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 6: The ogres are excited as one of them starts to climb the ladder to Micah. She bounds backwards, obviously terrified.<br>
<br>
THE TWO OTHER OGRES: &quot; FRESH WIGG'LINZ MEATZ.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
PAGE 4<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 1: Will comes flying out of the wash tub in which he and his sister had been doing the dishes. Cups, utensils, dishes, and a shower of dish water are airborne as Will draws the axe back to strike.<br>
<br>
WILL: &quot;AAAAAHHHHH!&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 2: The surprised ogres, including the one climbing up the ladder towards Micah, start towards their unexpected assailant.<br>
<br>
OGRE ONE: 'MEATZSS SURPRISSEZZ.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 3: Will swings the axe, and the head of the beast nearest him (one of the two ogre twins) separates gruesomely from its shoulders.<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 4: The young boy lands prepared for more battle. He is drenched. His hair hangs in his face. His clothes soaked and dripping, hang heavily from his scrawny frame.<br>
<br>
WILL: &quot;LEAVE. YOU ARE NOT WELCOME.&quot;<br>
<br>
OGRE ONE: &quot;HRR. URG. LIDDLE MEAT SPEAKZ. SPIZEY MEAT.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 5: The remaining two creatures advance on Will. He looks tiny and frightened, as they close in, but he holds his ground bravely.<br>
<br>
OGRE ONE: &quot;AH-HURM. MEATZ EYEZ AN TENDER HEARTZ MINE!&quot;<br>
<br>
REMAINING OGRE: &quot; LEGZ. LEGZ MINESSZ.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
PAGE 5<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 1: With a warrior yell, Micah comes flying off the loft.<br>
<br>
MICAH: &quot;STAY AWAY FROM MA BROTHER!&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 2: The little girl lands on the back of one of the ogres. Will's hand is out in horrified protest.<br>
<br>
WILL: &quot;MICAH, NOOOO!&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 3: She is holding on for dear life as the ogre thrashes about trying to dislodge the little unwanted rider. In the background, Will is getting ready to throw the axe. The riderless ogre one is drawing his sword.<br>
<br>
WILL: &quot;HOLD ON, SIS!&quot;<br>
<br>
OGRE ONE: &quot;IG. HURK. MORE MEATZ TO EATZ. YUMMMM.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 4: Will hurls the weapon.<br>
<br>
WILL: FEAST ON THIS YA UGLY BEAST!&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 5: The axe buries itself deep in the ogre's forehead as the creature tosses off MIcah. Ogre one is reaching for Will.<br>
<br>
MICAH: &quot;HH-000HHH!&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 6: The remaining ogre wraps his massive hand around Will's throat, lifting the young boy into the air.<br>
<br>
OGRE ONE: &quot; HURK. LEZ TO ZZSHARE.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
PAGE 6<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 1: The ogre holding Will throws him at his sister.<br>
<br>
OGRE ONE: &quot;IK BLIK. LETZ THE MEATZ PLAYSZ.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 2: Will collides with Micah.<br>
<br>
WILL: &quot;UMFF!&quot;<br>
<br>
MICAH: &quot;OWW!&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 3: The two children lay sprawled in the debris created by their collision. The final monster towers over them. It is drawing back its massive sword. Something is glowing slightly behind it.<br>
<br>
OGRE ONE: &quot;ORK. ZSCREAM MORE, MEATZ. TENDER MEATSZ.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 4: The ogre looks over its shoulder as a blinding source of light erupts from behind it. The creature tries to block the light by holding up its massive hand. Behind ogre one, but closer to the reader are the two kids, also trying to block the light with their hands.<br>
<br>
MICAH: &quot;YOU DONE DID IT, NOW...&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 5: The beast looks back at the children with confusion in its eyes.<br>
<br>
MICAH: &quot;YOU DONE WAKED UP RENEE. YOU GO'NA BE REAL SORRY.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
PAGE 7<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 1: Exterior of the cabin. There is a bright light pouring supernaturally from the windows and busted door, lighting the clearing the cabin rests in.<br>
<br>
SFX: &quot;ZZZZZZZ-RAKKKK!&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 2: The remaining ogre erupts backwards from the doorway, out into the night.<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 3: The monster lands in a lifeless heap far from the cabin.<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 4: Large panel. Back inside the cottage. A tiny winged figure floats before the two children. Micah and Will are holding their hands up trying to block the glare from the tiny fairy.<br>
<br>
WILL and MICAH: &quot;THANK YA, RENEE.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 5: Close-up of Renee. She is beautiful, ethereal, exotic. Her hands are on her hips<br>
<br>
RENEE: &quot;WHAT A MESS. I GO TO SLEEP FOR A FEW HOURS AND LOOK WHAT YOU TWO ALL GET INTO. YOUR PARENTS ARE GONNA SKIN YOU ALIVE.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 6: Pan back. Two dead ogres, ogre guts, and wreckage everywhere, with the two children, and the fairy in the middle of it all.<br>
<br>
RENEE: &quot;YOU ARE NEVER GOING TO SEE DAYLIGHT AGAIN!&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
PAGE 8<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 1: The two children are standing and brushing themselves off, while Renee flits about them.<br>
<br>
WILL: &quot;WHERE WE GO'NA GET STARTED? IT DONE BIN ALL TORN APART.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 2: Will is starting to panic. The full weight of what just happened is starting to sink in.<br>
<br>
WILL: &quot;MA AND PA GO'NA HAVE MA HIDE.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 3: Suddenly, Micah hauls off and decks her brother, knocking him to the floor.<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 4: As Renee floats over her shoulder, Micah stands angrily over Will, who is sprawled out on the floor. He is rubbing his jaw and looking more than a little bewildered as his little sister yells at him.<br>
<br>
MICAH: &quot;YOU LIED!&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 5: Exterior of cabin.<br>
<br>
CAPTION (Micah): &quot;YOU SAID THERE WEREN'T NO MONSTERS!&quot;<br>
