<br>
After a day of working on my jewelry skills, I came across some other Council ladies in Firiona Vie (Cashew, Galadhriel and Irides).  After a short discussion, we decided to head to North Karana to tackle the hill giants!  So we had 31st season druid, 30th wizard, 24th cleric and myself, 31st enchanter.  After arriving, we buffed up, I summoned pet, etc etc.  We formed our plan, Galadhriel would snare the beat, I would get my pet engaged, step back and fear it, and then chaos from there.  We then went on our search of a hill giant (finally the hunters instead of the huntees).  We found one...and decided to go for it.  We agreed if things looked bad, to run early.  The worry was for nothing though, as Galadhriel snared, my fear took hold and he absorbed all the power of Cashew's nukes.  I had a couple of resists, but I did 600 damage plus whatever my pet did, Cashew did around 1000 damage, and I imagine Galadhriel did probably in between Cashew and myself!  But the fact of the matter was, we killed a hill giant!  Let me tell you there has been no feeling greater, as there is now less fear in my blood from them.  Sure, it took 3 of us damaging, and one making sure we didn't fall in health too much.  The 3 guns were practically out of mana after the encounter, so it's not something that's easy.  It takes the right mix of people (someone to snare and someone to fear are essential), and big damage (Thanks Cashew!) always helps.<br>
<br>
After this we went to rest at the guards.  The order of events is a bit fuzzy, so I'll just go to another very significant event.  We killed GrimFeather!  Okay, so we had some help when he wandered into the guards at the tower and they took away a lot of his health while he killed them, so he was a wounded bird.  But we jumped on him after, using the same tactics as we used on the hill giant.  And the bird dropped!  This was also after we had taken on a regular griffon, so I already had a little more confidence that we might be able to take him.  Of course the only other chance we would have had to kill him from full health was when he appeared right after we killed him!  Well, needless to say we weren't exactly ready as we had just expended a lot of energy killing his previous incarnation.<br>
<br>
Of course there was some tragedy in the night, as both Irides and Galadhriel had deaths.  Just had some bad luck on Irides' time, as while we were killing one griffon, another showed up and immediately went after her (while she was assisting a newbie), and also Cashew went LD at the same time.  So a bit much to handle so someone took care of the second griffon for us (thanks Nikoryn).  Gala died while Cashew was still in LD land, and we decided to try to take on a hill giant.  He got on Gala after a short bit, and I tried to get him feared again, but just went out of my range.  So then I had to try to do enough damage to it, but that wasn't really working and I went out of mana.  A wizard offered to help kill it, so I told him to go ahead, just wanted it off my back.  Well, he did more damage than I did (since Gala was wiped of it's memory), so we didn't even get the kill.  But we did get a nice loot from it (A little over 11p in cash for each of us, not to mention FS weapon, lambent stone and an ivory.<br>
<br>
All in all it was a fun night!  Several griffon, hill giants, griffennes and even GrimFeather fell to the might of the Council of Twilight ladies night out.  We look forward to bringing more along for the ride!  Until then, happy and safe hunting!<br>

(big brother follow-up)</span><hr size=1> Well met all,<br>
<br>
This sounded like great fun what you posted about there little sister.  Of course not to be outdone, I was happy to get a small piece of the action.  Later on, after you had gone to bed (awww, rough day killing giants, poor baby), Cashew, Cirroc and myself went off after some of our own.  Met in Firiona Vie, ported to NK, etc...  Similar plan to yours, with me being in Galadhriel's place as snarer, and trying to live up to her damage.  With my tracking skills, we went in search and found a hill giant shortly thereafter!  We went to work and it went off flawlessly, with all of us only getting hit a few times.  We then went and medded up some more, and found Regis The Reverent on tracking.  Figuring we could get another bracer for the guild's clerics, we killed him and let Cashew loot, as she has the evil dark elf cleric she seems rather fond of giving stuff to.  And it's just easiest for her to complete the quest anyway, with her being able to port close to the Temple of Solusek Ro.  Medded up a short bit again, and went off to find another hill giant.  We did, and killed it, similar to how we did before.  But though we wanted to slay more, they must've been as tired as my companions and had already gone to slumber, as I was unable to find any of their tracks.  So my awesome teammates Cashew and Cirroc decided to head off as well, but I wasn't done just yet...<br>
<br>
Since I now had the panic animal spell, I knew that killing griffawns would be an easy task for me, and I wanted to try to get griffennes to come out.  I killed probably 5 or so griffawns, and then a griffenne showed up.  It was an easy fight, easily keeping it feared.   Then shortly thereafter I found my way to a griffon, appeared slightly more powerful than myself (yellow con).  I figured what the heck, and went to work on it.  It was a tough beast, resisting snare a few times before it finally took.  I then went to fearing the animal, and that was also a chore, but I was able to get it running.  I must admit, the griffon was a worthy adversary, as when he resisted my panic spells, he would lay into me heavily (up to 88 damage), and thus by the time he fell, I was slightly under half health, and about 30% mana.  But wow!  I never thought while I was in my teens that I would be able to take a beast like this by myself, but with my new panic spell, it was fairly easy.  It was a long task though, taking probably between 5-10 minutes, but I won the war of attrition.  I even slew another griffenne after that, only making sure I had enough mana to keep the beast at bay.<br>
<br>
Well, there is my story of North Karana.  As I understand it, the earlier group also killed Regis for Irides to get a bracer, but my sister forgot to add that in her excitement over the other activities.  She is just a blonde you know, so I apologize for her oversight.  I look forward to hunting all these beasts again, and I knew it was risky taking on the griffon, since I was still bound in Firiona Vie.  But I triumphed, and had my Spirit of Wolf spell in place, so at the earliest sign of trouble, I would've made like Feldros and ran like the wind!  Take care my fellow councillors!<br>

Yes, what a tremendous turning point indeed the other night.  We took down hill giants and other nasty thing, and not even a full group.  The right mix helps.  A druid/ranger and an enchanter are musts.  Sure I might have done the most damage a few times, but I couldn't have done it without the help of my fellow ladies.  I'm sorry about the deaths that occurred.  And don't let that scare you off!  We can take them down, with careful planning.   More will fall, of that I have no doubt.<br>

We took down GrimFeather at full health.  This is spectacular.  Revenge on all the times he has killed us, and we've only just begun.  Galadhriel, Loralana, and I hunted for a bit, and then Cirroc joined us.  Alas, Galadhriel and Lora had to go eventually.  Later on in the evening Lora's brother Kinvarian took up the fight and joined Cirroc and I.  More griffons, griffenes, and HG fell.   3 people can take GrimFeather down, but I'm sure my fellow guildites agree that it's still dangerous.  If Snare and Fear don't take, then we know we're in for some trouble.  The more the merrier of course, North Karana seems to be the hunting ground of late.  So join us if you can!  And don't worry about binding there.  If you're bound in Firiona Vie or elsewhere, Galadhriel, Oakwyn, or I would be glad to teleport you there.  <br>
