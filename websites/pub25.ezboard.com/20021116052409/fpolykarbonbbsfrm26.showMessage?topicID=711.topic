you probably wont, but i still wanna say it: DONT STEAL!<br>
thank you<br>
<br>
now then, this took me 3 hrs to write, i think thats a long time, but idunno, maybe your opinions are different on that.<br>
<br>
It is for a manga called 'Hidden Emotions', wich will also be drawn by me.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
There is a boy and a girl... <br>
or man and women, <br>
nothing is really for keeps in this one, <br>
the age of both is really unknown and is <br>
nowhere to be found in the records of their station. <br>
Or in any other.<br>
They don't seem old though, <br>
so they can't really be. <br>
Can they?<br>
<br>
&quot;When the time comes, <br>
when the war has stopped, <br>
when the sky seems black with dust, grease and gunpowder, <br>
two legendary beings will rise! <br>
<br>
These beings will clean the world, and in due time the blue planet should be cleansed of any evil beings, <br>
<br>
end of time, end of place. All such words will become meaningless, for it is not time that judges whether you <br>
<br>
are good or not, neither is a place; only the spirit that is you can define you being good, or being bad. <br>
Make sure you take the right decision.&quot;<br>
<br>
Two people are sitting in the dormitory they share; <br>
discussing the war, they have fought together, with the enemy.<br>
<br>
<br>
#1 &quot;Heh, yeah, my old man wrote that...&quot;<br>
#2 &quot;You think it'll happen? I mean... the war is over now...&quot;<br>
#1 &quot;And the sky looks black with dust and grease and gunpowder....&quot;<br>
#2 &quot;..so? Do you think so?&quot;<br>
<br>
=ding dong ding dong= (Cafetaria is open)<br>
<br>
#1 &quot;Well.... Who knows? It might; it might not...&quot;<br>
<br>
#2 &quot;Stop giving those vague awnsers.... they're not even real awnsers!&quot;<br>
<br>
#1 walks over to the door, pushes the button on the panel, right to the left of it.<br>
<br>
-psshunn- -tishhh-<br>
<br>
It opened.<br>
<br>
#1 &quot;Heheheh... well, maybe that's something my old man gave me of him! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  &quot;<br>
<br>
#2 &quot;Aww, common! Gimme a break!&quot;<br>
<br>
#1 one walks out of the door, leaving #2 behind to shut the door.<br>
<br>
#2 &quot;H-hey! Wait up!&quot;<br>
<br>
Both are now running through the hallway; on their way to the cafetaria.<br>
He is called 'Daitsuke' and she is called 'Hiroki'.<br>
<br>
Not only their ages are unknown;<br>
also their surnames, <br>
origin, <br>
race, <br>
homeworld, <br>
kind and even their combat type are to be discussed.<br>
<br>
However, the forces didn't want to lose them in their effort to make the world better (or in this case, save the <br>
<br>
whole thing...) because, they are yet to be defeated. Nobody knows why they hang around eachother either, <br>
<br>
because they don't seem to have a relationship of some sort.<br>
<br>
People even asked them if they were a couple, to wich they insisted to 'forget that rediculous thought!'<br>
Also was them asked, if they were brother and sister, to wich they remained silent...<br>
<br>
The war has been faught, it has ended, and as usual, al pupils and seniors, warriors and janitors come to <br>
<br>
the cafetaria to...<br>
&quot;DIG IN!!!&quot; -=YEAH!=- (Mass hall)<br>
<br>
That was Churie, Hiroki's closest friend; probably the closest anybody will get to her besides ofcourse <br>
<br>
Daitsuke.<br>
She is a nice person, and knows how to stand her ground, and standing firm while doing it.<br>
To her, the 'principle' is (or are) everything. The only thing she won't allow her principles (or her manners) <br>
<br>
get inbetween is food!<br>
<br>
The cafetaria is a huge hall with huge tables. Big long lines that stretch over the entire hall, wich is really <br>
<br>
really big because it must be able to fit the entire crew of the station in there. It as large and wide <br>
<br>
passage-ways for the people of the station to get their supper by the desk... wich is, naturally, tremendous.<br>
<br>
When the people finish their meals, they go back to their dormitories and tide things up for inspection.<br>
If your room is ok, no points are deleted from your record.<br>
If your room is not tide enough, points are taken away from your record.<br>
The more points you have by a certain time, the sooner you will be relieved from battle duty.<br>
The more you lose, the longer it will take for that warrior to go back home.<br>
<br>
For Daitsuke and Hiroki this is, ofcourse, a different matter.<br>
Nobody will inspect their room, because it is tidy, whenever. And also because no record was ever taken <br>
<br>
from the two.<br>
Also, it would be pointless to check their room for that, or even deminish points from them, because they <br>
<br>
decided to stay until the very end. Never did they say the end of what exactly, but the most important to the <br>
<br>
generals and those other hotshots was at least 'till the end of the war.<br>
<br>
Ofcourse, now that the war has ended, the leaders of the station fear for the worst.<br>
If they leave now, they will lose their greatest defense...<br>
<br>
The meals are finished, and everybody has rushed back to their dorms, to tidy things up before 8:00pm; <br>
<br>
inspection time.<br>
Usually, Daitsuke and Hiroki start to talk about what they've been through at that time, because they are left <br>
<br>
with nothing else to do but either that or train. Both of them don't really feel like training.<br>
The war had ended after all. Why bother?<br>
<br>
Daitsuke &quot;Hiroki.&quot;<br>
Hiroki &quot;What is it?&quot;<br>
Daitsuke &quot;...&quot;<br>
Hiroki &quot;...what?&quot;<br>
Daitsuke &quot;How come?&quot;<br>
Hiroki &quot;Heh, you're sure acting weird today... what's on your mind?&quot;<br>
<br>
Daitsuke is looking nervous.<br>
<br>
Daitsuke &quot;Well, I know this is one question you should never ask to a woman...&quot;<br>
Hiroki &quot;Eh?&quot;<br>
Daitsuke &quot;But how old are you?&quot;<br>
Hiroki pauses<br>
Daitsuke &quot;I'm really sorry if..&quot;<br>
Hiroki &quot;It's ok.&quot;<br>
Daitsuke &quot;It's just that, you can see me grow older, but... well...&quot;<br>
Daitsuke &quot;You just never seem to age!&quot;<br>
Hiroki &quot;..&quot;<br>
<br>
Hiroki looks worried.<br>
<br>
Daitsuke &quot;Hiroki?&quot;<br>
<br>
Hiroki now smiles back at Daitsuke<br>
<br>
Hiroki &quot;Beauty sleeps!&quot;<br>
Daitsuke &quot;Eh??&quot;<br>
Hiroki &quot;That's it! Beauty sleeps!&quot;<br>
<br>
Hiroki grabs a bag.<br>
<br>
Hiroki &quot;I'm heading for the showers, it's nice and quiet about this time. Are you coming?&quot;<br>
Daitsuke &quot;Err, right..be there in a minute.&quot;<br>
<br>
Hiroki takes off.<br>
<br>
-&quot;It's not beauty sleeps....she didn't even have time to take those, we've almost been constant battle...&quot;<br>
<br>
Daitsuke takes his bag he always takes when he's goin to the showers and takes off as well.<br>
Once he arrived at the showers, going to the lockers etc etc, you know the deal there.<br>
<br>
Daitsuke and Hiroki have a way of communicating with eachother, through embedded deviced inside their <br>
<br>
heads.<br>
These devices can ofcourse never be renmoved, because it could also cause irreperable damage.<br>
<br>
=Daitsuke= &quot;Hiroki...&quot;<br>
=Hiroki= &quot;What?&quot;<br>
=Daitsuke= &quot;You're not telling me everything....&quot;<br>
=Hiroki= &quot;What are you talking about?&quot;<br>
=Daitsuke= &quot;You know very well what I'm talking about... Your age... why don't you age?&quot;<br>
=Hiroki= &quot;Long story.&quot;<br>
=Daitsuke= &quot;I've got time.&quot;<br>
=Hiroki= &quot;You'll probably hunt me down until I tell you, right?&quot;<br>
=Daitsuke= &quot;You bet!&quot;<br>
<br>
A silent pause passes by; this is a very hard thing for Hiroki to say.<br>
Hiroki never tells anything personal to anyone but Daitsuke.<br>
<br>
Hiroki &quot;Here we go... Switch over to silent-mode.&quot;<br>
=Daitsuke= *chack*<br>
Hiroki *sigh* *Chack*<br>
[Hiroki] When we started to do battle together, you thought I was in there, a rookie just like you...<br>
Truth is, I wasn't. I've ben training for several years before we even met.<br>
I am also a lot older than you are, but I don't know exactly how old.<br>
[Daitsuke] How come?<br>
[Hiroki] Let me finish.<br>
I am an experiment, conducted by a professor named Kaneda Taito.<br>
An experiment that no other dared to cinduct, even for years after.<br>
It was done in the gene-labs of Renox Industries Inc.<br>
That is where i I first found my existance.<br>
<br>
[Daitsuke] What are you trying to tell me?<br>
[Hiroki] I am not a human like you...<br>
[Daitsuke] ?<br>
[Hiroki] ...<br>
[Daitsuke] ...Well.....What are you then?<br>
[Hiroki] I am, in fact, an android.<br>
[Daitsuke] ..ah.....so that explains it...<br>
[Hiroki] Please keep this a secret between you and me, it might change my relation between all the others.<br>
[Daitsuke] Your secret is safe with me; I won't tell a soul.<br>
[Hiroki] It also ecplains the incident we were in last month.<br>
[Daitsuke] What do you mean?<br>
[Hiroki] A normal human being could never have cruised through that area in Dessiline 04.<br>
The place was flooded with nuclear material, but because I was built to do battle in nuclear wars,<br>
I was able to resist that much radiation.<br>
<br>
Some other people start to enter the baths as well.<br>
[Daitsuke] Well talk later.<br>
[Hiroki] Thanks<br>
[Daitsuke] ?<br>
[Hiroki] You've helped me out, I'll explain later. Thanks.<br>
<br>
*Clack*<br>
<br>
&quot;Daitsuke!&quot;<br>
Daitsuke &quot;Eh?&quot;<br>
&quot;Daitsuke! How many did you do?!&quot;<br>
Daitsuke &quot;You mean you actually counted those? Lets see...&quot;<br>
&quot;What? You mean you don't?&quot;<br>
Daitsuke &quot;I don't really think it's that important. I'd say about 11,234,723,643,058.&quot;<br>
&quot;Heh, did you count anyways?&quot;<br>
Daitsuke &quot;Nah, my computer counts how many rounds I've fired...&quot;<br>
&quot;You mean you blow them up with one shell?&quot;<br>
Daitsuke &quot;Don't you?&quot;<br>
&quot;...&quot;<br>
<br>
Everybody starts showering, and another day comes to an end.<br>
Back at the dorms, Daitsuke and Hiroki both sit down on their beds, and start unpacking their stuff.<br>
The main light has been shut down by the station's server. Only a desklight is on.<br>
The students usually keep that light on for their reports.<br>
Everybody has it on now, because they have to finish their report on the last day of the war.<br>
Daitsuke and Hiroki however, never finish their reports.<br>
Daitsuke, because his reports always come in too short; and because he loses count over the enemies <br>
<br>
eliminated.<br>
He got free of writing those reports.<br>
Hiroki, somehow always gets them in the computer all the time, and i think we all know how she does that <br>
<br>
by now, don't we?<br>
<br>
These two usually take this time to talk with eachother.<br>
They sure talk a lot, huh? Yeah, well. They're pretty close. In some way.<br>
Both lying in bed, just watching the ceiling, talking.<br>
<br>
Hiroki &quot;So...&quot;<br>
Daitsuke &quot;Hm?&quot;<br>
Hiroki &quot;Does this change anything between us?&quot;<br>
Daitsuke &quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br>
Hiroki &quot;Will we still be the friends we've always been?&quot;<br>
Daitsuke &quot;What are you talking about?! Ofcourse we will! Why would it change?!&quot;<br>
Hiroki &quot;Thank you. I appreciate it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Daitsuke &quot;So... how many did you manage to get down?&quot;<br>
Hiroki &quot;I don't know. That is, I do know, but I prefer to keep those secrets, until the reports are published.&quot;<br>
Daitsuke &quot;Why is that?&quot;<br>
Hiroki &quot;Hehe... People might get envious! ^^&quot;<br>
Daitsuke &quot;*laughs* Well, don't worry about me! First off, I'm keeping a bigger secret for you than just <br>
<br>
shot-counts, second of that, I'm probably as good as you are, so there's no real need for me to be envious.&quot;<br>
Hiroki &quot;...&quot;<br>
Daitsuke &quot;Sorry.&quot;<br>
Hiroki &quot;It's not that... I was just..never mind&quot;<br>
Daitsuke &quot;Life must be difficult for you. Well don't worry, you know you can tell me anything.&quot;<br>
Hiroki &quot;Ah, heck with it; I was checking my files for todays counts.&quot;<br>
Daitsuke &quot;I got 11,234,723,643,058. You?&quot;<br>
Hiroki &quot;12,634,756,587,641&quot;<br>
Daitsuke &quot;Heh, I guess you are a better shot than I am.&quot;<br>
Hiroki &quot;*giggles* You don't worry about that!&quot;<br>
Daitsuke &quot;Nah, I don't.&quot;<br>
<br>
=blip=<br>
<br>
Daitsuke &quot;Eh?&quot;<br>
Hiroki &quot;Heh, 10:00PM Whaddaya say we hit the sack?&quot;<br>
Daitsuke &quot;Wich one? The one in the TF or the one we're lying in?<br>
Hiroki &quot;.....actually, both are a good idea.&quot;<br>
Daitsuke &quot;Could we get in trouble?&quot;<br>
Hiroki &quot;Haha! Us?&quot;<br>
Daitsuke &quot;Wow.... You're more evil than i thought you were.&quot;<br>
Hiroki &quot;.....I suppose....&quot;<br>
Daitsuke &quot;Let's go!&quot;<br>
Hiroki &quot;Right!&quot;<br>
<br>
Both are now running through the hallways to get to the training facility.<br>
Daitsuke &quot;-Stop-&quot;<br>
Hiroki &quot;-What?-&quot;<br>
Daitsuke &quot;I forgot all about the cameras; we'll be sure to get caught this way!-&quot;<br>
Hiroki &quot;...&quot;<br>
Daitsuke &quot;-Is there anything you can do about it?-&quot;<br>
Hiroki &quot;-But I made a promise...-&quot;<br>
Daitsuke &quot;-Hey, this is no serious offense here, the war has been faught; it's over!-&quot;<br>
Hiroki &quot;- ...... true ...&quot;<br>
<br>
Her eyes turn static, like a blind man, she just stared in frint of her.<br>
If you don't look at it, you'll probably not even notice the slight highlights in beautiful colors in her eyes.<br>
<br>
(radio frequency sound) *shwufffffizzzz...* *blip*<br>
<br>
Hiroki &quot;We should be home free now.&quot;<br>
<br>
They continue their running.<br>
<br>
Daitsuke &quot;Hey, what did you do back there then?&quot;<br>
Hiroki &quot;I just sent out a distortion-frequency. The audio/video system will be jammed for 2 hours.<br>
That is the safety block for when the enemy might come to the station; it can't be harmed by the enemy and <br>
<br>
further this way. We should still be haveing an open eye to everything though.&quot;<br>
<br>
As she said this she had a very serious look on her face.<br>
Hiroki thinks by himself that that look on her face always gave him the creeps. Now he knows why.<br>
That serious look resembled the one she always had before battle. The one at the briefing.<br>
It's as if she always stores the information given to her in some way; although I would never have come up <br>
<br>
with that explanation before he knew she was an android.<br>
<br>
Hiroki &quot;We're almost there.&quot;<br>
Daitsuke &quot;We made it!&quot;<br>
<br>
Hiroki stops and jumps to the side, flat against the wall.<br>
<br>
Hiroki &quot;Hide!&quot;<br>
<br>
Daitsuke stands astounded in the hallway and jumps into the same direction as Hiroki.<br>
Guards pass by, on their way for inspection on the audio/video system that has been jammed.<br>
<br>
Hiroki &quot;...&quot; <br>
Daitsuke &quot;...&quot;<br>
<br>
=Daitsuke= &quot;That was close.&quot;<br>
=Hiroki= &quot;Yes&quot;<br>
<br>
*tapp tapp tapp tapp tapp*<br>
<br>
=Hiroki= “We’re here”<br>
=Daitsuke= “Now, how do we get in? Like, the lock’s been set…”<br>
=Hiroki= “I thought you had that all-access card?”<br>
=Daitsuke= “….how do you know about that?”<br>
=Hiroki= “Hah, that’s easy. You talk in your sleep.”<br>
=Datsuke= “Ehh… forget it… Let’s see…”<br>
<br>
Daitsuke is checking his bag for the keycard.<br>
Daitsuke “Ah, found it.”<br>
He pulls out a shiny piece of a glass-like substance.<br>
<br>
Next to the door Is a panel, just like the one in the dorms of Hiroki and Daitsuke.<br>
Only difference between the two is the fact that this one needs a card to gain access, and the one in the dorms just uses a fingerprint scan.<br>
<br>
(*blip* *ziff* (the door opened)<br>
<br>
Daitsuke smiles “Piece of cake!”<br>
They walk through that door, which leads to the hall, going straight towards the training room.<br>
<br>
Then, all of a sudden, the alarm goes off!<br>
With bells ringing and a sound screaming through the entire station, an officer declares that there is an intruder found in the Training Facility.<br>
<br>
Hiroki “What did you do with that card?!”<br>
Daitsuke “I don’t know! I just used it! Maybe there is also a time-lock?!”<br>
Hiroki “Aww, great!”<br>
<br>
A guard jumps in to the place where the both of them are standing.<br>
He holds a long gun, probably a rifle. It’s really hard to see what type of gun it is, because when the alarm went of, all the lights were shut down, and a blue glow is like a thick myst over the entire section of the station.<br>
<br>
Guard “What are you two doing here?!”<br>
<br>
=Hiroki= “Just play along”<br>
<br>
Hiroki “We’re here to check out TF for the intruder.”<br>
Guard “How is that possible?! The alarm went off a few seconds ago!”<br>
Hiroki “I noticed the intrusion a lot sooner than you people did, I just didn’t have enough time to check in with the commander.”<br>
Guard “Yeah, I’ll bet!”<br>
Daitsuke “Hey man! Lay off! You have no evidence whatsoever we are the intruders!”<br>
Hiroki “Besides, who do you think you’re talking to anyway! We’re the top!!”<br>
Daitsuke “Leave us be and we won’t report this. Send troops to help us search if you want to, although I don’t think they’ll be much of help…”<br>
Hiroki “Forget about reinforcement. They’ll just get in the way!”<br>
Daitsuke “Right. Now be off.”<br>
Guard “……..”<br>
<br>
The guard leaves and Hiroki and Daitsuke are left alone there.<br>
They both look worried and relieved at the same time, because what was it that they did to trigger the alarm?<br>
<br>
Daitsuke “Let’s investigate.”<br>
Hiroki “No need to.”<br>
Daitsuke “What are you talking about? We need to figure out what triggered the alarm!”<br>
Hiroki “No we don’t. I already figured that part out while you were sending away the guard.”<br>
Daitsuke “are you saying you already know what did it?”<br>
Hiroki “Not what, but more like who…”<br>
Daitsuke “Eh? Who are you talking about? Are you saying I did it?!”<br>
Hiroki “No. I’m talking about the being inside TF (Training Facility).”<br>
Daitsuke “Is somebody there?”<br>
Hiroki “I know there is something in there that lives. I’m not sure what it is.”<br>
Daitsuke “Huh?”<br>
<br>
Hiroki now looks at Daitsuke with that serious look on her face again.<br>
<br>
Hiroki “I’m saying that that being might not be humanoid.”<br>
Daitsuke “So we don’t really know how strong it is either, right?”<br>
Hiroki “…”<br>
<br>
Daitsuke sighs.<br>
Daitsuke “Well, we might as well get a move on.”<br>
<br>
With that said, Hiroki and Daitsuke both move into the musty training facility.<br>
It’s is something like a running course with a lot of wild creatures, obstacles and even airborne beasts can attack you while you’re staying there.<br>
<br>
But something is wrong now.<br>
There are no creatures around. This new creature must be very strong.<br>
The monsters and droids inside the facility aren’t the easiest ones to defeat, depending on wich route you take ofcourse (beginners, intermidiate, ace, sharpshooting)<br>
<br>
Hiroki “Switch to silent mode. I will head for sharpshooting, you head for beginners.”<br>
Daitsuke “Why do I have to start at beginners?”<br>
Hiroki “You know very well I don’t care about statistics. If you want me to, I’ll head for beginners.”<br>
Daitsuke “Nah, never mind. No monsters around anyway…”<br>
<br>
*chack* *chack*<br>
<br>
=Hiroki= Move<br>
<br>
With both of them heading for a different directions, nobody really knows where the creature is, or what it looks like, how strong it is, or even if it’s humanoid or not.<br>
<br>
If it’s humanoid, its far easier to track, but also more dangerous for the two defenders of the station to shoot eachother.<br>
If it isn’t humanoid, it’s harder to track, but far little danger is at sake for the two to shoot eachother at that.<br>
<br>
Both of them have moved deep into the facility by now, and they are getting pretty nervous.<br>
Daitsuke accidently moves through an infra-red beam, triggering the time count mechanism.<br>
As the sounds of the trigger approaches, Daitsuke scared himself half to death.<br>
<br>
=Hiroki= Are you all right?!        <br>
=Daitsuke= Yes. That was the time mechanism…. Damn…<br>
=Hiroki= Move on then.<br>
=Daitsuke= Hehh? Oh… ok, right.<br>
=Hiroki= Well what did you expect me to do then?<br>
=Daitsuke= Well…<br>
=Hiroki= Hey, if you think I’m gonna come over there and give you a hug, you’re terribly wrong!!”<br>
=Daitsuke= Really?<br>
=Hiroki= You’re terrible.<br>
=Daitsuke= heheh…<br>
<br>
*shuffle shuffle*<br>
<br>
=Daitsuke= What was that?<br>
=Hiroki= I don’t know, it came from over there…<br>
=Daitsuke= Will you be ok?<br>
=Hiroki= Yeah, I think it wa*@#%$..tichhhh….**stich*<br>
=Daitsuke= What is it?! Hiroki! HIROKI!!!<br>
<br>
Daitsuke “@#%$!”<br>
<br>
As soon as he could, Daitsuke rushed over to the sharpshooting section.<br>
Running trough bushes, and gates and fences, he finally arrives at the spot where he finds only the earring he gave her as a birthday present.<br>
<br>
Daitsuke “It must have been ripped off of her ear. There’s blood all over the place.”<br>
<br>
He takes the earring, and puts it in one if his pockets, hoping it will be safe there.<br>
He stands up, and looks around for a bit.<br>
<br>
Daitsuke “@#%$. I should have been here sooner. I suppose I can’t be helping it now. Better follow the trail.”<br>
<br>
By that he meant the trail of blood left behind. That… ‘thing’ must have done a lot more than just rip off her earring. There’s too much blood around here for that little wound…<br>
Well, it’s not really all over the place. Maybe her hand is open or something.<br>
That’d probably sum it up.<br>
<br>
He follows the path that has been left behind by the creature. Or a superhuman?<br>
Can a human really do this much damage to a solid and massive structure like this?<br>
No real telling it.<br>
<br>
He goes deeper and deeper into the facility.<br>
The TF isn’t really a ‘place’ inside the ship; that is, it’s just for a few metres.<br>
After that, you start to enter a new dimension. Nah, not really a dimension.<br>
It’s more like a portal towards another world.<br>
Four similar worlds, wich all resemble our blue planet in some way.<br>
One with light-class creatures, one with mid-class, one with heavy-class and one with airborne.<br>
<br>
Hiroki and Daitsuke always train in the last one.<br>
‘Ace’.<br>
<br>
Sometimes alone, sometimes both. For the challenge.<br>
With two people it’s more challenging not to hit ground creatures, because you always have to beware for your partner. Shoot the partner, end of simulation, teleport back to sick-bay immediately.<br>
Ground rule. If you pass that rule, you will be suspended for a week, and 12 points will be taken away.<br>
If you come down below 1 point points will be added until they are at one.<br>
Then, when the time per point passed, one will be decreased again, until your debt has been fulfilled.<br>
<br>
Be sure you'll get your next episode<br>
stories grow like people do<br>
always unexpected<br>
you'll never know <br>
The next day.........<br>
