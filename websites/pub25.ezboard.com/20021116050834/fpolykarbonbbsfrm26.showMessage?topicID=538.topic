A little girl usually dreams of faeries and castles: Of kings and queens, and herself a princess. Of far away places, full of mystery and enchantment. The thought of those things being real always bring happiness to this child who knows nothing of the outside world. The worries and sometimes saddening responsibilities of being an adult are far away. Right now she only knows of the beautiful castles and faeries, and of the happy days that are envied by all. <br>
<br>
                                 Preface<br>
<br>
<br>
Hello. My name is Sarah Mattington. My mother died when I was 5 years old. It’s sad, yes. But truth be told, this story has another side: A side that I have kept to myself, until now. That spring, I met ‘someone’ in the park. Whether she was a faerie, a ghost, or simply a figment of my imagination, she was exactly what I needed at that time in my life: a friend.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
<br>
                     My friend, Mandalynn. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
<br>
Little Sarah watched with wide eyes as the caterpillar marched across the grass. “Your too slow, Mr. Caterpillar.” She announced. But as she was about to pluck the little insect from it’s steady trot, a faint voice caught her ear. “Hear my silent prayer, heed my quiet call…” what a pretty voice! She thought. Who is singing, and where is it coming from? Sarah walked towards the voice, with great care. “When the dark and blue surround you…” It seemed to be coming from the park’s stonewall barrier. But how could that be? Little Sarah wondered. Suddenly, she saw a part of the wall had been broken: A tiny space fit just for her. She squeezed through, without an inch to spare. She had never been on the other side of the wall before. She feared she might get in trouble, and turned to go back, “Step into my sigh, look inside the light… ” But the beautiful voice lulled her into giving chase once more. <br>
She found herself skipping down into a dark cave. The dense walls gave way to a large underground chamber. Drops of water clung to overhead stalagmites, then dripped down into little pools of watery light: creating an enchanting melody. “You will know that I have found you… ” Sarah gasped as she saw a tiny magenta figure perched on a rock looking down into one of the pools. The little orb stirred as Sarah made her presence known and took flight into the air. “Don’t be afraid, little one. I wont hurt you.” It said softly.<br>
“I’m not little. You are little!” Sarah announced.<br>
“Hee hee hee, so I am. What is your name?”<br>
“Sarah, what’s yours?”<br>
“I’m known as Mandalynn.”<br>
And what followed was a great time. Filled with playtime and laughter: A happiness only carefree children could know. Everyday Sarah came back to the park, and everyday they spent together. The other children whispered among themselves. “What is that silly Sarah doing, playing by herself?” they couldn’t seem to see Mandalynn, but Sarah didn’t care. As far as she was concerned her new friend was all that mattered.<br>
<br>
But one day, Sarah went to the park to look upon a horrible site. Construction workers where tearing down hers and Mandalynn’s special place. With worried tears in her eyes, little Sarah ran as fast as she could, and shoved past the workers, down to the cave that the adults couldn’t fit through. Upon the rock, laid the tiny purple-hued figure. “Mandalynn! Are you hurt?” Sarah cried, as she fell onto her knees next to her. “Oh…Sarah…I’m afraid…I must leave now.” The little girl began to protest, but Mandalynn silenced her. She raised her tiny hand towards Sarah, shaking the little girl touched her.<br>
Everything began to fade, and grow dark. She called Mandalynn’s name, and in response, the cave’s surroundings appeared again, but almost dreamy like. She turned, and gasped in wonder as she saw a human-sized Mandalynn! She was beautiful, and glowed like an angel. “I must go.” She whispered tiredly. Without thought, Sarah flung herself around the woman’s waist and cried. “Please don’t!”<br>
“The workers will come and destroy this place, but don’t destroy it in your heart, little one.”<br>
Mandalynn replied. Sarah didn’t understand, and kept crying. The youngster suddenly heard a familiar song, which somehow seemed to calm her down.<br>
“Hear my silent prayer, heed my quiet call…when the dark and blue surround you… Step into my sigh, look inside the light. You will know that I have found you… ”<br>
<br>
A slight intake of breath snapped Sarah out of the dream. She looked down to where Mandalynn was, but in her place, now laid a flower. Fresh dew encased its pedals, as it slouched sadly on the rock.<br>
Sarah emerged from the cave, carrying the delicate flora like a newborn. She dug a small hole in the field beside the stonewall, and gently laid the flower to rest. With a whispered goodbye, Little Sarah left the park: never to return in her youth again.<br>

The beginning was especially nice, giving things almost a whimsy,dreamy feel. There isn't really much to work on, but you need to seperate paragraphs a bit more. Such as when a person finished talking and another begins, you should seperate the two so the story looks a bit more formatted, and a little less blockish. <br>
<br>
This story really reminded me of my childhood. I have to say, I really loved this story, great job! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/unaveenfoxthorn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>NaveenFoxthorn</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_star.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(3/2/02 6:14:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=538.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://smoothimages.homestead.com/files/gsc2AV.jpg height=85 width=120></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: quick little storybook story that my mom hates!</span><hr size=1> oh wow, thanks! personally, i think the ending needs work, and yeah i kinda forgot to do the whole proper grammar thing.
