After nearly a year of little or no sleep he finally heeds his waking dreams will and goes on a quest that has been compelling him for far to long.  He does not no why, but, he is drawn to the North, always, to the North.  Vedas fancies him self as a free-lance swordsman with quit a cultured background.  His sword skills come from the far East, his dexterity and strength from the Dwarven catacombs, and his intelligence and wits from the Western Druodou {Druidic Wood Elves}.<br>
<br>
    Garret is an ambitious Northern Wood Elf that is quick to act and slow to reason.  He is a Detachment Officer of his hometown, Palimorai.  Normally an elf of his type would be shunned, but his talent as a marksmen and bold attitude has become an asset to his people and protecting them from an every encroaching dangerous world.<br>
<br>
    Dark mage is a mysterious character that lives high up Termais Mountain.  The people of Termais fear this magician of the black arts but also praise him.  Termais has seen many hardships in its time and always it has made it through with thanks going to what could be called a “miracle from the dark”.  Little is known about the Dark Mage because he rarely leaves his small hut, with the rare exception of when he is collecting Jaba Fruit from a near by Jobo plant.<br>
<br>
    Marxist Cain is the General of the Mew-Mew Kento “Blood” Army {Army of the Kings}.  He has become to be known as the “Gentle Killer of the Damned”.  Marxist is known for his tenacious and some times heartless attitude towards getting what his Emperor Shank wants.  Marxist is sent to Termais to gather the “Dark Master”<br>
<br>
    Termais is a small village of humble farmers.  Termais lives at the foot of a large and looming mountain, that when it was built, it was a great and prosperous village.  But, after many generations the village has used its soil and quick to shrink.  But, the people of Termais are strong and, “We will make do, we have made it this far and we will make it further.  We just need to walk our father’s foot steps and continue walking tell we reach prosperity.”  Termais kept its quiet demeanor until the Emperor Shank’s Mew-Mew Kento army came searching for a Dark Master.<br>
<br>
<br>
    Vedas, after a year of unsettled rest, sets out on a quest to squelch the persistent nightmares he has been having.  His travel through Don-Dor Kingdoms was relatively quiet and uneventful.  After the “Great Extinction” there are few pearls to meet a man in Don-Dor Kingdom.  While traveling through the North Woods he was attacked on two occasions.  Once by a Mauler Wolf.  And, the second time ambushed by a hotheaded Elf.<br>
<br>
    Five days after Vedas and Garret’s encounter the village of Termais came under attack by the Mew-Mew Kento Army.  Their leader, Marxist, has laid siege to the village after torturing its people for the information of the where about of its mountain hermit.  Marxist would had eventually left if it were not for Pesh, a boy who spoke up when his baby brother was attacked by Marxist.  When Termais began to burn, Garret of Palimorai, rushed with trusted men to save their “quiet abode atop the mountain face”.<br>
<br>
    In the unseeing chaos that lights the night sky and fills the dark air with the lingering smell of death a clash of skills rages.  Garret and his men encounter a detachment of the Mew-Mew Kento Army from the east a mile from Termais that resulted in one death on Garret’s side and the death of all on the Mew-Mew Kento Army side.  Vedas encounters his own detachment that greatly outnumbered him within sights view of Termais.  This is when he demonstrates his limited magical skills in order to survive the encounter.  Afterwards he chooses to circle around to enter the village from another point.  Near the village gates Vedas meets up with Garret for a second time where they draw swords together under the same agenda.<br>
<br>
    Marxist and a small group of trusted men travel northward to the hermits hut.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

The hut is submerged into the mountainside hiding its true size, though; outwardly the hut’s appearance is very small.)<br>
<br>
Marxist:  Mage!<br>
<br>
(No reply -)<br>
<br>
Marxist:  Mage! I know you are in there.<br>
<br>
(Still no reply.  Marxist turns to his two escorts and motions for them to burn the hut.<br>
<br>
Slowly they approach nervous at first.  One takes the lead and laces what could be called the roof of the hut with flame from his torch.  The second soon follows suit and the hut is bright with fire.<br>
<br>
As quickly as the fire began, consuming and scorching, it disappears.  The flame leave not as if blown out, but burnt out, as if its food supply of wood was gone.  Though, clearly the hut still stands.<br>
<br>
The guards look at each other then back to their commanding officer.  With a cold stare Marxist waves his hand.  The knights approach the hut again and light it on fire.  Again as the flames burn themselves out the hut does not go with.)<br>
<br>
Marxist:  (In a monotone voice) Enter and capture the mage.<br>
<br>
(The knights again trade glances and then draw swords.  One knight approaches the door and tries to peer in between the wood slates that make the hut’s door to see if he can view anything.  The knight then backs up and delivers one hard kick the old worn door.<br>
<br>
The knight tumbles back as he looses his balance and the door does not give way.  The other knight approaches the door and inspects it himself.  Then he places his blade between the rusty lock and the cave wall.  With all his body he twists his blade and with it the lock at its hinges.<br>
<br>
The knight’s sword snaps in half but the rusty lock stays firm in its place.<br>
<br>
Both knights trade glances back and forth somewhat bewildered.<br>
<br>
Marxist finally steps forward and places his hand on the door for a moment almost caressing it-)<br>
<br>
Marxist:  It’s a Seal.<br>
<br>
(Marxist reaches behind his cloak and unlatches a small pouch from his thick white hide belt.)<br>
<br>
Marxist:  I had hoped not to use this so soon.<br>
<br>
(Marxist motions for his men to move back.  Once they do so he clutches the pouch tightly in his hand and places it to the door.  With a flash and a blinding light the pouch bursts into smoke.<br>
<br>
Slowly, Marxist lowers his hand to the handle and pulls.  Giving roughly the door slides open.  As soon as the door opens a creek Marxist steps back.<br>
<br>
Turning about -)<br>
<br>
Marxist:  All right, move in –<br>
<br>
(The sight of his men laying on the ground unconscious interrupts Marxist.<br>
<br>
Standing still and stalwart while looking about -)<br>
<br>
Marxist:  Reveal you self!<br>
<br>
(Marxist is frozen as a cold touch sends shards of pain throughout his body.  The hand rests nicely on his left shoulder.  The body behind him moves from his left shoulder to his right as he does so trading his touch.  The wind begins to whip about and the air becomes alive with horrible shrills that sting the ear.)<br>
<br>
Marxist:  Black Mage!?<br>
<br>
(The being turns to the front of Marxist revealing itself.  The creature is at least six inches taller then him which is quit a feet considering that Marxist himself is five nine.  The creature is covered from head to two in a heavy waving black cloak that whips about freely disturbing its surroundings.  That is all.  A very tall creature shrouded by a large and heavy cloak hiding most if not all details about itself.)<br>
<br>
Marxist:  You will kill me as you killed my men?<br>
<br>
(The mage replies in a shriek -)<br>
<br>
Mage:  Your men are not dead, not yet.  I can however rearrange that for them and you if you do not leave, promptly.<br>
<br>
Marxist:  I have been sent by your lord and Emperor Shanks to take you to him.  I will not leave until then.<br>
<br>
Mage:  I have no lord.<br>
<br>
(With these words the dark figure waves his hand in a high crest over his body and with it Marxist’s body soars through the air.  Tumbling and turning Marxist rights himself on his feet and draws his sword facing the living cloth of a mage.)<br>
<br>
Marxist:  Black Mage of Termais, I will take you by force if I must!<br>
<br>
Mage:  I’m more of an *Arcainist then anything else.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
