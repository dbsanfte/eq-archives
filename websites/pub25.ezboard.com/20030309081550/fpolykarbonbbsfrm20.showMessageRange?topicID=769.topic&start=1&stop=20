NarShadaa:<br>
The ungoverned &quot;smugglers' moon&quot; orbiting Nal Hutta, Nar Shaddaa is completely covered by interlocking spaceport facilities and miles-high docking towers reaching to orbit. The moon's all-covering &quot;vertical city&quot; was built over thousands of years, and is protected by often-malfunctioning planetary shields. Though it was once a glorious world of bustling, legitimate trade, Nar Shaddaa quickly lost prestige as the hyperspace trade lanes shifted away. Now quite distant from most galactic commercial centers, Nar Shaddaa is typically allowed to run its own affairs with little Imperial interference. Famous as the birthplace of Jabba the Hutt, Nar Shaddaa is controlled by Hutts and assorted &quot;smuggling guilds&quot; who control various sections of the moon. It is now widely regarded as the center of smuggling operations in the known galaxy, and the pollution, decay, and lawlessness associated with smuggling traffic run rampant on the moon. Sections of Nar Shaddaa's maze-like city include the Duros sector and the Corellian sector, which contains three bars popular with bounty hunters-- the Burning Deck, the Slag Pit, and the Meltdown Cafe, and another corner tavern called the Orange Lady. Most of the moon's 72 to 95 billion inhabitants live in the highest levels of the spaceport-cities. Nar Shaddaa was originally given to the displaced Evocii as a new homeworld, after the Hutts forced the species from Nal Hutta. The Hutts continued to exploit the Evocii in their new home, buying up their land and using them as a cheap labor source. Now their forgotten, inbred descendants can be found inhabiting the lowest levels of the vertical city. Han Solo and Lando Calrissian both used to frequent Nar Shaddaa during their early smuggling days, and still have associates living there. Before their service to Captain Antilles, C-3PO and R2-D2 traveled to Nar Shaddaa in an attempt to apprehend the criminal Olag Greck. The bounty hunter Greedo and his family lived in the moon's Corellian sector for several years, until an Imperial attack on a Rebel hideout resulted in massive destruction and the collapse of nearly twenty sector levels. Following the Battle of Yavin, Alliance agent Kyle Katarn avoided bounty hunters on Nar Shaddaa in order to find Imperial navigational charts related to the Dark Trooper project. Six years after the Battle of Endor, Leia and Han Solo, searching for Vima-Da-Boda in Nar Shaddaa's lowest levels, were attacked by man-eating vrblthers and the bounty hunter Boba Fett<br>

<br>
and a little on Nal Hutta...since we might visit there<br>
Nal Hutta <br>
A bruised green, blue, and brown planet in the Y'Toub system, Nal Hutta (meaning &quot;glorious jewel&quot; in Huttese) is one of the primary planets settled by the Hutts after leaving their ancestral home of Varl. The planet's immense size is compensated by its extremely low density, giving it a tolerable gravity. Nal Hutta was once a pleasant world of mountainous rain forests. Since their arrival, however, the Hutts have transformed it into a gloomy planet of stinking bogs, stagnant, scum-covered puddles, and patches of sickly marsh grass inhabited by insects and spiders. The planet's flocks of large, clumsy birds are shot down by swoop-riding hunters. The atmosphere is polluted by strip-mining operations in the Nal Hutta's industrial centers, and a greasy rain drizzles down on the world's destitute inhabitants living in their squatters' villages and ghettos. Entertainment centers located near the Nal Hutta spaceport stand on stilts in the planet's swampy ground. The white palace of Durga the Hutt lies across from the spaceport, and features a swamp- water bathhouse and an infamous network of dungeons. Nal Hutta and its moon, Nar Shaddaa, are located in the center of &quot;Hutt Space&quot; and receive a constant traffic of freight haulers, smugglers, and other galactic traders. Raw materials are continually strip-mined from Nal Hutta's surface and shipped to the Nar Shaddaa moon for processing and transport. The planet is ruled by a council of the eldest members of the &quot;Clans of the Ancients,&quot; the oldest Hutt families. The world's pop ulation consists of nearly seven billion inhabitants, three billion of them Hutts. Many years ago, the planet was known as Evocar and was the homeworld of the primitive Evocii. When the Hutts arrived, they traded technology to the Evocii in exchange for land-- eventually buying up the planet and forcing the Evocii from their homeworld. The Old Republic relocated the displaced Evocii to the Nar Shaddaa moon, but they fared no better there. Once the Hutts controlled the entire planet, they replaced all Evocii structures with Hutt palaces and shrines and renamed the world Nal Hutta. The planet's nearness to busy hyperspace lanes made it a popular trade world at the time, though the trade lanes have long since shifted. In recent history, Nal Hutta and its moon have become a haven for smugglers, pirates, and criminals. A massive, radioactive gas cloud, containing the hidden planet Ganath, lies very close to Nal Hutta<br>
