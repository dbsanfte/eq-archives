I meant my comment mostly in humor.  I'm like to quote myself:  &quot;Getting the crap beat out of you does not sound like a good answer to the problem.&quot;  Yeah, if you can win you're all set; but most people being picked on would probably loose because of strength or numbers of the bullies.  Not everybody has the power to make those guys wish they didn't mess with them.  And there's the punishment for fighting.  If you fight at my school they call the police and haul you off, no matter if you were defending yourself.  Of course, that's if your not in the hospital with a knife wound or something.   <br>
<br>
Instead, I would try finding a place to go during the off time.  My art teacher used to let me hang out and work on stuff in her class during my lunch.  As long as your quiet and offer to help out every once in a while I've found that a lot of teachers don't mind having an extra kid around.<br>
<br>
I had lots of problems when I was in middle school.  I got this boy in trouble for harassing me, and about 15 of his girlfriends decided they would like to kick my ass ^^;;  I just tried to lay low though and stay where there was a teacher around  because there was no way in hell I could win a fight.<br>

It must be nice having all those free periods (I don't have any this semester!) and instead of drawing all the time, maybe take one of them a day and do something different. If you're at a relatively large school, you're probably not the only person who likes to draw, or that feels the same way. It might be a good idea to try and find some of these people and get to know them better. That way, if anyone tries to give you any crap, you've got people to back you up that can empathize. I'm pretty lucky- my school is pretty small, with about 100-120 students per grade, and even though I'm not really &quot;Popular&quot; I've kind of established myself with just about everyone. I know it sounds a lot easier said than done, but get to know your classmates that don't pick on you. During class is a good time, because the fact that you're in there together gives you something to talk about. I've carried on many a conversation with everybody from the cheerleaders to the hermits to the goths  about just about everything that way. <br>
I hope that helps. I haven't had people draw on my work (becuse it's always been better than theirs), but I have been given grief for a bunch of other stuff. You don't have to fight back. Just stand up for yourself, be assertive, and they'll see that you're a lot stronger than they are. People like that aren't much fun to pick on. By the way, where are you from? <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://blahlaland.blogspot.com">uh oh... time to squawk twelve-hundred..</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zodawg0079>zodawg0079</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(12/2/02 12:47:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11541.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://ftp.sunet.se/pub/pictures/comics/Marvel/Punisher/punlogo.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: i feel like such a loser sometimes</span><hr size=1> sometimes fighting isn't the problem....it's the solution <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>A lone shogun wandered on to a battlefield....he met a guild of assassins whose skill was unrivaled and he sought the highest level of artistic expression.

<br>
Generally, most people are at least halfways decent. Yes, there are the few roving idiots that are like the very bad apples in an otherwise good barrel, but let's not think on that for the moment.<br>
<br>
I find that when dealing with those who find your interests a bit &quot;strange&quot; will just ignore you afterwards after you answer any question of theirs (sarcastic or not) in a deadpan, matter-of-fact way. Most are sensible enough to get a hint that you won't change your interests for their sake of aesthetics.<br>
<br>
However, when dealing with the more persistant (as in, those who are maliciously-inclined, rather than truly curious), it's best not to drop your voice or get all irritated. As much as it sounds elitist, treat them as you would a small, impudent child. By keeping your tone level when speaking to them, they're less likely to persist. If you get irritated or intimidated, they'll go after you like vultures to carrion.<br>
<br>
In addition, use tact. Simple as that. By going around things with your words, try not to offend or provoke them (like saying &quot;I think rap is @#%$&quot; or something to that) while stating your opinion. It's better they find you boring than have them think it's a lark to harass you.<br>
<br>
As for name calling...well, you can't help that. You can't please everyone, so might as well just keep to yourself and ignore them. Whatever degrading thing they call you, don't snap back another insult, further instigating the problem. Just get confidence from the fact that you <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>know</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> that whatever they're calling you is not true.<br>
<br>
But if they're insulting your circumstances in life (parents, for example), a good, simple rebuttal will work (staying away from insulting them outright, of course). &quot;Clear&quot; implications work better than something obvious, since it causes a gnawing discomfort at the receiver (unless they're dumb as bricks), giving you time to go off on your own merry way.<br>
<br>
Physical harassment calls for self-defence if your school/police/whatever is completely useless and twattish. I second that staying out of a fight is best (less time in the hospital means less embarassment), but if things are really out of hand and no one is being helpful whatsoever, learn to defend yourself. If you do, don't go into a fit of rage and have a brawlfest. One of the first lessons in effective self-defence is having a much cooler head than the opponent.<br>
<br>
Random note: Girlfights are dirtier than the fights boys have. Hair pulling, scratching, etc. The shrieks are absolutely jarring sometimes.<br>
