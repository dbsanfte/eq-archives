With a lot of pseudo-manga these days, from Vampi(sic) to Jade(sic) to Darkminds(um, so-so) as well as almost every comic trying to copy the aesthetics (did I spell that right?) of manganime, who knows how long this last.<br>

<br>
Obviously, the popularity of manga and anime in the US plays a large part in so many of these being made, but there were other artists incorporating elements of anime and manga into their style before it really became as popular as it is. For example, almost a decade ago, people like Joe Madureira, Scott Campbell (to a lesser extent), and several others were also using elements of the style in their own artwork. <br>
<br>
I'm sure the number of comics and artists emulating anime/manga will decrease as it's popularity does also, but I'm sure it will still be present in many artists' styles.  <p><table width=100% border=0>

If you can do something to your product to increase its popularity, it would be idotic not to do it.<br>
<br>
though, im sure that ALOT of artist just prefer the manga style.<br>
<br>
 for decades American comics have all followed a similiar trend. those super detailed characters, with those super detailed environments, I have no idea why they do this... but thats the trend.<br>
<br>
When you compare American trends to Japanese trends youll notice a distinct difference. Japanese artists prefer to keep there characters less detailed, and there Backgrounds moderatly detailed.<br>
<br>
using this style is much more effecient with the art of story telling. <br>
(if you dont know what im talking about I suguest you pick up a book titled &quot;Understanding Comics by Scott McCloud&quot; from your local book store)<br>
<br>
It creates a symbolic relation between the reader, and the characters in the story. it has ALOT to do with the human mind, and its weird way of interpreting things.<br>
<br>
for example, if you have a manga handy, open it up. glance through a few pages and examine the characters.<br>
<br>
youll notice the characters who are suposed to be &quot;the good guys&quot; are done with a simple, and apealing design, however &quot;the bad guys&quot; are drawn with more detail, and emotion. this is to create an unrelation to specific characters, so you can hate them easier. <br>
<br>
<br>
uhhh.. wow, I just started rantng.. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
anyhow, with that in mind, I think its obvious why people lean twards a japanese style. Its much better suited for story telling than our Americanized style. perhaps some people fail to realise WHY they like japanese over american, but Id be willing to bet that this is one of the largest factors.<br>

i dont know if you are aware that in an anime, there are 10(am guessing here, am i about right) frames at least per second, which means for the simple motion of waving a hand that lasts five seconds, a character might have to be drawn 50 times (if you dont reuuse cels), how long does it take you to draw your character perfectly 50 times in a way that the animation is smooth<br>
dont point out erroers in theses facts or whatever, im just saying dont call anime lacking in detail... infact, there are 3 levels of shading and lots of detail in hair in folds, while in american cartoons there is usually 1 level of shading, mostly skin tight clothes, and not much detail<br>
<br>
manga and comics is a different story... but dont generalize, some manga is exceptionally well drawn, while some is very lacking in detail <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ualucard1515.showPublicProfile?language=EN>alucard1515</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator <img src=http://contest.polykarbon.com/badge1.gif></span><br> <font color=#336699>(12/13/01 6:13:31 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.undeadart.com/forum/alucard.gif width=100 height=94></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: re:</span><hr size=1> Actually, he was talking about both as far as I can tell. Anyone who does animation reduces the level of detail, whether it be American, Japanese, whatever, so that has nothing to do with the differences between anime and any other form of animation. And the levels of shading differ from animation to animation. Some Japanese animation only uses 2 levels, and some American animation uses 3. And uh... &quot;mostly skin tight clothes&quot; What are you talking about? I don't know what animation you've been watching, but aside from superhero type shows, I don't see too many people going around in skin tight clothes. And while superheroes may predominate American comics, they certainly do not in animation. <p><table width=100% border=0>

<br>
I'm not sure if I'm understanding some this right or not ... <br>
<br>
but as far as character detailing and backgrounds ... I have a few scans from Blade of the Immortal and they look anything but simplified.  And I could easily rant off a huge list of American comics that have NOT been detailed in background or character.  You are narrowly focusing on ONE genre of American comics and ONE genre and Japanese manga (yeah yeah ... animation for both too).  <br>
<br>
Spending a bit of time just browsing at the areas biggest comic book store I can assure you that there is a mix of high detail, low detail, and almost no detail on both sides.  <br>

I do make the distinction between the two.  It's like cheese to me ... I'm not just eating cheddar ... I'm eating mild cheddar ... not sharp ... not extra sharp ... but mild.<br>

It is all just cartoons/anime and mangas/comics ... but they do come from different places.  While cartoons and comics typically have American or European settings and deal with corresponding themes ... anime and mangas typically have an asian setting and deal with asian themes and seems to me there's a lot more historical stories in anime and mangas then there is in cartoons and comics.

eventhough I came from Asia, grew up reading, knowing and influenced by nothing but Japanese comics untill not too many years ago, I really hate the word &quot;manga&quot; being used. Strictly speaking from an artist point of view, by distinguish ourselves with terms like manga artist or anime artist in US basicly denied ourself as part of mainstream. Comics are comics, it annoys me to no end that general public as well as within artists community want to separate comics and so-called manga.  <p><center><i>"Talent is worthless without hard work."</i><br>

I was making a point.  You don't want people to make the distinction but sometimes there is a call to make the distinction.<br>
<br>
And it's not a matter of trying to justify people making distinctions ... but if in Japan they are calling their comics mangas and their animations anime ... then it can't be necessarily be wrong to make the distinction when talking about the differences between that which is made in North America and that which is made in Asia.  <br>
<br>
I can see where it is sometimes wrong to make the distinction ... like when people are limiting themselves or boxing themselves in ... but in general to make the distinction is not necessarily wrong. <p><br><br><p align=center><a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/uanyte.showPublicProfile?language=EN"><font color=red><b><i>Read my profile </b></a><font size=1>and find out what kind of top secret stuff I've been up to.

<br>
The cultural gap is certainly getting thinner, if comics can't be comics and animations can't be animations, anyone in North America with Japanese influence artworks will be look upon as none-mainstream, or as second class. <br>
<br>
What I am saying most likely doesn't make much difference for people who isn't seriously considering comic or animation as profession. I simply hope Japanese influenced artists being treated as equal in North America.<br>

I am done with my ranting now. now back to your regular schedule... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><center><i>"Talent is worthless without hard work."</i><br>

I don't have to have plans to join the industry to see that some people on both sides seem to generalize and assume that anyone on the other side is inferior.  It's pretty sad really.<br>
<br>
As for the labels, I really don't mind them since I have always thought of manga and anime to refer to something that was originally produced in Asia.  It doesn't have to be about the style or content at all.  I know that as time progresses, the distinctions between North American art styles and Asian art styles are getting more blurry, but that doesn't mean you can't make some generalizations or labels to help you categorize things.  <br>
<br>
The only time labels are bad is if they're being used to refer to something negatively.  If I said that all anime and manga are bad and then went around insulting people for doing it (as I'm sure we've all seen some people do) that would be wrong.  It would be just as wrong to go around insulting people for doing North American styled art and generalizing that as bad. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/umadzack.showPublicProfile?language=EN>madzack</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pre-Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(12/14/01 8:54:03 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Is manga and anime a fad in America? part deux</span><hr size=1> Here's another question:<br>
<br>
Is anime/manga INFLUENCE being exploited ad nauseum by the suits of the media industry in the west? Like in comics, for instance. Or videogames. Everybody in the west's trying to come up with  &quot;saucer-eyes&quot; in order to be hip.<br>
<br>
