<br>
the first of which i call Hrafnars fallen. This one would center around 4 characters, one a noble, one the nobles former slave who has giant ancestry, one a crazed berserker driven insane by a traumatic past and years of isolation<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> , and one an old warrior who is actually Odin in disguise<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :hat --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/pimp.gif ALT=":hat"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . The four characters would die within the first installment and be sent back to Midgard (earth) as einherjar (heroes that belong to Odin) by odin himself to stop a giantess from freeing Loki from his bonds and starting Ragnarok. The men who are dead would appear to the people of earth as undead. black/blue skinned men with red eyes. I could go into several stories beyond the first exploring the half-giants origins, the cause of the berserks madness, vengeance for the four of them, and even the discovery by the noble through some detective work and analysis that the old warrior is actually Odin.<br>
<br>
My next idea was an alternate timeline thing. What if the vikings were never defeated? What if they became the dominant culture and there Germanic religion grew to the size that Christianity is today? What would this world be like? i think id call it, &quot;CSE: Confederate States of Erikson&quot; i haven't really though about who to focus on in the world though<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ...<br>
<br>
Another idea i had was to bring mythology into the present by passing some ancient responsibiliuty onto the descendant of a ancient hero. Sent on a mission by the gods across the world and into the realms of the gods and giants to complete a task and prevent Ragnarok (the prevention/delay of Ragnarok was the primary concern and responsibility bestowed upon odin with his vast knowledge and foresight)<br>
<br>
Finally i thought... hey what about the giants?<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  how about taking the side of the giants for a change? why not center around a giant anti-hero who does whatever it takes to outsmart Thor, defeat Odin, crush humans, and free Loki the bringer of the Ragnarok.<br>
<br>

Crits first, if the warrior were Odin in disguise how would he die and then send himself back?  Also it is worth bearing in mind that if they look dead people will undoubtedly react badly to them and therefore you are missing out on a large chunk of human interaction which could of helped the plot.<br>
<br>
Despite these crits I really do love the idea, the giantess who tries to free Loki could be none other than his daughter Hel.  The alternate time-line is a good idea but the CSE makes it sound as if a mobile phone company runs the world, a better idea might be the Nordic alliance or some such.<br>

this comic should one day be made in a online format where you scroll down to veiw more, much like Scott McCloud's online comic, &quot;Zot!&quot;. Keep that in mind when you think... &quot;thats not enough for a page&quot; or &quot;whoa! thats way too much for a page!&quot;... the page breaks are more or less scene breaks or something.... anyway enough yammerin... <br>

<br>
Panel 3:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 3/4 shot of king on throne. He should look pretty solemn. Anger and sadness. frame should portray a far away frozen in time look to the frame, perhaps black and white, maybe brownish old time photograph?<br>

<br>
Panel 2:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp medium shot of Buri snorring<br>

&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He just roams around the forest, sleeping on the ground like a wild beast. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Fear is something no man should show, but when we fight together and I see his bererkergang state... <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp especially as deeply touched as that man is...<br>

HRAFNAR:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp ...Another fearsome man. Not in Magni's insane bloody way, but mysterious and morbid. Noone onboard knows anything about him. All I know is he scares me and thats enough. At times i swear he is in his own world or from another.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Panel 6:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp extreme close of Hrafnars eyes falling closed<br>
