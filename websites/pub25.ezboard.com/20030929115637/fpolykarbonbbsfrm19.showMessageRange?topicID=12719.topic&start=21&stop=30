For those that have been collecting Ghost in the Shell 2 the use of CGI is obvious. Even though the use of 3D elements in 2D comics have always looked &quot;wrong&quot; Shirow did it right for the first time. Man Machine Interface looks tremendously beautiful. The CG combined with 2D methods looks great for the first time (at least to my eyes) on a comic book. I think Shirow was smart not overdoing the CGI and leaving many pages with no CGI and in traditional manga style just to show the readers that he doesn't need CGI to make his panels awesome. Shirow evedently doesn't use CGI as a dependence or a need. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=1monkeypunch1>1MonkeyPunch1</A> at: 8/31/03 3:56 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dynamiteneon>DynamiteNeon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>TBA</span><br> <font color=#336699>(8/31/03 3:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12719.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.mangaden.com/pics/junk/b.jpg width=75 length=75></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: disney</span><hr size=1> I think it goes in cycles.  I agree with OtakuLad that 2d isn't going anywhere, it's just not popular right now because 3d is still relatively the new, cool thing.  There will always be a niche market for 2d games because there's some games that just work better that way.  I don't have a problem with that.  But, don't expect them to be publicized as much because there's still too many people that think pretty pictures and framerates are the only important thing in a game.<br>
<br>
For some companies there's obviously the cost issues also.  But, honestly, there's no reason why you can't create art in 2d on a computer and not have it look just as good as stuff you would do by hand.  It's just that most of the people that move to computer are doing it for the wrong reasons, so they usually skimp on the extra stuff.  Is there really a difference if a Disney artist did some key frames in an animation program and then let the computer do the in betweening?  If it's done right, I really don't think it's such a big deal.<br>
<br>
Of course, I'm not defending disney.  They've made some of the worst decisions I've ever seen since Eisner took over, but I'm just saying that it's theoretically possible to make good stuff for cheaper on computer.  The idea of moving to computer alone is not a bad thing.  Like you all have said, if the story sucks, it won't matter.  It's just really sad that they're firing all their good people and replacing them with management.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=alucard1515>alucard1515</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator <img src=http://contest.polykarbon.com/badge1.gif></span><br> <font color=#336699>(8/31/03 3:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12719.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.undeadart.com/forum/alucard.gif width=100 height=94></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: disney</span><hr size=1> Well, as far as games go, I don't agree. 2D is basically dead. There's a niche for it, and it's called the GBA. That's all anyone makes relatively big 2D games for now. This has been going on since the Playstation first came out, approaching 10 years now.<br>
<br>
I have no problem with doing animation on computers if it helps, but not if it significantly affects the quality of the work. Like you said, many of them use it as a shortcut, not to improve quality. <p><html>

<br>
But, then again, this may just be that Japan has alot of those style of games that we bring over occasionally, so maybe it's more accurate to say that AMERICA isn't as interested in 2d games anymore.   I also think you're not really talking about all 2d games.  I think you're more specifically interested in the side scrollers like castlevania, which usually just end up on the GBA.  There are plenty of 2d games on the other consoles (like puzzle games) if you look for them.<br>
<br>
You also keep saying the GBA like it's a bad thing.  There's a good reason that a majority of the 2d games show up on the GBA, and it's because it's almost overkill to put them on the other machines when the processor requirements are so low.  It's not like they couldn't port them all over to the other ones, they just don't because it's not worth the cost.  Isn't there also an addon for the gamecube to let you play GBA games on the TV or something?<br>

Never heard of it. I realize there are some 2D games coming out, I'm talking about high profile games. And I'm not just talking about side scrollers either. Those are great, but I also mean the old style adventure games (LucasArts, etc), and RPGs.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>You also keep saying the GBA like it's a bad thing.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
It's not a bad thing. I love the GBA games. But the fact that there are ONLY big name 2D games for the GBA is.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>here's a good reason that a majority of the 2d games show up on the GBA, and it's because it's almost overkill to put them on the other machines when the processor requirements are so low.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
This is what I mean. Everyone has this antiquated idea of what a 2D game should be. Sure, if you did them the same way everyone did on the SNES (which is basically what the GBA is), then of course it's more power than you need. But since they are so powerful, there's a lot more you can do with the games now. It's just that no one has taken advantage of this huge potential, so we haven't seen how far 2D games can really go. And why is it more costly? You can always use less power than you need. It just allows you to create higher resolution, and more complex games.<br>
<br>
I'll use Castlevania: SOTN as an example, since I consider it one of the best examples of what 2D could be. Now, the ones for GBA have all been excellent, but they are not NEARLY as deep or complex as SOTN, and it was made YEARS before these games. They've taken a step backwards. Again, I'm not being unrealistic. I don't think that they should all focus on 2D games, or refuse to update old classics into 3D. I just think that every once in a while it couldn't hurt to produce a good quality 2D game. <p><html>
