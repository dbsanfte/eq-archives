Eventually the orcs started to invade Greater Faydark and the dwarves sent all their armies to help out the Elves. It happened that in the middle of the campaign the goblin scouts saw that Kaladim was ripe for the taking. And so the goblins attacked early on morning and over powered what few guards there were.<br>
<br>
  Un benost to the goblins there was cook up early to start preparing breakfast. He noticed the goblins as they started to filter in, and started to wake up the people. The town started a battle that lasted all day. Using tools and what weapons were around the town held off the goblins and even managed to send someone out a secret tunnel to get the armies. During this first day of battle the cook would lead charges with his frying pan and mug. But alas at some point he was severly injured. It was in the hospital which was manned by the few apprentice healers were around that the cook met a beautiful woman with whom he fell in love.<br>
<br>
  Thee next day the armies arrived and crushed the goblins. A few of the goblins managed to escape and the dwarves learned there lesson about leaving the city poorly manned with guards. And so the cook healed without a problem, because of the love and care that was given by the healer. They married soon after and had a happy life.<br>
<br>
Brell Serilis came down a while after the battle to check on his most faithful followers and heard about the cook. He sought out the cook and promised him one wish for his bravery and courage. The cook asked for one day to decide and Brell granted it. That night the cook and healer talked about what they would wish for long into the night. Early the next morning a very tired cook walked up to Brell on his way to work. He asked Brell to grant his wife and him a girl as thier first child. Brell said that it would be his pleasure to grant such a wish.<br>
<br>
  Life went on, and it took a couple of months but the healer became pregnant. The couple was happy and hoped that Brell remembered thier wish. And nine months later a baby girl was born. And Brell visited on that day to wish the couple happiness. It was then that the couple named the baby Annette.<br>
<br>
  Now Bristlebane was following Brell on that fateful day and over heard the talk about the wish and the baby girl. That night when everyone was sleeping, Bristlebane snuck into the babies room and cast a spell on her. The spell turned her into a baby boy, but also cursed him to be called annette like he was named. Then Bristlebane cast a spell on the city to forget the original wish that Brell granted the cook and healer.<br>
<br>
  In the morning the parents woke up and found a baby boy. Proud of their child they never thought of the fact that their boy was named Annette. And Annette outcast because of his odd naming decided to forsake Brell and worship Bristlebane. He also became a miner much to the sadness of his parents.<br>
<br>
So the tale of the boy named Annette continues and all whom read this might contribute in those future tales. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/flottdrinalfrm11.showPrevMessage?topicID=28.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/flottdrinalfrm11.showNextMessage?topicID=28.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/flottdrinalfrm11.emailToFriend?topicID=28.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/flottdrinalfrm11.threadControl?topicID=28.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/flottdrinalfrm11.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=28.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/flottdrinalfrm11.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=28.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub25.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="lottdrinalfrm1">Courtyard<option value="lottdrinalfrm2">Barracks<option value="lottdrinalfrm18">Event and Raid planning<option value="lottdrinalfrm11">Library<option value="lottdrinalfrm16">Pax Conlegium<option value="lottdrinalfrm17">Visus Fidelis<option value="lottdrinalfrm15">Announcements<option value="lottdrinalfrm3">Great Hall<option value="lottdrinalfrm14">Epic Might<option value="lottdrinalfrm8">Marketplace<option value="lottdrinalfrm12">Treasury<option value="lottdrinalfrm4">Council of Lords</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/blottdrinal>Lords of the Ters'Tai - Drinal</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/flottdrinalfrm11>Library</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.eqguild.net/guilds/terstai/">Lords of the Ters'Tai</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.230<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
