Thanks for the compliments <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  However, I'm affraid there's still a lot to do - once I get the lineart and shadowing done in Flash, I'm probably going to export the image in high resolution (4000x8000 pixels) and start coloring it with Photoshop. That is, unless I think it's too much work and settle for a b&amp;w poster <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Update 5</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->:<br>
<br>
I've started sketching out the background, although most of it will be sky (and a good deal of the rest is covered by the foreground). On the right side you can see something I like to call a &quot;tree&quot;, and on the left edge there's a small piece of a japanese gate showing. As you can imagine, lineart-wise the background is going to be very simple. At the moment you can also see the background &quot;through&quot; the foreground objects at places (like the little guy's right leg), but this will be fixed soon enough.<br>
<br>
Other than that I've almost completed cleaning up and shadowing the kids, but there's still some work to do with the grown-up versions.<br>

<br>
Glad to hear you like it! The 3d issue you mentioned stems from the fact that I haven't shadowed every part of the picture yet. Parts missing shadowing include the sword you brought up (all of it), the guy's stomach, chestplate (next to his armpit), left glove, the hem of his shirt, the girl's fingers and the little guy's right leg. There are also other, smaller parts which have not yet been shadowed.<br>
<br>
As to the kids' expressions.. maybe once you've rested you can give me ideas how they seem confusing and how they could be improved? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    What I was shooting for was that the girl's upset, clinging to the guy's arm and shouting something like &quot;TEDDYYY!&quot; (as you can see, her teddybear has been overtaken by a hedgehog <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    ). The guy's supposed to be surprised to find out that the &quot;monster&quot; his friend asked him to come and slay turns out to be a sleeping hedgehog and nothing more. Still, his friend DID come to HIM to ask for help, so he's going to do his damndest to help the girl out (and hence he's &quot;bravely&quot; standing between the girl and the &quot;monster&quot; <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    ).<br>
<br>
On a larger thematic scale, this spot under the tree (in the background) is supposed to be the place where as a kid the guy promised to the girl to always protect her from monsters, and later on as an adult promised to take care of himself and come back to her in one piece from whatever adventure he set upon. Hence the name of the picture - &quot;Yakusoku&quot; (Promise).<br>
<br>
Ideas for better conveying this situation through their facial expressions are gladly heard, so do mention them if you have any.<br>
<br>

<br>
I was off for the weekend. A lot has changed since then<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I've looked at your example picture concerning skull curves and I have to say that this was a very interesting experience. Honestly, I prefer the girl to the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> right</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. I was surprised though, since it doesn't match my own explanations about matching curves<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  However she's about twice as cute as the one to the left. Very stylish with that pointy nose and all, but still a beauty (anyways I don't think that beauty depends on the style. A girl in Asterix can be as cute as a Peanuts one). On a second or third glance, I'd suppose it has something to do with the flat forehad of the left one that she'd get less points. It's hard to tell, maybe it's more about the &quot;steepness&quot; of the curves I mentioned than about they're meeting or not...but then, haven't there been numerous people trying to define the beauty of a face? <br>
<br>
I've seen reports on TV recently where they tried to measure the symmetry of a face (like position and size of eyes, nostriles etc...) and then take that symmetry-value as a scale for beauty. I think it's rather primitive since a lot of us can tell from a face's profile if they like it or not. <br>
<br>
Anyways, I think the face we're talking about here has improved again, it might just be the lips that are still itching my eye.<br>
<br>
I also like the poster idea and I think it looks real good (though I'd never guessed that the small ones are our heros in younger years, but that's probably due to my limited imagination<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  However I have to complain again (uh, no, no please<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  that the boys eyes are a bit, uhm, strange? They're ok now that I got it, but I had to look two or three times at his face until I managed to sort it all out. I think it's these lines beneath his pupils; at first they look as if <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> they</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> were the eyes. Also it's maybe I haven't seen small pupils in Manga <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> without</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> some circular curves near them indicating the eye. But then again, I haven't seen that much Manga. Maybe I just wanted to take the opportunity to complain<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Nice of you to drop by again <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
And I'm quite surprised to hear that you chose Amelia over the unknown person on the left. I don't know what series or movie she's from as I just found her picture with an image search, but since she was drawn in a different style from Amelia she fit my example. It does prove, however, that there's no one hard rule for defining beauty although - as you suggested - people have been trying to explain why someone is thought to be beautiful while someone else isn't.<br>
<br>
And as I assume was already clear, different people like different things. I can't summarize what exactly I find attractive in the girl I drew, but to me she looks pretty (more so than the original, I have to admit). She's no knock-out but she doesn't hurt my eyes <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
I'm glad to hear that you think the face has improved. Unfortunately at this point I'm not sure what I should do to improve her lips, but since the picture isn't finished yet I'm sure something will come up.<br>
<br>
As for the kids, I can certainly understand that if I didn't explain what their presence means, a lot of people would think that they are the adult characters' offspring who are just being kids while their parents are talking about adult (ie. boring and icky <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) things. I've tried to make them look a little bit like the adult characters do, but obviously there are reasons why they can't look exactly the same:<br>
<br>
* I can't give them exactly the same haircuts (like the &quot;bundle&quot; on the back of the adult female's head) because hairstyles for kids and adults are usually different. I have broken this &quot;rule&quot; a little bit by giving the guy the three bangs he has on front, and the girl her two<br>
<br>
* I can't give them exactly the same jewelery, as kids don't much care for those. If I had given the little guy the ferronniere (headpiece) and the girl her pearls instead of a bow it would probably be clearer who the kids are, but that'd be too obvious. These are supposed to be the two characters as kids, not chibi versions of their adult selves <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
And then there are of course a couple of counterparts, such as the guy's sword and sword belt, and a somewhat unobvious hint in the girl's dress (folds) versus the woman's sleeve (folds).<br>
<br>
I'm hoping to make it clearer that these four characters aren't supposed to exist in the same time by drawing the legs of the adult male character and having them &quot;fade&quot; into the background. I'm hoping that'll be sufficient.<br>
<br>
Now, as for the little guy's eyes.. Personally I'm quite surprised about the problems you and Ryo were having with them, as they are clear as a day to me. That doesn't mean much, though, as I was the one who drew them so obviously I KNOW what they should look like <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Your troubles mean that they aren't clear enough, so I'll have to do something to fix them. The most likely fix is the addition of curves to show where the outline of his eyes goes, but I'm still considering whether to do this with outlines, or simply by using a different color to bring out the eyes (assuming I will color the picture).<br>
<br>
The problem with lines is that they don't always fit the picture. We all know that the adult guy, for example, would have a sort of &quot;line&quot; (edge) to the left of his nose, on his right cheek, to point out where his cheek's &quot;underside&quot; is, but if I added this line it will look like he's old and wrinkly. Instead of adding a line, I usually make these kind of things clear with colors and shading, instead of lineart. Adding a highlight in the shading phase instead of a line now will accomplish the same thing, but with the difference that the guy won't look old. The problem with this approach is that in lineart state, certain parts of the picture might look &quot;unfinished&quot; to you, as you don't know what things I've considered adding in the shading phase <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  The little guy's eyes were one of these things. Imagine that I colored his face in a skin tone, and then colored a white area around his pupils. It would be clear where his eyes were, right? You just can't see that in the picture's current b&amp;w state.<br>
<br>
One way or another, though, I'll fix it. If I color the picture then I use white color to show where his eyes are. If I leave the picture at b&amp;w (actually, greyscale is more accurate), then I'll use lines.<br>
<br>

About that beauty: I think it's an interesting topic and I wouldn't call it a prove for non-existent-rules that my own rule didn't match. There are really a lot of people who agree on the beauty of...uhm...Cindy Crawford. Or other models. The same goes for males.

About the kids: Yes, I think it's hard to put in obvious details without having them look funny (like you said, jewelery e.g.). On the other hand, if it helps to get the idea, it might just work well (&quot;Aw, look, it's him as a child!&quot; &quot;How did you know?

<br>
Here we go again <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   As you can probably see, there are very few visible changes to the picture. This is simply a sign of the fact that the picture's starting to reach its finished state (as far as b&amp;w goes).<br>
<br>
I've added more gears to the background, a mock-up cloud behind the grown up characters (the final clouds will probably be cartoonish and &quot;puffy&quot;), changed the tree's roots slightly to curve along the bottom right corner, sketched in the guy's legs, done numerous tweaks to the lines to smooth them out (not visible at this size) and added a couple of details like the pattern on the guy's right sleeve.<br>
<br>
When I added the mock-up cloud in the background I realized that the characters on the foreground were starting to &quot;vanish&quot; into the background as it became more detailed. Therefore I added thicker lines around the grown ups to make them better stand out from their surroundings. These would also be added around the kids later on.<br>
<br>
Now, the question is: does this change ruin the picture in your opinion? I personally like the effect, but am I alone in my opinion? If you look closely, I also added a similar effect to the hourglass figure in the background - there's a &quot;gap&quot; in places where the gears come in contact with the shape. <p><hr><b>Want to color my lineart?</b> Otherwise alter something I've created?

The outline on the girls face looks a bit thick to me, but that's probably just because of the shadows on her nose and...uhm...the &quot;where the forehead meets the nose&quot; part.<br>
And those mountains in the background...are they supposed to be clouds or did I get you wrong there?<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
The upper half looks pretty close to finished now, great work. The only thing I can come up with (after an intense search<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) might be the shadow that covers the guy's nose and mouth, it looks a bit funny since I don't get the source that's casting the shadow.<br>
<br>
I don't know what you're planning to do on the lower part, but just in case...the teddy and hedgehog seem to be missing some shading. Since there's not so much detail in the background (yet?), the kids might get along well with the thinner outlines. Though it would be nice to have the opportunity to compare with a thick-one<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

those clasped hands between the couple at the back - where their fingers intertwine. There's no shadowing there whatsoever, tho I woulda thought there would have been small shadows created by the fingers...<br>

<br>
Yes, the thicker outline on the girl's face is due to her shadowing. I'm going to change the black shadows to dark grey similar to the guy's (under his nose, for example). That should help some <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
The mountains are supposed to be clouds <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I sketched them quickly just to see what the picture would look like when there's more &quot;stuff&quot; in the background (which was the reason why I added the dark outlines). It's not supposed to be the final cloud / clouds, but I do have to agree that I, too, thought it looked like a mountain <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
The shadow under the guy's nose comes from the same lightsource as the shadows everywhere else - off to the right side of the picture. The lightsource is slightly above horizontal level, so it casts shadows on everything facing left or down (like the underside of his nose). I'm sure it could be debated whether the shadow should be so dark or not at this angle, but I think I'll make use of my artistic license to interpret things how I want <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Also, the teddy and the hedgehog are still in sketch state, which is why they don't have any shadows. The tree's shadows aren't complete either, as it's not casting anything on the ground although it should. I'm still pondering how it should look. I'm hoping the shadow cast on the ground by the tree will make the ground seem less empty, but other than that I haven't thought of any further details for it.<br>
<br>
Hopefully in the next update you'll also see a slight change to the girl's lips (for the better <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ).<br>

It's been a long and quiet period once again, and it would've been longer and quieter if I hadn't decided to make sure that you guys knew I was still working on this picture. The reason for no updates in a while has been part &quot;real life hassle&quot;, but mostly because the changes I've made to the picture have been miniscule and haven't warranted an update. I will probably make one more greyscale update to this picture in order to tie up some loose ends (mainly fixing up things in the bottom part of the picture) and after that I'll consider starting the coloring process. This should be sometime next week.<br>
<br>
The changes between the last update and this one include <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> changes in the background</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> (cleaned up top end of tree, added some quick shadow sketches to the roots and continued the ex-cloud, now-mountain's lower end further down), <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> finalizing the line clean-up process on the grown ups' upper torsos</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> (it's finally done!), <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> adding a see-through effect to the older girl's fan-like neck thingy</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> and <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> adding shadows to her hands as well as the guy's shirt</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.<br>
<br>
As you can see, I decided that the mock-up cloud looked so much like a mountain that I decided to keep it as a mountain <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I'm still pondering whether I should add some details to it or not..

So often we just see the finished version, or an &quot;in progress, a b/w and a cg&quot;, but to see a dynamic picture like this is a real change.<br>
<br>
On to the picture itself - I don't feel qualified to critique any thing, but I feel that the boy version of the guy, doesn't have the impression of youth, to the same extent as the girl does - i'm not sure what it is - could be the forehead proportions? but I think that is contributing to the recognition problem with him, whereas with the girl it is apparent that she is a younger version. <br>
<br>
Something else which may help with indicating separate times is a difference in lighting - ie if you colour it - have the older version by moonlight and the younger version by sunlight. The moonlight will help to indicate the passage of age (ie sunrise often represents birth, and a world of possiblities still to come) and to have moonlight will help with romanticism, and expectations - the possibility of an ending but the hope of a new tommorrow.<br>
<br>
Hope that isn't a bit too wishywashy, but just my ideas <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/usyphernz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Syphernz</A> at: 9/11/02 6:19:18 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=kopitz>kopitz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/11/02 9:02:03 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7034.topic&index=40>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: update 8</span><hr size=1> I have to agree on everything Syphernz said, I'm also enjoying to observe the development process<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Sometimes it can be motivating and inspiring to view a finished piece of art, but there are also times when you're just discouraged because you see perfection you think you'll never reach. I can't put it in words how I feel when I see a major mistake of an otherwise great artist...like...just to pick an example...<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> any</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> example...a great pic with an ugly girl's face in it<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
It's more encouraging than anything else to see a page of one's scetchbook with crappy hands, odd faces, wiered muscles etc. if you're used to his artwork being simply perfect. It's like &quot;Hey, the bad stuff looks exactly like mine, maybe my &quot;good&quot; stuff will look like his too - one day&quot;. Maybe we should do a contest: &quot;Post the worst page of your scetchbook&quot; to encourage everybody...&lt;cough&gt; uhm, looks like I'm off topic again.<br>
<br>
Ok, for the picture: I had to reload the old version and compare it to the new one to really see the changes. I think there has been a big improvement on the lower part. The tree's shadow adds a lot of detail without distracting from the characters. Very good composition. The whole lower part doesn't look that flat no longer. I don't think there's much more detail needed here, maybe just some shading would do. But I'm sure you have your plans.<br>
<br>
The mountains are perfect in my opinion. I wouldn't bother about detail, contrast or anything else here. I'd just leave them alone.<br>
<br>
The lighting/shadows on the hands work pretty well, though the former version has more contrast which is also very nice. Maybe some deeper shadows would help. But then, there's really nothing wrong with it.<br>
<br>
That transparency effect on the fan thing has similar impressions to me: On the one hand it looks pretty good, on the other hand the former version added contrast to the whole area, since now the tree, the hair and the head are all round about the same grey level. I wouldn't prefer one over the other though.<br>
<br>
The only thing I'd take from the former one would be the guy's eyes, but that's just personal preference because I like them darker (and it gives a more &quot;mangaish&quot; look imo).<br>
<br>
