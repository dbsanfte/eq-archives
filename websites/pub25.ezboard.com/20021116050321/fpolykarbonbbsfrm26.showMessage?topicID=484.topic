I'm not great with churning out poems...especially lots of them...especially if they have to be good...<br>
I'm better with short stories...poems are too much work to me...especially if they're supposed to be serious...<br>
you guys would have serious haunting poetry...and I would have a limerick about a guy mowing his lawn in the snow (which happens here frequently...no..I'm not kidding unfortunately....quit laughing a guy got killed doing it...yes that's true too...I have the news article...hehehe)....As you can see it would probably kill any mood you try and create...<br>
If you'd give me some ideas to shoot for...like certain emotions or subjects and maybe even certain styles you'd like to see I can write poetry...but normally I just can't take it seriously and write dumb stuff....<br>
I'm not a terrible writer (not a great one either) but I need to be inspired...<br>
<br>
I don't know....as long as we're on the same page....in addition to that I finally have a job and I get offered another...now I have to choose...manual labour...or desk job....I don't know...maybe a sonnet....An ode to office space....Or a haiku about grease stains and smelling like gasoline<br>
<br>
I guess to sum it up.....<br>
1. I need some direction...<br>
2. I'm going to be busy....<br>
3. I write better short stories...<br>
4. I can barely be serious...<br>
5. I can write almost anything including poems given a little aim <p><pre>

Just keep the lenght of the piece under 3/4 of a page (single spaced size 12 font) I'll post a sample piece so you can get an idea of the subject matter. Some prose of a city scape might be good. I'll try and post a few of my poems for example on direction and style i am looking for. the prose piece follows, the poems i still have to type so i may get them on today or tomorrow. <br>

Trees of a park<br>
<br>
There is a park by the house that I live, which has been there for as long as I can remember, from my earliest days of youth to my days of now. I have over the years traveled through the park many a time, indulging in its quite serene. Walking through the soft, green, grass that covers the expanse of park in all directions, I take on of all that is around me and my senses are filled with a quite joy; the wind rustling through the vine, bushes on the bank, leaves of some odd pea-plant with small purple flowers. <br>
At this park there are several large trees which gives one the sense of being in the country, yet at the same time existing in the suburbia of a small city.   The trees, tall and great, only have leaves half of the year; in spring they are a soft hue of green and the fall and winter they drop a dull brown color. The two greatest ones lay at the entrance to the park, as if they had been there since the advent of time and intended to stay there till its end. They have seen many a face, both young and old pass by, both of the present and long past. <br>
When in this park it is like being in another place entirely, reminiscent of some great fantasy. It is a place in which perfect harmony between all things of nature exists and seems to have always existed in that way. In the morning the soft sunrise brings back memories, and the colors of the clouds among the trees softens the day to come. <br>
Upon the afternoon, with sun bright as day, a feeling of the country is created; the city can be forgotten and only the park, the trees, the grass and vines are present in mind. At dusk the glowing of the clouds as they wane softly from their hues of pink and orange till darkness, foreshadow the night to come; it is the closing of the day, but not of the mind. There is a perfect moment that seems to exist between the point of day and dusk, a moment in which the mind makes a silent but steady transition from the jittering activity of the day to the peace and solitude of night. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp At night three lights on green metal posts, scarcely six feet high with small green caps, give the park a soft eerie green glow. Although they produce light it is hardly significant, for the darkness prevails in the wide spaces between; there is still darkness for the spirits to roam. It is at this time that many thoughts come to the mind those of: past, present and future. A discovery of one’s self is gained and lost with in each sojourn. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Upon exiting the park one must again walk up the small flight of concrete steps, about five or six, and past the two large trees; those that serve as gate keepers between the real world and that of the mind.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp One day, however, after many visits to this park had come to pass, it was learned that the trees might be cut down in the way of progress; the outlanders came to cut them down, trespassing on the park, new to the soil, once there and once gone. Doing their horrible deed of which they had no care or quarrel, they would destroy a life, a memory, and a place of solace hard to attain and long to forget. <br>

<br>
I know I set this up as an open ended project, but I think it would be good if we all had a deadline date for some work, just to set pace. Otherwise the whole process becomes chaotic.<br>
<br>
I am thinking March 5th as the initial deadline. Here is what needs to be in on march 5th:<br>
<br>
For people doing poems: mimium of 3 and a maximum of 5 (preferably 5, but i know everyone is busy) revision takes a while so I need time. <br>
<br>
For people doing prose: minimum of 1 maximum of 3<br>
(note: I know i told jefm a lenght restriction, but i've decided to lift some of that restriction. Here is the new limit: 3 pages single spaced, size 12 font Times New Roman) <br>
<br>
Select notes: If anyone has ideas for visuals and or special fonts you want to use let me know.<br>
<br>

Basically, I am trying to get something in from everyone so I can start the compiling process. I need a bit of time to edit the work I recieve from everyone and then return it to them. <br>
I'm hoping we can get at least half of the required material by the end of march. So march 5th is just the first step. If time is a crunch for you, just let me know, and i'll reset the date. <br>
It will take some time for the publisher to review the book so the sooner we get everything together the sooner we can start the actual publication review process. <br>
<br>
thanks, <br>

Poetry seems to be coming easier this time....so I should have a few by the deadline....<br>
