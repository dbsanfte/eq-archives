I'd like to get good at this writing thing. Thanks. There is no name for it yet.<br>

<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Space...What is there to say about it. Many might call it cold and vast. Some say it's a thing of magnificent beauty. And others say it's pure evil. But others, like me, call it home. I've lived in space for as long as I can remember. We moved from Earth when I was but an infant. I was told that Earth was in a state of constant mayhem. With the leaders of the world throwing their nuclear powered toys at each other. It was only a matter of time until they destroyed the world. But lucky for me  my family, the Reigards, survived. The Reigards and a handful of other billionairs had enough money to travel through space on the top secret space ships Mr. Reigard had built for the US military. 200 in all. Not enough to save the whole world. But enough to start life again. My parents told me about how happy they had been to be away from the wasteland that was home. Space was still new to everyone and everyone was enthralled at how huge the universe actually is. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I remember when I hit my teen years how our space colony, aptly named Outer Heaven,  was a bubbling cauldron of activity. By then we had vast starships and ways of traveling through space that astrologers of the 30th century couldn't even conceive.. We soon discovered the Carackians and the Yerezorians. Two alien races.   Despite what you may think about humans and aliens, they were friendly and taught us technology beyond our years. We prospered, we built, we lived. Soon everyone forgot earth. It was a story grandparents told to the young as a myth. To the children...a blue sky was outlandish and the deep oceans was a faery tale. We were able to plant trees and shrubery though. Millions of them. What the Yerezorians scientists taught us! We soon had plants that were alive. And I don't mean that they grew by sucking nutrients out of soil. They talked and grew just as we do. And soon they branched off into their own race, the Faradrides. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The Faradrides were however frowned upon by the other three races. It was considered a sin to mix science and life. Everyone believed that god didn't approve. They were enslaved and forced to work and build. To everyone else...the Faradrides were just pets, beasts that had no feelings at all. But I know that to be false. I met a Faradride girl ,Telatalia, who was quite intelligent about matters such as hyperdrive, g-forces and all that other space jargon. Tela and I became the best of friends. Luckily her family worked for ours and we chatted all the time. We grew together. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp When I was 20 years old, I finally graduated from the inter-racial academy of space pilots.I was on my way to becoming what i'd always dreamed. A pilot for the solar-falcons. A team of military pilots who scout for new races and habitibal planets. We had a huge party that night to celebrate. Everyone arrived including Tela who i hadn't seen in a year. She told me that she would be sneaking out of Outer Heaven in search of something better. What she was searching for...she wouldn't tell me. She asked me to join her, but I refused. Looking back I don't think it would have mattered if I joined her or not. It sure would have been easier if i did go with her. Before she left, she gave me a necklace that shimmered briliant colors of the spectrum. She left after that. This is where the real story begins... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/upsychoweb.showPublicProfile?language=EN>PsychoWeb</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(8/28/02 7:01:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=783.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Prologue to a novel, possible manga.
