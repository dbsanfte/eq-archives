1 &amp; 2 look just like Sony camcorders (built in 2050 though<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>
3 is my fav., it looks pretty cool, I can't tell what it is that makes it cool, though. Hm, I think it has to do with the visor. Visors look cool<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
4 is different, I really like it, has to be 2. on my fav. list<br>
<br>
I can't say anything about the rest, they look just like mech-stuff to me. Very good drawn mech-stuff that is<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  There's nothing to them that looks wrong to me.<br>

First off I am of the opinion that practicality and originality weighs heavier than style.<br>
A mecha's head must no doubt be the sensor area for the mecha and possibly contain a complex avionics package for targetting and object location and such especially if to travel through space where it would need 3D targetting.(Can you imagine being in space with no radar where you don't know where 'up' is because there is no 'up' or 'down'?)<br>
Anyway,the head should also generally have a relay compartment and such to pick and send signals and data.[unless it's fairly primitive].<br>
I'll rate my crits on these heads like this and also remembering the fact they're made for battle.<br>
1. This would suffer in battle because everything seems so exposed and volatile. However it does seem to have a wide line of sight and that pod on the side seems to be vulcans so perhaps it could be useful but what person would place powerful vulcans on the head? <br>
If solid rounds then too much space is needed for ammo and a flexible neck for recoil(if it recoils) and if beam then I don't see how that could be hooked up based on the equipment a head needs which should take up that space.<br>
Big problem with this suit is that the pilot will have two definite blindspots on either side of the mecha. If someone attacks him from left or right diagonally strong enough then he's toast without even knowing it. (I guess he could depend on sensor readouts but this is for battle; visual confirmation is always very useful in battles)<br>
<br>
2. Same as #1 without the vulcans. Not a good design. I would add more cameras and such to either the upper torso of the mecha or the sides of the head to eliminate the obvious blindspots. Antennae frame does look sturdier however. Artistically speaking perspective is a little off considering the placement of the camera.<br>
<br>
3. Not bad but generic. The visor is good because of a large field of vision but why cover part of it with that little gadget?<br>
The antennae are too flimsy looking however they are short and close to the vulcans so there's a nice balance. One big problem is the power cable to the back which I hope is short because if not that's just a weakspot shouting to be acknowledged. (Another problem with perspective with the placement of the lines near the antennae)<br>
<br>
4.I don't quite get its shape since some part seems missing however it is actually useful since if the mecha's body were shaped similar then it would probably be a stealth mecha due to the rounded frame which everyone knows avoids and deflects radar signals better than a blocky frame can. Therefore it'd be able to avoid detection. <br>
However those fin antennae make little sense to me unless made to gather larger amounts of data quicker than normal and relay them quicker due to the large surface area of the antennae. I'd say it's for aquatic use but I highly doubt. Again the powercable....<br>
<br>
5. Besides the vulcans and the ability to make its opponent go:&quot; Oooo..look at that..&quot; because it does look cool I don't see the use. That is unless the dome at the top is actually a highly sophisticated sensor relay system using the smoothness of the dome for a higher efficiency in relaying and recieving signals with higher clarity. Obivously it would have to be some form of polymer so it isn't destroyed easily but that idea would be darn cool.(wait...I came up with that all on my own...oops)<br>
I hope the four thingies are weapons. If not then please remove them because they confuse the design unnecessarily.<br>
This one looks cool if not somewhat less useful than others.<br>
<br>
6. Artistically, I don't like how it looks really but it is practical. The antennae fins on the front look like they could do the job well too though they are however exposed to be damaged easily. The field of vision seems large and I doubt there are many blindspots an opponent can effectively use.The thingies at the back look like batteries?<br>
<br>
7 &amp; 8. Sorry to say I don't see how these are any better than the others in functionality. The field of view is poorer and offensive capabilities seems off unless all weaponry is hidden.(I guess the forward attachment on #7 is a horn? If an antennae then it's really vulnerable...)<br>
<br>
9. Another very good design. Except for the bugging powercable....will fare well in battle considering the categories I'm thinking of. <br>
<br>
BTW: #4 and #8 get extra points for creativity.(the top section of #5 too but only if it's a sensor thingie)<br>
<br>
Well that's it. I hope you see those mistakes and the improvements that can be made. Sorry if you expected me to just reply:&quot;Way cool&quot; because I'm actually of the opinion that does little to nothing to help the people who post here unless they post here for recognition and to feel good about what they draw...I'd hope not. This ain't a gallery.. <br>

    Spike, you're a freak...... if I were to take everything you said into account then all my mech heads would just look like variations of your own, which in my opinion just look bland.(and I don't see any radar on it at all)<br>
    Don't forget, an artist's job is to concisely convey the thoughts and concepts he has in a manner which is both interesting and can be easily 'accepted' in another person's mind, unless, you're just drawing purely for yourself and that's futile.<br>
    btw: About the field of vision comments, aren't your eyes at the front of your head? do you have extra pairs to the side so that you can see at a totally 360 degree angle, no, and that's cus heads are generally made to move (wow, that's a shocker ain't it).... a fairly good example of this kind of MOVEMENT are submarines, they don't have to suface and place men at every corner to see approaching enemies, they just use the periscope which can move to see what their sonar has already detected, such would be the same for mechs.(oh and number 8, that big thing is the visor and the other thing is a telescopic lens with different modes of view)<br>
     As for things being exposed what would you have me do, huh, large paper bags, if nothing were exposed then they would just look alike, not to mention bland and just plain silly.And the larger the visor on the head the more exposed that is, isn't that true?<br>
     It seems to me that you just used you're critique to try to show off to everyone reading that you seem to have some knowledge of mechanical things. I've read critiques that you've posted here before, and you don't seem to have respect for anyone else's creative vision, you just tell them to change everything that doesn't fit into your own view on how everything should be. (that's not what critiques are, it's supposed to help people improve in their own unique style, not turn them into you)<br>
     Contrary to what you may think, you are not a mech god.  <br>
<br>

Spike, everything you said is true, but I think it's too much.  A big part of designing mecha (among other things) is to simply, &quot;Make it look cool.&quot;  I know it's not totally about that, but it is important.  I mean an artist SHOULD take all the things you said into consideration when designing a mech, but not so much that it completely changes your design.  Honestly, just speaking for myself, I wouldn't watch a mech anime or read a mech manga if the mecha looked all crappy and bland, but their parts made sense.  I'd be bored because I like to be visually stimulated.  In my opinion, all those little extras and such on the mech that don't do anything are alright because it does the simple job of making it look cool.  I think both of you are right to a certain extent.  But I don't think that Yann should be SO concerned about the functions of each piece of the mech. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/usadclown37.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sadclown37</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.angelfire.com/linux/coolstuff1/avatar.html" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pre-Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/25/02 11:34:42 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7228.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.angelfire.com/linux/coolstuff1/avatar.html WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Mech heads</span><hr size=1> on an additional to what banishedknight just wrote...The fact is that when you design a mech (most of the time) you're assuming technology far in advance to our own.

(btw. I asked you to 'respond', and I can say with all certainty that that was not what I expected, you went a bit overboard in my opinion) You sounded like you were saying, 'all your stuff here is wrong cus it doesn't fit into my view, this is how everyone should draw mechs' (insert Paladdin here)<br>
   I just think you need to learn how to phrase things better.<br>
   Anyway here is my peace offering:<br>

<br>
The green is a little off, sorry.<br>
I figured you didn't have time to colour it properly, cus you were talking on the Polyevolution site about how tied up you were, and I had a little free time so....*(to anyone who wants to critique my colouring do so in the coloured art section, it'll be posted there)*<br>
<br>
Oh, one more thing, people and artists especially need to be encouraged, there's nothing wrong with someone telling you you've done something well, that it looks kewl; it helps motive them, especially if you display to a bunch of strangers who aren't obligated to love everything you do like most relatives are programmed to do. (It does help). So please, in future critique with more respect for the artist's intentions, that'd be alot more useful to them, I'm confident in my abilities, but remember that some on this board are beginners and fragile, don't you remember what that was like?<br>

Now, the mech heads. The mech heads look awesome, theres nothing wrong with them, apart from 1 &amp; 2, which look odd and do, I admit, look like camcorders. Ditch 1 &amp; 2, but keep the rest, they're pretty much perfect. <p><A HREF="http://sin.emeraldwinter.com/news.html"><IMG BORDER="0" IMG SRC="http://sin.emeraldwinter.com/graphics/buttons/mybuttons/button1.gif"></A>
