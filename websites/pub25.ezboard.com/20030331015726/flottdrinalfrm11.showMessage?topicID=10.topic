I slept quite a bit, weak from the constant battles feeding my recent burst of experience.  After deciding I had spent enough down time I realized I was low on arrows again (tis amazing how fast you go thru 2 full packs).  I cleaned up my camp and started my journey from South Karana to Qeynos to visit the bank and stores.  <br>
<br>
After banking and getting some fletching supplies I headed back out, hoping to make the most of the speed endowment granted to me by a kind druid in South Karana.  I didn't take the time to fletch any arrows as I knew there would be plenty of time for that when I got back to South Karana. <br>
<br>
As I left Qeynos and entered the foothills I started to wonder why we could build such a magnificent city and still not have the technology to carve a pass into the mountain range to get directly into the Karanas from Qeynos.  Oh well.  After racing thru the Qeynos pass and into the Western Karanas I felt the urge to visit Eastern Karana instead of Southern Karana (ok, I knew some guildies were there). <br>
<br>
I set off on a direct eastward trek, knowing that it was quicker to leave the road and travel by land using my Ranger abilities to avoid getting lost.  I was musing about life in general when I noticed the tingling sensation in my feet dissipating.  I knew that soon my druid endowed speed would depart and was hopelessly praying I would make it across the vast Western Plains of the Karanas before it wore out.  Alas, I didn't and worse yet, I was so caught up in the moment that I lost track of my surroundings.<br>
<br>
I knew I was still running in an Easterly direction so I was in good shape there.  the terrain was unfamiliar however.  The plains were gone, visible only to the far south.  I was now in the foothills, having not realized how far to the south their reach extended.  I decided to keep running east, figuring it twas only a spur of the hills and soon I would be back in the plains.  <br>
<br>
A few more steps and I knew something was wrong.  My keen ranger senses were picking up somethign I had not felt for a while ... fear.  I didn't know what caused this (other than the boom boom boom of footsteps behind me), but I immediately started tracking trying to figure out where not to run.  The first two things I saw on tracking were red names.  Ah, the fabled Oon Brothers, coming after me.  <br>
<br>
At this time I remembered a gift from the High Commander himself.  The precious gift was no doubt created by a highly gifted Shaman, most likely from beyond the northern mountains.  I was terrified beyond belief at drinking a potion concocted by a Shaman, but decided then that although our gods may differ, they both dislike their vassals not trying to make use of what has been made available to them.  I quickly quaffed the potion down, taking just one gulp, hoping it would be enough to save me, as it had been a few days since I had spent any time practicing my precious Ranger Gate spell. <br>
<br>
Lo and behold, I felt a familiar tingling in my feet, and ran faster than I think I ever have.  Within moments the Brothers were far behind me, and then they were completely off track.  Soon after I entered the Northern Plains of central Karana and settled down to heal my wounds.  Afterwards I journeyed on into the Eastern plains of Karana.<br>
<br>
After surveying the landscape and seeing yet another of the Oon Brothers on tracking I decided to be more careful in this zone.  I was not sure in which direction my brothers and sisters in arms would be so I turned once again to my Ranger senses.  I visited the Druid Rings and noted Dubs the Druid, famous caretaker of Dubs Aeronautical there with another guildmate.  Dubs appeared to be meditating so I kept to myself so as not to disturb him.<br>
<br>
Looking around the great ancient ruins I could smell death.  I knew that something big had happened just recently and started off towards the direction of the smell, hoping to find my brothers and sisters.  As I came upon a deserted bandit camp I noticed a few figures appear.  I knew they were not the bandits of this region for their armor never shined this bright.  As I made my way up I realized these were guildmates.  <br>
<br>
After discovering the rest of my guildmates had left the area, I noticed my potion endowed speed was fading.  Now understanding the power of the Barbarian Shamans I asked my guildmate for a spell to renew my enhanced speed.  It was granted, and I was off to South Karana knowing there was nothing I could do for my guild in the Eastern plains.  As I ran to South Karana I found myself wondering if the barbarian I had just met was the same Shaman who had crafted the potion that had saved my life.  I will probably never know, but whomever it was, I thank thee for giving of thy powers to aid the newcomers of the land.  <br>
<br>
I would also like to thank the High Commander for bestowing this gift upon me.  I am not sure, but I think the foul Brothers Oon were gaining on me and about to bestow certain death upon me.  This was truly a life saving gift.<br>
<br>
Laters all,<br>
Talas<br>
<br>
P.S. - As an offside to this.  I stopped to drink the potion thinking I had to, and this caused me to actually get hit a couple of times.  I stopped because I didn't want to risk wasting the potion.  Coudl someone tell me if you have to stand still to drink the Blood of Wolf potion, or can you do it while running?   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon2.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/utpar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>TPar</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Council of Lords</span><br>  Posts: 618<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/25/01 1:49:15 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Daily Journal - The perils of AutoRun</span><hr size=1> The Blood of the Wolf potion casts a sow spell... and therefore, MUST be quaffed while standing still.
