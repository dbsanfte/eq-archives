<br>
Chapter 0<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Don't you find the sound of dripping maddening?<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Drip. Drip, Drip, Drip.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lying in bed, it's all I can hear.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I can't sleep. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Not just because of this, I can't ever sleep.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Really.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  A person who can actually not fall asleep. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I'm not one of those ones who go to bed at 5 am, wakes up at 6 and blames the fact that they're tired on insomnia or vitamin D deficiencies or whatever other @#%$ they can think up. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp My problem is not lack of exercise. My problem is not lack of Valerian root. My problem is lack of sleep. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I lie in bed from 11 pm until 6 am with nothing happening. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp My problem isn't to much caffine, or to much stress, or to much television, my problem is just I can't sleep. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I drinks 5-7 cups of coffee a day, people try to blame my lack of sleep on this, I've gotten tired of explaining to them that I didn't start drinking coffee until after I couldn't sleep. I'm sick of explaining how coffee doesn't stop me from sleeping, it stops me from dying. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Who say's you can't die from insomnia. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I read a book, it said that if you go without sleep for ten day's you go insane. Too late, I wonder what it does if you already are? It goes on to talk about how lack of sleep can cause death. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Please, let it. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I haven't slept in five months. I'm sick of waiting. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp People don't seem to realize the true implications of not sleeping. I often hear people wishing they didn't have to sleep. I hear this and wonder why anyone could possibly want something like that. Then again, people do listen to Pop music by choice, and high healed shoes are actually popular.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Basically, I chalk this up to human stupidity. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Human stupidity is the cause for most things in the world. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 'Stupidity,' 'Greed' and 'Desire To Fit In' seem to be responsible for 99.999% of all goods made and purchased. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The remaining 0.001% contains things like food. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp You know. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The things we actually need.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Just in case you were wondering.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Also, if you were wondering, yes, I have considered suicide.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I thought about that a lot as a child. I was one of those kids who would get a bottle of aspirin, take it all then time myself for how long I could go without being to scared to continue and making myself throw up. At first I was disappointed with myself for giving up, but I noticed that my time was improving, so I kept with it. It was after a few months of that that I reached my limit. I can still remember the time on the stopwatch when I would run to the toilet. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 37:45:079.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I always wondered how I could have it on the same @#%$ millisecond every time.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Fate maybe?<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I decided it was because I reached my limit of being able to stomach it, if you'll pardon the pun.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I decided after the 8th 37:45:079 in a row that I would have to find a new way to kill myself.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hang myself?<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Never seemed like an option, I'm very claustrophobic, so I always figured choking would just be too scary and I wouldn't be able to go through with it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Same for drowning.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Burning myself?<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Are you @#%$ crazy? That's the most painful way in the world to die! Also I don't like heat, it makes me feel as if pins are sticking in all over my body and it itches like crazy. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp So burning and itching just seemed annoying and more trouble then it's worth.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Slitting my wrists?<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp That's the option I finally settled on. I originally didn't go for this one because to be honest, I was scared of it hurting when I cut myself. I would have a steak knife against my wrist, feeling extremely depressed, and right before I made the final slice I would think how much it hurts to step on a pin, and multiply it by ten, that's how much I thought it would hurt to cut so I didn't<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Yeah, I know I'm a wuss.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp You're probably wondering how I managed to pick slitting my wrists after that aren't you. Well, it's an interesting story.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I had just had another fight with my parents. I can't remember what about, my grades in school, my future, how I wanted a cat, something like that. Anyway, I went upstairs really depressed. I remember I was crying. I wanted to die. I looked under the cabinet (remember, I was still on OD'ing at this time) and all I could find was Iron and Vitamin C. Though the Iron did say there was enough Iron in the bottle to seriously harm a child, I didn't want to go like that, I wanted to go with a good story. That's the most important thing about killing yourself in my opinion. Sure the way has some importance, but think about it what are people going to remember more? That you died from an OD? Or that you ate Iron pills until you died because your parents wouldn't let you have a cat. When you die, have a good story, like a guy who can't take the pain and drudgery of his life tries to change it, he fails, so he ends it by throwing himself off a building into a busy intersection during rush hour. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp That will make it into the news.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Back to the story. I didn't want to take the Iron, so decided to try to slash my wrists, I knew I wasn't going to be able to go through with it, but I felt I should at least try. The problem was, the knives were downstairs, as were my parents. You can guess why I didn't want to go get one. I started looking around the bathroom for anything, scissors, Swiss army knife, a @#%$ safety pin, anything. What I found was one of my old disposable razors.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Jackpot.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I started to tear that little plastic thing apart. The blades were protected by a safety guard plastic thing, it was designed to stop you from accidentally cutting too deep while shaving. I tore it off eventually, and when I looked down, I saw the razor had cut my hands all over. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Oh the irony.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The best part was I didn't feel a thing, I then knew I could cut my wrists and it wouldn't hurt.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp And yes, I am a wuss.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Taking off that little thing set me free, I knew at anytime, I could just end the torture I called life.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Oh the precious irony.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Of course this revelation cheered me up, so I didn't kill myself that day but I did start practicing. Every day I would take that little blade and slash my legs or my arms or both. Not deep cuts, just ten little cuts, to get me used to the feeling of cutting myself, so I wouldn't hesitate next time.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I always wondered if that blade was clean though. I was always worried I would get an infection, have to go to the hospital, have my parent's find out, and have them put an end to my fun. I also thought that that had to be one of the worst things a doctor would have to tell the parent. 'Hello, I was your son/daughter's doctor, the problem was your precious little child was slashing at themselves with a razor every night and it got infected. I suggest you get some therapy for that crazy little @#%$.' The only thing worse I could think of was 'Your eleven year old daughter is pregnant from your husband.' Possibly 'We had to pump this much semen out of your son's stomach.' Maybe that one and the incest one with the ages twelve to fifteen in there as well might beat the razor one, but not by much.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp You might wonder why I'm telling you this. It's not to get your sympathy, I don't give a @#%$ what you think of me. It's also not to tell you to go cut your wrists. Your favorite suicide method is your own, no one can pick those for you. Some I missed are:<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Jumping off a cliff/tall building; I'm scared of hights.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Drinking poison; Didn't have any around the house, I wouldn't let my parents kill things. No, it's not hypocritical, I didn't want them killing animals, they (the animals) didn't do anything to deserve that. Human's on the other hand, after careful study, I've found there isn't a person over the age of 5 who hasn't done something to deserve it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Shooting yourself; Ugh, I'll explain later.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Gassing yourself; Electric stove and no car keys<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Electrocution; Didn't have access to anything powerful enough to do anything more then hurt me, get rid of my hair and give me a headache for a week.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I was a deprived child. Probably explains why I was so depressed.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The reason I'm telling you, is because I think it will make the story I'm about to tell you make a lot more sense.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Especially how I managed to get roped in by a guy like Jack.<br>
<br>
Chapter 1<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Life was horrible.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A completely god-awful, senseless, pointless, waste of my time.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I couldn't sleep, and when I did I was always sorry, because I had to wake up to this.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp At night I would pray that I would go to sleep and not wake up. In the morning when I woke up I would curse god, and tell him/her/it that I didn't believe in him/her/it anymore. That night I would be praying again.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Don't get me wrong though, I'm not religious or anything, I strongly doubt that any sort of god exists. I just figured that even though the chance of god existing was minuscule, I'd be a fool to give up a new chance at ending this @#%$ that I call a life.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Every morning I would get out of bed at 7:15. I had a second alarm clock in case I fell asleep, and the first one didn't wake me up. Yep, I put that much effort into getting up. Pathetic, wasn't it. Once I got up I would turn on my stereo to my wake up song. Parabola by Tool. While listening to that I would do my stretches, a few sit ups and a few pushups, grab my towel and go have a shower. By this time it was 7:21, everyday. After my shower, brushing my teeth, drying off, trimming my little goatee and getting changed into my clothes for work:<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp One pair gray/brown/black/navy blue suit pants, ironed<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp One long sleeved, buttoned up, white dress shirt. Preferably with some little thing on the breast pocket. To show off the fact that you were willing to pay an extra $40 to feel superior to someone due to your clothing. It seems kind of like stapling a good report card to your forehead. A lot of effort to look good and you still look stupid<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp One Red/Blue/Dark Green/Black &quot;Power&quot; tie.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp One pair Black shoes, leather, because if you aren't killing something to have footwear what good are you? Your dead flesh on your feet has to be shined to perfection too.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp One pair Black/Dark Gray socks.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp One nicely trimmed haircut, out of eyes, showing off forehead and ears. Moosed or gelled with fragrenceless products if anything sticks up.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Any facial hair should be kept to a minimum and must be kept properly trimmed.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp No natural or un-natural odors may emit from your body.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The time at this point is 7:46. The same time everyday. I would then go down to have my breakfast of one pot black coffee, two slices of toast with blueberry/strawberry/blackberry/cherry jam on them. On my way out the door I would grab a handful of espresso beans to eat while I walked. When I reached the bus stop I would have three breath mints to get rid of any coffee breath. The time was 8:13, always. The bus would come at 8:17. I would be the third person on the bus, and sit at the back on the left side. Always.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The reason for all these patterns is so you can have the illusion of control over your life. You get organized not to make yourself a success, but to try to hide the fact you're a slave from yourself. They don't make you into dynamic, well functioning members of society whose ideas can flow much more clearly now. They make you into mindless zombies, who keep doing the same thing day in, day out because it numbs them to the fact their life is not only a sham it's completely worthless in the grand scheme of things. The reason for dress codes at work is not to maintain a decency standard. Customers don't even see me. It will not have an effect on the quality of your work if your shirt is untucked slightly, if a button isn't done up, if there's a spot on your shirt, if you have a short-sleeved shirt with a tie, if your shoes are slightly scuffed, if your socks don't match your pants, if your hair is untidy or if your pants have a wrinkle in them. What it will do is get you a mention in your performance review for &quot;sloppy image.&quot; The point of the is to try to stifle any creative thought you might have, to show you that your boss has total control over you, even over what you wear so you better do what he says, and to turn you into a mindless autonomous clone. Also known as a positive productive member of society.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This is what I had to wake up to. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Is it any wonder I didn't want to go to sleep?<br>
<br>
Chapter 2<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I felt empty. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It was as if I knew there was a piece that should be there, that wasn't. It felt as if there was something  I should do. One little thing that would make my life complete, but I didn't know what it was. It felt as if I would never know what it was. It felt as if I was going to spend the rest of  my life, miserable, empty, alone and just wanting to do one thing so badly, but not knowing what that one thing was.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp That was when I decided to end it. To end it all.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp My plan was, at exactly 8:16:59 I was going to fall in the road in front of my bus stop, one second later, that bus would smash me into oblivion.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I made this plan sitting at my crappy desk, working my @#%$ job, talking to my @#%$ manager about the Henderson account. I realized that I would finally be able to end it, finally be free, and I started to smile. It seemed disconcerting for my boss, I don't think he had ever seen me smile before. He mumbled something about having to call a client and left quite quickly after that. I spent the rest of the day playing games. I figured why bother working when you're going to die the next day. Some might argue that's the best time to work, because you'll never get a chance to finish what your doing otherwise. I couldn't think of anything I had to do that had any importance what-so-ever, or anything I had ever done that would have had any real impact had it been finished or not. So I played games all afternoon until going home.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp At least I could go back in time without having any impact on history.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp When I got home I thought about trying to get laid one last time, but decided it wasn't worth the effort and masturbated while watching a phone sex commercial instead.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp @#%$ my life is pathetic.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp After cleaning myself up I ordered in a pizza and gave the pizza guy a healthy two hundred dollar tip. I sure wasn't going to need the money. That night I got drunk one last time, and knew in the morning I would wish I hadn't. I then decided to watch TV one last time, and immediately wished I hadn't. What I saw was Limp Bizkit winning for best group, 'Nsync singing the national anthem at the Olympics, and some news announcer talking about how people were eagerly awaiting the premier of the new Survivor series. I thought to myself how if this is how the world is turning out, I wish I had thought of this bus thing sooner.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Horrible, Horrible people.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The next morning I woke up, as expected, with a hangover. I still woke up at 7:15 though. Still listened to Parabola. Still got into my shower at 7:21. Still got changed after drying off: One pair black pants, one white long sleeved dress shirt, One blue power tie and one pair black leather shoes, shined to perfection over my dark gray socks. I missed trimming my hair though, I wanted to shave off a few seconds. At 7:45:47 I had my usual breakfast and was out the door chewing my espresso beans nine seconds early. I had a few breath mints while taking the walk to my bus stop. I got there at 8:13 as usual, I guess I must have walked a bit slower then normal, probably the wind resistance caused by not having properly trimmed facial hair. I waited until I saw the bus coming around the corner. I held my breath and looked around at the blank, emotionless faces around me. These were all helpful productive little worker drones, getting ready to contribute to the status quo. I wondered if any of them would ever consider what I was doing, or realize that it was a step they all should have taken years ago. I didn't have much time to think though because 5 seconds later I fell forwards just in time to have 5 tons of metal crash into me sending me flying. Then everything was black.<br>
<br>
Chapter 3<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp My eyes opened to a bright light, I quickly shut my eyes with the pain.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I tried opening them again and this time my eyes had adjusted to the brightness, so it was now physically possible. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It hurt to move, so I contented myself with staring at the celling. I managed to croak out 'Is this heaven'<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Nope,&quot; was what I heard from my left.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 'Is this Hell?' I asked.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Much worse,&quot; was the responce, &quot;You're still alive&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp After much grunting, groaning, stiffness and general, all-round discomfert I managed to turn myself onto my side to see whom I was talking to. On the bed across a small gap in which a Nurse coul fiddle with you comfortably I saw him. There he was, lying on top on his sheets, proped up with 3 pillows, a copy of Nietzsche's &quot;Beyond Good and Evil&quot; in his hands. There he was, with his black spiked hair, 3 inches in length, twirling off in random directions, and flattened in the back due to the pillows. There he was, with his tanned, well muscled body, with not a visible scrap of fat on him. There he was, with his ice blue eyes. There he was, sitting across from me, looking at me with the hint of a smile, flitting at his lips.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I was wondering when you were going to wake up&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 'What happened?' was all I could think of to say.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;You my friend, were hit by a bus, just fell right in front of it acording to witnesses. What a horrible . . . 'accident' that was. The reason you're still alive is you forgot that when the bus was coming to it's stop it would be slowing down, thus you were knocked out for a bit, but all your injuries were mainly bumps and bruises&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He must have seen the confused look on my face because he continued with.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;The doctors were talking about it while you were asleep&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I was quite stunned to say the least. Also I was rather dissapointed. Not only with the fact that I was still alive, but with myself for forgetting that the bus would be slowing down. I didn't have much time to think about it though for it was then that the nurse came in.<br>
 <p><p>i gave myself away
now i'm nothing<br>
i let it slip away
now i'm nothing<br>
all that i can do
is break myself in two<br>
i f***ed it all up
now i'm nothing<br>

The character is not the average 'I'm gonna kill myself' type character. This one has depth, emotion, contradicting thoughts and the like. The story is interesting as well for it seems to revolve around the sleep/no sleep idea. <br>

I believe he was considered quite sane.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uthebraneatingzombie.showPublicProfile?language=EN>The Bran Eating Zombie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(3/4/02 3:43:01 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=532.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.ohgr.com/lo_mages/lo_top_mouth.jpg length=130 width=130></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Start of story</span><hr size=1> Thanks, I didin't think I was crazy, but others seemed too.<br>
