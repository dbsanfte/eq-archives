He'd been there since he could remember, and he would soon turn eighteen, the age at which boys coming of age must venture out into the unmarked territories to prove themselves worthy of manhood.  If they could travel to the great mountains, retrieve a scale from the hide of morgan, a red dragon who protects the great mountains.  Then, if they can survive the journey back, they will be praised as men.  Arol thought back to the last fall, when the last boys went on their journey.  Only two made it back.  He was afraid, but knew he must go on the journey, those who refused were hanged in front of the town, and he did not want that.  &quot;Arol!&quot;  He was quickly jolted from his thoughts by the shouts of his mother, Feron.  &quot;Arol come to bed!&quot;  Arol ran down the grassy hill toward his house.  He would worry about the future when it came. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/unitetimeweirdo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>nitetimeweirdo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Fresh Meat</span><br> <font color=#336699>(2/20/02 9:12:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=512.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.liquid2k.net/nitetimehero/cheese.jpg height=120 width=120></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: nice</span><hr size=1> The next day, Arol left early.  He didn't want to keep the town's best metal worker, Jin, waiting.  Being a friend of the family, he offered to help Arol make a weapon, and teach him to use it.  His excitement was building, as he rounded the corner of Industrial Street, running right into an open door.  Out walked his best friend Chise.  &quot;Ouch, you ok.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah, you ready to work today?&quot; asked Arol.  Some how the 16 year old had conned Jin into helping him as well.  <br>
<br>
Chise was about 5'11&quot; with short, clean brown hair and a commanding presence.  Chise was the kind of person who liked to be in control, almost a perfectionist at times.  He couln't wait to be considered a man, even knowing what danger lay ahead.  He was leaving with Arol, a year early.  Besides, he had been trained in his grandfather's dojo.  Mastering his art at a very young age, no one in the town would stop him.   <br>
<br>
&quot;Let's get going.  Jin won't be happy If were Late.&quot;       <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uascendedbob.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ascended Bob</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(2/22/02 7:01:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=512.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: nice</span><hr size=1>      Arol noticed that Chise was trying hard to contain laughter. &quot;Whats so funny?&quot; he asked, trying to look stern though he realized the humor of the situation.<br>
     &quot;Nothing, lets go,&quot; said Chise.<br>
     The trip to Jin's was much less interesting than they thought it would be, and eneded up being much more work than they cared to spend that day. the afternoon, though, brought a surprise that neither had expected.<br>
     The village mayor stood atop his podium in the center of town. If anything required such measures to get attention in a town so small, you could be sure that it was important.<br>
     &quot;Though we may trimuph over man and beast. The most holy forces of nature are none to be reckoned with. There will be no hunt for the great dragon this day, for a storm in nigh and we must prepare.<br>
     The two looked to the sky to see what tidings it brought of this and saw only blue. &quot;What could he mean?&quot; asked Chise, youthful vigor angered at the thought of being smitten. &quot;We have to go. This is a test of manhood, not some silly custom. We need to do this.&quot; At that he left Arol standing in the street, half releived that he could breathe another day as a child, half anxious for him to start his real life.<br>
     He walked home, still noticing nothing odd with the weather. It was then that he saw Chise, loaded with as many weapons as he could carry.<br>
     Chise was a fearsome foe, unassailabe to all who crossed him but, Arol could not help but wonder what all of the weapons were for. <br>
     He approached Chise. &quot;Where are you going,&quot; he asked, wary of the look of determination on Chise's face. He knew that anything Chise was planning he would not be talked out of but feeling that he should at least try.<br>
     &quot;I'm going for it Arol. I am going to get a scale from that beast or die trying.&quot;<br>
     &quot;Chise, you are still a year from being of age to even attempt this. I do not even know why you want to go so early.&quot; Arol watched the unchanging countenance of his friend.<br>
     &quot;I want to. I need to prove myself to. . . well, myself,&quot; replied Chise as he continued on the path leading out of the village, with Arol close behind. &quot;Ther won't be any storm,&quot; he said. &quot;Just look at the sky.&quot;<br>
     Just then a grey started creeping around the horizon.<br>

<br>
&quot;Look, it's not so bad.  We can just leave after the storm ends.  You'll have you're shot soon enough.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No, I'm still going.&quot;  His look of determination changing to a smile.  Lightning flashed, followed by the boom of thunder.  &quot;Heh, that which is dangerous to us must also be dangerous to the beast!  It' s the perfect time to go.&quot;  He retrieved the the star and started walking swiftly down the street.<br>
<br>
&quot;Wait, Chise you can't...&quot;  Chise turned around.  Anger beginning to show.<br>
<br>
&quot;Look, either get your stuff, or head home.  If you aren't a man yet, fine.  This is something I have to do.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Like I was saying, You can't go without supplies.  The food is at my place.&quot;    <br>

They walked to his house watching people scurrying like ants in the presence of such tidings as this storm. Boards were being put up and horses let loose. &quot;Wait,&quot; Arol said while stopping abruptly. &quot;Chise you have to go to my house by yourself.&quot;<br>
     &quot;What?&quot; asked Chise. &quot;What for? What will I tell your mother.?&quot;<br>
     &quot;The supplies are in the shed in the back so my mother will never even see you. Now give me the weapons and go.&quot; Arol took the heavy bag and slung it over his shoulder. &quot;Meet me at the Southern Pass and we will make way to the mountains, and hurry!&quot;<br>
     Chise was curious and a bit taken back but, Arol <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> was</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> older so he did as he was told. When he got to the small stream that ran through the northern part of the village and right in front of Arol's house he slowed his pace and looked for any sight of Feron.<br>
     Arol's mother was going about as if nothing were wrong. The miller who lived next door, though, was assisting in ever way that he could. <br>
     &quot;Now's the time,&quot; he thought. Chise snuck slowly through the brush until he was where he needed to be. Hopefully he could leave undetected as well. Finding the food that Arol spoke of was not so easy. This was because there was no food anywhere in the shed.<br>
     &quot;Feron where should I put these bags?&quot; he heard coming from the front of the house.<br>
     &quot;Oh great,&quot; he thought. &quot;They've moved all the damn food. What the hell am I. . .&quot; He stopped dead mid-sentence. Arols mother was walking around the corner of the house and straight for the shed. &quot;What am I going to do.&quot;<br>
     &quot;Oh just lay them in the kitchen,&quot; replied Arol's mother to the miller's question.&quot; She then walked into the shed. &quot;What in the world. . .&quot; She picked up the peices of a shredded broom. &quot;I just made this thing,&quot; she said. &quot;I wonder what happened?&quot; <br>
     Chise was not around for any of this. He'd taken the the small moment that her head was turned to jump out the small shed window and into Arol's room. &quot;Thank Gelendar that was close,&quot; he said while breathing hardly. He slumped down under the window to catch his breath and noticed that the kitchen was right out the door of this very room.<br>
     &quot;Do I dare?&quot; he asked with a smile. That very smile could send chills through the boldest of men. The youth that is Chise is never one to be timid. &quot;He grabbed a bad of food and was out the same way he came in.<br>
     Arol stood at the Southern Pass. Chlenching his cloak tighter against his body to ward off the chill that came with the cooling winds. His teeth were clenched as were his fists. Chise saw that he no longer carried the weapons and immediately asked after them.<br>
     &quot;Where is our gear?&quot; he asked in a somewhat irritated tone. &quot;You don't know what I went through to get this,&quot; he said, dropping the sack of rifled goods. &quot;If you think that you hiding the weapons is going to keep me from leaving  you're wrong.&quot;<br>
     &quot;Calm down Chise. They are in the cave up the road a bit.&quot;<br>
     &quot;Oh,&quot; Chise felt ashamed of his accusing tone.&quot;Sorry.&quot;<br>
     &quot;Forget it lets just go.&quot;<br>
     As they walked along, the road began to get more rocky. They were leaving the flatter lands and headed into the mountains. It would be a short journey with only a few villages, even smaller that their own to pass through. Chise tuned to Arol, &quot;By the way, what were you doing while I risked life, limb, and capture by your mother?&quot;<br>
     &quot;You'll see,&quot; said Arol. With that he veered off the path a bit. &quot;Come on the weapons are this way.&quot;<br>
     As they approachesd a small space between two hills. Chise noticed the weapons on the ground and &quot;Horses?&quot; he asked, giddy with disbeleif and glee. &quot;Now we won't have to walk.&quot;<br>
     &quot;Well, when the end of the storm comes there will be a few people wondering what happened to their horses,&quot; said Arol.<br>
     &quot;Hah, I thought I'd be the one to do something like that,&quot; said Chise. <br>
     With that they saddled up and prepared to take off.  <br>

It would be hard going, but the closest town was a mere 6 miles away.  They rode hard, not talking, concentrating on keeping the horses under control and the road in front of them.<br>
<br>
They had traveled just over two miles when the sun began to creep behind the horizen.  The raine had not let up, and lightning could still be seen, although, not as frequently.  (Storms in there part of the world were known to last weeks, sometimes even months.)<br>
<br>
&quot;We'd better find shelter.  The horses need rest.&quot; suggested Arol.<br>
<br>
&quot;Looks like the trees get thicker over there.  Maybe if we can find a dryer spot...&quot;  Chise let his word hang, searching with hs eyes.  &quot;There!&quot;  <br>
<br>
They moved to the spot.  It was dryer than one would expect and big enough for the horses and the two adventurers.  They moved to set up camp.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showPrevMessage?topicID=512.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showNextMessage?topicID=512.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=512.topic&index=5><img src=http://www.polykarbon.com/bbsimage/addreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.emailToFriend?topicID=512.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.threadControl?topicID=512.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=512.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=512.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub25.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="polykarbonbbsfrm18">PK-BBS Rules and Regulations!<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm27">Board F.A.Q.s<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm3">News and Updates<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm2">Photoshop and Art questions<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm4">General Manga/Anime Discussion<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm5">Japanese Language Help<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm23">art in progress<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm13">Black and White Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm14">Color Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm19">Member's Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm17">Moderators Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm6">Member Photos<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm31">Help, Hints and Cheats<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm20">Challenges<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm21">Matches<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm26">Writer's Forum<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm32">VG Discussion<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm33">PolyKarbon CCG<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm35">Member Created Tutorials<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm36">Best Tutorials</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#336699>- </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs>Polykarbon BBS</a><font color=#336699> - </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26>Writer's Forum</a> <font color=#336699> - </font><a href="http://www.polykarbon.com">Polykarbon: Manga & Photoshop</a><font color=#336699> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM ARTS AD SCRIPT -->
