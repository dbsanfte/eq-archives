Sam and the Raiders<br>
<br>
Sam took a look for the last time at his hometown Broken Hills, that had been very precious to him, but the losing of his family had been a too big loss for him, so he had to let go of his past, by giving his home and everything away. Now he's gonna start his great journey to south, the endless desert, towards a city that was once known as Reno...<br>
Sam used a moment at thinking on his chilhood, and looking at the places he used to play, and  started walking towards his friends that had had since he was a child and he said: &quot;Everything is gone now and there is a long way to go, let's move out...&quot; His party wandered throught the wasteland for days, hoping to get somewhere. The night started to fall on that faithful evening, that definetly would change Sam's life. Sam and his party decided to stay for night at a loose canyon rock, because there was water, gathered in a small hole. they didn't know where it had come from, but it sure wasn't bad either. Sam was on he's nightwatch turn, when suddenly he started seeing strange flashes in the horizon and he pulled up he Desert Eagle. He woke up he's friends and they started to sneak towards these strange flashes.<br>
On a ridge, they saw a caravan attacked by a bunch of raiders, they had a dog with them, that was loyal to it's masters, and usually acted with the name, 'Muffe'. Muffe got a feeling of someone watching at it and the raiders. It looked scared, and in a moment it started to shake and whine calm and silently. Sam and his friends tried to hide, but too late. The dog started to bark very roughly, and then one of the raiders, a big, stupid one shouted: &quot;Hey, I think there's sumthin... SHEWT 'EM!! They could be spies!&quot; Another raider responded: &quot;Let's not waste ammo, take Muffe and go check it out. Maybe it's just a loose Brahmin... In that case we could use a new cattle for our wagons, since the old one is starting to get tired on our way.&quot; ... &quot;Awwkay!&quot; The big raider answered.<br>
<br>
Sam and his friends noticed soon, that they had been seen. Sam acted fast, and drew his Desert Eagle, and started shooting at the villains. He's friends, Lil' Mike and Usuck followed his actions, and started spraying wildly with their sub-machine guns.<br>
The raider which was holding Muffe, let the dog loose and shouted hard: &quot;Sonuvabitch!!! They're fuckin humen! Shewt 'em, Shewt 'em all! SHEWT 'EM GODDAMNIT!!!!&quot;. The raider behind him, started shouting at the others, and started shooting at Sam and his friends. The big raider was already preparing on a grenade, when Muffe ran to the battlefield. The raider threw the grenade high to the air, and for a some sort of twist of fate, Muffe thought that it was a toy, and cought the grenade. Muffe started running towards the raider excited, and a moment after that, the dog disappeared into the air along with a big ol' explosion. Luckily, Sam and his friends were behind the loose canyon rock, and they were safe from the explosion.<br>
A little later, Sam and his friends started hearing a sound of a dog crying, and they saw Muffe lying on the ground. It had survived of the explosion, but it was badly injured... The raiders looked back, and saw the caravan they had attacked, it had fleed while the raiders were fighting Sam's party. One of the Raiders ran to help Muffe, but then, Lil' Mike felt bad, and started to yell and he ran to the battlefield. Sam tried shouted him to stop, but Mike ignored him, because he was so focused on the moment. He ran towards the raiders with a sledgehammer and accidentally he blew up a explosive crate, that triggered a chainreaction. Two of the raiders' vehicles blew into the air as a big fireball, and a hot piece of metal flew directly into Mike's foot. He yelled because of the pain. The raiders started to retreat, while shooting at Sam, they thought that Mike and Muffe had been killed in combat, and the left. Mike tried to crawl to Muffe, even when the piece of metal had gone throught his muscle. When Mike got just to the dog, he fainted. The raiders had already fleed a long way, and Sam and Usuck left their cover, and went to the battlefield to help Mike.<br>
<br>
When Mike woke up, he felt that his face were being licked by the warm and soft tongue of Muffe, and he noticed that the metalobject from his foot were removed. &quot;We saved the dog, and we found some water and medical supplies from the stuff, the raiders left behind...&quot; Sam explained. &quot;Who were they?&quot; Usuck thought, while he scratched he's hairy nipple that was sticking out of a hole in his filthy T-shirt. The dog had just a little fragmentation in it's belly, and we got it pulled out, would you like some eggs by the way?&quot; Usuck explained. The dog seemed calm, and Sam gave it a piece of a meat jerky. Mike wanted some too and said: &quot;You get pretty hungry while fighting... don't you think, dog?&quot; Muffe bent it's head confused. Usuck noticed a small, rusty, metal plate on the dog's collar. Usuck tried to read the text on it. &quot;Muffe.&quot; &quot;Is that your name?&quot; Sam asked. The dog was licking at it's filthy paws... At the meal, they started hearing the sound of motors and they started to look around. They noticed a big dust cloud in the north, that was coming closer. The cloud was moving fast, and the friends noticed a Vault-City flag on one of the vehicles, and a big, strong looking man sitting proudly on one of the vehicles. The friends didn't expect this civilized people, such long way from their home, but help could be useful. Usuck was waving his had already. The car with the strong man stopped infront of the party, and the man jumped away from the car... He said: &quot;You're all under fuckin' arrest!&quot; He was waving his Assault Rifle towards the car.<br>

Well here goes:<br>
In Hell, Satan and his legions are taking the souls of serial killers, rapists, thieves etc.. and putting them into<br>
mechanically enhanced bodies.these are called THE DAMNED.<br>
   The main character is a young man by the name of Zenith<br>
Nadir. His family's souls were taken by Satan. Zenith wants to put them to rest.<br>
Later on in the story Zenith meets a robot inhabited by a demon who wants to rid Hell of Satan. This Robot/Demon's<br>
name is Daimonikos (Greek for Demon).<br>
 at each corner of the world are rifts where Satan's demons <br>
can appear along with THE DAMNED.<br>
<br>
