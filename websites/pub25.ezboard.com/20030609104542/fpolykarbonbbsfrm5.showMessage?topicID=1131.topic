<br>
 I speak japanese fluently (well almost just need to pronounce my vowels a bit better).  My grandmother who is a native from Japan taught me japanese when i was just a baby (im 12 now) she told me stories of how it was, and about festivals and all sorts of things she did when she was there. but back to the point ya i speak japanese i know hiragana and katakana about 1000 kanji characters, vocabulary etc. i celebrate all their holidays and all western holidays (imagine how many days of school i missed <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) and follow most traditions, and i also no ALOT OF JAPANESE HISTORY and GEOGRAPHY. <br>
<br>
 ! wanna go to Japan so badly and be like welcomed there.  but the thing is...  my grandmother is japanese and my grandfather is black, their daughter (my mom) was japanese/back and she married a black man (my father) so the makes me a quater japanese and 3 quarters black so as you can imagine by what i said im black skinned. the question is do you think that i would automatically be treated like i know absoullutely nothing about japan when i step foot there and every where i go people will automatically speak broken english to me??? i knoe theres alot of discrimination there but is it worse for the blacks???  <br>

Don't be too nervous about it.<br>
When spoken to in other language than Japanese, you have only to say &quot;nihongo de douzo!&quot;. <br>
People would feel much happier if they find you speak Japanese fluently.<br>
There would be no much difficulty for your getting about there. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=aohjpn>aohjpn</A> at: 6/1/03 1:32:30 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sethness>SethNess</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pre-Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(6/8/03 6:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1131.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Just asking a question</span><hr size=1> Hi !<br>
I'm an American, living in Hiroshima for a few years now, and I have quite a few friends here of all colors, so I think I'll be able to answer a few of your questions based on personal experience.<br>
<br>
Problem is... you've got SO MANY questions there, fellah !<br>
<br>
I'll answer as many as I can remember. *wink*<br>
<br>
1) Will people talk to you in broken English ?  Yes, absolutely, positively, all strangers will try to talk to you in English.  It's natural...a) you look Gaijin, and b) Japanese are accustomed to paying major $ for the chance to try-out their English, and their social standing goes up considerably when their friends see them chatting in English, so they'll be eager to try-out their English on you.<br>
<br>
Cute story:  My friends are an American-looking girl, who speaks Japanese perfectly, and her Japanese-looking boyfriend, who can't speak a word of the language.  When they visited Japan, people kept facing HIM and ignoring HER, even though she's the better speaker.  Drove them nuts.... laughing. ;-)<br>
<br>
2)  Gaijin is chic, Gaijin is cool.  This is a country where the ads are all full of Gaijin-looking people looking cool, so you get to reap the full benefits of all that advertising.  Yeee-haaaaa !<br>
<br>
Being 3/4 black is only slightly more inhibiting, socially, than being any flavor of Gaijin.  It's not bad at all.  You'll find that Gaijins have no problem getting dates, although its' a bit harder to convince the parents that it's OK to for their kids to marry a gaijin.  (This is only partly racism.... the other part is, if you get bored with Japan, you'll end up moving away from Japan, with these people's daughter/son.  They'd rather have their kids close to home, and you can't blame them for playing the percentages, there.)<br>
<br>
You'll find that many people will want to date you just to practice their English for free... which kinda sux, if you're bothered by that.  (*I* am.)<br>
<br>
2)<br>
Fair or not, in Japan, black gaijins have a reputation for being extra-nice to their girlfriends, and extra-macho/handsome, so you'll find that sometimes, the color of your skin will actually be a plus....soem girls will seek you out, just based on your being black-ish.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, yeah, there IS a fair amount of racism aimed at blacks and whites, here in Japan, so your girl/boyfriend may not want to introduce you to their parents.<br>
<br>
Cute story:  Hell, this is true in America, too.<br>
I'm white, and my sister dated a black guy all through her highschool years, but never felt comfortable telling anyone in the family that she had a boyfriend.  I feel like I missed a big part of her life, just because she was afraid that someone in the house might be racist.<br>
<br>
Do you LOOK very very gaijin, or do you look a little Japanese ?  If you don't look Japanese, but speak Japanese extremely well, and are halfway good-looking, you'll find yourself bombarded with offers to go on TV, visit schools &amp; talk about your home country, yada yada yada.  Fun, fun, fun !<br>
<br>
Cute story:<br>
You'll find that some of your friends will ask you to PRETEND that you can't speak Japanese, as a practical joke aimed at people they introduce to you.  This is half joke, half them-boosting-their-prestige-by-talking-in-English.<br>
<br>
You'll find that people will seek you out, just because you're gaijin, and that's interesting.  This is pretty universal.  <br>
I've been here about 2 years, and haven't heard a racist comment yet, though I read about a bath-house that got sued for not allowing Gaijins in.  So, I'd say you're gonna have a good time.<br>
<br>
Last cute story:<br>
I know two happily-married black+Japanese couples...and everyone oohs and ahhhhs over their kids.  I can also think of at least 1 TV personality who's a half-black girl.<br>
<br>
So, I'd say offhand that you'll have alot of fun and happiness, here in Japan.  C'mon over ! *grin* <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=maimaipanda>maimaipanda</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Resident Panda</span><br> <font color=#336699>(6/8/03 1:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1131.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.sit.wisc.edu/~mamiller2/temp/pandatea.jpg height=146 width=130></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Just asking a question</span><hr size=1> I came across this thread on one of the BD forums which I thought might be of interest to you.

as an aside, i can confirm what a lot of the posters are mentioning about nigerians in japan - i can't count the number of times i've been accosted by nigerians/ethiopians/etc. swearing up and down that they're american and trying to drag you into their stores/hit on your female friends, etc.  unfortunately, you will have to contend with everyone lumping all blacks together - i had a friend from NY (who happened to be black) whom i lived with for a bit in osaka and he absolutely <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>hated</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> the crap he would have to deal with as a result of the brazen actions of such individuals.<br>
<br>
on the other hand, as seth said, being black does open up a certain demographic of individuals to you (just as being a marine does, etc.) who preferentially seek the company of dark skinned individuals for a variety of reasons, which I will leave you to discern for yourself.  However, I should have to say from my own personal experience, that you will have a much easier go of it in the big urban areas as opposed to being way out in the inaka. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-size:xx-small;">Mamonaku. 11ban sen ni  Panda densha ga mairimasu. </span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> <!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--> <!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-size:xx-small;">Abunai desu kara, kiiro no sen no uchigawa made osagarikudasai.</span><!--EZCODE FONT END-->  </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
