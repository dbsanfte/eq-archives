So far I've only studied Romanji and I've memorized about 200 words in the one month I've been studying. On top of my knowledge of words from being a long time anime/manga fan, my vocabulary peaks at about 400-500 words at the moment. On a side note, I would have began earlier, but I needed foreign language credits for my HS, so I took spanish....what I crap language <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   , it kept me from starting Japanese. Anyway, I just began work on learning to conjugate -ru verbs. Anyway, I'll get to the questions now....<br>
<br>
1.) Is there any secret to picking out words spoken, (really fast like), by native japanese people? Not fast like Cheetah is if you've ever seen Scyed, but I've found it more than extremely difficult to pick out verbs and adjectives. Nouns aren't so difficult (maybe because they're pretty linear?). So, what's the secret there?<br>
<br>
2.) After reviewing some of the older posts I cam across one topic that said that learning romanji first can complicate matters later on. What becomes complicated?<br>
<br>
3.) When should I begin learning Kana and/or Kanji in my studies? Before I learn more about conjugation of verbs? Or after I learn to conjugate most verbs effectively?<br>
<br>
4.) Are there any sites that anyone knows of that offer printable practice tables for kana? I've looked before, but I can't seem to find any.<br>
<br>
5.) What utensil should I use to learn both kana and kanji? Calligraphy pen? Pencil? Ballpoint pen?<br>
<br>
6.) Has anyone ever used the &quot;tape recorded vocab-learn by sleeping&quot; method?<br>
<br>
7.) How many words a day, (week, month) did you study?<br>
<br>
8.) Does learning Kana and recognizing the individual sounds make learning new words easy? Kind of like kanji...ko=child and inu=dog, so koinu=puppy (I think that's right). For instance does knowing the hiragana or katakana for su make learning a word such as atsumi easier?<br>
<br>
9.) How long would it take to become conversational if one studies about 1-2 hours a day? I know everyone is different, but I guess a better question would be How much and long did you study before you became conversational?<br>
<br>
Phew, outta breath <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :x --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/sick.gif ALT=":x"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  . Wow, sorry for that mega barrage of random questions, some I should have grouped together, but I really needed to get those off my chest to be able to continue studying. I'd really appreciate any input even if you can't answer every question. Also, forgive me if I said something already answered in any of the other topics on this board, I looked through most of them.<br>
<br>

The best advice I can give on picking out words in a sentence is to expand your vocabulary.  Words are a lot easier to pick out in quick speech once you know them.  Also, if you can pick out nouns, adjectives will come before nows and will end with -i or they will have na between themselves and the noun (kawai<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>i</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> neko, shizuka <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>na</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> kurasu).  &quot;Kawaii&quot; and &quot;shizuka&quot; are the adjectives.  Verbs come at the end of a sentence and end in -ru or one of the many conjugations, which you will learn.<br>
<br>
2.  I wouldn't say learning romanji first complicates things but learn kana, which I will address next.<br>
<br>
3.  Learn kana as quickly as possible.  Especially hiragana.  Katakana can wait for a while.  It helps immensely with conjugating verbs and adjectives.  Especially adjectives.  You'll be able to remember that adjectives that end in -shi aren't -i adjectives but ones that end in -shii are.  Kanji can wait since you've just started learning, but you seem to have a pretty good vocabulary so far.  When learning kanji learn it just for the words that you already know.  Once you start learning new words, learn them along with the kanji.  This helps to expand your vocab and your knowledge of kanji.<br>
<br>
4.  I'm not quite sure what you mean but I haven't seen anything that you mentioned.  I learned hiragana by writing out the table for it, then quizzing myself by picking words out of the dictionary and writing them.<br>
<br>
5.  You can use anything really, but the best thing I've done for helping me learn to write kanji is a whiteboard and dry markers.  They're wonderful!  Very easy to write with and they don't tire you out.  Also remember that stroke order is important when writing kana/kanji.<br>
<br>
6.  Never have.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
7.  When I was in class I'd say we learned about 15 new words a week.<br>
<br>
8.  I wouldn't say learning kana helps you to remember the words so much.  Kanji definately does.<br>
<br>
9.  Heh, I have no idea since I'm not even conversational yet.  I've taken Japanese I and II and am starting Conversational Japanese I in a few weeks so I'll let you know how things turn out.  <br>
<br>
10(kinda).  スコット   I believe that's right but I may be wrong since I'm not the best at kanatizing things.  It definately ends in ット　though.<br>

<br>
I started with a private tutor who actually taught me hiragana/katakana without studying in romanji (I tell ya, that was a weird first few weeks), but I think it was extremely helpful.  I found that looking at Japanese characters became like reading English very quick (As in, speed and ease of recognization of words I knew).  Yes, the less time you spend on romanji the better, I say.  A private tutor, while expensive, realllly helps you learn rather quickly.  Later, I took Japanese in high school (Though technically I was past grade 12 level) and I'd say it was taught quite badly.  The only time we practiced conversation was in dialogues that we prepared and rehearsed before performing for the class.  Also, I learned about 20-30 words a week with a private tutor, and only about 10/week in high school.  Somehow, the 20-30 words with the tutor didn't feel any more difficult to learn.  There was a vast difference in the amount of words and material I learned via tutor.  However, college Japanese seems to be taught much better (At least where I went XD  ...  But then, I've only taken Intermediate Japanese II in college so far...  Whatever that means).  There's much more of a focus on practical Japanese, TONS of conversational practice.  Also, private tutors and college classes tend to teach you more about the culture, too, which is quite useful if you ever plan on visiting Japan.  So in summary!  Highschool:Bad, Tutor/College:Good!!<br>
<br>
If I had to estimate about how long it takes to be decent in basic conversations with native speakers...  I'd say *around* a year if you practice conversation with someone alot while learning vocab/etc.  Often, the major issue in a conversational crisis can be just not knowing one word or two. =T.T=<br>
<br>
As for picking out words with fast Japanese...  Koji's definately right, just knowing the words well is the easiest way...  And knowing how sentence structure usually goes, too (Like he was saying about the adjective:noun:verb).  Although, truth to be told, if you're watching anime and trying to understand, it can be difficult for awhile.  Especially since pretty much everyone starts learning the regular polite form of speech (&quot;Teineigo&quot;/&quot;Teichougo&quot; : Noun-desu, Verbs end with masu) and lots of anime characters speak plain form (Verbs ending in &quot;ru/u&quot;: Imasu to iru) and slang.  Then *some* will even speak the super polite form depending.  The degree of honorific speech changes ALOT depending on who you're talking to. =*^___^*=<br>
<br>
The tool you use to learn kana/kanji doesn't really matter unless you're going to practice calligraphy too. =^__^=  In which case, brush + ink is the way to go!<br>
<br>
And...  Never tried those tapes you listen to while you sleep, but, you never know. =^__^=<br>
<br>
Oh yish, and I believe the guy you're referring to in Scryed was named Cougar. XD<br>
<br>
And emm...  Everything stated above is from my personal experience, learning languages tends to be quite different from person to person (And with high schools/colleges, varies loooots!).  However, Japanese is a really fun language to learn and Japan is REALLLLLY fun to visit, so, keep it up! =^___^=<br>
<br>

<br>
Also, my only problem is definetly the fact that NONE of the schools in South Florida that I know of offer a Japanese course. I blame the overabundant influx of illegal immigrants making spanish a basic necessity. The only place I can think of offering Japanese is FAU, and if you've heard of Florida State Universty, then you know it's a nationally (for lack of a better term) uber <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .

no problem.<br>
It's a hell of alot easier than it'd be in English, because the patterns are really repetitive in Japanese.<br>
<br>
Here are the hints:<br>
<br>
Nouns are followed by &quot;wa&quot; (written with the hiragana symbol for HA)<br>
 or &quot;o&quot; (written as the hiragana symbol for WO) <br>
or &quot;de&quot; <br>
or &quot;ni&quot; <br>
or &quot;ga&quot; <br>
or &quot;no&quot;.<br>
These short, one-syllable words are called &quot;particles&quot;, and they're easy to learn.  Some of them are &quot;post-positions&quot;, which are like English PREPOSITIONS, except they come AFTER the noun... so, in Japanese, &quot;at home on the sofa&quot; would be written &quot;home at sofa on&quot;).<br>
Learn them well, and they'll help you understand what part of the sentence the noun is playing.<br>
For example, &quot;I paint your car in my garage&quot; would be written like this <br>
(I) ha (you) no (car) wo (I) no (garage) de (paint).<br>
<br>
---<br>
Next tip:  All adjectives end in -II (&quot;eeee&quot; sound) or &quot;-kunai&quot;, meaning not-whatever.  So, for example, OLD would be furu-II, but not-old would be furu-KUNAI.<br>
<br>
---<br>
Last tip:<br>
Verbs have a dictionary form, that ends in -U,<br>
or a regular-politeness-form, that ends in -MASu.<br>
Try to memorize the -MASu forms, because those are the ones you'll actually use when you're talking to people.<br>
<br>
Here's a quick listing of the -MASu endings, and what they mean.  I'll use the example of the very common word &quot;suru&quot;, meaning &quot;do&quot;:<br>
<br>
SHImasu = do.<br>
SHImasuka = do ?<br>
SHImasen = don't<br>
SHImasenka = don't ?<br>
SHImashita = did<br>
SHImashitaka = did ?<br>
SHImasen deshita = didn't<br>
SHItai = want to do<br>
SHIMashou = shall we do<br>
<br>
Or, the verb &quot;kau&quot;, meaning &quot;buy&quot;:<br>
<br>
KAImasu = buy<br>
KAImasen = don't buy<br>
KAImashita = bought<br>
KAImasen deshita = didn't buy<br>
<br>
If you can recognise these verb endings, you can get a good handle on what's happening in the sentence.<br>
The really really GOOD news is, all the things I mentioned above are written in HIRAGANA, which is easy to learn.<br>
<br>
You can see a decent table for learning Hiragana and Katakana, by the way, at my website at www.kgwagner.com/hiragana1.html<br>
(It's a site to help you REMEMBER the shapes, not to WRITE them.)<br>
<br>
and you can get a copy-able table of hiragana and katakana from almost any textbook or dictionary.  Just xerox-copy the table, blow it up to some really nice, big size, and throw some tracing paper or cheap, thin paper over the top of it.  Start copying !<br>
