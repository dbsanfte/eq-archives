<br>
Honestly i didnt read it all. Infact I only rad about the first five lines but the part i read was cool.<br>
<br>
I also like the charachter designs, espessially the funky tatoos on the guys face. the outfits look really snappy aswell.<br>
<br>
Do you mind if i make a page of comic from a bit of the story as practice for me.<br>
<br>
I will post it here and in the B&amp;W Art forum if I do.<br>

A good thing to remember is that a Manga can be broken up into 5 levels...you have a <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> series</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> which is the big overall continuum of the comic.  A series consists of one or more <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> stories</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  Each of these stories can span across one or more <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> books</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> with each book having many <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> pages</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  Each page will have one or more <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> panels</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> used to tell the tale (and if you want to get really nitpicky, I use <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> scenes</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> as well which is the term I use for a series of panels that make up an event in the story...most scenes occur on a single page, but some can span multiple pages).  When writing a script, it's helpful to identify how your stories break down...do I want this story to be one book or three?  How many pages do i want in the book(s)?  What part of my story do I want on each page and how many panels should I use to detail that scene?  Now when you think about it like that, you can see where you'd want your script to reflect this.  So you could start off with page one, give general notes for the page, list of characters and such.  Then you'd do one panel at a time (describe the background/locale/actions, give character dialogue and if you really want to get picky, you could even provide sound effects that you'd like to see in the panel).  Of course, this is getting a lot of detail into it...if you're working with an artist who is great at developing panels, then just break it down to the page level and let them have at it.  Just remember, the story is your vision, so if you know exactly what you want it to look like, make sure the artist knows (even if that artist is you, it's always good to jot down how you envisioned it, so it's easier to remember later on).  Anyways, just some helpful tips to think about on actual scripting.  In fact, here are some links that might be helpful.<br>
<br>
Here is a link to the WizardWold.com Writing School where some people have written scripts and had them critiqued by professional comic editors/writers.  It gives some good samples to work from:  <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.wizardschool.com/wizschool/wswriting.html">www.wizardschool.com/wizs...iting.html</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
A good article by Warren Ellis on writing comics (which describes different styles of scripting...and if you look in the Writing link on the sidebar, you'll see more samples of scripts): <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.warrenellis.com/writcom.htm">www.warrenellis.com/writcom.htm</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> <br>

I guess I should have used the word &quot;draft&quot; or &quot;outline&quot; or something instead.  When I actually begin drawing it I'll lay out the panels, I mostly wanted to get the characters setting and just the story elements looked at right now.  I don't really even need anyone to read all the way through, just to look at it a little to see if it is worth developing into a full-fledged script.  Thankyou for the great analysis though, I have only read a book with a section on scripting, and it was basically how do draw from a script that had already been written.  This is the first one I've ever made so I am taking it really slow ^^  The links are very helpful, thankyou.  And, you don't have to read it yourself, I am comfortable with the story now, and I've already got two responses on it on other boards.  <br>
<br>

<br>
For example, my scripts only contain brief notes on visuals (usually just actions and *important* details), along with pretty straightforward dialogue, 'cuz much of it changes when I actually draw it. It's split into pages (so I can make sure each installment will fit into a single issue), but I don't bother to split it into panels. People usually give me a lot of crap about the way I write scripts (heh heh) but hey, it's never a good idea to waste time and effort just because that's the conventional way to do things.<br>
<br>
In this case, since it appears that you will be illustrating the story yourself, I don't see anything wrong with your script except that these &quot;parts&quot; look like they're going to be pretty long.<br>
<br>
Speaking of which, I like it -- I haven't read all of it yet but what I did read, I enjoyed. As I was reading this I sort of imagined a visually dark world -- I'm wondering if you were aiming for that or if it's just my imagination? :^) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon2.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/udarkora.showPublicProfile?language=EN>DarkOra</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(10/16/01 9:58:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=354.topic&index=5>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.darkora.net/img/external/darkorca.jpg width=72 length=100></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hmm...</span><hr size=1>   Yeah, you don't have to get that detailed in the script (I'm pretty sure I mentioned that in my previous post), but for people that are fairly new to writing scripts (like some of the people that might be reading these posts because they want to learn), it doesn't hurt to start out with all the extra detail and then use a more shortened form later on.  It's kind of like learning to draw...if you learn the skeletal structures and anatomy first, it takes a lot longer, but once you've practiced those enough, your drawings tend to be pretty solid afterwards.  You'll eventually get to the point where you don't sketch/write in the underlying structures any more because you understand how they all fit together.  Comics/mangas do have space restrictions (like it was mentioned, there's only so many pages in a book).  The full script format at least lets you get experience at figuring out how much will fit on a page and figuring out how to group panels/scenes to help with the flow.  It's always a good idea to spend time and effort when you're learning/practicing something...<br>
<br>
BTW, sistaninja, what I've read so far seems pretty good, but it does seem a bit rushed in parts (which is fine for a fast-paced story, but as with all things, it can be overdone and if used to much it can sometimes make the flow of the story seem jumpy).  Looks like a pretty decent job of writing so far.     <p><br>

I have decided I will write a &quot;full script&quot; sometime soon to learn how but not with this because it is so long, I'll wait until I get good at it to continue with this one.  I will break it into pages though, thankyou for the suggestion ^^  I'm going to get someone familier with fighting styles and the like to help me with the action or maybe study it and then go over it.
