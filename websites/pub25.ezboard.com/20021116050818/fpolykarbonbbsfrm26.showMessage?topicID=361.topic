<br>
im going to give you a few tips that help me personally to create basic plots for comics.  <br>
<br>
Plan 1. <br>
whole comics usually start as small ideas, sometimes one scene or even one line of speech.  I normally create the plot then mould the character to it but the opposite can work quite well if you have a really complex character.  <br>
the best way to get these ideas is not to sit down and try to think them up but brainstorm with something like a book.  <br>
Go through an encyclopeodia or an old history book, whatever, and just make a list of what you see that looks interesting. i personally plug them all into a program called inspiration (<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.inspiration.com/">www.inspiration.com/</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> ) This is pretty good for this type of stuff.  <br>
<br>
this could be a bit of my list <br>
<br>
missile silo, oil rig, snakes, haiti revolution, evacuation of a city, firefighters, hydro electricity dam,  music festival etc.<br>
<br>
basically anything and everything<br>
<br>
then just think of each of them like a comic.  <br>
this is the part where you have to be carefull.  it is easy to think &quot;oh a missle silo. thats easy just have a bunch or terrorists try and launch a missile or something&quot;  this type of stuff has been done over and over again so its best to think of it in a different light.  <br>
<br>
eg. what if due to a false alarm the whole silo was locked down for security reasons trapping the people inside. <br>
what of all of the people on the base are ordered to launch a missile at a country but refuse to for moral reasons leading to the government trying to break into their own base.  <br>
what about a romance comic about two people who work at a missile station.  <br>
what if everyone on the base were going insane from a weird chemical in a new weapon.  <br>
<br>
just brainstorm thinking up as many ideas as possible for each of the things on your list.  and you should come up with something hopefully. <br>
<br>
cant come up with ideas like that?  need a bit more help? time for plan B<br>
<br>
Plan B<br>
pLan B some people may call cheating but i dont think so.  then again it depends on how creative you can be.  <br>
Basically the trick is to get inspiration from books, films and comics BEFORE you actually read them.  <br>
nxt time you see a movie preview or read a blurb or a basic plot outline brainstorm on it without seeing what the writer has done with it.  how often do you hear an idea for a movie from a friend and when you see the movie your image of the movie in your brain seems a lot better.  <br>
<br>
just know when to not push it.  say for example if you read an overview for deep blue sea.  if you start brainstorming and come up with an idea of sharks trying to escape their cage you would probably want to reconsider this idea once you see the film.  you probably want to cross out all ideas involving fooling around with genetics to make sharks bigger.<br>
<br>
you may be left, however, with a few ideas that have nothing to do with the movie version at all. so use these in your comic<br>
<br>
using ideas like this i have never been stuck with ideas for comics.  unfortunatly sometimes i get too many hence the huge amount of unfinshed scripts on my drive<br>
<br>
oh well post your methods of getting ideas here <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/umylak.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mylak</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(10/22/01 1:16:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=361.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://mylakovich.homestead.com/files/pics/ngpclance.gif height=66 width=75></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ok</span><hr size=1> i like the idea of trying to get inspiration from a movie you havn't seen yet. I agree sometimes the movie falls short of the ideas that you get when you watch the advertisements.<br>
<br>
the main problem with trying to think of something original is that everything has been done befor. you just have to choose one that hasnt been done correctly or recently enough for most people to remember it. Not to say that you should copy anything, but there is a good chance that even if you think of something independantly, it will resemble some movie or comic that already exists. Thats okay, we arnt in the reneissance anymore where everything is new, so its unavoidable.<br>
<br>
i usually start with characters, because i like personality studies more than just straight action. I try to think of a character who has more problems than good things. if there is one character that is annoying to read about it is perfect people, like James Bond in the movies or for instance Howard Roark in Ayn Rand's Fountainhead. Roark is almost inhuman in his perfect obediance to his principals and his almost total lack of character flaws. Rand writes the book extremly well, but those kinds of characters are too unrelateable. I prefer a character who has to struggle morally every day, and in the end doesn't get everything they wished for. Regardless of what genra you are writing about, you should try to get inside your characters instead of using cookie cutter steriotypes to populate your story. i'd prefer to read about a character that fails a lot; then when he does succeed, it makes it that much more rewarding.<br>
<br>
just my personal belief <p><BR>
