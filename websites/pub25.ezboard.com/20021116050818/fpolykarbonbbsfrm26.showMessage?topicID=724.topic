&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp You SHOULD file charges.  Well, I gotta go tell Kim.  Bye.<br>

I really like the humor and the way it is described.  But do you really have to have all those extra scenes where nothing happens?  You have a lot of scenes that have nothing to do with the story.  Example, the bath scenes.  At the begining, I wasn't sure what was going on.  All the titles got me kind of confused.  I wasn't sure if it was another day or if it was just a break, such as a page break.<br>
<br>
Please understand that this is one of the first times I've ever critized someone else's story, so I'm not very...experienced in this type of field. <br>
<br>
 Never the less, I love the story and think you did a great job.  You have so much detail!!  I'm just stunned. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/utaerx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>TaerX</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(7/26/02 6:40:22 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=724.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Script: Fever Dreams</span><hr size=1> The two bath scenes are fan service. =)  (Not!)<br>
<br>
The first one is the mom reacting to what she knows to be impossible, but can't denied that it happened.  It's a feeling of disbelief.<br>
<br>
The second one is the mom coming to accept the possibility that her daughter may have some sort of ESP, and trying to balance her parental responsibility for keeping her daughter healthy against her want to be richer (the lottery ticket).<br>
<br>
That's what I <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> intended</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, anyhow.  Other people I've shown this to have said that the pacing is abrupt as well.  I'm going to have to retool some stuff leading up to the ending.<br>
<br>

Everyone thought this was the first chapter and the story would be continued.  I'm going to have to rework the dialog / pacing / blocking for the ending.<br>
<br>
If you've read this far, you've read the story.  What I was <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  trying </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to communicate was:<br>
<br>
1) Amy's father, Mr. Reyes, kidnapped here after fighting with her mother, Carol Reyes.  (He's probably heading for the border and hoping to disappear in Mexico, but that's neither important nor implied.)<br>
<br>
2) Kim <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  does </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> get sick, successfully assists in Amy being reunited with her mother, and gets hospitalized.  I haven't decided if she lives or dies at that point, that's beyond the scope of the story.<br>
<br>
I was hoping some of the comics leading up to the ending would indicate that, but evidently, the didn't.<br>
<br>
I'm <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> so</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> bummed. <p><hr noshade size=1><center><font size=1><a href="http://www.freewebs.com/taerx/"> My FreeWebs Home Page</a> (Not a lot there)</font></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uaokoayame.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aoko Ayame</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(7/29/02 11:17:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=724.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Aaaaaargh!!!! :(</span><hr size=1> Oh... don't get too upset!

Have you read some of the rest of my story I posted?  I posted a little more of the script.  Please tell me what you think of it.<br>
<br>
If you have any changes to your story, I am more than happy to read it again.  I found it really interesting.<br>
<br>
I have two other stories that I am currently working on.  Both are not typed out in any way except little bios for some of the characters.  I'm going to try and post them on another topic.  Tell me what you think of them.  If it works I'm calling the topic New Space.
