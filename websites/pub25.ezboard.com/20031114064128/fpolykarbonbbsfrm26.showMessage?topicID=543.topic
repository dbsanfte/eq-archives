The Winds of Time<br>
<br>
Prologue<br>
<br>
The winds of time blow across the desert of eternity, the high Golden Eye watches from above the land below. Many events have passed and many more will come, however a scorched earth has no feelings by which to judge them. A land in perpetual chaos has not compass by which to steer, no star to guide by. A force of good or evil has no dominance amidst chaos for chaos yields to no one and favors no one. Yet among chaos all things can exist…<br>
<br>
 Since the dawn of time the Isle of Maydor has existed in a state of perpetual chaos, neither face no figure can be clearly discerned as the turbulent sea thrashes and turns in its watery bed. For those of the land of Maydor they must struggle against the perpetual chaos that exists within all things as they struggle to find peace and harmony. Can destiny spell and end to the chaos or will the gods’ fury never be calmed? Such is the fate of Maydor.<br>
<br>
“Damn these scrolls,” Darvin said as he coughed amidst a jetting could of dust as several scrolls fell from an old redwood rack. Thoroughly annoyed he slapped the wooden ends of the age-old scrolls down on the table; he had little respect for such belligerent scrolls. He mumbled something under his breath as he ran his finger along the text, obviously looking for something, with a self-induced haste. The lights flickered as he moved anxiously from one scroll to the next.<br>
“Ahh, here it is,” he said his finger coming to rest on the text of a scroll that looked no different from any of the others. Anyone in the room would concede with out a second thought that all the redwood scrolls in the redwood rack looked to be the very same and only a scholar interested in the distinct color of the images created by the words would have found the place of interest. “So you thought you could elude me, but time’s hardly ticked past five and you’re already found; I’ve gotten quicker and you’re not so sly.” The man said much to himself. It was a habit of such scholars to at times apostrophize the eternal works that were there consistent companions. <br>
<br>
“Most interesting, yes this is most interesting, and how it is in accordance with my earlier assumption. This quest for answers is most invigorating. Reminds me of my days of youth, when I was bucking for knowledge at every turn. Then the nights knew me as well as the days, and at times nights far more intimately.” <br>
<br>
The old man rummaged through some parchment that was haphazardly strewn about the room taking a piece at random, then producing a pen from what seemed to be nowhere scribbled something down on the piece he’d selected. <br>
At the far corner in the shadows, barely visible, a figure leaned against the door. He said nothing, arms crossed about his chest, his gaze on the old man, nothing more, nothing less. <br>
<br>
“This quest has been full of fruit, yes this is what I’d call a full basket.” The man said as he walked closer to the figure. The man said nothing as the elder approached. “You see my boy, this scroll speaks of the balance that will emerge from chaos,” The elder held the scroll up and began to dictate. “And as the god Guror in his fury cast the land into a perpetual chaos his wife the goddess Elyor issued forth a fate that one day a warrior would bring balance to the island. But until this time the land would be consumed by chaos.  So you see, dear boy, the scrolls do speak of the eventual balancing of the land. <br>
The man didn’t move but spoke. “The scroll neither indicates time nor place, the warrior could appear at any time anywhere. Such is the nature of chaos.” <br>
<br>
“Ah, yes, quite right, you always were my favorite pupil Vylor, and rightly so,” The man said whimsically reminiscent, but in an absent-minded manner. “However, we of the Alteri have ways of knowing when such times exist and where such places are. We are the favored lot.” <br>
<br>
“If the nature of the man be evil or if the nature of the man be good, how do we proceed, we who are the balancers.” <br>
<br>
“An excellent question,” Renn replied and began thrusting scrolls back into their spaces on the racks, even after he had put away several the over all tidiness of the room did not improve in the least. “And one rightly asked, however, it can be fairly assumed that for good to exist so must there to be evil, and vise versa,” he gestured unnecessarily as he spoke. “Hence, by aiding one we man only slightly weaken the other, but we’ll never destroy it completely. Which ever side fate has decided for us we shall take, be it good or be it evil, it’s all the same to me.”<br>
<br>
“You’re a man of little conscience Renn,” the shadowed figure said. “I have conscience for some things, but for those things that can not be changed, I have none for none exists.”<br>
The man spoke with a wisdom that was beyond his years. Although, Vylor was a high sorcerer of the Alteri, he had some conflict with their views from time to time. Not all they did could be seen as a direct benefit to the land. So many years of separation on mountain of Unall had dulled their senses in certain matters. <br>
<br>
“I think you have too much conscience where none is due,” Renn continued. <br>
<br>
“Old fool,” Vylor said almost inaudibly under his breath.<br>
<br>
Renn whirled around, sorcerer’s flying. Two flames sputtered and went out. “Old fool am I,” Renn countered. Vylor was visibly disturbed and some what shifted his stance out of surprise at Renn’s impeccable hearing at such an age. <br>
<br>
“Well if I’m the old fool then you’d best be the one to handle the situation. Fine. It is settled. You’re in charge of seeking out this fated warrior and aiding him in his quest. If he be good such is your fate and if he be evil such is your punishment.” With that Renn strutted past Vylor without another word. <br>
<br>
Vylor admitted the man was smart, he was a genius in fact, however, what disgusted him was the fact that Renn like so many other high sorcerers seemed to play the land of Maydor as if were a mere game of dice. They made their calculated throw and if a balance was achieved it was, and if it wasn’t there was always another chance. But the high sorcerers were not gods, nor were they even descended from gods. Their purpose hadn’t even been given to them, so much as it was self implemented. High atop the mountain castle of Unall they seemed to dictate the supposed fate of the land. Fine. If he was to be an accomplice of destiny such was his fate, but he was going to play by his own rules and not what the old windbags on this mountain decreed. He’d leave on the wind and he’d return on the wind and no one was going to get in his way.<br>
<br>
“If the destined man be good such is fate, if he be evil such is fate, to be apart of this destiny so too it seems is my fate.” With that the man mouthed an incantation and vanished from the room. <br>
<br>
And so with a conversation between to men on the mountain of Unall the threads of destiny were beginning to weave their predetermined pattern. But even those who think themselves to be above destiny as the elders of Unall did became the most blind to destiny herself. All were tools, mere pawns in a game which already had an end, destiny was no mans fool and no mans toy. So all would come to see…<br>
