Whatcha think?</span><hr size=1> Okay, here is the basics of the new story I plan on working on sometime in the future. I'm going to put aside the other two I have made (Datenshi, and the one I call &quot;Untitled 1&quot;)<br>
<br>
What I plan on doing is start the story off with a woman who is sitting down wiriting a poem. (this takes place in feudal Japan. Guess you noticed by now I'm in love with Japan.) She doesn't have ANY relevance to the story besides the fact that she is the one who is writing it (She acts as the narrator). Every time I write a chapter I'll close it with a poem, which is when she is writing. I can't explain it perfectly, but I'm sure you get the idea. This is probably the first original idea I've had since yet.<br>
So the deal is that she acts as the narrator, and the poems at the end of each chapter are hers.<br>
<br>
Here is the main story. (I rewrote it, so It's much neater, and I also added some new things to it. I also took away one character, the ninja guy, and made the necro-priest more important to the story.)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Characters:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">Mamoru-</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> The main character. He has lived a rugged life ever since his father’s school was taken over, and his brother and father were killed. He bears a scar across his chest and face, which are reminders from that day.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">Iaka-</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> Iaka is a man who’s in ties with the Yakuza, and other dirty businesses. He is a ronin who plans to dominate all other schools in Japan.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">Kazuma-</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> A former Shinto priest who was stripped of his priesthood for practicing the black arts and banished from his village. He came to Iaka, claiming that he could help take down Mamoru (which is so true, but not in the way Iaka would want <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   ). Kazuma's true intentions are to destroy Iaka, and resurrect Shosetsu so he can watch Shosetsu kill Mamoru. He actually wants Mamoru dead, because Mamoru was hired to kill Kazuma once, but failed.<br>
 <br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">Keiko-</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> Keiko’s father had a large debt to pay off, and so he borrowed money from Iaka with the collateral being Keiko. When it was time for Iaka to collect the girl (since Keiko's father didn't pay him back), Keiko’s father sent Keiko away with all of his money. Iaka kills Keiko’s father, and is now after his collateral. Keiko has a hefty amount of money, and plans on using it for protection from Iaka, so she purchases the services of Mamoru.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">Shosetsu-</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> Mamoru’s brother. He is the true antagonist. His skill with the sword far surpasses Mamoru. He had died many years beforehand, but was resurrected by Kazuma. He wishes to defeat his brother and prove that the sword is meant to kill.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">Natsumi-</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> A female bounty hunter that is after Mamoru’s head. She is hired by Iaka, but soon changes her opinion on what’s more important: Friendship or money? She looks back on who is the true criminal, and decides to fight Iaka with Mamoru and Keiko.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">Sword Smith-</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> So far, no name has been given to him. He is a lone sword smith who has very few customers. Mamoru comes up to him with a drastic request. Create me a rival sword! This same sword smith created Mamoru’s father’s treasured sword, which was missing from the burial ground of Shosetsu and his father (Shosetsu took the sword. He has always desired that sword). Now Mamoru needs a sword of equal strength to battle Shosetsu!<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Basic Story:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Mamoru is a killer for hire. He does any odd job for the right price. One day while in a bar, Keiko comes up to him and asks for a proposition. Here’s the deal: Mamoru has to protect this girl from a group of guys who are after her. Mamoru says that despite his name (which means “protect”) he isn’t the type of person to do “Yojimbo” (bodyguard) jobs. He demands a hefty sum, knowing well that she couldn’t possibly have that kind of money. Oddly enough, she pays him, and Mamoru begins his first job as a bodyguard. (He doesn’t accept all of the money though, just half of it, after realizing how serious she was.)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Background:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Mamoru was the son of a great swordsman who created a school to teach his sword art to those who understand the concepts behind what a sword really is: an instrument of murder. Mamoru’s father had two children. Shosetsu was the first born, and then came Mamoru. One day, Iaka came out of nowhere and demanded that Mamoru’s father hand over the dojo's certificate of liscene. Shosetsu and Mamoru fight them alongside their father to protect the dojo, and each claimed a great number of men. Mamoru killed ten of Iaka’s men, and Shosetsu killed the greater number of twenty. Even though they fought hard, it was still not enough, as Shosetsu and Mamoru’s father were killed. Mamoru was wounded across the face and chest, and taken for dead. Mamoru hung on to life, and managed to pull through. He now wishes to avenge his brother and father’s deaths by defeating Iaka and his people one day.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Sub Plot:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
After Mamoru accepts the Job from Keiko, a mysterious man shows up in front of Iaka. He was the fallen priest Kazuma, claiming that he can help kill Mamoru. It was his intention to resurrect Shosetsu and to use him to take down Iaka and use his dojo to boost Shosetsu’s power. Kazuma is actually loyal to Shosetsu. Iaka did not know this, of course. Shosetsu plans on killing his brother. He wants to prove to Mamoru that the sword is meant for killing. Mamoru wants to prove that it isn’t, and that father was wrong. <br>
Shosetsu was a sick individual, who’s lust for power while alive, drove him to love the art of killing all a little too much. His father taught him that the sword is used to kill. It was when he was four years old that these words were carved in stone into the mind of Shosetsu, but his father had an epiphany later on. His father knew that the sword is meant for murder, but that sounded to be far too crude, and came to the assumption that one must kill in order to protect. He names his second son Mamoru because of this. Shosetsu was beyond the point of changing his ways, using his skill to kill for pleasure. He would kill animals he found in the woods, and later killed his first man at age 16 out of pure rage. His father’s immature principle of “the sword is meant to kill” had twisted Shosetsu into a bitter person who loved to kill. Once Kazuma brings Shosetsu back to life, he addresses him as “master”, and tells him of his plan. Shosetsu is reluctant to go along with it at first, but is persuaded by Kazuma. Shosetsu goes over to his father’s grave and robs the Dairyoku from the grave, which was his father’s great sword with the strength of fifty men. Shosetsu will use this sword to kill his brother.<br>

Whatcha think?</span><hr size=1> Thanks. I got two new things to add about the story that I forgot to mention (mainly because they are so important, and I didn't give them names yet.)<br>
<br>
They are these two swords: (they are actually very Inu Yasha clad. Like the Tetsusaiga and the Tenseiga. I didn't mean it to be like that, though <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    )<br>
<br>
Dairyoku- A sword which was created so that one slash of the sword would be equal to the strength of fifty men.<br>
<br>
Daimamori- A sword created so that it would be as strong as fifty men, and never would break.<br>
<br>
Basically, the Dairyoku was the original sword and was created by a sword smith to give to Mamoru's father. After his father past away, along with Shosetsu, both of their graves were robbed. Shosetsu was missing from the grave, and the Dairyoku was missing from Mamoru's father's grave. Shosetsu had taken the sword, and is now going to use it against his brother.<br>
Mamoru (after getting the crap kicked out of him by Shosetsu and the Dairyoku) now heads over to the same old man who crafted the first sword. Mamoru asks him to make a rival sword that can be used against the Dairyoku, and so he makes the Daimamori.<br>
<br>
[Edit:]<br>
One thing I'm having a hard time thinking of, is a reason for Iaka (I called him Akai when I first posted) to be after the girl who hired Mamoru (I gave her a name, Keiko.) I was thinking at first for it to be a money issue, that maybe her father owes him money and Iaka was going to kidnap her to get the money back, but that doesn't work out right. Then I was going to have it that Keiko's father owed him money, and Iaka killed him, now he's after Keiko, but then I though &quot;There's no money in revenge.&quot; So I'm stuck. Pretty much anything to do with money is out of the question because it won't work out...<br>
<br>
Oh yeah, and if anyone wants to give a whack at designing Shosetsu and the swords, then feel free because I have no idea at what either of them should look like. I basically thought I'd give him a Sesshoumaru-clad look to him (definately he'd be bishonen), but I didn't want to rip off. Keep in mind this takes place in Japan during the 1500's so Shosetsu will be wearing a kimono, and maybe some armor... heck if I know, just have fun. Same with the swords. That is, if anyone wants to give it a go and try to come up with a design. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kagebu>Kagebu</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0> at: 1/2/03 4:48:22 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=agentcryrid>Agent Cryrid</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(1/2/03 7:47:12 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=881.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: New Idea...

Whatcha think?</span><hr size=1> I have a crit for this story, but it's really just a personal beef, so feel free to completely ignore it. My problem with this is the names. Okay yeah, I appreciate that they're japanese ( or at least japanese-esque) but i always find that in comics of this sort the writer often dis-regards his artistic license for realism. Your names don't have to be entirely accurate, as for a western audience they're hard to read and ,more importantly, hard to distinguish from one another. Take &quot;Dairyoku&quot; and &quot;Daimamori&quot; for example. half way through reading your synopsis I had to check back to figure out which was which. This is a problem that even Tolkien had. He was so caught up in making middle earth like an ancient saxon world that a lot of his characters names sounded very similar, and hence confusion. Don't forget who you're audience is. If your average western manga reader has to re-read a name twice before they can figure out how to pronounce it, it really breaks up your story flow. If you think your audience are people who will appreciate the feudal Japanese accuracy over simplicity then fair enough. If your audience is Japanese, for example, I'm sure they'll be fine. It's something people rarely notice, but the names in &quot;AKIRA&quot; are almost perfect..<br>

Whatcha think?</span><hr size=1> i read this breifly (i.e. read a couple pragraphs here and there) I'm sure i missed a lot, but how about Iaka and Keiko's father had some sort of deal ,but Keiko's father didn't come through on it (something like Keiko's father had some sort of debt and couldn't pay it so he asked Iaka for money and in return he was supposed to give Keiko to him, very possable from what i know of ancient japanese culture but could be wrong) When he diddn't deliver on the deal and sent keiko away giving her all the mney and supplies he could giver her...iaka came to collect and killed keiko's father and went in search of keiko....keiko having all the supplies she needs would then have enough money for mamoru....of course during their adventures however keiko would prolly have to do side work to keep the two well fed and pay off mamoru for the extended time...which she could prolly stop paying with money if you wanna turn it into a love sub-story as well, or have her at one time not be able to pay mamoru and so she let's him &quot;take her&quot;, or farther on in thtory have mamoru and keiko know they are about to be caught and with the aformentioned story of iaka wanting her Keiko could tell mamoru to take her virginity so thyat she wouldn't be wanted by iaka anymore and then the story woud turn torwards iaka hating mamoru and wanting to kill him for taking what was his. Keiko would then have to find a reason to stay with mamoru then, or for mamoru to take her with him. Maybe something like even though iaka doesn't want keiko anymore for her virginity he still want her to sell as a slave or something to get his money's worth. All that would generate Mamoru being permanently in the story even if they split up and then you could bring in new chars and branch into several sub-plots that make sense, but those are just random ideas. <br>
<br>
EDIT: I just read the rest of the stuff and i was thinkin...maybe Keiko is some badass martial artist in reality and killed many of iaka's men, but due to it being fuedel japan she needs an escort and a disguise. She was a daughter of a welalthy man who sold her into slavery and such to pay off a debt, but she ad studyied martial arts for many years secretly and when she was taken she was taken straight to iaka who she almost murdered but his men stopped her before she could, but she still kiled one or two before she made her escape. Having been well known before she was sold she got money and some protection...<br>
Ok thas all i can think of lol<br>
:END EDIT<br>
<br>
As for the poetress, it's a good idea if you are a good poet that can capture the entire issue within a couple lines...for this kind of story i would just make her a writer instead, telling of an ancient tale. But if you like the poetress idea more you shoud stick with that since i haven't seen anything with a poet like writing but plenting of straight story writing naration chars...and you would have to eventually come up with why she is writing this tale...i would make it an older keiko writing down her past or one of their great great grandchildren..etc. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=psoj>psoj</A> at: 1/2/03 7:49:47 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kagebu>Kagebu</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(1/2/03 9:17:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=881.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://liquid2k.com/datenshidojo/sano01.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: New Idea...

<br>
And I tried to keep some of the names very simple. Keiko is a real easy name to remember because it's common. Mamoru is also common, and it means &quot;protect&quot;. Iaka is actually a character of mine on EverQuest, which is Akai spelled backwards (Akai means &quot;Red&quot;.) Shosetsu might be the most difficult name to remember, but you can't just have a ton of plain names. The Dairyoku and the Daimamori are reasy to remember. Mamori means Defense, Guard, etc. and sounds similar to Mamoru (the guy who wields it.) and Ryoku means Power, Strength, etc. (the Dai, means Big, Great, etc.)<br>
I found the same problems when I read Tolkien's &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; epic. I could only remember Frodo and Gandalf, other than those two, I can't remember the rest of the people in the story.<br>
Maybe I should make it easier on the brain because this will be targeting american audiences.<br>
<br>
I have another name I'll probably use somewhere in there.<br>
<br>
Natsumi= a female character (fairly common name.) For some reason she tags along with Mamoru and Keiko.<br>

I won't go into detail on who the poet/poetess , because everything that describes him/her in the beginning and en will be in soliloquy-clad poems. and everything in the middle just regular short-verse poetry. I'll let the reader decide who the heck they think the poet/poetess could be. Hell, Maybe Shosetsu will live, and he'll be writing about it (his name can be translated into a few things, one of them is &quot;novel&quot;) It might be Keiko, or Mamoru. I'll just let the reader speculate, now that I took out the idea that the poet/poetess is the writer of a book(set of poems) which is the story. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kagebu>Kagebu</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0> at: 1/2/03 9:32:40 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=durakken>Durakken</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Fresh Meat</span><br> <font color=#336699>(1/2/03 10:15:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=881.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: New Idea...

The names sound great to me...and i'm not some jap buff myself i don't even know what most of it means...you theory is wrong cuz think about vid games...Ryu, Ryo, Iori Yagami, Mai Shironi. with move names like Tatsumaku senpu kiyaku, hadouken, etc. I've not seen anyone not be able to distinguish between these characters and moves and they do remember them. the swords however a lil hard to rember though, but i would just put like a hyphen in there for american readers so they can catch on quicker...but seriously if you get into a manga or book or whatever, you are going to know the names of every last thing. like your example of LOtR. you may not know the names to well, but you say Gannondorf to any real fan and they'll be like stupid it's Gandalf even if it said gannondorf in the book...(leave it to someone to write a book that typo a name everytime it is written..) but just a question...how do you not remember Arigorn, Legolas, Frodo, Sam Gamgee, and Gandalf...they sound nothing alike and they are pretty much the most important characters from what i read of it...If your refering to the brandybrooks and the baggins and the blah....who cares they are pretty much only mentioned to give a little bit more depth. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kagebu>Kagebu</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(1/3/03 12:03:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=881.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://liquid2k.com/datenshidojo/sano01.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: New Idea...

Whatcha think?</span><hr size=1> I knew someone would get their knickers in a twist over this. It's hard to find specific examples for this problem but why unduely confuse your audience by calling your characters Ryu and Ryo or Kay and Kai when you could call them Kay and Bill. If you have some other reason for calling them what you do then kewl. You sound like you have some other plotline reasons for using them anyway. Psoj/Durakken seems to like them, and if he/ she is representitive of your target audience then that's what you should be going for. I'm not saying &quot;don't use the japanese names&quot; only always to bear in mind who your readership will be, and keep pandering to them as one of your top priorities. Having a target audience is one of the MOST important things for both a writer and a designer. But more importantly right now....Can we see some prelim designs??<br>
   To Durakken: it's not a theory. it's fact. Video games that name characters too similarily have done it badly. So has Tolkien, in parts. Admittedly when you get to the sort of universe he created you're bound to run into difficulties, and many have done it far far worse. Take, for example, Robert Jordan novels. It happens all the time. How many twelve year olds knew how to pronounce &quot;Hermione&quot; when they first saw it? Bad naming. Rowling forgot who her audience was, or at least she pushed them aside for some reason of her own.<br>

I'm not too good at designing characters, so you probably won't see that many come out from this. I'm especially having problems coming up with a design for Shosetsu.

   I'm sure your names'll be fine, but seriously you need to know who you're writing your manga for. I'd imagine it's for your adverage western manga fan, fans of blade of the immortal and soforth. In that case perhaps having a bishonen leading character may not be such a good idea...etc..etc... <br>
   I guess i'm just trying to give advice as to how strongly your audience should direct your plotline if you want a successful comic. I understand you're probably writing it for yourself, but you represent a portion of the populace too.<br>
Good Luck anyway.<br>
