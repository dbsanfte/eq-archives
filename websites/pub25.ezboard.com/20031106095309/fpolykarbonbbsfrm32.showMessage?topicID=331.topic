I dont think anyone from the orginal debate is still here, but read everything before you post your opinion. VF4 EVO stuff is greatly appreciated.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>    L</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->ately I've been searching the WWW for information on my favorite fighter of all time. During this process I've taken in a lot of info on both Tekken and Virtua Fighter. I've come here to lay it all down in one LONG post. I'm here to discuss with others these two beloved fighters. Which do you prefer? I'm looking for more of a preference here. It's been discussed, sure, but here it is right out in the open. Both games are great and sure its kinda like comparing apples and oranges, but here we go....<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>       My Choice</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->: Virtua Fighter<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>       Why?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->: Its a fighter I've played for many years. My first 3d fighter. Virtua Fighter 2 on Sega Saturn was the beginning. For the time, the graphics were above and beyond what any other system had. The animation was fluid and the moves were incredibly inumerable. To put it lightly I was awed by this game. I cant quite put my finger on it, but something about this game gripped me and didnt let me go. After this every other fighter was just second best. Nothing ever felt right to me. Now years later I've been able to more or less figure out why.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>       Gameplay/Graphics</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->: Being only about 10-11 when I first played, I found it nice to be able to come in and get through a few levels with my limited moves and eventually get stopped dead in my tracks later on. Virtua Fighter lends some ease in letting people scratch the surface of a game with limited knowledge and slowly pull you into something much more deep. Over the next year and a half I learned more and more moves. Looking back it's overwhelming how much there was to keep being discovered. If you keep at the game and most importantly retain what you &quot;learned&quot; the game sorta becomes part of your mind. For lack of a better analogy it's like learning a martial art. You gotta practice and remember how to do the moves (I would know I was two steps away from a black belt a few years ago and I dropped it). Each character has there style and I find it hard to really learn more than one character fully. You gotta choose who you like. OR if you prefer you can learn many characters but not as much.<br>
<br>
Now the graphics. Each Virtua Fighter has brought something very impressive to the table graphics-wise. The most groundbreaking would be Virtua Fighter. The first true 3d fighter. So revolutionary that its on display at the Smithsonian. Nothing like it had ever been around. Groundbreaking. For some the whole Virtua Fighter style isnt for them. For me it was something (at the time) that was completely foreign to me. Everything in the game was new. I had never seen such &quot;oriental&quot; influenced levels and costumes.(oriental is not meant to be offensive, just describing the culture portrayed by the game, how it felt to me) Virtua Fighter 2 was even better. The Saturn port was less dazzling, but it was better than any other fighter out at the time. Virtua Fighter 3 blew away the competition when it came out in theatres. It was lightyears ahead of the graphics in Tekken Tag Tournament (aracade version). Unfortunately by the time it hit the Dreamcast it had lost its impact. To tell the truth though I enjoy Virtua Fighter 3 very much. It retained eveything I like about the first two, but gave it a new cover. I wasnt looking for earth shattering, and frankly this was enough for me. The game was still there and under all the changes, it was the Virtua Fighter I loved. Sure the voices were changed from their classic-ness and were much worse, it was what I liked. Virtua Fighter 4, I'm embarassed to say, I havent had the opportunity to play yet. I've bought it, but I'm still waiting about two more paychecks before I can afford the actual system. I can say this though. If the game is able to retain it's style, music, gameplay,and graphics (which it seems it has) I will be MORE than satisfied. Am I biased? A little. I've been more or less raised on this fighter, but I saw Tekken the whole time. Not as much but I did. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>       What About Tekken?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->: I really enjoy Tekken, I really do. Especially recently I've tried to warm up to it. And I have. The games pacing and style are very good. I enjoy the characters and controls, but I dont feel at home. I've looked up some moves and tried to get into the deepness of this game. The deeper, harder moves and a whole new dimension to the play. The problem is, it seems like this game is too easy to win. I fought my cousin who is as die hard for Tekken as I am for Virtua Fighter and I very nearly won a few times. This is my only true gripe with the game. The other reasons are purely personal preference. I will admit Tekken has a much more &quot;there&quot; story. When you win, you see the characters story. In Virtua Fighter you pretty much just win. The story is in the character bios in the instruction manual. You find out what each character did after the tournament in the sequels instruction book. Tekken is much better at conveying its story. Virtua Fighter seems a little more original and willing to try new things. Tekken has more or less used the same formula from square one. Graphics got better, but the fighting stayed more or less the same (which is a good thing). Virtua Fighter seemed to add something with each new installment. In some cases it worked (the option for ring outs, cant remember if the were in the original VF, but this definately worked) and in some cases it failed (side step button in VF3). At least they went for something new. Back to Tekken, if I am incorrect about new additions I apologise because I dont know the Tekken games as well I do the VF games.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>       Conclusion</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->: Virtua Fighter is my choice. Tekken seems like a fun little romp for good measure (to me). I could never get down with Tekken and feel part of it. I look forward to the responses from you guys, because this is one of the best boards for Tekken/VF discussion. I only ask a few things for responding to this please (I'm in the mood for an awesome debate):<br>
1) Lets try to keep it civilized as usual. No name calling or even personal attacks and the like.<br>
2) Support what you say with details.<br>
3) Dont come in with &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom is the best hands down.&quot; Or DOA, Soul Calibur, or any other fighter. I like those too, but its for another topic.<br>
4) Like I mentioned I'm in the mood for a serious discussion with other seasoned Tekken/VF players. I look forward to this and just hope people are willing to run with this.<br>

I've played T4 since last summer. I've been in 3 T4 tournies and I rank in the top 5 players in MI. I bought my PS2 just to buy TTT so I could practice. I moded my PS2 just for T4. Last night I owned 28 people in a row and placed 4th on that T4 machine. Playing T4 is like second nature to me now, sure a nobody can get a luck hit or two in Tekken on even the best players, but winning is still no problem for a vet. Lot of people bitch about the 8 frame jabs, and that in T4 when you block you don't get knocked back so you can have a little room and Jin in general but that crap doesn't botherme enough to hate the game. Long story short, I'll take T4 over VF4 any day.

So they are going to attract different kinds of people.<br>
<br>
VF is a combo based fighter. Like DOA is. You attack your opponent with combos/strings, and to master the game you have to learn which combos are right for the opponent you are playing. So people who like to do combos are attracted to games like VF and DOA.<br>
<br>
Tekken's system however is more of a &quot;dynamic&quot; styled fighting. You dont use long strings to attack your opponent, instead you have to mix things up with a quick number of hits and then wait for your opponent to counter attack, or go into another short string to hopefully counter attack their own counter attack. The goal of every good player is to hopefully get them into the air so they can do juggle combos. Which are Tekken's true &quot;combos&quot; even though they arent like combos you would see in another game. Because its not a very combo friendly game, newbies have a hard time getting into it and will describe the controls as &quot;stiff.&quot; While a newbie vs a newbie is a good match, a newbie vs someone who knows how Tekken works will get humiliated.<br>
___________<br>
<br>
As for which game I like, I think Tekken 4 is perhaps the greatest fighter since VF2. VF2 came and introduced a lot of new things to fighters, I think Tekken 4 is just as intuitive.<br>
<br>
If you are talking about VF vs Tekken as a whole? Then I dont know. Early VF's were better than early Tekkens, but I think the later Tekkens are better than the VF's. I hated Tekken 1 and 2, so I was a VF fan untill Soul Edge came out. When Tekken 3 came out I fell in love with the fighitng style. Tekken Tag wasnt anything new, just a cheap upgrade from 3. I havent been a fan of VF since Tekken 3 came out.<br>
<br>
But Tekken 4 has completely blown me away. Way more than any fighter has. And yes there are a load of new things with this game, so many that I dont want to describe them all since no one would read something so long.<br>
<br>
Tekken 4 REALLY shines when you get good at it. If you just start out with Tekken then you probably wont find it the most fun game ever. The learning curve to actually beable to do something good is just to high. I dont agree about the newbie can beat a seasoned player, your cousin may have had Tekken for a long time but if he doesnt take the time to go online and learn what it is capable of then he is still a newbie. I know this because my friend and I are in the same position, he started out learning the mechanics of the game much earlier than me even though I have played it for longer, he kicks my ass just about every time. Sometimes there are other people over who have played tekken for a while but they still cant even come close to beating us since we know how the game works while they are trying to do useless combos.<br>
<br>
I dont want to type forever so I will just post some videos of examples of what T4 can do in the hands of good players.<br>
<br>
This site is where people go to learn advanced juggles. The moves are listed when you click on the image, the name link is the video file. (This site used to have juggle videos for each character, but they took most of them down for some reason)<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.tekkenzaibatsu.com/tekken4/_movies.php">www.tekkenzaibatsu.com/te...movies.php</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
The players on this site are incredibly good. If you compare these fights to VF4 tournament fights then you can see how different the 2 games are in the hands of good players. (I dont know if the files are going to work, some are dns errors which mean the server is down)<br>

Hmmm.......<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I disagree. You have to mix your moves up in most fighting games in order to win against a half competent opponent, 2D or 3D. <br>
<br>
I do agree with your statement on VF vs tekken though. I didn't like the original tekken games either. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  VF2 was one of my first 3D fighters i owned, and i loved it to death but i'm afraid tekken3 didn't do a lot for me.

I too was intrigued by Tekken 3, but it just wasnt too earth shattering for me.. <br>
<br>
First off, let me clear my cousins name cause he'd kill me if he read this (which he wont). I exagerrated. I got close maybe once or twice. He wasnt even using his characters (Hwoarang and Bayak ((or something to that effect))). While using those two he's almost unstoppable.<br>
<br>
Now back to the topic. What was it about Tekken 3 in particular that made it better than VF3? Or Virtua Fighter for that matter. Tekken 3 seems intersting enough, but when I compare it to the likes of VF2 (but not so much VF3) it doesnt seem to measure up. Where I see the better-ness is in the extras. Namco is always good for adding in extra goods. As to your comment on using combo strings against certain opponents to win and in Tekken you need to be more &quot;strategic&quot; (or something to that effect), I think that VF has just as much strategy to it. Especially in this newest incarnation where combos and reversals all play a part. But in retrospect it may seem hard for both of us to really &quot;know&quot; the game if we dont love it and dig in to it as we do our respective fighter. Where I see Tekken as sorta &quot;stiff&quot;, you see VF as sorta &quot;basic&quot; (I think, from your post). <br>
<br>
Still, I dont see what makes &quot;juggles&quot; so important. They are what made VF2 and to a lesser extent VF3 challenging. When someone was in the air it was a perfect chance to rip into them. You'd be surprised how a quick ground attack on your fallen opponent can change up a fight. But an expert would know to do a quick rise. It's where you get up faster than normal (it even plays into reducing the damage from some moves if you can roll into a throw). To more or less show my point I'll show this link.

I hate having to think about blocking, it starts to much of a poking game, punch, block, punch. I mean what other reason would you hold back expect to defend? The block button in Soull Calibur makes a little more since because your using a weapon but still.<br>
<br>
Newbies in VF4 and just press, PPP, PPP, PPP with Lei Fei all day and do more damage than a newbie in tekken whose just jumping around cause all kinds of frame disadvantages to themselves. I find that see more perfects in tekken than any other game. <br>
<br>
Breaking throws in VF4 is damn near impossible. You have to do the same command your opponent did to break it. So if Wolf does a half circle back, forward throw then you must do the same motion to break it. Not only that, out if Wolf Hugh list of throws you guess with one he'll do and break it in a limited amount of frames. In tekken normal throws are broken with 2 (RP) and command throws are broken with 1+2 (LP+RP)<br>
<br>
Another thing I like about tekken is that you  can &quot;Chicken&quot; moves. I don't if VF4 has it's own version of this or not but it's useful VS counters. <p><a href ="http://www.geocities.com/madartwork/Main.html"><img src="http://img2.ranchoweb.com/images/madpower/madbanner.jpg"border=0 ></a>

But when I played it I noticed that I could do what <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> I</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> wanted, the fighting system was a lot more free flowing.<br>
<br>
When VF3 came out I was really disapointed. I didnt like it at all, I thought the levels were cool but other than that I really hated the fighting system. My friend whos the tekken fanatic bought VF4 and we played it all day, I wasnt intrigued by the cumbersome fighting animation, which I think is more important than graphics. I heard they used motion capturing for it, but they failed to implement realistic physics with that realistic movement, which made the characters move awkward (the jumping knee attacks are most noticeable for the wierd physics).<br>
<br>
But what sways me the most is the fighting system. And I just kind of got tired of PKG button fighters. I dont like having to constantly be hitting different directional combonations just to do a punch that is appropriate for the situation, which gets old. Or sometimes in VF you have to do a combo just to beable to do a certain attack since it has no single combonation. What I like about Tekken is it has LP,RP,LK,RK buttons, and they are actually true left right moves.<br>
<br>
And about juggles, they are important because a good player can completely turn the fight around with one juggle. Newbies cant juggle and they never think of juggling. The person whos best at juggling will often be the one who will never get beaten. They are the hardest and most strategic part of Tekken since they arent true combo strings, you have to decide what move is best for how the person is falling and what move will keep them in the air. Just look at this video and tell me juggles wouldnt be important in a fight (this is supposed to be the hardest juggle ever done, and you also have to note that yoshimitsu has 150% life) <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.hameko.tekken.org/movie/raijin-lee-combo.mpg">www.hameko.tekken.org/mov...-combo.mpg</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
I still stand by my opinion that VF is a combo fighter. Ive seen the tournament videos and it becomes a combo&gt;guard fest. Theres a few pokes and stuff but for the most part its a combo string&gt;having the other guy guard the combo&gt;the other guy does a combo that gets guarded. Or they counter/side step the combo and hit them with their own combo which is really where the only damage comes into play. Ive tried playing the Tekken style where you hit them with short quick attacks with VF4 but it was obviously unsuccessfull since the fighting system just doesnt like that style of fighting, and when you try it you get put at a very big frame disadvantage. <p><a href="http://www.newelysium.com"><img src="http://www.newelysium.com/forum/banner.gif" border=0></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/upunisherx666.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Punisher X 666</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(8/14/02 1:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=331.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.spiderfan.org/characters/villains/file_photo/punisher.jpg width=118 height=132></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Inevitable: Virtua Fighter vs.Tekken *LONG READ*</span><hr size=1> I like the Virtua Fighter series more than Tekken,<br>

Tekken is more colorful also, the VF colors seem to be off. Instead of giving kage a nice looking blue color they give him some weird looking blue color.<br>
<br>
The backgrounds in VF look great, but you can't leave the ring. I'd like VF a lot more if you could move around the BG like in T4.

I dont think that could happen in a real fight. It's insane. Impressive, but insane. What I see wrong with this little showing is that the guy (Lee?) does the same two punches a LOT in a row to keep him up there. He only really &quot;varies&quot; it up when the guys way up there. <br>
<br>
Now to say tournaments of VF are only combo&gt;guard seems kinda crazy. Choosing which combos gonna get the guy is just like choosing which combos keep a guy in the air. Sure guys can block, but choosing how to break the block is half the fun. Tekken seems the same way. Combos make the game go around. Choosing the correct move is important in both games.<br>
<br>
Finally to say that pressing a button to block is weird is merely a preference. It further explains your Tekken loyalty. But to say it's a game flaw (which you didnt entirely say Madpower) is outright wrong (in my mind). It's just a different system. Lastly, to say that VF characters look like &quot;jagged crap&quot; (or something to that tune) seems a little harsh. I've watched some movies since you said this and the difference is very minimal in character quality. Bizzare colors and weird characters are again a preference, but it helps explain your view. <p>~Trunxx</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ushousetsu.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shousetsu</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.newelysium.com/forum/psicon.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator <img src=http://contest.polykarbon.com/badge1.gif></span><br> <font color=#336699>(8/14/02 6:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=331.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.newelysium.com/forum/kazuya.gif width=91 height=70></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Inevitable: Virtua Fighter vs.Tekken *LONG READ*</span><hr size=1> I know that would never happen in a real fight, but it still shows just how effective juggles are in the hands of someone good. And just because he does the same punches over and over again doesnt make the combo any easier to do. I gurantee that you wouldnt beable to pull even 2 of those 1,2 punches in a juggle, they arent as easy as they look. And if you closely watch just exactly what moves he is doing you will see how he does the 1,2,f and then has to hit with another move to make sure the character stays against the wall and doesnt get to far away from him. He also does some just frame moves in the juggle which is damned near impossible (just-frame moves are new to Tekken 4 where you have to hit a button during a certain couple of frames in a characters animation which will do an extra move that is usually a powerful one).<br>
<br>
And VF4's combos are preset, unlike Tekken's juggles. The juggles in tekken werent made by namco, they are made by regular people just trying to see what moves work well to keep the character from touching the ground. Only certain combos work in VF since thats how they made the system, some people happen to like memorizing those hard to do combos. People who play Tekken usually like to make up their own move list with each character without the aid of preset combos. <p><a href="http://www.newelysium.com"><img src="http://www.newelysium.com/forum/banner.gif" border=0></a></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ushousetsu.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shousetsu</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.newelysium.com/forum/psicon.gif" BORDER=0> at: 8/14/02 7:00:44 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/umisterkyo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mister Kyo</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(8/14/02 7:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=331.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://misterk.8m.net/avatar.jpg height=130 width=130></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Inevitable: Virtua Fighter vs.Tekken *LONG READ*</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Newbies in VF4 and just press, PPP, PPP, PPP with Lei Fei all day and do more damage than a newbie in tekken whose just jumping around cause all kinds of frame disadvantages to themselves.

<br>
I disagree about the newbie thing on VF4. If you're half good you know they are going to do it anyway. Then you just counter it, or throw them. Easy.<br>
<br>
You are right about the non-guard+punch throws though. Too hard to break. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :| --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/indifferent.gif ALT=":|"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  As for &quot;chickening&quot;, yes VF allows you to do that. Tapping block quickly usually cancels a move. In VF2, Akira's Knee was done by pressing kick+guard, then tapping guard again.<br>

That's why i don't like tekken as much. It is highly possible in tekken games to just juggle away and you can take like 60-100% of life. Sure, if they took a max of 30% it wouldn't be a problem for me. There's almost no limit on how many times you can juggle someone (most 2D games only let you juggle a few times to keep it fair). Juggling is also highly unrealistic. I'd rather realism any day.<br>

Well....It would have been nice if they had worked out a way for the edges to be anti-aliased. Even though PS2 has no hardware based anti-aliasing it is still possible to do. If it was gone, i bet it'd look just as good as tekken4. <br>

Eh, well that shows you havent played much Tekken. 60-100% life is almost impossible. You would have to be playing one of the best Tekken players in the world to do that kind of damage in a real fight. Now there are bugs in older Tekken versons where a character like Lei WuLong has an infinite juggle that is just d/b+2 over and over again in certain stages, but that was a bug in only the first few versions, its been fixed.<br>
<br>
Most juggles take about 25% for advanced ones and 15-20% for regular ones. They made the system to have the character drift to far away after a powerfull move so you cant hit them anymore. Only the best players have been able to beat that and juggle the character for an extended time. And thats usually through unrealistic wall setups that would never happen in a real fight unless you were fighting someone that never moved.<br>
<br>
And VF is just as unrealistic as Tekken. Since when can real people jump 4 times their height? In Tekken they jump a normal persons jump. Tekken has unrealistic juggles, VF has unrealistic arial moves.<br>

I will admit that in T4 once you launched by a good player you know your in for some damage. Most of the juggles are hard on tekken bedside's Jin's launcher, 1,2,3 d+4. That thing is too easy and takes a lot. But it's no cheaper than Lau's launcher, p,p,p, d+k. I juggle in all games and in VF4 the few juggles that work hit too much. Like you can hit someone 4 times in the air with kage and still pull off on last summersault kick when they are 1in for hitting the ground. And getting juggled against the wall (Really on that caged ring stage) You can't tech until to just go owned on the wall. In rare cases I can pull of a 60% or high combo (not juggle)with Kazuya. It's his last combo in the Demon darkness vid.<br>
<br>
Another thing I like about the tekken series it the special lighting effects each character has when they do a special move. Like the lighting effect Kazuya gives off when he hits someone. Sure it's not realistic but if want real fighting sim then buy a boxing game. <p><a href ="http://www.geocities.com/madartwork/Main.html"><img src="http://img2.ranchoweb.com/images/madpower/madbanner.jpg"border=0 ></a>

Let's not assume things we don't know. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I've played a lot of hours on tekken3. I know i have seen around the 50-60% life take by juggle combos on that game. In fact, one of my friends does it every time we have a  tournament at his house. It's also highly likely to do that amount of damage in Tekken Tag.<br>
<br>
If you don't believe me, here's a link. Certainly shows i have played enough tekken to know what i am talking about. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  This is a link to a gamefaqs tekken4 juggle FAQ. Check characters such as Kazuya, Brian, and Christie. Most of the juggles range from 30 to 50 something, so 60% wasn't such a bad guess for tekken 4, considering i have only played it for a total of about 8 hours.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://db.gamefaqs.com/coinop/arcade/file/tekken_4_juggle.txt">db.gamefaqs.com/coinop/arcade/file/tekken_4_juggle.txt</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
<br>
As for tekken 3, here's a few examples of large % combos i checked in some faqs i downloaded eons ago.<br>
<br>
Paul:<br>
<br>
{ch} d,d/f,f+1, u/f+3, 1, d,d/f,f+1 ,f, d+4,2 *note only works on big characters big time juggle 75% energy<br>
<br>
Lei:<br>
<br>
 The easiest juggle combo is uf+4,UF+4. This causes a ton of damage and all you hard to do is hold upforward and rapidly press 4. I've done over 1500 damage and over 40 hits. Others work in the same way but are much harder to do. One work of advise, these won't work in battle, so done't try it (except one).<br>

<br>
Another thing i noticed while going through the FAQs was the large number of infinite combo (particularly for Hwoarang), a good cheap way of winning. I really don't like infinites because as soon as one starts you might as well walk away from the machine. Almost zero chance of escaping unless the person doing it goofs up. Anyone know if there are infinites in any VF games? (i don't know any and i'm not saying it to annoy the people that like tekken). If you do know of any, please post a link to a combo movie/faq. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> And VF is just as unrealistic as Tekken. Since when can real people jump 4 times their height? In Tekken they jump a normal persons jump.

<br>
I remember the original two tekkens also had fairly unrealistic jumps as well. Not as extreme, but they were there. They are both unrealistic to an extent (after all, games are an escape from reality), but i'd still say that VF is more realistic than tekken.<br>

Actually, i quite like the flash effects in 3 and 4 as well.

Back to the topic:<br>
<br>
As far a jumping goes, T1 and T2 jumps were to high. VF1 and VF2's jumps were just as bad if not worse.<br>
<br>
FAQs are never right when it comes to damage. Like shou said, The arcade doesnt tell you how much damage each combo does. And the one that do take hella damage are damn near impossible to do.<br>
<br>
Were talking about T4 Vs VF4. The combos in Tekken 3 do take a lot of energy, mainly because the move take as much in a juggle as it does when you get hit with it standing. That game was made about 6 years ago, the system has changed. In Tekken Tag moves take a more in the arcade version than on PS2. But still you have 2 characters so the higher damage is makes the rounds go faster. In T4 a hard juggle doesn't take as much as a 2 hit juggle on T3. There is no infinite combos in Tekken besides the beta versions that has the parking area bug.  <p><a href ="http://www.geocities.com/madartwork/Main.html"><img src="http://img2.ranchoweb.com/images/madpower/madbanner.jpg"border=0 ></a>

I wouldn't go that far. Even an educated guess by looking at the bar and estimating, i'm damn sure that the faq is about right. Combos like this in tekken 4 for Brian looks like someone like me can even do it-<br>
<br>
Juggle starter         Juggle Finisher<br>
QCF_WS+1       | - d+2, 1,2, f,f+2                   |   44<br>
<br>
That's 44% gone. Even if it wasn't exactly accurate..That's still a lot of damage. You only have to do that combo once and almost half their life is gone. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :| --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/indifferent.gif ALT=":|"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

From the way most of the debate has gone, i assumed we were all talking about the series as a whole (such as talking about the variation in jumping in both series). Oh well. I really dislike Tag (any version of it), i'd rather 3 anyday. With the infinite combos, i was under the impression that in almost any fighting game, there are infinites. Maybe they just haven't found any yet? Judging from what i've read, most infinites are the result of really small overlooked glitches. (Such as the &quot;juggle angel repeatedly with the same move over and over&quot; one in KOF2001). <p><a href="http://pub84.ezboard.com/bprojectk" target="_blank">

I used to laugh at how floaty the jumps were in VF. But now jumping really doesnt play such a huge role anymore. <br>
<br>
Now to combos that can realy screw a person over... In VF3tb there is a rare case with Akira that if you position a person at 1/3 angle to the wall in his stage and can perform this really crazy combo, you can KO someone in one combo. I cant truly remember the combo, but it seemed logical, but highly unlikely in a real fight.<br>
<br>
The thing I dont like about Tekken now that I think about it is the juggling. The very thing we've been discussing. If a good player can get you into the air, chances are that youre not coming down for a few seconds. That in and of itself is enough to take away a little bit of fun. When I played some &quot;experienced&quot; players over at Gamestop a while back some guy as Jin whomped on me because he quite literally kept me bouncing and in the air. I got one or two hits in, but he just kept uppercutting me right before I hit the floor and opened up on me. Now I'm wondering, in a tournament is this all you see? An exchange of juggles?? Or is it more complex? Is it a game of trying to avoid being juggled? I dont understand. From this debate there seems to be a heavy basis on juggling.<br>
<br>
Once I get my PS2 in about a week I'll have my VF4. But I'm starting to consider maybe picking up a Tekken 4 if I ever have some extra cash...To see what all the fuss is about. <br>
