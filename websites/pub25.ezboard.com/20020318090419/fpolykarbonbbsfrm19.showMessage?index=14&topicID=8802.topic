I for one don't think that would be the worst thing that could happen.<br>
<br>
And the US had 375 million last time I checked.<br>
<br>
I think one of the main problems with why we have over-populations and such is things like amnesty international. They bring food to places where the people are starving. These people are starving because western culture has told them to grow, grow, grow population wise. They then get more people then their area of land can handle. Because they have more people then they can handle they have food shortages (the worlds way of restoring natural balance) When they have food shortages, we send them food, so no one dies, and they keep growing. This means that they will have bigger food shortages this year, and every year to come until we stop giving them food. We also need to stop believing that we know the difference between right and wrong, that we are meant to dominate the planet, that diversity is a bad thing, and that we need a really high population to be a successful species. Otherwise we're doomed to failure. There are certain laws that ALL life on earth has to abide by, laws of Life. Just like there are Laws of aerodynamics. And just like the Laws of aerodynamics, if you try to fly without obeying them, you'll crash and burn.<br>

If not then we'll all die soon cos we'll fill and pollute this planet up soo much there won't be any room left for anyone.  Not even the rich and famous.<br>
<br>
The only thing that can save us is if people die.  Whatever happened to survival of the fittest anyway?  Most things nowadays are handed to you on a plate.  I'm not elitist but there are people on this planet that just don't deserve to live cos they're lazy, inconsiderate and fat.

<br>
There are over 8 billion people in the world! in ASIA there are over 3billion people the most populated spot of land in the world. and that is only the costakl region of that area near china and all. there is enough room for us humans here on this earth. To think that we are gonna go extinct in the next 2 generations is just pure hype. and as for saying we are disrupting the natural order of things by feeding poor people and all is like saying that when you broke your arm you should have just died cause you would develope &quot;ganggreez and died from the massive infection unless you could fix it on it's own&quot; and saying why do we let the weak and the fat and lazy die is  elitist, the fat people will outlive us because there bodies can store more food for there system then us.. so by the time we would strve the fat person would be down to our size.<br>
<br>
as for the fact that saying that people should limit the peoulation.. they do that in some of the countries that have an overgron population... they are only allowed to keep one child.... and they usually want boys. so if a girl is born they kill her.. and are allowed to do so by law because they want a gilr... but if you'll notice by doing so they are lowering the gene pool and the chance that those boys will be able to find a mate and have a child anyways... so that is limiting the population already.<br>
<br>
next no matter how many countries we feed the people that are starving.. are usually dying anyways. and alot don't make it past 2! and then others die in the teens! and even less make it to be able to have children. by that tiem they may have lost 10 borthers and sisters. but then the only reason so many are born is because the survivla rate of children is so low... so that the childrent can work and make the family enough money to live......<br>
<br>
but here is the funny part! IT WAS THE SAME HERE IN THE US!!!!!!! beofre most families here had 6 to 10 children! that was before child labor laws with children working in coal mines just to make money to live.. but dies young from all the coal in there lungs.<br>
<br>
the human race has been through more then you could fathom and yet we still survive. no matter what! we wont go quiet in the night.... if we go it is gonna be by something far worse the over population.... so trust me.. we as humans will survive. <p><p align=center><a href="http://shadoboxxer.5u.com"><img src="http://shadoboxxer.5u.com/LinksBanners/mainbanner2.jpg" border=0></a>

Or our polution of the oceans could accidently kill of a huge percentage of the blue-green bacteria thus lowering the average oxygen level of the world, killing either us, or at least a few thousand more animal speices. And haveing the weak, stupid and lazy may be &quot;elitist&quot; I like to think of it as Natural Selection. You know that thing that happens all the time in the animal kingdom that we're egotistical enough to think we're exempt from. <br>
<br>
