Chapter One<br>
Linz, Austria 11:00pm November, 1907<br>
<br>
<br>
        The snow began to fall. The gray skies were turning black as the sun dropped below the Austrian mountains. The temperature in Linz had steadily plummeted over the past few days until it had dropped well below freezing. A young man walked out into the night. He was eighteen his short blackish brown hair rustled by the wind. He was thin and wiry with the thoughtful appearance of an artist in his looks and just a hint of insanity rising in his eyes. His laughter rang out with that of his friends as the group left the small cathedral. The church Abbot had preached a sermon that night. He shrieked to the congregation that tonight the savior would return and strike evil, preaching that they must all prepare for their return to home and to the father. The congregation had believed that he had had no more than a crazy dream, probably planted on him by one of the Jewess witches known to frequent the nightmares of religious men. The cheery group met a junction in the city streets and went their separate ways bidding good night. The young boy was almost alone. He fell silent as the last of his friends waved and turned to corner. Really, he liked the silence more than the jokes he made with his mates. The silence could never divulge his thoughts to the world. He trudged on through the deepening snow. As the boy passed a beggar on the side of the road, he contemplated a life free of the beggars and Jews who dirtied Linz’s streets at all hours. He thought of a life where he could silence the rambling of the crazy abbot with a word, a command. He would create that world maybe, he thought to himself a smile on his face.<br>
        Deep in thought, he never noticed the shady figure that had been following him from the time he had left church. The boy stopped to lit a cigarette; the small flame warmed his face. Darn but it is cold, he thought to himself. He stared up at the full moon as it appeared in a gap in the clouds; it shined pale blue with an eerie aura about it. He suddenly felt calm. He pulled out his notebook and began to sketch on the yellowing paper. Though it was what he felt like drawing, the works he produced were quite different from calming heaven above. They were depictions of war and suffering, yet these seemed to relax him more, they gave him a sense of pride. He suddenly heard snow crunching behind him. He whirled about on his heels and spied a shadow approaching him in the darkened alley.<br>
        “Who-who’s there? Who are you?” the boy did not run he could not he stood transfixed by fear.  The shadow emerged from the darkness. It was a strange boy his age if not younger. Six feet in height at least and very large build. He wore strange clothes. A long black jacket with silver embroidery reminding him of kingly garb shone in the half-light of the November moon. It was then that the light struck his face. He had pale white skin. The moonlight glinted on his silver and gold toned eyes and highlighted a small scar on his throat. But his hair! Pushed up slightly in the front by a pair of silver aviation goggles it was longer than most men’s, far longer, down to his waist, tied at the back. It appeared to be a shade of purple or blue, it was unearthly, supernatural, as his teacher would call it. Blue hair and robes that shine thought the boy; “you must truly be an angel here to guide the world to safety.” The “angel” reached into his long jacket and produced a shining pistol.<br>
        “I am Gabriel.”<br>
        The boys last action was to throw his arms up before his face before the slug lifted him from the ground and threw him down on the snow, his blood pooling in the fresh snow, his head laying on a sketch of a tank crew cheering the destruction of Linz. Gabriel, as he had came slipped back into the night.<br>
<br>
* * *<br>
<br>
        Gabriel Nightbringer stood in the balcony of the small cathedral as he had last night. He stared down into the atrium over the faint glow of his pipe. Behind him, the evening sunlight streamed in through the beautiful stained glass window, silhouetting him perfectly, however the group below him never noticed his presence. Their eyes like his were fixed on the open casket in the middle of the room. He turned to look at the window for a while. It seemed out of place here, in this cold dilapidated stone hall. It was a humble recreation of the rose window. So, this was what it was truly like? He had only seen pictures of the original that were taken when it was discovered bent and broken in the Notre Dame Ruins back in 2005. It was probably still intact here, he thought. He recalled his history lessons. 50 years after Paris had been taken out by a CHO, or Cesium Hydrogen Oxygen Bomb, archaeologists discovered the ruins of an ancient cathedral the only remaining piece was the famous ‘blessed rose of glass’ which was more than 70% intact. Perhaps he would go to see the window in its pre war condition while he was here. Why bother, he thought, this is close enough and it is in the past, it will not matter when I leave. He turned his attention back to the crowed of people in the church. They boys casket was well furnished. According to the history books, though they were not accurate on this period due to how long ago it was, told that though the boy’s father had died, the boy and his mother lived well enough. They had lived well until last night, he thought. The old woman whom he took to be Mrs.Schicklgruber was falling apart. The congregation had already stopped her from killing herself three times now se was frantically screaming and lashing at those who tried to comfort her. He felt very sorry for her. He stared in amazement at the anguish in this woman from losing someone he knew would be a murderer. He was brought out of thought by the deep penetrating voice of an old gray haired man who was finishing the boy’s eulogy. <br>
        “…we knew him well. He was a wonderful, strong souled boy. He was known by many to be fun loving, but with a deep root of responsibility. A touch of genius which some called madness to a point. Here he lies. Cold and lifeless, struck by an unknown hand, his death is a mystery. His only hope for vengeance lies in the hope that his murderer feels the pains of anguish as we do.”<br>
        That part always was the only one that seemed to hurt him. He never felt sympathy for the ones he assassinated. He followed his orders. They were all evil people who had killed or would kill, in this case, countless people. His contacts always assured him that his work was a necessary evil, though sometimes he had doubted its importance. But for some reason, just like today, going to the funeral of the person helped him feel better. He thought it was madness at first and then it seemed to be an apology for his jobs’ necessity. The old man was almost finished with the eulogy then he could leave with a sense of closure.<br>
        “We leave him now to better hands. My dear pupil, (the man must have been his teacher, thought Gabriel) our dear friend, Adolf Schicklgruber, son of Alois Hitler, may the angels guide you to a better world and a new life.”<br>
        Adolf Hitler, his life erased before it became history. Gabriel had just saved the lives of 60 million innocent people and those of countless soldiers. However, for the first time, he felt uneasiness at the situation. Gabriel shrugged off the feeling, an assassin had no use for such emotion as worry. He buttoned up his coat and snuffed out his pipe, then left the cathedral, into the cold sunny[/link] <p>"Er, der das Leben bewertet, spricht weich vom Drachen."

It makes me raise questions as to whats going to happen next or who he takes orders from and what is the present like now? My biggest question is for you though. Do you think you can top the assasination of &quot;him&quot; in your story? I'll tune in next time. Same bat-time? Same bat-channel? Its good stuff.<br>
<br>
On a side note though, one does not have to be racist to see things as racist. Clearly things such as the Holocaust and the KKK can be seen as racist by even the most un-racist people.I'm not saying that you are just that maybe you should rethink the way you put that.  <p>My old aunts used to come up to me at weddings poking me in the side while cackling and saying, "You're next." <BR><BR>They stopped after I started doing the same thing to them at funerals. </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/unoahrei.showPublicProfile?language=EN>NoahRei</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.artistnation.com/members/paris/noahrei/1942-1947r.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(3/5/02 4:03:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=546.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Interesting Novel, please cnc</span><hr size=1> Thanks, yeah you are right.

Some people saw it as racist. In my opinion they would be racist, but who knows. Anyways thanks for the comments. I am gonna try to do a chapter each weekend, but I am feeling inspired now. The novel will really take a twist. The funny thing is it was inspired by a cartoon (Timesquad on cartoon network). <p>"Er, der das Leben bewertet, spricht weich vom Drachen."
