A white, flying horse approaches. He could not believe his eyes, but he is not surprised, since he had a strange feeling today.<br>He arrives on the flying horse in Jerusalem. Slowly he makes his way through the crowd. Some people are afraid, others are yelling Messiah. He is clothed with light, that no man can see his face.<br>He stops when he sees some reporters with TV cameras.<br>He says: I am a troubleshooting engineer and live in Germany. The Lord has given me a new name. My name is David.<br>I am no prophet and do not intend to say anything about Jesus or Mohammed, maybe later. But one thing is for sure:<br>Jesus is the word, truth. God is love. Jesus did the will of the Father, that means love is higher than truth. This is my key: love is higher than truth.<br>I think the Lord has chosen me because I could forgive the worst sinner, if he repents. And I have fantasy like a child.<br>For example: A voice told me that I am the last one. What would be if I invent a time machine and become the first one? But there might be two problems: You can only travel in the spirit and you will lose all your memory. So you have to send your story first. Therefore it is written: In the beginning was the word...<br>Usually I would recommend to read the Bible, but there are errors in it. <br>So solve the contradictions with fantasy and have faith like a Muslim.<br><br>Do you know the legend of King Arthur? The rock means love, the sword means truth. The sword in the rock means true love. I have pulled that sword.<br><br>We need to feed the poor children in this world, even in Iraq. Please give donations to Life Outreach. A personal message to James Robison and all people in the world: you have a Father in heaven.<br><br>Second day:<br>David checks the different newspapers to see if they report the news unbiased. With the help of God he changes the stories wherever necessary. People need to know the truth.<br><br>The Muslims are wondering who David is. He did not contradict the Quran, and he rides on a flying horse like Mohammed. Surely he is a man of God.<br>The Christians have realized that he is the overcomer.<br>The Jews find their belief confirmed: he is the second Messiah, while Jesus must have been the first Messiah, although some are struggling with Jesus.<br>David arrives and some reporters ask if he is God.<br>David says: I am not the light, but I am send to bear witness of the light that all men through me might believe.<br>A reporter asks him about the conflict between Jews and Muslims.<br>David says: Try to imagine you have two children, one is a Jew and the other is a Muslim. What would you do? God is love. What would love do?<br>To love means to give more than you have received. Beloved means to receive more than you have given.<br>Give your brother what he needs. But remember: the final target should be to be united against the man of sin.<br>Jerusalem should become the city of love for all nations.<br><br>Third day:<br>The people are wondering who the man of sin is. All nations make preparations to send embassadors to Jerusalem. Some people say that David is the first rider of the Apokalypse, the antichrist, especially the Catholic Church has this opinion. But the majority still thinks that David is a man of God.<br>David arrives and one reporter asks him about Revelation.<br>David says: When I read the book of Revelation, I realized that it condemned a lot of people to hell. This could not be the purpose of God, since God is love. So I thought about a way to turn the prophecy upside down. Charity never fails, but prophecy may fail.<br>I risked that God would blot out my name out of the book of life, but I trusted in the love of God.<br><br>David continues: I thought about the meaning of colors: blue is the color of God, red is the color of the Holy Ghost, green is the color of the son in the flesh and yellow is the color of the son in the spirit.<br>White is the color of purity and black is the color of the Holy War, the war of truth. It will be fought with weapons like TV, radio, newspaper and Internet.<br>Prepare yourself for war.<br>You have to give a signal for unity. Change your National Hymn to the song „Brothers in Arms“ from Dire Straits. This will be your baptism of fire. Whoever plays the most beautiful song will receive the most blessings. <br><br>BROTHERS IN ARMS<br>These mist covered mountains<br>Are a home now for me<br>But my home is the lowlands<br>And always will be<br>Some day you'll return to<br>Your valleys and your farms<br>And you'll no longer burn<br>To be brothers in arms<br>Through these fields of destruction<br>Baptism of fire<br>I've watched all your suffering<br>As the battles raged higher<br>And though they did hurt me so bad<br>In the fear and alarm<br>You did not desert me<br>My brothers in arms<br>There's so many different worlds<br>So many different suns<br>And we have just one world<br>But we live in different ones<br>Now the sun's gone to hell<br>And the moon's riding high<br>Let me bid you farewell<br>Every man has to die<br>But it's written in the starlight<br>And every line on your palm<br>We're fools to make war<br>On our brothers in arms<br><br>I heard that president George Bush executed one of my sheep. He is the son of a liar. But remember one thing: if he repents, we have to forgive him.<br>Don’t be afraid. You do not know the power of love. The Lord says my heart is like a bottomless pit.<br><br>Fourth day:<br>Some countries did not report the event of the third day, especially the western countries since the media are controlled by the illuminati. David appears in such countries and repeats his words.<br><br>The arabic world is on fire, especially Iraq. They realized that they have nothing to lose, but everything to gain. Most Muslims believe that David is Mohammed, but they are also thinking about Jesus words. This is their chance to unite against the common enemy, the USA.<br><br>Fifth day:<br>Israel realizes that they have no chance but to unite with the arabic world. This is an historical event.<br><br>Sixth day:<br>The Americans are shaken in their beliefs, but their national pride prevents them to give in. They support their president and think that nobody could do anything against their superpower. But slowly their minds are changing. Some Americans prepare themselves for demonstrations against George Bush. Some people in the White House quit their job. George Bush gets nervous when he sees people clothed in black.<br><br>Seventh day:<br>Suddenly China changes their National Hymn to „Brothers in Arms“. <br>In the meantime David visits a lot of places all around the world. Some children get the opportunity to ride on the flying horse.<br><br>Eighth day:<br>All nations change their National Hymn to „Brothers in Arms“, since they want to receive the blessing.<br>George Bush realized that he has lost this fight, the public pressure is too high. He repents on a press conference. Al Gore will become the new president in the meantime.<br><br>Ninth day:<br>David says: the war of truth is not over. Investigate the Catholic Church.<br><br>Tenth day:<br>In the public opinion the Catholic Church is a false church. The pope repeats that David is the Antichrist, since he appears to be an angel of light like Satan.<br><br>Eleventh day:<br>More and more people leave the Catholic Church. It becomes an empty house.<br><br>Twelvth day:<br>David proposes to distribute the wealth of the Catholic Church to Life Outreach.<br><br>Thirteenth day:<br>Christians are wondering if they should become Muslims.<br><br>Fourteenth day:<br>The Muslims are celebrating. The Americans have realized that they have had the wrong president and are thankful for David. The first talks of reduction in weapons and space travel programs have started.<br>David arrives in Jerusalem. One reporter asks if he is Mohammed.<br>David says: I have no memory of a former life.<br>Now I have to tell you the truth about Jesus.<br>All people around David are silent.<br>David continues:<br>One day when I closed my eyes I saw a circle of light. Later I found out that God can be described by a circle: the Holy Ghost is the spirit of truth, truth is the word of God, the word of God is Jesus, Jesus is God, God is spirit and the circle is closed.<br>Jesus died for our sins and was resurrected.<br><br>One reporter asks: When Jesus is God, does that mean that Mohammed was a false prophet?<br>David answers: No, but some prophets have been influenced by Satan. For example God never tempted Abraham to sacrifice his son. And there was a reason why God wrote the ten commandments on stone. <br><br>Fifteenth day:<br>People all around the world are mourning for Jesus. At the same time they are happy that God sent David to bring truth into the world. All wars in the world have stopped, and the criminal rate has dropped dramatically. This is a time of peace. The kingdom has come.<br>David says: no man should have more money than he really needs, because the money comes from the poor people in this world.<br>David visits people with all kinds of diseases and heals them. More and more people are convinced that David is God, because he has been at different places at the same time.<br>David says: I am not God, but the spirit of Jesus dwells in me.<br><br>Future:<br>Life Outreach has become the richest organization and it is going to help all people on earth. Nobody has to feel hunger any longer.<br><br>The Americans would like David to be their president, but David says: I would like to live like a normal man.<br><br>Others would like to see his face.<br>David says: I can not show you my face, because I want to live a normal life. But one thing will I tell you: I have a dragon tattoo over my heart, because I am born in the year of the dragon, on the same date as Bruce Lee. Bruce said: you must become like water. Water is the symbol for the word of God, and the word of God is Jesus.<br><br>David says: I did not tell you about the resurrection. All people who ever lived are on earth right now. It is not a reincarnation, but a spirit transformation.<br><br>David says: everything is said and done. It is time for me to go into pension, but I have no money. If somebody could give me a little house at the beach of Florida? I love to watch the Dolphins. By the way do you know that song „Dolphin“ from Prince?<br><br>How beautiful do the words have 2 be<br>Before they conquer every heart?<br>How will U know if I'm even in the right key<br>If U make me stop before I start?<br>CHORUS:<br>If I came back as a dolphin<br>Would U listen 2 me then?<br>Would U let me be your friend?<br>Would U let me in?<br>U can cut off all my fins - But 2 your ways I will not bend<br>I'll die before I let U tell me how 2 swim<br>And I'll come back again as a dolphin<br>Why does my brother have 2 go hungry<br>When U told him there was food 4 all?<br>This is the man that stands next 2 the man<br>That stands 2 catch U when U fall (Oh!)<br>CHORUS<br>If I'm under water, will U find me?

This David shows no real emotion, he just talks. <br><br>Another thing, why should this David be able to judge others. For some reason, that just doesn't seem like a very Godly thing to do. Secondly, you suppose all Americans are prideful, while in fact you are really just making one big stereotype. Your doing almost the same with Catholics.

Nothing wrong with it per-se - most of us fantasize about what would happen if we could get certain wishes granted - but it is a horrible base for story.  <br><br>Rather than asking: &quot;what if&quot; as many good science fiction and fantasy stories do, this says &quot;so there!&quot;  Such an attitude can only turn off readers.<br><br>I'm not entirely sure if you're looking to write a political satire, a religious allegory, or something else entirely.  If the latter, I highly recommend the ficticious works of C.S. Lewis, who was a master of allegory in the 20th Century (he was also one of the best theologians of that century, perhaps even of the whole Second Millenium).  <br><br>If the former - well the names of George Orwell and Aldous Huxley certainly fit, but (personally) I find those authors to be very luddite-ish in their thinking.  Still, they wrote some good satires and raised some important questions about the era in which they lived.  Good study material.<br><br>Whatever you wish to write, if your ultimate goal is to make or sell a point, don't be confrontational about it.  Having the &quot;so there!&quot; attitude will put readers on the defensive and they will not even listen to what you have to say.  Rather, ease into your point gently, get in around any defenses or preconceptions the reader has by altering the particulars of the situation.  One very good example of this was Robert J. Sawyer's Quintaglio Trilogy (Far-Seer, Fossil-Hunter, and Foriegner) where he showed us a race of evolved dinosaurs on a distant world.  The struggle of the Quintaglios to escape their doomed planet is an entertaining read, but underneath it are parallels to the conflict between science and religion that occured here on Earth over the past five hundred years.  By couching the questions of science vs religion, evolution vs creation in an alien culture, Sawyer lets us see these questions from an entirely new perspective, and thus gives us a chance to think about these questions anew, and question our own decisions.  Much more effective than if he'd written a three-book treatise attacking the Church and religious dogma directly.  <br><br>Just my suggestions...<br><br>Andrew <p>--<br>Andrew Crisp,<br>Writer, Artist, Webmaster.<br><br><i>"The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious.
