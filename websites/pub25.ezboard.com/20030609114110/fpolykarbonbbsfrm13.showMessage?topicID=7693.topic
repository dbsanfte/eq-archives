<br>
What's going on? I've been working on my anatomy skillz all week so this is my first sketch of something different. And guess what, it started with me, messing with anatomy! That's why Cloud turned out so freakin' buff. This is my version of an older Cloud, kind of evolved as I drew it. I even changed the outfit a bit. As you can tell I started taking my time but as my time at work dwindled I started picking up the pace. :: Shrugs :: Hope someone likes it. Crits are great, comments are wonderful. Thanks everyone!<br>

<br>
anyways, the drawing is good.  I was gonna say cool then I decided it sounded lame.  but I thought it, and tahts what counts.<br>
<br>
I'm not all for the neck being the same thickness as the jaw, but it doesn't look horribly bad.<br>
<br>
he kinda has popeye forearms... and I think that his clenched hand might be a little too long.<br>
<br>
um... it looks like he's wearing a cup.  not a coffee cup either.<br>
<br>
but none of these things bother me.  I think the picture looks really good (cool), and I'm just pointing them out in case you wanted crits.<br>
<br>
comments:  <br>
<br>
beautiful eyes.  so simple, and yet so INTENSE!!<br>
<br>
I like the detailing of the small dents in the metal parts (shoulder pad especially) <br>
<br>
I like the modifications to the outfit and the boots rock my world.<br>
<br>
the hair looks really good, except theres one little piece that seems a bit out of perspective to me. (oh you know which one I mean.  the lonely one)<br>
<br>
all in all, the picture is great, grand, wonderful, and I like your choice of character.  <br>

Then, once u have a basic knowledge of the right parts and proportions, use body building mags- the muscles here are in huge form so that way u can see how they look under the skin and in real life, the way they catch light and bulge and extend. Of course, u dont have to take this as gospel, its just the way i did it, but the main point that all artists will agree is u need to- use real life reference (body building mags or anything that shows the body clearly) and learnt the basic shapes and the way the arm works- we as artists must have a knowledge of anatomy that can allow us to draw bodies from our minds and from scratch- to do this, it helps to use simple shapes and stuff to get it. it also helps to draw people when ure out, like in class i sketch peoples hands and clothes to get an ide of what it really looks like. it helps.<br>

Thanks so much for da' help. I've really been pounding at the figure drawing and anatomy stuff lately. And that advice was aimed exactly for me. I have borrowed an antomy book from my friend so I'll dive into it a bit more than I have been. I understand what you're saying. The only problem with the muscle mags are the lack of poses! No biggie though...  I want to have this knowledge. Any other helps you have would be greatly appreciated... I'm also having trouble keeping my drawings from being stiff... I wanna draw more &quot;fluid&quot;. Please help me if ya can!<br>

hehe anyway, check this site out:<br>
 <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.fineart.sk/">www.fineart.sk/</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
this has got a lot of great reference and anatomy stuff. check it out! great, i can see u r on the way, i remember when i first started drawing anatomy, about a year and a half ago, it blew me away, but i was determined to learn it the best i could-i can see u r on the track. get this down and ure work will inprove tenfold.<br>
i hope this helps u and anyone else!<br>
<br>
as for the fluid part- this comes with learning to draw body expression-- so to do this, i suggest doing very rough sketches with a line of action and drawing simplistic-no muscles, just the basic shape of a figure running, the main thing here is to get it to look like its moving or in a space. so fill up ure sketch book or, i suggest doing it on rough paper because theres no need to waste sketchbook paper-<br>
but make sure its quick, try to capture the moment and put as much energy as u can into it- u will get used to this and also get used to drawing the figure as well, which will make u more confident in ure drawings..this is hard to explain, if u need more, i can post up one of mine if i can find one. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=latinochampion>latino champion</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(6/5/03 1:55 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7693.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> help?</span><hr size=1> OK-this isnt the best example, but its close to what i mean- this was done very quickly, in about 5 minutes or less, not sure, anyways,excuse the anatomy for a sec, i tried to capture what i wanted in each one my pencil left the page very few times. im not the best artist but i do what i can to help...i hope this does.....<br>

Latino: I read your advice this afternoon while on lunch and I must admit it did help me. I was struggling this morning while churning through the pages of that antomy book. But I pressed on. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
I didn't realize how difficult the back and arms are to draw when you must draw all of the freakin' muscles!!! But I think it will pay off in the end. It's just hard work. I also tried doing some quick sketches of stick figures and stuff too. So after coutless sketches I tried to work on something that maybe I could try and finish. Here's the rough of my start... I tried to apply a bit of what I learned today. Let me know how I can improve it... crits please!!<br>
<br>
Thanks a lot, you've done so much already!<br>

PS: Latinochampion, next time you draw something could you post or send me the images of it as your progress (your skeleton, to when you start fleshing it out, etc.). My next problem is foreshortening... blah.<br>
