                             A Lesson in Good Taste<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Early one Sunday morning Steve sat on his couch, still in his pyjamas, sipping<br>
coffee and lazily scanning the paper.  The front page reads “Bill Gates Aquires Pop<br>
Group”.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Yeah what else is new.  Why do they always bury the horoscopes” Grumbling to<br>
himself.  Just then his friend walks in the door, grabs a beer from the fridge and takes his<br>
place on the couch.  Steve barely takes notice until his friend says.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Hey man what’s new.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Looking at the horoscopes I finally found them” he says reading as he goes. <br>
Cancer (June 21 to July 22) - If you don’t act quickly the spice girls may release a new<br>
album.  Steve throws down the paper in shock.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “This looks like a job for THE GOOD TASTE SQUAD” both him and his friend<br>
chant in unison, while simultaneosly tearing off their clothes revealing colorful tights<br>
underneath.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Steve??? you sleep in that” Little James says.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Why yes I always have to be prepared.  How many times have I told you not to<br>
use my real name, you’ll blow my cover”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Ok, JAMES” Rolling his eyes.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In a tough super hero voice “Have you been working out.” Little James just<br>
shakes his head.  “Who would be evil enough to bring back the spice girls.”  Little James<br>
looks at the headline of the paper<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Holy white shoes after labour day James”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “What is it partner”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Look at the headline”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Yes I know, breast enlargment 50% off, but what does it mean”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Not that one”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Oh Bill Gates of course, and the only thing that can vanquish that demon is the<br>
Sword of UNIX”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “But that’s in the museum under heavy guard”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Fear not.  To the Good Taste Mobile” They do a lap of the apartment then head<br>
to the parking garage to a beat up pinto still in primer.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Hey Steve, when are you going to paint that”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “What did I...”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I mean James” Correcting himself he opens the passenger door and gets in. <br>
After several tries James finally starts the car and they head to the museum.  Meanwhile<br>
in a secret lair somewhere in seatle Bill Gates sits chuckling.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “The shareholders thought I was foolish for bugging the good taste squad<br>
headquarters, now we’ll see who’s foolish.”  Gates claps his hands to summon his<br>
faithful servant.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Yes master” he says out of breath as he comes running.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I’d like you to bring me the UNIX katana”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Yes master!!” He says with a smile then he exits as promptly as he entered.<br>
Back in the museum our heros are at the ancient swords exhibit.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Excuse me sir” asks James.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Yes!!” Says the excited security guard “How can I serve you”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Can I take a closer look at that”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Are you refering to the 20th century hand crafted UNIX katana that is Bill Gates<br>
one and only weakness”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Why yes I think so”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Sure, here ya go” The guard unlocks the case and hands the sword to James.<br>
“Why are you wearing tights”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Have no fear citizen” James says as he escapes the museum leavig the guard<br>
scratching his head.  Outside the museum James hands the blade to Little James.  Little<br>
James feels a tap on his shoulder and a beautiful dark haired woman whispers in his ear<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Is that a katana in your tights or are you just happy to see me” Little James<br>
weakness is bad pick up lines.  One thing leads to another and he’s picking her up for a<br>
date.  After a few drinks he brings her back to his apartment.  He wakes up the next<br>
morning with a mild hangover watching the morning news talk about a bizzare robbery at<br>
the museum involving a couple guys in tights.  He shuts off the tv and rolls over then<br>
notices a note.  “Dear Little James,  Sorry for leaving so quick but I had to get your sword<br>
to My boss.  Love Jacob”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Meanwhile somewhere else in the city the beautiful lady named Jacob is meeting<br>
with her boss.  “Is this what you were after”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Yes, thank you.  Mr. Gates will be very pleased.  Now if you excuse me I have to<br>
make a call”  The woman walks off turns a corner and dissapears then the man dials a<br>
number.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Hello, did you get it”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Yes master”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “good now get rid of those useless superheros and I will be free to create Spice<br>
Girl cd’s”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Yes master” again with a smile obviously delighted in this chore.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Back at Little James appartment the phone is ringing.  Eventually he picks up and<br>
of course it’s James.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Hello” Groggily.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Hey, did you here we’re wanted”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Do you know what time it is”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Yeah about 2:00pm”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Oh, well what are we going to do”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “We’ve got to hide, I know the perfect spot.  To the Good Taste Mobile!!!”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “How about you just pick me up” He rolls over and hangs up the phone and waits<br>
for his friend.  After a few minutes James arrives and takes him to an abandoned<br>
building.  They unload some equipment from the back of the pinto and haul it up to the<br>
top floor then examine maps to try and think of where the sword might be.  The work is<br>
so exhausting that eventually both of them fall asleep.  When they wake up they find that<br>
they are bound to a chair and both Jacob and her Boss are standing there.  Jacob’s boss<br>
starts talking.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “My name is Big James, and you are both tied to chairs.  This building has been<br>
scheduled for demolition for months.  Obviously it’s not a safe place to sleep.  It should<br>
finally be demolished in about 5 minutes.  We have to go and get a safe distance away. <br>
Front row seats were a little to expensive for us, they’ll cost you your lives.  Farewell” <br>
Big James and Jacob climb up to the roof and jump to the next building while James and<br>
Little James try and escape.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “How are we going to get out.  We can’t let them release another Spice Girl cd”<br>
James says while starting to panic.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Don’t worry they’re idiots look how old this rope is it should break easy”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Oh, Right we’ll use the Good Taste Squad Super Strength”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Oh boy,  1...2...3....SUUUUUPER STREEEEEEEENGTH” They both use all<br>
their strength and break the ropes then climb up to the roof to follow Jacob and Big<br>
James.  They spy them a couple buildings away and start running, leaping from roof to<br>
roof.  Jacob and big James notice and split up to try and confuse our heros but it doesn’t<br>
work.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Little James you take Big James, I’ll take Jacob”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “But I want Jacob, you take Big James”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Ummmm, whatever” They split up as well and follow their own villain.  Little<br>
James catches up with Jacob and corners her.  She tries to do some Matrix style kung-fu<br>
which causes Little James to yawn because it’s so cliche.  He solves it quick by pulling<br>
out a gun and shooting Jacob.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Curse you James, now I’m incapacitated” cries Jacob in pain.  Jacob then<br>
procedes to Bill Gates lair.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp On the other side of the coin James has Caught Big James and they’re in a furious<br>
fight.  Big James is whirling the UNIX sword around tring to hit James while james runs<br>
around kicking Big James in the shins while shouting “Biff”, “Bang!!”, “POW!!!”. <br>
Before too long James’ plan works and instead of shins Big James is standing on two<br>
very large bruises which causes him immense pain and makes him fall.  James kicks him<br>
once more just for spite then takes the sword from Big James’ hands then goes in search<br>
of Mr. Gates.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Little James has allready found Bill Gates and they are standing at opposite ends<br>
of a conveniently long hallway.  The both pull out guns and charge at each other firing<br>
completely missing each other but finally ending up face to face in classic stand off<br>
formation with guns to each others heads.  Little James pulls his trigger first “CLICK”.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Looks like your out” Smiles Mr. Gates as he pulls the trigger as well<br>
“BANG!!!!”.  The gun goes off and little James falls limp to the floor.  James is standing<br>
behing Bill Gates and witnesses the fall of his comerade.  He draws his sword and shouts <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “En Garde” Bill just shrugs and pulls out a light sabre.  James sword starts to<br>
glow green with envy, I mean power.  The sword gives James new strength and in one<br>
quick blow he hits a keyboard uploading pictures of Bill Gates superimposed with the<br>
spice girls causing his stock to drop to $0.02 hitting the enemy where it hurts causing him<br>
to faint.  “There’s my two cents” hearing that Little James stands up and shakes himself<br>
off and laughs.  “What the...”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Holy your socks don’t match James it was only a flesh wound”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Oh, I get it, only a flesh wound” And the both laugh happily ever after and the<br>
world is a more tasteful place. <p>--

It does have a light air about it, which is good considering all that has been happening these days. Most people are all depressed, we need some bright cheer to keep us going. I liked the juxtaposition of Gates to the Good Taste Squad. Some things could be edited out in my opinion, as things always can be edited. My over all impression was a good one. Your use of specifics and imagery in certain places adds a lot to the overall picture.<br>

However, The whole mr. Gates thing you could only develop it so far. And some people are just tired of hearing about him, so you'd lose some audience. If you were really going to spend time working on something, do it with something completley original. (i.e. no borrowed names or such things.) But of course do what ever you like, its your work. I just present a point of view so that you might consider it from varying angles. <br>

but he's the president of the more money than brains club and is instantly recognizable...I guess I could make up a name but then it would miss the point a little bit...I dunno...<br>
It was intended as a massive joke and i was trying to toss in as many cliche's as possible...kinda old school batman style...<br>
Both Mr. Gates and the spice girls are portrayed as bad things...with the spicegirls being more of a weapon than a villain themselves...<br>
It's not really meant for mass appeal...just to make my friends laugh :-) <p>--

I like to see peoples thought processes, hence I like to post more than one liners as comments. As writers we are constantaly learning from one anohter. We draw elements from everywhere and synthesize them, creating our own creative style. In order to become more masterful ourselves we must learn from our peers and from those who are considered masters. <br>

I never got the feeling like it went on to a tangent that detracted from the overall story. Sometimes comics can take weird angles and you kinda forget what was going on in the beginning. But in this case I'd say you do a good job of keeping the reader into the story from beginning to end.<br>

I was trying to think up a succinct way to say my comment. I liked the idea of the UNIX sword (i assume that is to what your were refering). It was a nice way to incorporate the UNIX element. Coupled with James it gives an image of a valiant underdog going up against colossal odds. In the end it is used to deal him a harsh blow, but not a deadly one. ( the starwars imagery at the end i thought was funny cause you make good mockary of it.) Personally, I found your use of the 'sword' a key element in the story. This is becuase as I have noted, it presents the underdog lashing back at the corporate giant, in a comic an humorous manner. It allows exploration and thought outside the comic. <br>
Its to damn bad no one but us is comenting on our works. It limits the response perspective.<br>
