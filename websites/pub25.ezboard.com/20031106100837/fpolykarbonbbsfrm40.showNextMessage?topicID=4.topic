I'm 15 years old and I have the responcibility of a 30 year old. I have the mind and maturity of a 20 year old, and the smarts enough to go insane. <br>
<br>
Sometimes I feel like I want to go crazy. Just have a person that I can see and talk to and he will share the same ideas and tell me the answers to my questions.<br>
<br>
One time I thought too much. I came up with the conclusion that all people are crazy at one time or another. By the way that we act, our behavior, the things that we put up with-- being allowed to fall into mind-boggling propaganda that gets our money for things like &quot;male enhancement pills.&quot;  People are crazy to follow along with things like that. <br>
<br>
I've had precognitions of the future and new inventions and products not of what could happen in a movie, but of the futures reality. for example:  bio-metal--from spider webs,  crystal T.V's, magnetic sheilding, anti-gravity machines, cures for all kinds of diseases, human genitic decodeing and manipulation, a machine that can generate more electricity in one minute than a hundred-thousand ton neutron bomb, an ansible-- a machine that can send messages through space-time instantly. Those were just some insites of the future, could you check out the validity of some of them? Thank you. I have to get some of this off of my mind. If some of this does infact happen... technology might just be the downfall of humanity.<br>

<br>
I don't know what this feeling is. my stomach is in a knot and im very, very angry.  I hate school.  Teachers hand out homework and excersize their authority by telling people who are younger and less experienced what to do.<br>
People who do that are insecure. they need to have the feeling that they are always better than someone else. <br>
<br>
Ya know, one thing that i can not stand is for some adult figure and well behaved person to misuse their authority. I don't have a problem with authority, just the people who want to use it for their own betterment.<br>
<br>
Another thing that i can not stand is for these girls to dress up and act slutty but to not want to do what it is that they are dressed up for! &quot;Just because I'm dressed this way does not make me a slut.&quot; one girl said that to me and i was ready to pop. What should you say?! <br>
<br>
people in their little clicks, not wanting to venture out into the unknown of their school because they care about what others think about them. thats sad my friend.<br>
I can't stand it when someone thinks that they are better than someone because the way they look and act.. now that really pisses me off.<br>
<br>
thats just the way it aall has to go. the rich get richer, the poor ger poorer by a government who is sopposed to be infallable. (like the Catholic church.)  <br>
<br>
humanity is @#%$. we all know it one way or another. we are screwed. the things we do, the things we say, the feelings that are passed throughout the day. we are just digging our own little holes to die in. I wish people could change their ways. but knowing my luck no one will have the brutal honesty to tell it to anyones face of how they feel. so this is good bye, fare well, adios, bon voyage, see ya lata-- im gone.<br>
<br>
please respond if you have anything to say. thank you for all who read this. and give your thoughts about me no matter how bad it may hurt. if i have told some truth or just plain out tell me that im crazy... i don't care. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=angeloflight7>angeloflight7</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pre-Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(3/28/03 4:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm40.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I'm Jacks complete lack of suprise</span><hr size=1> Yeah... its like 6 in the morning and I'm sitting here drinking my tea (or jet fule as someone once called it- tea with like ten teaspoons of sugar... lol<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   ) preparing myself for the ordeal that I will soon have to endure. My daily journey through school, watching the masses of idiosy as they buzz along shuving me out of there way, screaming profanities... ughh... I hate school so much, just as you do, I guess. I feel like people are so stupid sometimes... I just want to make a bunch of signs that say &quot;I'M STUPID, WATCH OUT!!!!&quot;, walk up to the majority of the school population and say, &quot;HERES YOUR SIGN!&quot; In fact the teachers would probably be first... Yeah my U.S. History teacher, Mr. Cambell would be the first on my list. Hes really smart, hes a pretty good teacher, but is cynical and stupid when it comes to anything else. Then of course theres the idiots that you were talking about... people with the intelligence of a small invertabrate who somehow, by some weird, sick twist of fate get dropped into a position of authority. So now, you're stuck having to answer to someone who is on a completely different and much lower intellectual level than you. I swear, I feel like sometimes I'm more mature than people over twice my age... some people just don't get it... and think that just becuase they've been on this earth loger than you have and just because you have the sucky title of &quot;teenager&quot;, or &quot;adolecent&quot; that there smarter than you... maybe not because they're so intelligent, but because you know absolutely nothing at all.

Anyway, you may feel more mature now, but don't lose sight of the grand scheme of things:  you'll be old like that one day, and probably cenile.  Just because you can't relate to someone's opinions or understand the motivation behind their actions doesn't mean it's immature.  That, my friend, is an assumption, and assumptions get one in trouble.  FYI: between the ages of 13-20, the average human loses 30% of his or her gray matter in his/her brain.  That's quite a chunk.  More than half of it is from the memory section, so say good-bye to all of your attained memories of less-than significant events.  Kiss about 40 IQ points good-bye, too.  I've noticed this in myself, and I don't do any sort of drug or drink or anything, and my IQ has dropped about 20 points since 13.  my IQ is 168, btw.  Be humbled!  Haha, all jokes aside....For people who claim to be so incredibly intelligent, your complaints seem somewhat unoriginal and shallow.  Nice to meet a fellow psychic, though!

hey guys, thought i'd add a bit. <br>
<br>
sure some of us can make predictions of the future, ive had my own. and we can easily make devises like magnet sheilds and greater energy sourses. but the question is can we handle it when we get it?<br>
<br>
one of Einstein's greatest quotes was... &quot;our technology has surpassed our humanity greatly, but maybe one day our humanity might surpass our technology.&quot; by making these devises we will probly end humanity.<br>
<br>
scientist have proven that we only use 10% of our brains full compasity. what holds itself in the other 90%? and wut can we do with that 90%? should we know?<br>

That's a.) on average, and b.) at a time.  Given that almost 50% of your brain just holds either memories or motor skills, you aren't always considering your past, or doing every type of muscle contraction possible, so the real question is one of how much of our right lobe we use.  That is where IQ comes in.<br>
<br>
I think your friend has a valid topic, however, with the idea that our responsibility is lacking, and curiosity (or greed, whatever you wish to call it) has exceeded the responsibility.  I completely agree...in general.  There are always exceptions (hehehe, ever hear &quot;this is the only rule with no exceptions&quot;? it's a paradox..).  Some people genuinely want to help others, and not just use the technological advances for their own gain.<br>
<br>
Thus, a question I present:<br>
<br>
Is it truely to be selfless if you are only selfless to gain access to a reward?  Ie, not sinning so you may get into heaven.  Seems like bribery, to me.<br>
<br>
Just a random query I thought I'd bring up to such obviously intellegent people....<br>

<br>
About the whole doing good works to get to heaven thing in the last reply... uh... thats not quite how it works. The Bible says that we don't get to heaven through our works - &quot;We are saved by grace, not by works for it is the gift of God lest any man should boast.&quot; Its not, &quot;Oh, I've been a good person, I havent done all that much wrong... I deserve to go to heaven.&quot; We all deserve hell (now, I don't know that anyone agrees with me about the whole heaven, hell, God thing, but this is what I believe) and the truth is that our best will never be good enough for God. Thats why we are saved by grace and not by works. <br>

Ive come to realize, over the span of my almost insignfigant life that we are just that, totally and utterly non-important to humanity. Therefore, because we have this, striving want, for why we are here, why humans behaive the way they do, it would all eventually be in vain. What would you do with that information when you got it? Perhaps your perspective on life would be changed and youd have a better grasp and understanding of the human phyci(sp) but youd still have to deal with everything every <br>
day of you life. <br>
<br>
We are all selfish. Everything we do in our life, is bettering ourselves in some fashon. Wether it be giving a poor person money (self gratification) or buying your mate a present for a holiday (again self gratification). Everything you do is selfish.. and thats the truth. Its not that we are bad people for it though, its just human nature, there is no way you can do something withought it benifiting you in one way or another. Perhaps the drawback of this action may be greater than what is gained, but that is totally irrelevent when discussing our minds.<br>
<br>

Its not that humanity will be distroyed and we are all going to hell... not that... its that we as humans have grown up to believe that someday we are going to become movie stars or rock stars-- but we won't. and we are slowly learning that fact. im just trying to tell it as it is.<br>
<br>
I don't care how smart you are- how ugly you look- what kind of cloths you have on. yes that tells who you are but really... I don't give $H|T.  I could care less if you are popular or look better than someone else. Its our problem for falling into a place where propaganda and advertising envelope us and mold us into someone that we are not and in some cases someone that we do not want to be.  People are stupid because of what they do because someone else told them to do it some one more &quot;popular.&quot;  <br>
<br>
Im trying to make all of you question yourselves on how you act, what you do, how you do things because of the more &quot;popular&quot; people.  &quot;Popular&quot; as in the people that you look up to, the people you hang out with, your rold modles, the magazines and tv that you stare at. <br>
<br>
Now there is a question of &quot;popularity&quot; in schools.  Some of your class mates hang out with the most favorable just to try to become another &quot;popular&quot; person so infact they use the most &quot;popular&quot; to become &quot;popular&quot; themselves.  <br>
<br>
This is why there are clicks.  There are clicks of all different kinds. &quot;popular, geek, smart, outkasts, lame, jock, baseball, basketball, football, all different kinds.&quot; I do not see the need to be in a group just because you are into something and you do not want to talk to anyone else because they aren't as &quot;POPULAR!&quot; <br>
<br>
Thats the students, and now here is the teachers. Teachers have the authority to tell someone to do something, they MISUSE their authority to tell a child to do physical labor. And if they do not do that physical labor and acctually get to a class on time then they get an F for the day.  Getting a failing grade like that does not measure how smart you are like grades are sopposed to do.  Grades are a way of controlling students.  like so many others I could give a @#%$ and a care less if i get detention because im just going to skip it<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  .  Also this is that teachers are sopposed to be teachers, right? so why do they teach their biased views to their students? Did any of you know that Martin Luther King was an alcoholic? No teacher tells you the bad side about their favorite people in the world. Abraham Lincoln was so depressed he almost committed suicide-- but he couldn't do that so he payed a person's family-- john wilks booth to kill him! NO one knew that? I can't stand teachers. Especially when they fail you just because they don't like you.<br>
<br>
I should write a book- the top ten things that are @#%$ up in this world, shouldn't I?<br>
<br>
I agree with this statement that ExiledCow said...<br>
<br>
I dont think we are going anywhere, and there is no need to ask, until mankind as a whole decides to mature. <br>

Maybe its in the form of propiganda or maybe in the form of your physical surroundings but outside influnces do change the way we act. Theres nothing that can solve that... Except go senile. Popularity has to do with insicurity, you feel as ifyou dont belong therefore you try to act cool. teachers have the right to do what they choose when reguarding your grades, whilst it may not be too your likeing, authority overules what we want or think, its just the truth. And another thing, some people would rather be in a fake bliss rather than knowing the hard cold truth. Not everyone wants too know the truth... tahts why  they bend things to make it all spring-like and fun. Anway most of that stuff is trivial anyways... let dumb people be dumb... let the inelegent ones be intellegent, and then, let you be you. <p>-Moooo!-</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=infinitenoises>infinitenoises</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(3/30/03 5:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm40.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> insert witty subject</span><hr size=1> &quot;... let the inelegent ones be intellegent, and then, let you be you.&quot;<br>

<br>
none of you don't really know what im talking about. im just speaking my mind on certain issues that you could  comment on ... im not talking about a specific thing like school. im talking about things that piss me off and things that humans as a whole need to change.<br>
<br>
now, for the subject today, government. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   GOVERNMENT is another way of saying &quot;Better ...... than ......  you.&quot;   I don't really care for the government all that much. really i could care less. im much more of an anarchist. but i do not show it physically.  <br>
<br>
for example, &quot;it makes no sense to me why politicians make $150k a year and $15K per month after they retire(senators etc) while the men and women fighting for our country only make $30-$40K a year and $1500 after they retire. the ppl that actually do somethin and put their life ont he line are getting paid less then the politicians that do very little for us.&quot; -one of my best friends, kevin. <br>
<br>
now the government may not be all about money but they do seem to &quot;care&quot; about more people over there in foreign countries then they do their senior citizens back INSIDE the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>

In relative context to about 90% of people on this board, I'm spelling GOD.  Check my other posts, I bet that's one of maybe three or four errors I've made.  I knew it was senile, as I've used that word since, what, third grade.  Puh-leeze.<br>
<br>
And you've got some of your facts wrong, Snake Blitz.  And in later years, perhaps you'll realize the immatture views of the anarchist.  Perhaps you should read <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">Lord of the Flies</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->, it can teach you to respect and appreciate government in general.  And I take offense to that, as I'm in the military.  You are obviously underappreciative or undereducated...either or.  You choose.<br>
<br>
As for your statement regarding senior citizens...perhaps you have had a bad experience, but in general, people in this country are well-taken-are of.  I know there are issues regarding social security, medicare, abuse at old-folks'homes, etc, but if you only knew the standard of living outside our country, you'd be amazed at how we pull it off.<br>
<br>
Once again your little hydrogen thing proves you don't do your homework.  I'm sad to tell you it's not so simple as you seem to think it is.  It takes huge amounts of energy to seperate hydrogen from H20.  Scientificamerican.com or something, read up on it.<br>
<br>
Finally, I know that law must be local, or state, and should probably be revoked, if it is *in fact* illegal to wear a costume after halloween.  I know in Louisiana, mimes at New Orleans would be arrested if it were true.  Same for Venice in Cali.  And I wear costumes to SCHOOL all the time.  Then, dramatists/thespians would be criminals, as well.  I'm willing to bet there's more to the law than meets the eye.  Every country has stupid laws....you can be arrested for not saluting the flag on certain days in England...heck, I bet England has some of the most prejudiced and unneeded laws of any country.  It's a matter of deciding whether a new law needs to be put in place, or an old one removed.  Bam!  ::Emmeril style::<br>

Thing is... the reason that the goverment makes such a mass of money when looking at the ratio of Goverment high ranking officals to soliders is beacause there the brains behind the operation. Its been like this for what... Ever? A person that can strategically place troops, make laws, handle forehn affairs, and has a big hand in what is happening in the Usa is of course more on the priority then those putting there lives on the line. It may not be moral... but hey.. who the hells going to take out there little book of morals in the middle of a constant war?<br>
<br>
I may  not agree with all the things going on in the goverment but no goverment, or nothing for that matter is fullproof.. therefore loopholes and dumblaws will remain. I think we gotta a pretty good govermental structure, just bad leadership at times. <br>
As to reguarding the hidrogen car thing...<br>
<br>
I love the randomness. <br>
<br>
<br>
We are dumb. If we found an eaiser way to bake the same quality bread wed prolly do it the old way because where old fashioned.<br>
Then again, if enough people do it, the old way stops becoming old fashioned and just becomes a waste of time. <br>
<br>
<br>
Oh yeah, and another thing... theres no reason to be arguing over grammer and spelling, it doesnt take a genuis too open up microsoft word and revise there post... Then again... im really lazy. <br>
