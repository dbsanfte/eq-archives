(i have a general idea but the details are rather foggy at the moment.) i can tell you that it's a story about magic in a modern world. kind of like weaveworld (but not as scary) and harry potter (although for more grown up people. <br>
i wrote this after reading two volumes of the gormenghast trilogy by mervyn peake and wanted to try my hand at the intense descriptions he uses in his stories. if you don't understand what's going on that's okay. i'm looking for feedback more on the style than anything else. it's a little long (two pages on my computer), sorry. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

The Woman on the White Horse<br>
<br>
by a.g. brown <br>
<br>
Prologue<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The high, crumbling walls of the alley were filled with the sound of rain the way a river canyon is filled with the sound of the river, every drop a weight hammering tirelessly at the pavement below. Water bubbled and ran in countless tiny streams down the faded, night-stained brick and sang as it fell through the air. Shreds of newspaper, sandwich wrappers and other bits of assorted trash were quickly reduced to a pulpy mush and swept down the storm drains. Deep shadows clung to the buildings, finding a toehold in every nook and cranny and filling the spaces with darkness until the uneven brick might have been smooth and unbroken. <br>
In the midst of this rushing darkness a lighter shadow moved in the blackness and then was still again, disappearing into the consuming blanket of night with barely a trace. However, a patient observer might be able to discern the pale oval of a face, cloaked in shadow, the skin nearly translucent from the brutal hammering of the rain. Slowly, the slump shouldered figure of a young man might be separated from the dim surroundings, his back curved with the weight of the storm and the dark night, and yet there was a sense of expectancy about him, of energy hidden beneath the weary slope of his body. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It was difficult to know how long he had been standing there, hands shoved deeply into his pockets, his eyes roaming restlessly up and down the street, first scanning the darker distances and then slowly creeping back to study the seemingly garish light of the hospital building opposite. His clothes were dripping with water, the collar of his jacket turned up in a useless defense against the hounding of the elements. He blinked once or twice as the rain made a constant play of motion over his face, writing in strange invisible lettering on the high curve of his cheekbones and dripping with unceremonious solemnity from the tip of his nose. But he remained perfectly still, only his eyes roving back and forth, searching for something or someone in the miserable night. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Finally a tall dark man was seen striding out of the light, his face in deep shadow beneath a broad-brimmed hat, his shoulders lined in fire as the falling rain caught the amber and red lights behind him and scattered it into the darkness. His face was thin and sharp with a severe slash of a mouth, a recklessly carved nose and eyes set so deeply in their sockets they gave the impression that they would be shadowed even in the bright light of day. The watcher stirred, prying one cold hand out of his pocket to push a piece of fair, damp hair back out of his eyes and they stood for a moment looking at each other, the younger man a little paler than the surrounding night, the older a little darker. Lightening crackled overhead, blue-white light piercing even the deepest shadows of the alley, repainting the two men in identical hues and shadows, so that for a brief second they might have been brothers or even twins. Then night fell again with a clap of thunder and the disparity regained its grip.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The pale man shifted slightly, his rain-drenched shoes make an ungainly squelching noise, even as his impatience threatened to get the better of him. The older man stood for a long moment, head bent, his face hidden in shadows before finally he sighed; a deep and sorrowful noise that was nonetheless nearly drowned out by the intensity of the water falling around them. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Mirre will live.” The words were heavy, carrying with them an unspoken burden. “Her wounds appear to be primarily physical and will be dealt with well enough in this place.” He stopped, the silence blending seamlessly with the night.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “And Allana?” The younger man asked softly, a tremor in his voice betraying his intuition. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Nothing could have been done. She was beyond their medicine long before they found her.” The muscles in his jaw worked to combat the emotions playing in his eyes and then he was under control again. “Perhaps,” he said reluctantly, “it was better this way.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The other’s eyes flashed with anger but he snapped his mouth shut, barely catching the obvious but painful question before it could be heard, although its absence was nearly as painful. “What do we do now?” he asked after regaining his composure. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “The same as we have always done. We watch and we protect until there are none left to watch or protect. That is our job, that is our calling. We have no other recourse.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “And Mirre will be safe in that place?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Yes. Those who are responsible for this whole tragedy will not disturb her again for some years.” He noted the unformed protest in the younger man’s posture. “Her grandfather is with her and will take care of her for the time. We have other things to attend to in the interim.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Perhaps they will leave her alone altogether.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The dark man shook his head sadly. “That, I fear, is not to be.” He fell silent again, ignoring the other’s curious stare. The rain began to slacken and a strange calm fell over the street. “Come, it is time that we left.” He seemed to give himself a shake, as if waking up from a daydream. He cast one last glance at the bright lights of the hospital and then, almost forcibly, turned and began walking down the sodden street. After a moment the younger man followed, although he stopped several times to gaze back at the building before the night and the distance swallowed him completely.<br>

The only thing I can find, which is really just nitpicking, is that I would change the order of some desriptions to add a more potent feel to the piece. It really is good though and doesn't have a lagging problem, which would be a big problem and often is with un-skilled writers attempting this particular style. So I guess all that I would do is try re-arranging some of the very vivid and really quite nicely done descriptions. Keep up the solid work. <p><BR>Give a man a fish and he'll eat for a day.<BR>Teach him to fish and he'll sit in a boat and drink beer all day.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uemmapeel1601.showPublicProfile?language=EN>emmapeel1601</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(5/10/02 1:15:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=622.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: stuff</span><hr size=1> thanks! <br>
any suggestions about what i should rearrange? (i did that once already before i posted this, trying to create the most solid writing that i could.) i can see that it might work better differently but i'm not sure what i should move. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
