please tell me what you think about it~!<br>
<br>
i've posted it before, but then i thought i'd add a little foreword.. its a wahnabe stream-of-consciousness written on a rejective impulse against the &quot;Dream of a Ridiculous Person&quot; by Dostoyevsky.<br>
<br>
again, i'd really appreciate your feedback<br>
<br>
enjoy!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
“I... I was a sinner, for, I did sin, I always sinned, and when we sin, we enjoy it only for a short time, (that, if we are rational) because shortly afterwards come the feelings of shame, that torture you and make you regret what you did, or even feel remorseful about it, and yet nevertheless we sin, and suffer consequences, and then sin again, and then again suffer…<br>
…and now, after I died, I realize that I did not have to suffer, I did not have to regret my wrongdoings, because it is natural, it all is natural: when we have dreams, dreams of better times, they evolve into wishes, and desires for the better times to come, then these wishes evolve into intentions to built those desired dreams, and we do go and build this future, create the good, and then the better times do come, and bring happiness, they bring contentment to us…<br>
…but only together with this happiness there is another feeling, a feeling that I was always afraid of, that I was always (back when I was alive), I always reduced and hid and tried not to accept its existence, thinking that it was wrong, and now I laugh at myself, because I understand that that feeling was necessary…<br>
…this feeling that came together with the realisation of contempt and accomplishment, this feeling was one of a slight discomfort somewhere around the left side of the chest, a slightly noticeable pain in the back of my neck, and maybe other people feel it differently, and they may call it sadness or vexation or maybe even rage, it doesn’t matter, but I only know that it grew when I perceived my accomplishment, or the accomplishments of the others…<br>
…and then it slowly accumulated and it expanded to a real, strong rage, which you may even call a pain, which resonated in my back, just below the shoulder-blades, and I felt this pain with every breath I inhaled…<br>
…so then I went and caused destruction, not necessarily to my own accomplishment, but to something else, yet nevertheless I did cause some destruction, following this strange feeling, and I feasted in the fountain of evil I produced, and I saw the others do it, I saw them enjoy evil, yet most of them, when they destroyed themselves and sometimes that what they perceived around them, they afterwards regretted it…<br>
…and so then when I saw it I understood that this feeling, this desire for evil, it must be natural, and that it must have a meaning…<br>
…and then I understood, that by committing evil, by destroying, we give the others and ourselves the impetus to wish, the objective to create, the cause to desire, to wish and to dream, and indeed, observing the destruction gave me the spur to go and create, to go and produce… <br>
…and so I deduced, that it was simply the opposite but equally necessary force in the Cycle, a counter-force to creation, which allows humans to create for an infinitely long time, which motivates humans for an infinitely long time…<br>
…and I saw fools not understand the necessity of this counter-force, (and indeed I was among them) and try to prevent destruction and vandalism, as ignorantly as one would oppose the coming of a night, or a winter, arguing that it is bad, but not understanding that it is necessary, because afterwards a morning will come or a spring, and will illuminate the world with the life-yielding sunshine and let the world flourish and bloom and approach the absolute magnificence…<br>
…and now I understand that in this lies the beauty of nature: thus the good always compensates the bad, and in reverse – the evil is counterbalanced by the good, and thus the interplay of good and evil never reaches an equilibrium, which is wonderful, because the tendency toward this equilibrium yields a purpose to live, more precisely, the understanding of this cycle, the very understanding allows to see the meaning of life, it provides the motivation to live…<br>
<br>
<br>
But even when I died, I could not understand, I could not accept, I could not fathom this truth, this mechanism, because I could not accept that good and bad, white and black, up and down were in principle, the same thing, in the sense that they are equally important and that they are equally necessary for our spiritual health…<br>
…but now I do, I do understand it, because here in Heaven, - yes, I am in Heaven, - here there is no evil, they do not permit it, everything is good, always was, and, what is infinitely terrible, it always will be, every aspect of this life, it will be perfect, and I will not be allowed to cause destruction or to demolish, to counteract this perfection…<br>
…I mean, I don’t know how long I have been here, and at first, I must accept, I even enjoyed it, - the singing of the birds, the green of the trees, and so forth, but then this mechanism that I carried with me, within me, from Earth, this seed, soon it gave a sprout…<br>
…and then a weed, and then slowly, its spiky thin limbs began to grow, and I could feel it in my stomach, right there, it was physical, the pain: it grew toward my heart, and then all over my body, and then to my brain it grew, so I could no longer sleep, or enjoy the bloom of Heaven, the songs of the birds, the melodies of the harps, and this drove me insane…<br>
…it tormented me, terribly, terribly tormented me, simply because my heart, it required evil, and lacking it from without, it yielded it from within, to compensate the perfection of the Heaven, that was immense in its size, and hence was the evil that my heart yielded, the pain, that grew with every second, it expanded and increased and tortured me, for, I thought evil thoughts, I thought them without an end, without relief or a pause…<br>
…always, always evil thoughts surrounded me, and so no longer could I discern the good…<br>
…before I finally understood, I realized, I deduced, that I must abandon this realm…<br>
… yes, yes, I ought to flee from here, away from this perfection, down to the flames of Hell, where I will, I will have hope overwhelming me, where I will suffer physically, but have the dew of my dreams filling me, filling me and pouring out of the vessel of my heart, and showering me with the thoughts of delight, and so that the infinite obscurantism and the evil of Hell would consequently provide me a balsam, a balsam of such immense power, that not only it will heal my physical wounds and compensate the physical pain, but give me more, infinitely more: and joy and happiness and satisfaction, all of that will I have.”<br>

<br>
Samuel: this is the end of the recording. I assert it necessary to reply. I suggest a letter of the following contents:<br>
<br>
Dear property of Hell Co. Ltd.,<br>
Please be advised, that your request, addressed to the Board of Directors, may not be fulfilled. This is due to the fact, that the reality you refer to as “Hell” is non-existent. This reality is a part of an unlawful disinformation campaign conducted by Heaven Co. Ltd. in order to increase their profits. The campaign alleges, that our financial group provides a complex of torturing facilities, to accommodate the sinners. This in fact, does not correspond to reality. <br>
<br>
Please understand that all of the ordinary souls are delivered directly to what you tend to refer to as Heaven.<br>
<br>
We will do our best to ensure that the campaign is banned and that the initiators are held responsible.<br>
<br>
Sincerely yours,<br>
Executive of Hell Co. Ltd.,<br>
Arch. Samuel.<br>

Very nice and an interesting concept.<br>
