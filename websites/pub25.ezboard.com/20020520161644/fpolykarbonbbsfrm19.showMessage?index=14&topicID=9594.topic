Moulin Rouge - This is one of the few movies that were actually -painful- for me to sit through. I didn't see what was so great about it and the music was entirely unappealing to me. <br>

<br>
I'll leave most of my arguements at the door and just say that Orwell and Coppola wanted their work to read like that.<br>
Orwell, because he had to illustrate that &quot;Communism had to stop now, before it gets to the point where you couldn't stop it.&quot;<br>
And Coppola had to say that war is frightening and confusing.<br>
<br>
<br>
I have to agree with Pheonix with LoTR...<br>
I really didn't like the heavy use of CG for field travel, it was just wrong for me.

as for books........well it's a shame to see so many AWEFULL books around in the market. evryone these days are buying stupid books on how to achieve succes and SH!T and books that have to do with how to get out of depression (99% of these books don't give any concrete results). that's pathetic you wanna echeive succes economicclally? go read &quot;art of war&quot; or &quot;the five rings&quot;, you depressed? go read a book from Freud or Jung and learn something usefull.  <br>

Cut out to make the movie PG, three hours long, and whatever else.<br>
Peter Jackson said the 4 and a half hour film was the 'dream cut'. It had everything he wanted in it before he had to start taking stuff out.<br>
The lothlorien scene with Galadriel was hacked up the most as well as some other scenes between Legolas and Gimli.<br>
One of the reasons why the movie seemed so choppy.<br>
Even after he cut all that stuff, New line still cut 15 minutes worth of travel shots. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/upixienim.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Pixie Nim</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(4/8/02 4:51:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=9594.topic&index=32>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.liquid2k.com/oolong/040.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: what is, in your opinion, the most overrated book or mov</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Titanic</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, definately... sooo overrated.

<br>
Titanic- VERY good movie.  I personally liked it, but my manliness prevents me from openly admitting it.  Curse you leo.<br>
<br>
Matrix- awesome movie, the first time you see it.  I don't know why, but every time i watch that movie it loses something.  It was definitely NOT overrated at all.<br>
<br>
Harry Potter- Good book, if you're into that sort of thing, but some people just overdid it.  Respectible adults waiting in lines for hours just to get fricking tickets.  That's rediculous.  Harry potter in general gets my vote for most overrated.<br>
<br>
Star Wars- Ep 1 wasn't written well, but he's a little rusty, give him a couple more to get into it.  btw, I heard that there isn't ever going to be an ep. 7, 8, &amp; 9 like there was originally supposed to be.  I'll explain more at a later time.  Yes, it was overrated, but wouldn't you be a little excited if they put 15 years between the first and second episodes of, oh, the lord of the rings?<br>
<br>
and ep 2 doesn't look good, it looks DAMN good.  I wanna see anakin goin after Obi-wan with 2 lightsabers (after he goes bad.)  I'm seein this one on openning night.<br>
<br>
Princess Diaries- not the movie, the books.  I don't know if anyone else knows about this, but the newest one just came out.  My girlfriend hasn't stopped talking about it until today when she finally got it.  She finished it in a couple of hours.<br>
<br>
that's all i have to say for now.  I will leave you mortals in peace. <p>-----------------------------------

<br>
over-rated movie? Pearl Harbor, Harry Potter. there are others but those were the ones that first came to mind. <br>
<br>
as for LOTR. The Fellowship of the Ring was rated PG-13, so while it may have been edited for content i'm not so certain about that. The Two Towers is rated PG which i find a bit puzzling (dare we mention Shelob?) but that doesn't mean it will be bad. <br>
quite frankly i think the adaptation of the books was the best i have ever seen. yes, there is some stuff they leave out but on the whole the story is intact. (besides, if you look at the website they are promising an extended version DVD release at some point in the future. some would say that it's just a marketing thing but i am looking forward to it.) i do agree that there is a lot of stuff that was in The Hobbit that would have clarified a lot, but maybe someone can talk Jackson into doing that next. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
as far as LOTR being a checklist for a fantasy epic, maybe you should wake up and realize that Tolkien invented the fantasy epic. LOTR and the related books were not only rich in history but were the first well-known group based fantasy. <br>
i know that not everyone likes The Fellowship of the Ring movie but i've seen it six or seven times and i'm still not tired of it, despite noticing continuity errors, etc. despite it's shortcomings i don't think anyone else will ever be able to make a better adaptation. <br>
<br>

Overrated Movie: I would say Harry Potter, the books were excellent...but the movie was just &quot;good&quot; everyone keeps raving about it though.<br>
The books though..are GREAT! I'm not one to jump on a bandwagon...in fact i thought they looked retrarded. But then on a trip to Canada...it was too late to read anything and i was tired of listening to music. So i listed to an audio tape of the first book, that my Cousin had brought. I was AMAZED! It was great...i kept wanting to listen too it! So after that i bought all the books and read them in a SINGLE WEEK! It was great! I really liked them, even though i thought they looked dumb.<br>
<br>
I'm also very sketchy about the &quot;Left Behind&quot; series...but i haven't read it...so i can't judge. <p><a href="http://pub57.ezboard.com/bchristianotaku">

<br>
Over hyped? yes. Overrated? pulease. If anything, it was underrated because of how sorely disapointed people were from the enourmous hype and couldnt bring themselves to like it since they thought they were going to witness a miracle brought onto mankind from the heavens.<br>
<br>
There is a huge difference between hype and overrated. <p><a href="http://www.newelysium.com"><img src="http://www.newelysium.com/banners/button1.gif" border=0></a></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ushousetsu.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shousetsu</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.newelysium.com/forum/psicon.gif width=13 height=13" BORDER=0> at: 4/8/02 1:33:59 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uyostinkypeanut.showPublicProfile?language=EN>yo stinky peanut</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(4/10/02 6:27:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=9594.topic&index=71>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://doramusuko.homestead.com/files/bender.gif height=102 width=98></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: what is, in your opinion, the most overrated book or mov</span><hr size=1> pearl harbour... 2 thumbs down <p><a href ="http://www.geocities.com/duffnznz/"><img src="http://doramusuko.homestead.com/files/mohopuna.jpg"></a>

<br>
Episode 1 was over hyped, Godzilla (the new movie) was over hyped. There is no way in hell those movies could be overrated considering 99.9% of the people who watched them hated them. <p><a href="http://www.newelysium.com"><img src="http://www.newelysium.com/banners/button1.gif" border=0></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ualucard1515.showPublicProfile?language=EN>alucard1515</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator <img src=http://contest.polykarbon.com/badge1.gif></span><br> <font color=#336699>(4/10/02 7:29:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=9594.topic&index=75>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.undeadart.com/forum/alucard.gif width=100 height=94></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: what is, in your opinion, the most overrated book or mov</span><hr size=1> Yes, but if something was the MOST overrated of anything, it would have to be rated highly by both critics and the general public, so it doesn't matter.
