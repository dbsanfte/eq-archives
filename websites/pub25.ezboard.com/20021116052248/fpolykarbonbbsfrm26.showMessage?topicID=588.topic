<br>
I hold in my hand a key, a key to a whole new world, but with the key comes tragedy, great tragedy, a tragedy like none in our world, not in any other world, this world is the ocean, and the key, is SCUBA.<br>
<br>
Again, Jared spit in his mask and rubbed it, Jared was 12 this month, and his mom had taken him to the caribbean to dive, he had been certified two months ago he was a normal sized kid with kinda blond kinda brown hair that stuck up even if he didn’t gel it, he had arrived just 2 days ago, and he was already going diving, the bad part was, he was diving with 30 other divers 12 dive masters, and one altitude diver it took 4 dive boats to get everybody to the dive site.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Jared splashed some water into his mask and emptied it, making sure to get all the spit out, he stood up and walked to his gear, setting down his mask next to his fins, he walked over to the side of the boat.<br>
  The sky was a clear blue, with only a few clouds of in the distance.<br>
Their was a slight breeze, but nothing to worry about, the water was calm so their probably wasn’t a current, making it easier to get around. Jared got up and looked around, he counted 14 divers there, most of them in their forties or fifties, he was the youngest there. Jared spotted a worn blue type on the inner side of the boat, it read Journeyer, probably the name of the boat. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp At the back half of the boa t there was a metal arch about 12 feet long and 3 feet high, on each side there was a wooden bence, where everyone strapped their tanks and B.C.’s* and put most of their gear, behind it was the dive deck, which had a ladder on each side.<br>
<br>
Closer to the front their was an inside, which had benches and a bathroom, on the right side straight ahead there was a room which had a bunch of navigational stuff, and next to the bathroom was a ladder which led up to where the driver sat, and some more benches.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
*B.C.(Buoyancy Control) The B.C. Is like a life jacket, that you can inflate and deflate to stay afloat and to become nuteraly buoyant underwater(not sinking or floating) and it attaches to your tank.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Jared climbed up the ladder to the balcony and approached the driver<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “How long till’ we get to the dive site?” he asked in a quite, hoarse voice, for he had not talked since he left on the dive boat a half an hour ago. The driver was a sturdy looking man wearing a shirt with a scuba diving skeleton on it, his skin was a light brown, and he appeared fijian or something.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “We dare’” he replied with an accent that Jared couldn’t name, suddenly the engines turned off and the boat slowed to a stop. The driver smiled at Jared and said “my name captain P. What yours?”Jared grinned,<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Jared” he replied, happy that at least SOMEONE on this boat was a nice, human-being <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Are you diving?” Jared asked hopefully, Captain P. frowned,<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I no dive, I only driver and helper of divers” he said sadly.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “You dive?” he asked cheering up a little. Jared nodded smiling slightly<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “you small” Captain P. Pointed out<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I know” said Jared grinning “I just barely started diving.” Captain P. Smiled<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “you should be getting ready, other divers already going in” he said pointing to the other three dive boats, that had divers jumping of them, their B.C’s and masks and fins on and their regulators* in their mouths. Jared nodded and went back down the ladder, holding his breath, because someone had just used the bathroom.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Jared quickly ran through the room and outside taking a deep breath of the fresh, salty air.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Around him divers were de-fogging their masks, getting on their fins, some were already sitting on the dive deck, ready to get in.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A particularly nervous man that looked to be 37 or 38 kept wiping a bugger like substance on his forehead(he had forgotten to rinse out his de fog) Jared chuckled to himself and started putting on his mask and booties.( like water socks, only thicker, Booties go under your fins to make them more comfortable)<br>
<br>
<br>
*Regulator, The object in which you breath out of, it is plastic with a gelatine mouthpiece and a rubber hose going back and connecting to your tank, also connected to your tank is you secondary regulator, your dive computer, which tells your depth and you air remaining, and the B.C. Inflator hose, which connects to your B.C. So you can inflate it quickly with the air in your tank.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Jared folded the bottom of his wet suit over his booties,  picked up his fins, slipped his mask over his head, and walked towards the dive deck. Captain P. Approached him smiling.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Which tank yours?” he asked cheerfully. Jared pointed to a silver tank with a black B.C. With red outlining<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “third on the left” he told Captain P. Who turned around and picked it up easily, then he carried it over and set it down behind Jared<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “What weight belt* yours?” he asked, more dully that cheerfully<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “16D” said Jared simply turning his head back and slipping on his fins and strapping into his B.C.<br>
 Captain P. Handed down his belt and Jared slipped it on. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Ready?” Asked Captain P. “Yeah” Jared replied<br>
“one, two, three!” said captain P. As he lifted up Jared’s B.C. So Jared could stand up (all the gear together ways something like 40 pounds)<br>
 Jared grabbed his regulator and put it in his mouth.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Big step” said Captain P.  As he walked over to help the nervous guy strap on his fins<br>
Jared breathed in and out of the regulator calmly and every time he exhaled a deep clicking noise came from it making him laugh, he took it off and said “scuse’ me” he chuckled to himself at his joke and put the regulator back in his mouth, by now there was only 6 people left on the boat, most of which were dive masters.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Jared waddled up to the edge of the deck and to a giant stride into the water, dropping like a rock he made a huge splash, imediatly he inflated his B.C. Making the sound of a balloon filling up. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Jared swam out and waited for a dive master to come be his buddy (until he was twelve he had to always dive with a dive master.) he waited a few minutes and decided to switch to snorkel because he didn’t want to waste air. He looked around and laughed, he guessed, like him, everyone on this dive was new to diving, one woman kept deflating and inflating her B.C. Another man was going down but then he’d shoot up staring at his computer worried out of his wits, the funniest thing, though, was the way nervous guy had jumped in with his air turned off, actually it must have been way scary for him but Jared thought it was funny.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Finally a dive master by the name of george came over and asked Jared if he was a junior diver and if he needed to dive with him.<br>
<br>
<br>
*Weight belt, A belt that is strapped with led so you don’t float to the surface and can get down quickly.<br>
Jared nodded and the started to descend, Jared switched over to his regulator, and grabbed his computer(it was a habit of his to watch his dive computer when he descended, and it was a good thing he did, because he noticed that even though they were descending rapidly his dive computer stayed at 0 feet below the surface, Jared ignored it, thinking that it didn’t matter, but later that small piece of information probably could have saved 42 life's.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp My name is Jared, the only survivor of scuba diving’s worst tragedy and I am giving you the quick version of the story, the long version is to gruesome to put to words, what happened was unthinkable, the first group of people were probably down at 90 feet, I was watching them for fun, because I had not yet seen any fish, when I slammed my hand into a group of coral, if you’ve ever put lemon juice on a paper-cut. It hurt that much, doubled. The whole left side of my hand was scraped and bloody, I grabbed my wrist and screamed into my regulator, almost instantly they came, the sharks, but amazingly, the didn’t go after me, they headed straight towards the people I had been watching, the only damage they did at that time though, was what looked to be it threatening him, snapping his jaws very close the one of the persons face but when he looked up I knew different, the shark, amazingly had snapped both of the mans regulator hoses in half, his eyes were full of horror as he looked directly at we, he then did the sign for “does anybody have extra air” franticly I looked at my computer only to discover that my air read 0 although I new I had plenty of air, franticly I looked around amazed, no one, I mean no one was even swimming towards him because of the shark, but I had read something like this in a book, the shark took out a guys regulators, and waited for him to suffocate then it ate him, starting a frenzy, only that book was fictional, and the shark was not real, it was an idea coming from the mind of someone who loved scaring people, well, this wasn’t fictional, I new what I had to do to save everybody here. I shot straight down, the increasing pressure in my sinuses was almost unbearable, I finally got down and grabbed my secondary, but to my horror, I had taken to long, he was dead, his eyes rolled into his head, I then new It was over I would be first to die, then my fathers warnings rang in my ears “if a shark ever attacks you, don’t swim to the surface,instead swim down to the bottom and hide under a rock, I looked down and saw no bottom even though the visibility was 150 feet. I looked up to where my master was and saw him jumping back into the water with what appeared to be a spear he then rocketed down like I had done his spear held outward. Then I had an idea, I grabbed the guys hand and started waving them around, an act which almost made me vomit into my regulator, the shark wondering why the guy was still alive swam back, but not away, I was relieved, but not for long, I heard the familiar balloon inflating sound and to my horror the guy started floating towards the top, I had hit his B.C. Inflater button! I grabbed for his deflate button but I missed and he slipped away, all I could do is watch in horror as the shark shot forward and started tearing him up, I can not go into much more detail than that, because that was the end, what I saw down there that day was un thinkable, and if anyone asks me if I believe in miracles I would tell them my saying, no one ever does till’ they get one. All told everyone down there except me died in 2 minutes, there were 43 of us, and about 50 sharks so it didn’t take long, now that day haunts my dreams, for almost a year I went through severe depression, I knew that it was my fault, I had killed 42 people in one day, again I will not go into any more detail then that, the one last thing that I can tell you, is that I escaped and I am glad I am not dead,<br>
but something that today. 4 years later is when I returned to the dive boat, captain P. Took one look at me and nodded, <br>
later I asked him why and he replied simply <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I know it happen sometime, but I not now I be dare”<br>
