I think you're confusing nationality with ethnicity. That has more to do with culture and also ties into racial background. Nationalism is a fairly recent phenomenon, it certainly came long after the Biblical Hebrews.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The only drop of dominicanism he has is from his father's side, yet like I said nationalism isn't determined by race. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I think you misinterpretted my meaning a bit. I didn't mean that being born of someone from a particular nation makes you a part of of that nation and it's culture, just that it's more likely that you may identify with it, even if in part. Not to mention the obvious fact that if you're born a particular race in a particular nation, you're more likely to identify with it since that's all you've known.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Nationality isn't bonded to a citizenship, nationality is much more than a social security number and a passport.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Absolutely. You provided the example yourself of Latin Americans acclimating themselves to the culture they've become a part of. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> If I die will I stop being Dominican? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Yes. You will stop BEING Dominican, but you once were. And again, that's not nationalism. Nationalism, as you said yourself, isn't merely being a citizen of a nation. So, what if you weren't always Dominican? Did a Dominican person suddenly do all those things in life before becomming a citizen of that country? No, because you are not defined by what you are at the moment of death.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Better yet....are dead men nationless?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Well, I'm not really sure how to answer that. I think it's more complicated than you're putting it. Like I said, you might not have always been a citizen of that particular nation, so would you define someone as American if they only lived a small portion of their life there? Now it's a little easier to define if someone has lived all, or most, of their life in one place, but still, is a dead man anything other than dead? When a German guy dies, I guess he's a German corpse, but I wouldn't want to go much further than that.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>And I don't mean a corpse, I mean the man/woman as in the personality (you would agree that we are much more than stardust).<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I'm not sure what you're saying exactly. Their personality? You mean the idea of them after their dead? I don't think they've suddenly become something else now that they've died (other than dead), but they are not ACTIVELY anything anymore.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>My nationality isn't necesarily more important over all else. But it is one of the essencial components of what I am. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I think I worded that poorly. I meant &quot;your&quot; in a general sense, but I may have also been misinterpretting what you meant. I still think that you're placing more importance on it than you should. Don't get me wrong, there's absolutely nothing wrong with being proud of your nation and your cultural background. Everyone is in part, an important part, defined by where they come from. Even if you completely reject the culture you come from, that is still based on the ideals of that culture (in terms of its opposite). We're all shaped by our experiences, and the experience from one country to another is not going to be the same. The problem isn't in accepting that your culture is unique and different from others, it's getting caught up in those differences and championing them above the similarities you share with everyone, even those OUTSIDE of your culture/nation/whatever. If one is caught up so much in what is important to ME and MY culture alone, then you're bound to ignore the others' side. I'm not saying your, or hikagun, is doing this, but I still think you're too invested in defining yourself as part of that group.<br>
<br>
<br>
As a little note (and I'm not doing this to be obnoxious), I thought I'd include the dictionary definitions I looked up for nationalism and ethnicity. I don't want to end up disagreeing when we actually agree just because we're understanding the meaning of the same words we use differently. If you think the definitions are incomplete or wrong, fine. Just know that when I use the words, these definitions are what I'm going by. I realize that words take on a life of their own and sometimes have different conotations for different people, but I try (keyword, try) to use them consistenly to reduce confusion.<br>

I don't think so. Ethnicity like you specified on your previous post implies race. I firmly left out racial traits from my list of factors that determines ones national status. So I guess <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>most</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> of the things that define ethnicity also define nationality but not <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>all</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> factors that ethnicity fall into nationality. Nationalism as you said before is a phenomenon of modern times yet in certain ways it has manifested in very peculiar ways throughout ancient times. <br>
<br>
As to nationalism defying death and trascending death I think that its a topic that is very subjective and in this case is the object of different conceptualizations regarding nationalistic emotions.<br>
<br>
I think that the definitions you posted on ethnicity and nationalism were very interesting to read. I also did a bit of research on Encarta on what nationlism really is. Encarta defines it more of a international social order than a idealistic movement. But it still is very interesting to observe and analyze. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=1monkeypunch1>1MonkeyPunch1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/27/03 9:17 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12792.topic&index=84>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/pyapor/manga.txt height=117 width=125></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Encarta article on nationalism</span><hr size=1> Nationalism, in modern history, movement in which the nation-state is regarded as paramount for the realization of social, economic, and cultural aspirations of a people. Nationalism is characterized principally by a feeling of community among a people, based on common descent, language, and religion. Before the 18th century, when nationalism emerged as a distinctive movement, states usually were based on religious or dynastic ties; citizens owed loyalty to their church or ruling family. Concerned with clan, tribe, village, or province, people rarely extended their interests nationwide.<br>
<br>
Historically, the tendency toward nationalism was fostered by various technological, cultural, political, and economic advances. Improvement in communications extended the knowledge of people beyond their village or province. The spread of education in vernacular tongues to the lower-income groups gave them the feeling of participation in a common cultural heritage. Through education, people learned of their common background and tradition and began to identify themselves with the historical continuity of the nation. The introduction of national constitutions and the struggle for political rights gave peoples the sense of helping to determine their fate as a nation and of sharing responsibility for the future well-being of that nation. At the same time the growth of trade and industry laid the basis for economic units larger than the traditional cities or provinces.<br>
<br>
Most modern nations have developed gradually on the basis of common ties of descent, religion, and language. Many exceptions exist, among them Switzerland, the United States, Israel, and India. Switzerland is a nation in which no common religion or language was ever established. The Swiss include many adherents to both the Roman Catholic and Protestant religions; they have no linguistic unity, for German, French, and Italian are spoken in distinct regions of the country. Swiss nationalism was fostered primarily by isolation in a mountain region, the determination to maintain political independence, and rivalry among imperial powers, which kept each from aggression against Switzerland.<br>
<br>
The United States was formed largely by British immigrants with disparate religious ties and was developed to a great extent by other immigrants having little in common except a yearning for religious, economic, and political freedom. American nationalism was based primarily on a dedication to the concept of individual liberty and representative government derived from British traditions. What was considered in Great Britain the birthright of Britons became in the U.S., under the influence of 18th-century Enlightenment, the natural right of every person. The Declaration of Independence marked the consummation of this libertarian ethos.<br>
<br>
Israel was formed almost entirely from the immigration of diverse national groups of Jews who shared a common ideal based on religious nationalism. The traditional aspirations of Jews for a national revival in Palestine had remained unfulfilled for almost 2000 years. As a result of genocide perpetrated by the National Socialist rulers of Germany before and during World War II, Jewish national aspirations suddenly achieved dynamic force. More than a million refugees from many different countries immigrated to Palestine. They learned Hebrew, the re-created national language, and established a new state with Judaism as the state religion. Among world Jewry, however, the Jews of Israel are a minority; most Jews continue to live as minority religious groups in their native countries.<br>
<br>
India is a nation in which the Hindu religion served as the cohesive traditional element in uniting peoples of various races, religions, and languages. India achieved national unity through the influence of Western ideas, notably those of British origin, and in struggle against British rule.<br>
<br>
 The beginnings of modern nationalism may be traced back to the disintegration, at the end of the Middle Ages, of the social order in Europe and of the cultural unity of the various European states. The cultural life of Europe was based on a common inheritance of ideas and attitudes transmitted in the West through Latin, the language of the educated classes. All Western Europeans adhered to a common religion, Catholic Christianity. The breakup of feudalism, the prevailing social and economic system, was accompanied by the development of larger communities, wider social interrelations, and dynasties that fostered feelings of nationality in order to win support for their rule. National feeling was strengthened in various countries during the Reformation, when the adoption of either Catholicism or Protestantism as a national religion became an added force for national cohesion.<br>

A similar problem now, but on a smaller scale. Now most people are extending loyalty to their nation, but rarely doing so to the world at large. It's all about what WE want and what WE need. (We in general sense, not one particular nation.)<br>

Just replace nation with world. Again, nothing wrong with pride in your nation or cultural background, but there's a larger picture. And even nationalistic people consider themselves a part of smaller communities, such as states, cities, or even smaller communities. I don't see why it would be any different if we shifted from nationalism. Ties to your country wouldn't disappear, but people wouldn have a better view of the large picture.<br>

I agree with your &quot;worldview&quot; nationalism. I myself consider myself a cosmopolitan. But a cosmopolitan world must be organized and thus people must have a clear idea of their own particular nationality. I think we both have covered common ground and finally come to a point in which we would have to face the great question: How can a cosmopolitan world truely work? This takes time and patience. I think that no matter what this type of &quot;worldview&quot; nationalism will come to us one of these days. Its innevitable. Not just because of the goblalistic movements that we see today but because already people are making plans for it and are trying to imagine how it would all be. Haven't you noticed that almost all movies, novels, comics, etc. speak of a future world that is dominated by a pseudo-united nations? Sci-fi writers never speak of the future reffering themselves to specific nations but of a world with a comunity of nations and most of the time simply say &quot;human kind&quot;. It's never &quot;Martians agianst Americans&quot; or &quot;Robots against the French&quot;, its most of the time human kind as a whole facing an enemy or challenge. This may be a very vague example but I find it incredibly natural for Sci-fi writers to propose a cosmopolitan future. This may be sad but it could be that in the only situation that the world can truely come together would be in a situation of possible<br>
 massive extinction of the human race. I really wouldn't want to wait for that threat ever to arrive before the world comes together and unifies all nations. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=japanesenationalist>Japanese Nationalist</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/27/03 11:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12792.topic&index=87>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.japanorama.com/images/flag_waving_ag.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Encarta article on nationalism</span><hr size=1> In the year 1999 a space fortress will crash into a small island in the south Pacific.

it means they ruled themselves, as opposed to being part of another country or empire.<br>
