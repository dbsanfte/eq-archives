<br>
many questions arise,<br>
<br>
Will it be made in japanese or outside? (would it be better with japanese actors or more famous ones in the US)<br>
Will it involve shinji, asuka and the rest, or is it a new story, should it be?<br>
Do you think they will stick to the hardcore plotline that has made it a classic, or will they dumb it down so to reach more audiance?<br>
i know that this is all hypothetical, but i often wonder what others think an Eva movie should be like. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sinfire>Sinfire</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://sin.emeraldwinter.com/graphics/link.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Insignificant Echo</span><br> <font color=#336699>(7/4/03 12:32 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12527.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://sin.emeraldwinter.com/graphics/avatars/avatar2.gif height=107 width=89></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: opinions on the eva live action movie</span><hr size=1> Ok I think it will be filmed in english, so I assume there won't be japanese actors and it'll most-likely be american acters, maybe some big names I don't know. <br>
<br>
I really hope it involves the original characters of the eva series (shinji, asuka, rei etc) since if they brought in new ones it just wouldnt feeel the same, and Rei is a total babe <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  so I'd like to see who would be chosen to act her. <br>
<br>
As for the plot... most people are dumb. Yeah. It's an annoying thought but if this thing is going to be released mainstream (which is pretty obvious that it is) then obviously they're going to tone it down a bit. I'm not sure, maybe they'll focus more on the action elements of eva?... in any case the way they balance there use of action and harcore plot is going to be crucial on the movies success imo.  <p><p align="right"><a href="http://pub49.ezboard.com/bfufu65836"><img src="http://sin.emeraldwinter.com/graphics/buttons/fufu.jpeg" IMG BORDER="0"  style="filter : Alpha(Opacity=50);-moz-opacity:.5;" onmouseenter="this.style.filter = 'Alpha(Opacity=100)';" onmouseleave="this.style.filter = 'Alpha(Opacity=50)';"></a></p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=japanesenationalist>Japanese Nationalist</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(7/4/03 6:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12527.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.japanorama.com/images/flag_waving_ag.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: opinions on the eva live action movie</span><hr size=1> In general I have a pretty pesemistic outlook for this movie.  I'll go see it anyway just cause Evangelion is my favorite anime series, but I don't expect much.<br>
<br>
From what I've heard, it's going to be done by English speaking actors, which to me, is the biggest flag that it's going to be ruined...maybe it would be a good movie, but I don't think it would stay true to Evangelion.  Most likely I feel it will be dumbed down for general audiences...I doubt there looking for a cult classic (ie a movie that gains a loyal following over a LONG period of time), they're looking for a blockbuster (something that'll rake in the dough at the box office).  This means cutting out alot of the major metaphor (which is what separated Evangelion from being just another giant robot anime), and just turning it into an action flick with some drama (at best).<br>
<br>
In order for it to save any face, they'd have to focus on other characters (tell it from a different point of view, especially if they use non-asian actors).  So maybe we could see the battles, etc. but the &quot;main&quot; characters would be in the background of this movie.  After all, we've seen all the fights with all the angels...so they'd either have to change stuff, or they'd just be showing agian, what Evangelion fans have already seen.<br>
<br>
*edit* Of course, anyone who's seen my thread in the photo section knows I'm trying to break into acting, and I'd jump at the chance to get into a film like this.  I'd especially like to be Kaji (he was my favorite character, I've got long hair, and I could flush out his personality), and any Misato love scenes would just be a bonus<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> w00t*edit* <p><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I have found that common sense is rather uncommon.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=japanesenationalist>Japanese Nationalist</A> at: 7/4/03 6:41 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=acoldoldkodiak>aColdOldKodiak</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://godkodiak.homestead.com/files/face.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(7/4/03 3:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12527.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://godkodiak.homestead.com/files/avatar.jpg height=130 width=100></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: opinions on the eva live action movie</span><hr size=1> Sorry, there's a couple things I have to say about EVA. <br>

<br>
2. EVA's original plot... wasn't that amazing.<br>
<br>
3. EVA's original characters all suck. They all are annoying... (except Rei, who for obvious reasons would be hard to be annoying), and all feel completely unreal. <br>
<br>
4. If live action EVA takes place in Japan, that'd be just... meh. I mean, does anything ever happen in Japan? Why is Japan the center of world events in every anime? <br>
Stick the center of the world in a place that makes sense this time. <br>

and there are other things... but... yeah. <br>

I don't know about that.. I know a few people who have very similar personalities to characters suchas shinji and asuka (and others), so I think if I know people who I can relate to them with it is a sign that the characters are actually realistic right? <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Why is Japan the center of world events in every anime? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
a lot of anime is made/written/etc in japan. hmm.. maybe they're full of themselves? hehe.. the japanese are a very proud culture so I've heard. <br>
<br>
Also I guess they're set in japan because of the fact it seems to be one of the main technologically leading countrys of the world, so makes a good setting for sci-fi. <br>

I don't consider myself a retard, but I'm a big eva fan.  Admitedly though I'd probably watch it no matter what it was like, simply because it is eva.  If it sucks of course I'll never watch it again, but at least once.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>2. EVA's original plot... wasn't that amazing.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I'd say about half of the stuff in there shouldn't be taken at face value.  The entire thing is a GIGANTIC metaphor for beliefs in and around Christianity.  Although I'm not Christian (I'm rather anti for anyone that doesn't know by now) I find it fascinating.  It obviously took a lot of research to put Evangelion together.  Take for example, the sixteenth angel Armisael.  It's a giant wheel of light.  On the surface, it doesn't seem too impressive, like the animators ran out of ideas or something.  However, after doing a little digging, I found out that the third (from the top) order of angels are known as Thrones or Ophanim.  These angels were often depicted as wheels of light.  That's not too well known.  In fact only the two lowest ranks of angels were originally said to have human form.  Originally the rest were different such as the highest chorus of angels, the Seraphim sometimes described as fiery serpents, and/or having four faces and six wings.  I think the fifteeth Evangelion angel, Arael, was supposed to be representative of that, but I'm not sure yet.  There are a gazzillion other metaphors and nuances that are <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>supposed</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to be there.  It's not like these things could get there by mistake given the subject matter...some things maybe, but not as many as there are.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>3. EVA's original characters all suck. They all are annoying... (except Rei, who for obvious reasons would be hard to be annoying), and all feel completely unreal.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I disagree.  To me they all feel completely real, which to me adds so much more richness to Evangelion.  You may be fortunate enough to not know any wimpy whiny people that continue to feel extreme self pity under all circumstances, but believe me, they exist.  The same holds true for most of the other characters.  I have seen/experienced people that behave like them.  THEY ALL COME ACCROSS AS EXTREMELY FAULTY HUMANS and I love that.  None of them is the knight in shining armor (some try, but inevitably succumb to their faults).  None of them is the ideal human being.  They're all so real.<br>
<br>

There's a perfectly reasonable reason.  American film/TV takes place in America, Italian films take place in Italy, Japanes film/TV takes place in Japan.  When you keep it in some place familiar, 1.) you are more likely to be accurate, as you've been there 2.) your audience is more likely to relate to it, because they've been there.<br>

I wasn't calling people who liked EVA retards, I was saying there are retarted (not as intelligent) people who like EVA just because it has cool action sequences. <br>
<br>
On the characters&gt; Sure individually these people all exists, <br>
but put all these crazy people together, then put them in charge of the most important project in humanity, then they become so... fake. Suddenly they're characters, and their personalities seem just too rediculous, as if it were written (which it is). I mean, every one is the series is a different type of crazy, WTH? Wouldn't this show up in some sort of phychological report to the administrators; who the hell is in charge? <br>
<br>
I just felt the whole time that these characters were <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>written</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->... I can't really explain it farther than that. <br>
<br>
On the story&gt; Ok, I did enjoy all the work put into all the theological ideas and metaphores myself, but then the story <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>drowned</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> in those ideas. <br>
Like drawings, when you just start with details and make everything look nice and pretty and do things in sections, you usually end up with a picture that is kinda screwed up, because it wasn't all drawn at once then detailed afterwards. <br>
<br>
Evangelion suffers from this, lots of theology, lots of ideas, not enough forethought to the putting them together. <br>
<br>
<br>
on Japan being center of universe&gt; I was kinda kidding. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

Uh, so? They're just drawings. I could see where you were coming from with another anime, in a made-up location, but almost all the characters were explicitly Japanese. <br>

What movie were you watching? Jean-Claude van Damme isn't American, Raul Julia isn't Thai, and they made E Honda Hawaiin in that movie. I'm not certain about the other actors, but it was pretty obvious most of them weren't the nationality they were portraying. Going with the nationality of the character goes hand in hand with what the character looks like. I mean, I don't see too many wide-eyed, triangle-nosed, spiky-haired people walking around the streets, so it's a little difficult to make the characters look like the stylized versions. And the problem with that movie was not the look of the characters, it was that almost none of them could act.<br>

That's just ignorant. How many movies with talented Japanese actors have you seen in relation to how many movies with talented English-speaking actors you've seen? Since you're an English-speaker yourself, probably more of the latter. And even if you have seen movies in Japanese, it would be difficult to judge their performances, considering it is in another language. If you just mean Japanese people in general, and not just people from the country of Japan, it's even more ignorant. <p><html>
