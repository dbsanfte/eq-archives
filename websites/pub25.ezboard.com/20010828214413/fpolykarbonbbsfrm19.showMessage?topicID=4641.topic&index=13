That's a lot of money to use on an experimental movie.  I think they meant for it to have a good plot -and- good graphics, but it just didn't work out like that.  I haven't seen the movie yet, but from what I've heard the plot wasn't all that great.  I'm not saying it has a horrible plot myself.  Just saying that's too much time and money for them to use it on an experimental film which was expected to make 145 million in the theaters..which it's not going to do.  But they -did- do a good job on the graphics. <p>All who read this signature will die.

<br>
I think in the case of Final Fantasy, there are two general opinions:<br>
<br>
1) 'Well, the plot sucked, but it was more than compensated by the graphics and animation.<br>
<br>
or<br>
<br>
2)Well, the graphics and animation kicked ass, but it was ruined on account of the sucky plot.<br>
<br>
we can therefor conclude that for the most part, whether people liked or disliked the movie, the plot SUCKED. <br>
<br>
I do think they wasted a great deal of effects on a simple plot. it wouldn't take much more, if any, effort to apply the same effects to a better plot. what a shame.<br>

It doesn't make sense to compare.<br>
Sucky plot compared to what? It's still 10 times better than all the teenager films and throw-up-in-your-seat romantic comedies out this summer. Do you think your money would have been better spent on the Princess Diaries or another Disney rip off? Lol.<br>
I mean come on... What were you REALLY expecting for a summer flick. Just because it had the name Final Fantasy, doesn't mean you should evaluate it as such. It was a movie, not an RPG.<br>
The acting and characters weren't that bad compared to other Sci-fi fantasy movies that have come out in the last ten years. If you were to actually give the characters in any final fantasy game spoken words you'd probably laugh at how bad the script was.<br>
Besides, this movie was basically the first of its kind. We can all be pretty confident that the next generation in CG will be better.<br>
, I think the movie was disappointing for you because you were expecting the legendary Final Fantasy plot that cannot be achieved in a 2-hour cinematic. If Square ever makes a Chrono type movie, we should all ignore the title and evaluate it as a movie.<br>
I guess it all comes down to... Could you do better? I mean, could you REALLY cram a long epic plot into two hours? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=doctord>Doctor D</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(8/15/01 12:37:50 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cry.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Final Fantasy movie...</span><hr size=1> okay, remember the first 5-10 minutes of the film?<br>
that was beautiful. <br>
<br>
when they really started talking though...<br>
well, they lost out on a lot. <br>
The dialog was terrible, and full of 'sci-fi babble' as some people would put it. When doing a sci-fi film, the most important thing to do is to make the characters as natural as you can...<br>
don't worry about talking the audience through your pseudo-science, they could care less. Worry about story, not explaining your ideas and gadjets.<br>
<br>
second, &quot;Deus ex Machina&quot;... <br>
*ahem*<br>
when did this become the standard way to end sci-fi films? It's gotten really old, and it needs a break. Don't copy Star-Treks gimmick to solve problems, make your own.<br>
<br>
third: camera angles/editing, this movie could have been much better done if they weren't afraid to change camera angles more often. This is one of the best benifits of CGI, you can do ANY angle at ANY time, with little-to-no work. A lot of really visually interesting things could have been done (other than presenting eye candy).<br>
<br>
fourth: okay, Square is used to &quot;epic games&quot;...<br>
okay, they are brand new to this...<br>
(which they really aren't, they have made games that focus on a short, action-packed story; but with the same results as this movie, terrible dialog and bad character belivability) <br>
the fact is that there isn't much dialog to a 40 hour game...<br>
you may point at a script as thick as a book, but the fact is that most of that is talking to townspersons, or to bosses who rant about how powerful they are (ala DBZ). <br>
<br>
<br>
the real fact of the matter is, that this movie could have been much better with the same plot (you know, the basic sequence of events)...<br>
it really could have except it would need better character development, directing, editing, dialog, facial animation...<br>

Alot of the things in FF the movie needed explaining in order for them to continue the story. Alot of things weren't even explained. Why were there only 8 spirits, if the phantoms were ghosts how come ballistic weapons and guns harmed them? Maybe the second one is not that important.<br>
And in a 40 hour square game, most of the dialogue is to do with the story. Townpeople and bosses make up a very small portion of it. In final fantasy 7 the northern crater, lifestream sequence, and soldier scenes take at least a half hour to complete EACH. that's an hour and half total and 75% of an average movie. And all those scenes are, are window after window of script. If all of that was spoken words it may even amount to more. And those are very small portions of the game. You could never fit the rest of it into another half hour.<br>
In a sci-fi or fantasy movie, the most important thing is the setting. The setting is what makes it sci-fi or fantasy. If you (the audience) can't figure out what the setting is then the story means nothing.<br>
If the characters never explained the 8 spirits, the audience would be confused as to why the heck they were looking for little plants, birds, and whatnot. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/urebelliousangel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rebellious Angel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(8/15/01 2:31:15 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://repressedinsolence.0catch.com/eye.JPG height=47 width=89></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cry.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Final Fantasy movie...</span><hr size=1> I keep telling my friends the reason FF:TSW didn't so well in the US was because &quot;most people aren't ready for it yet.&quot;  This is one of those occassions when they stare at me for a moment and then laugh uneasily.  But I still think it's true.  Granted, the storyline was slightly weak, the dialogue could've been better, and Aki's &quot;crying&quot; was comical at best...  But I liked the movie overall.  Then again, I like just about any movie where most of the characters die, especially if the significant other of the main character, or the main character him/herself dies.  (Ex: Braveheart, Armageddon)  Yeah, I know, I'm a sick child.  *shrug*  I still liked the movie.<br>
