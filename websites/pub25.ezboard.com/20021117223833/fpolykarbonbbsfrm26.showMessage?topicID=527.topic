Sorry ahead for the confusion and missing parts of a plot.<br>
<br>
Ray was pulling on the trucks door handle as Shraik and Max locked the garage doors. <br>
&quot;Max, get over here.&quot; Ray called as the gunfire from outside grew louder. Shraik glanced around the rather resourceful garage. Shraik heard Ray and Max talking, gunfire, and glass breaking. He turned to see the trucks' driver window shattered. Max climbed up into the window and fumbled around inside. Shraik couldn't find his sword, so he looked for something else. <br>
&quot;Found them!&quot; Max called out from the truck as he held up a set of keys. Shraik walked up to the desk with the cluttered papers over it and opened the drawer.<br>
&quot;Ooh! Shiny gun!&quot; He said and hopped into the back of the truck. Ray went into the drivers side and Max into the passenger.<br>
<br>
Bullets were flying through the flimsy garage doors as Ray started the engine. Shraik dived down on his side after a loud clang noise and a light appeared inches from his face. &quot;Hurry, Ray!&quot; Max cried as more bullets hit the truck. Ray put the car in reverse and turned towards the garage doors. Shraik tightened his sweaty grip on the handgun. <br>
<br>
Max Burner hadn't been so excited in his short 11 year old life. He'd barely knew this Shraik guy for a month and they were already diving into action. <br>
&quot;Get down guys!&quot; Ray yelled and Max ducked as low as he could. Screeching tires and loud crashes were all Max heard.<br>
<br>
Shraik crouched low in the back in the pickup but peeked up every few seconds. Ray ran the truck through the doors making them collapse, luckily not on Shraik. Almost as soon as Ray made it through Shraik started firing. PG's we're all around the huge hall, and they were all firing at the truck.<br>
<br>
Ray Wallman looked through the rearview mirror and sighed.<br>
&quot;Why are they attacking us?!&quot; Max seemed to like the action. Ray looked forward and gasped, a wall was right in front of them and was coming closer.<br>
<br>
Something seems wrong..... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=samspade>samspade</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(2/26/02 5:16:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=527.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Excerpt from my story...Critique please</span><hr size=1> Hate to do the psychologist trick but what do you think is wrong with it?<br>
<br>
Is it the pace, description, characterisation, dialogue, turn-of-phrase?<br>

Specifically in the way the characters speak. For example, when one of them says &quot;Ooh, shiney ect...&quot; it might add a bit of intrest to describe how he said this. Was it in a mishchiviouse(sp?) manner, or an excited one. Did his eyes widen in joy, or did he smile because of his good fortune? <br>
<br>
I say this because when I was reading it, the mental picture I got was three people in grey speaking in monotone voices. Work on including this, it will help add to your characters personality and help the reader get a better picture.<br>
<br>
Concerning the plot so far, it doesn't seem to be going wrong. I personally want to know what an 11 year old is doing hanging out with people who get shot at?<br>

Some are rather undescripted, allowing the reader to contrive their own images while others will go at great lenghts to make every detail crystal clear. It really all depends on your writing. if you naturally with great or little detail, you should leave it at that and not strain yourself trying to change. Of course, if a scene does need quite a lot of detail, then try as much as you see fit to get the details down. Its really all a matter of opinion though.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=lakeoffire>Lake of Fire</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(2/26/02 6:21:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=527.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> heck</span><hr size=1> I'm gonna put a later part in the scene that I just sort of revised.<br>
<br>
Shraik didn't need to scream to get Ray to stop the truck. The tires squealed as the trucks front bumper tapped anothers rear one. Max was gasping for breath.<br>
&quot;Wh...What?&quot; Ray held his chest and said hoarsely, &quot;Where'd they come from?&quot; Shraik shut his eyes tightly and opened them, that usually helped him in confusing situations, he never knew why. Max shivered and sunk down in the seat, &quot;What's happening?&quot; Shraik took deep breaths as he climbed from the back of the pickup, which was now stained with bulletholes. <br>
<br>
Cars, trucks, vehicles. They were everywhere on the road. Ray shook his head and put his hands over his face. The gun was in Shraiks shaky and sweaty grip. Max was trying to stay calm. A few moments before, the road was deserted, and suddenly the automobiles road in from behind shrubbery or trees and made a huge traffic jam. Shraik stated in a cautious voice what Max and Ray already knew, &quot;They don't want us to leave.&quot;<br>
<br>
Shraik Moode, with wide and curious eyes stepped toward the closest car. A small green Volkswagen, or 'punch buggy' as many people called them. A rough looking man was inside it, looked to be about 45. He had a salt and pepper colored beard and round sunglasses over his eyes. The man wore a cowboy hat that looked as worn as him. Shraik found it most strange that the man didn't even notice him standing outside his window. Shraik looked back at Ray and Max who were in the truck, they nervously nodded, then turned back to the window. He said in the most normal voice he could,&quot; Excuse me, sir! Can you tell me... What's happening?&quot;<br>
<br>
The man didn't reply, he didn't even move, but the window rolled down. &quot;Sir... Can you please...&quot; Shraik said in a half exasperate voice. The man turned his head to face Shraik and smiled. Shraik backed up and managed to force a smile. The man opened the door and stepped out. Shraik gasped at the size of the shotgun. It was bigger than most he had ever seen. But the man held it with ease, and aimed it. <br>
