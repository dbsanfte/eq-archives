<br>
&quot;where could he be?&quot;<br>
&quot;He said he would be here.&quot;<br>
<br>
*These and other comments are heard as those standing in the heat are looking down the lane for the Wizard. A couple younger members of the Lords rub their eyes wonder if the heat is beginning to effect their vision as the air starts to shimmer before the waiting group. Then, a portal forms briefly and out steps Noltrac to greet his friends.*<br>
<br>
&quot;Hail and well met my friends. I am glad to see you all here waiting for me.&quot; He looks around at a couple of the surprised faces. &quot;What, did you think I would not bind here?&quot; Noltrac chuckles.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well Racle, I am here to formally give you my answer. As I see no armed guards waiting to escort me out of these walls I will assume that were were no objections to my request to become a Page.&quot;<br>
<br>
*Noltrac pauses for a moment and his face become serious.*<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes High Commander Racle, I will be your Page.&quot;<br>
<br>
*Noltrac removes the hood from his bald head, kneels before Racle, and offers up his staff.*<br>
<br>
&quot;I hereby pledge to uphold that which the Lords of the Ters `Tai stand for. I shall stand by the side of my brothers and sisters, never to fail them. And I vow to never bring dishonor to the family through my words, actions, nor deeds.&quot;<br>
<br>
*As Noltrac speaks the final word of his pledge, there is a flash of energy. As of a light not quite seen, or a wind not truly felt. The younger of the Lords are unsure as to what they just witnessed, but the Elders among them know and explain. It is a binding that is stronger than any other know and it only happens when absolute truth, conviction, or love are professed.<br>
Noltrac remains upon his knee, holding up his staff, looking only at Racle, and awaits his Lieges' reply.*<br>

Realizing how rarely she gets to look him in the eye she holds his gaze and places her hand on his shoulder*<br>
&quot;Fellow Lords and Ladies of the Ters'Tai.  Please welcome my friend and comrade Noltrac to the keep as one of our family.  Rarely in my adventures have I met one with as much honor and knowledge and yet humility.  You may think he is a bit mad....   But what is a family without a mad uncle or cousin? &quot;<br>
Speaking now directly to Noltrac she lowers her voice.<br>
&quot;You have always been a good friend to me, and my dear sisters Ceelia and Gwenne.  Any of us would fight at your side knowing it was with honor and for a good cause.  I am most honored to sponsor you Nol and know that you have finally come home.  Please stand and be welcomed by your new guildmates&quot;<br>
*Racle reaches into her knapsack and finds that very special egg.  She takes it out and tosses it gently to her friend with a wink*<br>
*As Noltrac bows and introduces himself to those in the family that he has yet to meet and clinks glasses with his old friend Lord Baledor and samples Lady Kyrra's latest concoction, a young wood elf in blue runs in at the most amazing speed.   All most people see is a bright blue blur until she stops directly in front of the crowd*<br>
*With little regard for all this tradition and all the Elders gathered, the brash young bard pushes her way through the crowd and walks directly up to Noltrac grinning madly with arms outstretched.  Hugging him quickly and bouncing around him excitedly she can hardly contain her joy*<br>
&quot;Noltrac!!!  You did it!  I can't believe you did it!!  Racle always said you would, but I didn't believe her.  I suppose she is older and wiser for a reason.&quot;<br>
*With a grin and her drum in hand she looks at Noltrac with a wild eye*<br>
&quot;Ok enough with all this....  Where are we off to?&quot;   <p><center>

I am glad to have been accepted into this place among these people whom I count as friends. I look forward to having many grand adventures with you all. May we all continue to live in interesting times. To the continued health of the Lords of the Ters `Tai.&quot;<br>
<br>
*Noltrac raises his glass in a toast to all gathered.*<br>
<br>
<br>
*Upon hearing the sound of running feet Noltrac turns grins at the Bouncing Blue Bard who is now standing beside him.*<br>
<br>
&quot;Gwenne! My friend, I must perform the duties expected of a Page for a time. But once that time is done with you and I shall go and find what ever adventure awaits us outside these walls.&quot;<br>
<br>
*Noltrac then takes his position slightly behind and to the right of Racle. His face is serene, but the mad gleam in his eye has been joined by a sparkle of happiness.*<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; The further continuation of any adventures of Noltrac and Gwenne will be found in the Library.&lt;&lt;&lt; <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/flottdrinalfrm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=633.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/flottdrinalfrm1.showNextMessage?topicID=633.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/flottdrinalfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=633.topic&index=13><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/flottdrinalfrm1.emailToFriend?topicID=633.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/flottdrinalfrm1.threadControl?topicID=633.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/flottdrinalfrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=633.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/flottdrinalfrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=633.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub25.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="lottdrinalfrm1">The Courtyard<option value="lottdrinalfrm13">Applications<option value="lottdrinalfrm2">Ters'Tai Barracks<option value="lottdrinalfrm3">The Great Hall<option value="lottdrinalfrm4">The Council of Lords<option value="lottdrinalfrm8">Ters'Tai Marketplace<option value="lottdrinalfrm11">The Library<option value="lottdrinalfrm12">The Treasury<option value="lottdrinalfrm14">Epic Might</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/blottdrinal>Lords of the Ters'Tai - Drinal</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/flottdrinalfrm1>The Courtyard</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.terstai.net">Lords of the Ters'Tai</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.4.4<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
