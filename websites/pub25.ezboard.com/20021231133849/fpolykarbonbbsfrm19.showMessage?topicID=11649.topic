<br>
And here are the rules, which I'm sorry weren't available in the original post<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>World Conquest Chess</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
   By Josh Merker<br>
<br>
A White Knight Game<br>
<br>
A word about the board<br>
<br>
The board for World Conquest Chess, unlike a classic Chess board, is a cylinder.  This means that when something goes off one end, it appears on the other.  It also means that the board has no actual left or right edges, only top and bottom.  The directions on the board will be hereafter reffered to as North, South, East, and West, in the order they appear on a compass, with North pointed up.  Also, columns are reffered to as ranks, and rows as files(The board is layed out sideways for ease of use, therefore this is in keeping with normal Chess convention).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Object</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
To be the only remaining player through the capture of both of the other players' kings.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Setup</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Pieces are placed on the blurred spaces, from north to south, in the following order: Rook, Knight, Bishop, King, Queen, Bishop, Knight, Rook.  White's are placed on the first Rank, Black's on the eighth, and Gray's on the fifteenth.  The appropriately colored Pawns are placed on every space on the ranks immediately to the east and west of each player's pieces.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>New Rules</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Rules for world Conquest Chess are the same as for classic Chess in most areas, therefore only rules that have been modified for this variation appear here.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>The First Move</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
White makes the first move.  The second move is determined by White's first.  If white moves a piece east, then Gray moves.  If White moves west, then Black moves.  After the second player has moved the remaining player moves and play rotates in this order until the completion of the game.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Pawn Movement</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Pawns in this game act exactly as they do in classic chess only sideways.  That is to say that a player's pawns on his east side move east, and his pawns on his west side move west.  Pawns still capture by moving diagonally.  Pawns may also be promoted by advancing six ranks.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Check</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
On a player's turn, if he puts a King in check, he must declare check, and then identify which player he has checked.  On a player's turn, if his own King is in check, he must make a move that will put his King out of check.  If there is no legal move to put the King out of check, the player may make any move that would be legal were his King not in check.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Checkmate</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Technically speaking, there is no condition of checkmate in World Conquest Chess.  A player only forfeits the game if his King is captured.  This means that even if a player has no recourse for a check, he may still be able to get out of it over a course of multiple turns.  When a player's King is captured, all of his pieces are transferred to the ownership of whichever player captured his King.  The game is over when only one player remains in the game. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mido@polykarbonbbs>mido</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(12/13/02 9:21:49 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11649.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> chess</span><hr size=1> ill try it in a few days if thats ok <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=polarboy>PolarBoy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(12/13/02 1:50:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11649.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Getting started</span><hr size=1> Actually, this is gonna take a while.

<br>
I like what you've got so far but I think you still need to do some serious reworking of the gameplay because, as is, this really isn't going to fly.<br>
<br>
First off, the player in the center can't win.  Its just not possible under any realistic circumstances.  He/she is being attacked by both players each move, but can only react to one of them.  Effectively its like losing initiative (called tempo in chess jargon) each turn.  Its death.  I wouldn't be suprised if there was a version of fool's mate that would be guaranteed to suceed.<br>
<br>
Secondly, the pawns.  How do the white's Western pawns and black's Eastern pawns move?  Either way seems problematic.  If they have to move in the same direction as gray's Western and Eastern pawns, then they're pretty much totally useless (especially if they have to capture moving that direction).  If they go the other way then the endgame is going to be screwed up.  Once gray is out of the way and pieces have been traded off, people are going to try to promote pawns.  But now not only is the board way longer, but you have to punch through twice as many pawns to get to the backrow.  Its also unlikely that having that second row will be as helpful offensively because having pawns lined up like that is tactically weak.  Even setting that aside, if the backrow pawns can be used to support the front row, then what's going to happen is that both players are going to get hopelessly entrenched.  Remember, the way you break through strong pawn positions is to usually to use attacks with stronger pieces on the start of the pawn chain.  But now pawns outnumber pieces 2:1!<br>
<br>
So yeah, its a good idea, but I think the rules, or the board, need some tweaking. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=chocoking>ChocoKing</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(12/16/02 9:32:38 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11649.topic&index=10>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://chiyoko.homestead.com/files/yattasml.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re</span><hr size=1> superflat: He already took care of that it looks like:<br>
