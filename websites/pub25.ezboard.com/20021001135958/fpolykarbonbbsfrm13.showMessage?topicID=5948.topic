It is NOT like you took a copy of Joe's lineart, CG'd it and claimed it for your own.  It is good, however that you want to give credit where credit is due...now a little about &quot;Red Monica&quot;:  she was a character in Joe Mad's &quot;Battle Chasers&quot; comic series.  The series had great potential, IMHO, but Joe Mad dropped the project in the middle of the series.  He just left all these loose ends and the books were <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> always</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> terribly late...I think he set the record for missed deadlines...there were times it took years, literally YEARS to get ONE book out...it was a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> monthly</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> series.  Anyway, Red was kind of an anti-heroine who had supposedly shared a past with the series hero, but much about her character is left unresolved because *ahem* <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> somebody</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> wanted to run off and create a video game.  If Joe's record with his own comic is any indication, the game will be years behind schedule, and it when if finally does come out, it will crash just as things are getting good.  Anyway, there is alot of opinion with just a few facts for you, but I hope that helped.  You can pick up a compilation of the &quot;Battle Chasers&quot; in a &quot;graphic novel&quot; format (I bought one not too long ago at my local shop)...in Joe' defense, his artwork is great, and that is the best part of the books, again, IMNSHO <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>...please scroll along, there is nothing to see <a href="http://www.crimsoncrescent.com/">here...</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=kinokuniya>kinokuniya</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(7/23/02 9:59:44 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5948.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Joe mad</span><hr size=1> yo i didn't mean to sound harsh about you copying the pic, it just seemed that way cause the hair, swords and legs are in the same position and she has nearly the same clothing, but if you didn't thaz coo.
