____________________________________________<br>
        She was hard to find, that first time. <br>
        The rest of the village was already gone; some died in their beds shaking with fever, others had frozen to death the woods trying in vain to escape the foul touch of the plague. <br>
        There was a stack of corpses in the center of town, half-burned and covered in frost. They must have been the first to die, but the blizzard had thwarted any attempts to destroy the bodies before the disease spread further. <br>
        He paused, listening for some sound that might indicate where the girl was hidden but the village was silent as a tomb. A grim smile tugged at the corner of his mouth; silent as a tomb, that was a good one. <br>
        A gust of wind ripped an already listing door from its hinges and sent it cart-wheeling across the snow-covered ground. He sighed and turned up the collar on his coat. It was a force of habit that he was still unable to break after all these centuries. <br>
        The snow squeaked uneasily under his feet as he moved from house to hut to shack and barn, searching for that one last survivor, hidden somewhere amoung the dead. And there were a lot of dead. <br>
        He found her lying in one of the cowsheds, swaddled in a blanket and half-buried in the hay. Her lips were blue with cold and still her body shook with fever, the sweat beading on her forehead as though it were a summer day. <br>
        He sat down beside her and gently took her hot hand in his cold one. She woke and looked at him with deep green eyes glazed with fever. <br>
        “So you’ve come.” Her voice was whispery, dry after the struggle against the plague. <br>
        “I am here to take you away.” He smiled and pushed the strands of sweat-sticky hair back from her face. <br>
        She looked at him solemnly. “It is not my time to go.” He was silent, unsure of what to say next. “What do they call you?”<br>
        “I had a name once, but it has been forgotten. Now,” he sighed. “Now I am merely Death.”<br>
        She nodded slightly. “You have wasted your time coming here. I will not go with you.”<br>
        He blinked in surprise. “I’m afraid you must.”<br>
        “No.” She shook her head. “My destiny will not be cut short.”<br>
        He paused, trying to find the appropriate words. He had never had to persuade someone this young before. “Surely you have suffered enough, child.”<br>
        She smiled faintly. “All heroes must suffer.” Her eyes slid closed again, her body straining with the effort to breathe. He stirred restlessly, stroking her hand in a desperate attempt to comfort her. <br>
        This was how he had died. It was during the summer, a season that had come with all the heat of the fires of the underworld and scorched the earth to powder. His wife and child had fallen ill first and though he had prayed and begged the gods for mercy they had died, shriveled into mere husks by the heat within and without. He buried them and lay down on their graves and waited for the plague to take him. <br>
        The girl stirred and opened her eyes again. “They are waiting for you at the gates,” she said quietly. She took another painful breath, licking cracked lips with a dry tongue. “You must go now.”<br>
        “I will take you with me.”<br>
        She shook her head. “You cannot.” <br>
        “I have never…” he paused. “There is no pain in death,” he said pleadingly.<br>
        “Huh.” She made a sound that might have been a laugh. “How would you know?” She closed her eyes again and her hand went limp in his.<br>
        For a moment he thought she had given in after all, but when he leaned closer he could still hear her heart fluttering in her chest. He sat back on his heels, wondering what to do. This had never happened before.<br>
        There was a noise outside of footsteps and the door swung open and a tall man stepped in. He made a surprised noise when he saw the girl, dropping to his knees beside her as he placed his fingers against her neck to see if her heart still beat. Gently the stranger scooped the child up in his arms, folding the blanket around her securely and ducked out through the narrow doorway. <br>
        Death sat watching as the stranger strode away, a dark figure against the brilliant snow. The man turned once at the edge of the woods and looked back and he laughed as though he could see Death, huddled in the shadows of the tiny cow-shed. Then the stranger disappeared amoung the trees taking the girl with him. <br>
        Death lay back on the hay, staring up at the sunlight streaming through the cracked roof and chewing on his thumb thoughtfully. The girl had looked so young, barely a child of six winters, but she had spoken words like those of an elder. “They are waiting for you at the gates.” What did that mean?<br>
            “I see that she escaped you.” <br>
            He sat up quickly as Dexeter and Sinestran stepped inside. “My lords.” He bowed his head respectfully. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Dexeter wrinkled his nose in distaste as he surveyed the dirt and hay that covered the floor. “What did she say to you?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “She said she would not come with me.” He looked at the twins in confusion. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Why?” Dexeter folded his hands into his sleeves. “She did give you a reason why, didn’t she?” he said as Death looked at him in silence.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “She said her destiny would not be cut short.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The twins looked at each for a long moment and then Dexeter turned away with a scowl. “Did she say anything else?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “She told me ‘they are waiting for you at the gates’.” Death said. “What did she mean?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Your family,” Sinestran said after a moment. “They stand outside the gates of the underworld waiting for you to arrive.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Don’t they know…” he paused uncertain how to proceed.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “They have been told that you will not be coming to join them.” Sinestran shook his head. “Mortals can be so foolish.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Death nodded woodenly. “What about the girl?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Follow her. If she will not be persuaded by words perhaps your presence will convince her.” Dexeter pulled his hood up and disappeared through the wall. Sinestran gave Death a long look and then followed his brother. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Death sat numbly and for the first time in many years he wished he could cry, but tears were something that he was incapable of now. After a while he stood and stumbled out into the snow. Follow the girl, they had said. He would follow her and every step would be a prayer for release. <br>
