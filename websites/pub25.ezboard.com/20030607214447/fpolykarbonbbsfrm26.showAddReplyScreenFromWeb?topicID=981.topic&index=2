The cadences became more complex, less rhythmic, and more intense. His eyes gazed sightlessly at the door the man had left by. Not a being to be trifled with, that monstrosity. Snapping his fingers, he spoke firmly. &quot;Attend me!&quot;<br>
<br>
A small dragon slithered from the bookshelves where it had been half drowsing. It was gaunt, emaciated, an albino sport with milky pink eyes. Scales peeling away in patches, and it's pale, obscene tongue sported more than a mere fork - it was a small mass of writhing tentacles that slid up along it's jaw to lick an eye. Though apparently blind, the little beast leapt to Jacob's shoulder and creeled pathetically. Unmoved, Jacob smiled at the creature. &quot;I've a message to be delivered, Derleth, and you'll be taking it to the Boss.&quot; The creature hissed nastily, and it's stinger-equipped tail lashed viciously. &quot;No, not that sort of message. You'll take him this, and then return home, unless you happen across the Siren, the Harlequin, or the Thief of Dreams. Those, if any, you are to let know I have an interesting prospect.&quot; He turned, and picked up a small bird skull, and smiled darkly.<br>
<br>
Placing it on the open space he'd cleared on the desk, he took a small piece of chalk and wrote diagrams around it. He then took both hands and placed them on either side of the skull, and murmured soft, sibilant words in tongues forgotten before mortal man had come to this world. The skull seemed to writhe in pain under the spells, and when he finished, he smiled and leaned back in the chair. Placing a golden chain through the eyes he turned to the dragonet. &quot;Go now.&quot; He turned away, once more absorbed in his studies, ignoring the gold on the desk. Gold was easy to come by...but this opportunity would never happen again...<br>
<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
When the sickly dragonet slipped into the back rooms of the tavern and hissed, the thugs there recoiled instantly. In addition to being revolting, only one man could control the wily little beast - it was certainly no ordinary thing. The lycanthropes didn't dare harm the beast - it's master was no more to be trifled with than the Boss was, but for much different reasons. The Boss glared at the creature as he looked up from his table. Eyes narrowed he studied the ugly little thing, which hissed menacingly at him. He lashed it with his mental force, and the creature recoiled, reeling in terror...and then leapt, flying the short distance to land on the table. Derleth set the chain bearing the tiny bird skull down and backed away, making sharp little barking sounds. It settled, watching the Boss intently.<br>
<br>
The boss looked at the skull distastefully. That damned conjuror was more trouble than he was worth. He glared at the skull, then at the beastie - which hissed at him - and then said to the skull, &quot;Speak, fool.&quot; A black mist rose from the skill, taking the form of a swirling vortex from which two pinpricks of ruby light glared. &quot;These words I bring at the behest of he who summoned me...&quot; and then it spoke in Jacob's voice.<br>
&quot;Greetings to thee, you who would master this place. I give thee a gift, and a warning. My gift to thee is this: he beast Gaiscioch seeks my counsel, and has paid me well for it, but I shall hold my counsel for a day only. My warning to thee is this: that should you seek to tamper with this once-man, all your works shall be undone, and your unlife shall be as ashes before the turning of three moons - three months lunar. Pay my warnings heed, you who would command all, lest you suffer as no being such as yourself has suffered in ancient ages.&quot; The tiny creature faded as the boss crushed the skull in a blow that splintered the table, sending Derleth flapping for a roof beam. <br>
<br>
&quot;Damn that bastard antiquarian! Who does he think he is!&quot; The werewolves cowered at the vampire's anger. One foolish thug, perhaps attempting to curry his master's favor, flung a blade at the small dragon like thing, which buried itself in the creatures side, and nailed it to the wall. The boss rounded on the thug and roared. &quot;You imbecile!&quot; The room fell quiet, and there were several gasps, and muttered curses. Then the soft hiss and creel of Derleth sent the room quiet.<br>
<br>
The tiny beast, nailed as it was to the wall, clawed at the knife, finally catching a claw hold of the blade, and struggling. Clear, pungent ichor oozed from the wound, and then the beast continued to struggle, slowly tearing itself from the blade, and perching upon it. It's blind eyes stared at the thug who had hurt it, and it licked an eye, making that peculiar barking noise of laughter. The Boss snarled and gestured at Derleth. &quot;Go home to your master, worm, or I'll truly harm you!&quot; Emphasis came in the form of another mind lash and Derleth screeched, and flew out the window. Rounding on the thug who'd stabbed the little beast, he said quietly, &quot;You, my fine fellow, are going to have to deal with Jacob Gail's anger yourself!&quot; Never mind it had been the Boss controlling the idiot thug's actions, in hopes of ridding Jacob of the beast's prying eyes and ears. He didn't dare take on the sorcerer himself - he remembered all too well the three werewolves who had simply vanished after they had entered Jacob's lair in hopes of taking the wizard to the Boss to be mastered...one had turned up again, after a month - hideously deformed, and insane beyond even the boss' mental command.<br>
<br>
But what was the bastard talking about? What did he know that the Boss didn't, about the vampire childe? If only the weren't so well matched, the Boss would have confronted Jacob directly, but the man never left his home, it seemed. And while he was there, he was beyond the Boss' reach. But not, he thought with a dark smile, beyond Gaiscioch's... <br>
<br>
*<br>
Derleth had just about gotten back from his ordeal with the Boss. He landed about a yard away from Jacob's home and started to slither to the small door Jacob had cut in the wall many years ago. Out of the shadows a tall well built man who's eyes had the look of coal, a look that could creep under your skin and into your mind. He wore all black with a black cape he used to make himself look nothing more then a meager shadow. In fact this man was perhaps the most dangerous man about. His name was Akar Assante and he was the Thief of Dreams<br>
<br>
&quot; Well, well, another errand for Jacob&quot; Akar said as he stepped out in front of Derleth. <br>
<br>
Derleth just hissed in reply. And motioned to Akar to follow him. Akar crept into the house as quite as the wind but no man could not be sensed by Jacob. &quot;Ahhhh welcome, Akar, how goes things?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;They could be better, could be worse&quot; Akar rarely gave out personal information, even to Jacob. <br>
<br>
&quot; I have something that might interest you&quot; replied Jacob, trying hard to stay calm although the thoughts of what Akar could do to people simply delighted him. &quot;There is a new beast in town, a Vampire, a big vampire&quot; spoke Jacob. &quot;And I want you to do something for me.&quot;<br>
<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
Gaiscioch walked calmly down the street. Although out of his element in the wilderness the dark was always comforting to him. His sense’s where as good as any animals and his speed was impressive for a man of his size. But some things are just as at home in the dark. Men who live the night as wolves. Creatures more damned then a Vampire. For these men still lived there first lives along with living there damned ones. Easily manipulated if one had the proper mind set. <br>
<br>
Gaiscioch cursed his luck when he smelt the wolf in the breeze. &quot;Damn it, don't these things have anything better to do then bug me?&quot; questioned Gaiscioch who was not fully aware of his situation. Gaiscioch just kept walking not making any real movements in body to set off the werewolves. Even though he was quite calm on the outside every muscle was tensed, ready to strike or run depending on how many of them there were. He watched closely the shadows now, watching them move along at his pace. Not wanting to deal with a dangerous foe and bring attention to his already noticeable self Gaiscioch quickly went into a pub. There he sat all night listening to wolves howl, almost in a mocking laugh at Gaiscioch's ignorance. Gaiscioch paid for a room and slept under the bed to make sure no light reached him. <br>
<br>
 <br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
        In an Inn across town, a shadowy figure sat in the dark corner of its room. It was dressed in the long flowing robes of a bard and had a harp flung over its shoulder. It put aside the scrying device with which it had been observing the conversation between Jacob and Akar. It knew that Jacob had known of it's scrying, and that Jacob loved to watch a show. Jacob had deliberately spelled everything about Gaiscioch out to Akar, knowing full well that Cara Bronwyn, The Siren, would be listening.<br>
        With a smile that would chill a red dragon's heart, and a whispered challenge to her rival, she picked up the harp, and began to play.<br>
<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
        Gaiscioch awoke with a start and sat up forgetting he was under a bed. With a startled oath, he rolled out from under the bed rubbing his head in the spot where it collided with the bed frame. It didn't really hurt at all, but it was a habit from his human days that he found impossible to break. He quickly forgot about his head and tried to figure out what had awoken him. Nothing in the room seemed out of place, but there was something in the back of his mind that had not been there before. There was a faint melody that was drawing at his heart, compelling him to leave the pub. Common sense took the better of him though and he waited until the sun had set. Doing this took all of his considerable willpower however, and when the light at last faded from view, Gaiscioch burst from the pub as if he was looking for his first meal in a week. The song playing in his head would not let him stop to feed, but lead him across town to an unknown destination.<br>
<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
        The Boss issued a string of curses as he reached for his scrying bowl and hoped that she had not joined the hunt. When he attempted to call up a vision of Gaiscioch, his scrying powers would not work. He knew of only a few people who could block him so, and Jacob would not be so presumptuous. Boss called out a call to arms and sent his minions out to locate Gaiscioch, while he attempted to break through The Siren's song and into Gaiscioch's head.<br>
<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
        As a Thief of Dreams, Akar enjoyed many luxuries, including the ability to see into anyone’s mind and tell what is going on in there. While he shadowed Gaiscioch, Akar enjoyed watching the power struggle between Cara and the Boss for control of Gaiscioch mind. He knew that Cara the Siren could easily overpower the Boss if he wasn't in his keep, so he smiled slightly as he gave a slight push against her in favor of the Boss.<br>
<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
        One second, he was asleep under a bed in an inn, the next, he was for some reason standing out in the middle of the town. He had a fleeting memory of hearing music, but he could not remember the tune, or if it was even there. As he became aware of his surroundings, Gaiscioch suddenly realized that he was surrounded by werewolves. He only had time to unsheathe his claws before they were upon him. <br>
<br>
Jacob started at the picture in the book, watching as the lycanthropes slowly closed in on the beast. The Thief and the Siren had both answered his call. That merely left the Harlequin. Each one extraordinarily dangerous, each one powerful and unbeatable in his or her own territory and style. Jacob did nothing yet, merely observed the situation in his books, and smiled faintly. Yes, this was turning out rather well. In fact, it was turning out so well, he wasn't sure it wouldn't backfire on him any less than it would backfire on the others. Time to perhaps make certain that did not happen.<br>
<br>
&quot;attend me!&quot; He called, and Derleth leapt to his shoulder from the ceilings beams. Creeling miserably, it licked the still gaping wound, which bleed no more. &quot;Ridiculous, mortal weapons cannot harm you, so cease sniveling.&quot; The creature gave a series of sharp barks - laughter. &quot;When survives this, and after the Siren and the thief are finished with their introductions, bring him to me once more, Derleth. He has paid for information, and I would give that to him....&quot; There was no doubt in his mind Gaiscioch would survive. The fools never realized until it was too late. That's why Jacob was still alive, and had seen the passing of several of the night's Masters.<br>
<br>
Jacob smiled. none of the others knew what they were dealing with. He did, but he wouldn't tell them. And it wasn't exactly a secret, so much as it was something so obvious that none of them could possibly notice. &quot;Heroes,&quot; Jacob said to himself as Derleth flew away, &quot;are terribly hard to find in the rough.&quot; He walked over to one of his books, this one bound in a leather made from the skin of something that had never borne a name in human languages. This he opened, and studied intently. Then he spoke softly and firmly.<br>
<br>
By force of will and dark desire<br>
This I draw from the coldest fire<br>
From realms unknown in ancient way<br>
To places of men I call thee slave<br>
To do as bid, and nothing less<br>
No more than that by my duress<br>
<br>
As he chants softly, the picture on the book fades, and a pretty young woman stands before him. She wears nothing but a soft smile, and golden tresses, and she looks at him with a blank gaze. &quot;Seek the creature who harmed my familiar. Do with him as you will, but ensure it is seen by those who accompany him.&quot; He did not add silently his thoughts of who else should see it. The thrull could see his thoughts, and he was not interested in gaining it's true masters attentions this evening. Perhaps later. &quot;Go now.&quot; He turned, and the girl silently left the room, though, she did not leave by the door....the wet noises ceased, as Jacob turned to soft, sensual tentacles sliding up the chimney.<br>

<br>
the pacing in this is incredibly jumpy. you go from one scene to the next with no sort of pause and the flow of the story suffers because of it. <br>
<br>
secondly, you change tense practically every other sentence. this makes it very hard to read, not to mention a bit inconsistent. pick and tense (past, present, third person, first person) and stick with it. <br>
<br>
this is really too short (long as it is). you seem to have a tendency to skip over things, describe events in a single sentence rather than really explain what happens. you say that an old woman offers him shelter for the night. why not just show us? Gaiscioch is walking down the street, old woman sees him, invites him inside, etc. there's a lot in here that you could describe in action, actually showing us the events as they happen instead of just saying &quot;then this happened/happens.&quot;<br>
<br>
also, about the name. pointing out that this means warrior in Gaelic is a bit heavy handed. it would be better to let that come out in the story itself. the guy has forgotten his name but he remembers that he was once a warrior and calls himself that. let us learn slowly where he's from. btw, there are several other words that mean warrior in Gaelic and some are easier to pronounce. you might consider changing his name. the spelling i found of this word has a &quot;g&quot; instead of that first &quot;c.&quot; i'm not sure how you want the name pronounced but (just in case you didn't know) &quot;c&quot; in Gaelic is always hard, like a &quot;k.&quot;<br>
<br>
anyway, just some things to think about. <br>
