You should check out some of the 'what is talent' and 'professional- can I get there?' debates we've had here and in the lounge. Keep in mind good artists live a &quot;good artists lifestyle&quot; - they practice and are always comming up with ideas. Since you're a comic fan, you'll know a lot of pros in the industry have to be prepaired to work their arses of the break into the industry and when they're there, they work equally as hard to meet deadlines etc. Be prepaired for a lot of hard work if you wanna be a somebody in the art field. Most people here have ben drawing all their lives, like me, and I'm no where near good enough to be pencilling comics. Maybe if I practiced my arse off for the next few years, I could get there, but someone starting out is gonna have spend time, effort and be able to take in what they're learning each time they draw a picture. Some people simply have to talent- that's why at school they'd rather be playing foot ball or solving maths equations that trying to draw, since they knew they were no good at it. <br><br>Negatives aside, you could definetly get better. I see room for improvment, but how much you improve is up to you - you'll have to change your lifestyle if you want to get REALLY good and practice instead of watching TV or whatever you do to pass the time ^_^ At the end of the day, it's your choice, and I know choices are harder to do then stick to than for other's, but I can't see any other way. Practice and you'll get better. Just don't expect pro results after a year or two, but I'm sure you'll notice how far you come it you can stick it out. <br><br>Now what to practice? Well, I'd say everything! What are you best at? To start, I'd continue to improve what you can already do, then after it starts geting boring, try something else. You CAN leave lightsorcing and shadows 'till later one, 'cos I think the most important think is getting masses down. Copy pictures of pro artists and as you do it try to understand why they did it and why it looks good. Draw from life- it'll give you an understanding of depth and perspective. And just doodle and make stuff up for fun (to keep you mind stimulated with ideas, so you don't let the practicing side get you down) Just take things one step at a time.<br><br>Good luck <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><center><a href="http://www.organicmetal.co.uk/cgi-bin/forum/ultimatebb.cgi"><img src="http://www.organicmetal.co.uk/Extra/OM_BBS_girlbanner1.gif" alt="Organic Metal Message Board!!" border="0"></a></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/usuperfluidity.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SuperFluidity</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.superfluidity.com/flow.jpg/" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pre-Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(5/9/02 5:46:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3547.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.superfluidity.com/flow.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I need help - Seriously</span><hr size=1> If you keep this persistent I think you can improve dramatically in 8 months, that fast.

You must have a firm grasp of realism if you're going to venture into stylized art. Not to say that you shouldn't stylize anything until you become a master in realism, but you have to maintain certain boundaries that relate back to realism, so that a stylized character or object still reasonably resembles it's realistic counterpart (examples of that would be taking into account balance, symmetry etc. these can be bent to some extent, but they can't completely be ignored) (yakyakyak, I think you get my point. Your background in anatomy is going to prove very useful for you, here.)<br><br>2) Practice like crazy. A big problem I see with artists who are just beginning is that, instead of tackling the things that they have problems with, they'll deliberately find ways to skirt around doing the hard stuff. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Don't do that</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br><br>Take hands, for example: very often you'll see a beginner draw the character with their hands behind their back, in pockets, or even cut off by the edges of the paper. Hey, I'm not exactly pro, either, so I used to do it alot, too. But I remind myself, what am I so afraid of? I should be more afraid of applying to an art school and being turned down for not being able to draw something so essential.<br><br>I think those are the two big things. Learn realism, and practice what you're bad at. Everything else is supplementary to that. As for classes, take whatever you feel will help you with what I mentioned above.

Try and see the forms that he puts under his drawings, how he blocks in his characters, where he puts the lines of action, what the vanishing points are. That sort of stuff. But I would also suggest that you do this with as many other artists as possible. People don't develop styles in a vacuum, you develop a style by absorbing elements of things you see and reworking them into something you like. <br><br>As for classes, well, a general one would be a good place to start. Something that touches on a little of perspective, colour, life, theory, and different media. <br><br>If your goal is just to produce quality art for friends and gifts then I don't think two years is too little time, especially if you practice daily, just so long as it stays fun. <br><br>As for exercises, one of the best ones you can do to help you get what you see in your had onto paper is to pick an object and draw it without looking at the paper and without lifting your pencil. Repeat until the drawing starts to look like the object. Do this with faces too. Get someone to sit in front of you and draw their face without looking at the paper(you can pick up your pencil for this one). Gesture draw too.
