Chapter 1<br>
                      A Summer’s Sorrow<br>
Summer in the swamps that surround Lynoch are notoriously hot, humid and downright intolerable but in the mind of an anfibite youth skipping down the Dren Trail the day was wonderful.  Matyr was actually a little on the hot side, but that didn’t disturb his mood or slow his step; it merely added pep, an incentive to quickly return to his pond.  That cool crisp water beckoned his abominably dry leathery skin yearned for the murky depths.  You see Matyr was a Toad anfibite, and while most of his friends enjoyed physical training and combat, he was at home among his waterproof books given to him by the Frog anfibite hermit that lives in Lynoch.<br>
His head full of thoughts about what the old frog did locked deep in his underwater tower it should come as no surprise to him to find that he did not see the man posed in the middle of the road until he was merely a dozen feet away.  Jarred back into reality by the man’s silver lined black velvet robe; he quickly sunk behind a tree scolding his unobservant behavior.<br>
The man simply stood there staring into one of the only clearings in the swamp with a sad, almost tearful, expression.  The boy was seconds from walking up to the man and asking him what was wrong and if he could help, when he heard drums.  A low steady rhythm resounded through the swamp, stirring up things that shouldn’t be stirred.  Somewhere close, much too close in the boy’s mind, a Wyrx roared and began to tear his way through the brush.  He could picture the huge gray beast uprooting trees as it hulked about in search of food.<br>
When the drums sounded the man raised his head and spoke a few words to himself.  These few words made clear what Matyr had not even suspected; the man spoke in Anfibite with an unmistakably Toad accent.  <br>
“For those men who are about to meet their deaths at my hands under orders over which they have no power, for those wives and children of whom their loved ones are about to be slain I emit my sorrow.”<br>
On the word “sorrow” the man’s voice began to rise and fall in a chorus of magical enchantments.  Power ebbed from his hands and flowed forth in a kaleidoscope of colors.  The colors collected into a pulsing spectral orb five feet behind him.  The orb split into rays of color, colliding with the ground in more than a dozen points.  From these fourteen points, fourteen amulets began to rise and swirl, collecting their respective colors into a glowing epicenter two feet above the ground.  These points spread and the chant rose to a pinnacle and then the chant and the pulsing lights of magic were doused abruptly.  A new, slyer chant rose from the mage and a blanket of oscillating air covered the field behind him.<br>
Noises, strange noises, noises from large creatures, came from behind the mage.  A snort and a stomp shook up dust and sprayed it in all directions, some thing hummed and an unseen flame crackled.  The mage rose his hands and the amulets flew to him, landing neatly around his neck.<br>
The man drew a potion with his webbed left hand and a sword with his right.  He drank the clear liquid, tossing the vial aside, and reversed his sword so that the point faced the ground.  The sword was an ordinary longsword, with teeth lining the edges of the blade.  Physically plain the sword sung with magic and as the last rays of Plarius, the planet of fire, set on the horizon the sword shone with magical scripts and symbols.<br>
The blaring horns coming from the edge of the swamp opposite the mage disrupted the boy from his admiration and fear of the mage’s mighty weapon.  The boy looked over to see an army of foot soldiers followed closely by mounted knights, and mages.  The banners and breastplates spoke silently of the human empire Osaris.  Another horn sounded and a mounted human with the distinctive knightly beard and mustache rode ahead of the army about 30 feet and faced the mage with noble aloofness.  He unrolled a scroll and read for all to hear:<br>
“By order of the Emperor you, Frega of Fregerin, are hereby sentenced to death for the brutal murder of Atenius Coralli, nephew of the Emperor of Osaris.  Do you have any last words, requests or deeds to perform?”<br>
Frega threw back his hood with his left hand and spoke the words that were assumed to be his last: “ You cannot defeat me, but you cannot return home without completing your task.  Throw down your weapons and I will, one by one, return you to the homes you have left behind.”  Frega arrogantly proclaimed.  He smiled and added, “You can say you fell into a clever trap, can you knights tell one lie to save all of your lives?  No, you cannot.  So you must die.”<br>
The knight’s face turned crimson; he spewed orders to charge, which were cut short by a gurgling sound.  The man had turned to water!  The knight gushed down the flanks of his astonished steed and landed as a puddle upon the battlefield.  At this sudden display of power, about ten of the 150 or so footmen turned and ran, only to be controlled by the mages and sent charging towards Frega unwillingly with their comrades.<br>
The space between the mage and the army disappeared rapidly before the boys eyes, yet even when they came within one hundred feet Frega stood still, silently waiting, sword-tip buried an inch below the surface.  Only when the soldiers came within throwing range did the mage move at all.  The mage lifted his sword and pointed at the line of advancing soldiers.  The ground began to rumble and dust erupted from behind the mage.  A motley army of monsters appeared behind the mage, a few the boy recognized, a giant fire-breathing bull called a Tur, some type of Wyvern, a water elemental and a small swarm of pixies. Most the boy didn’t recognize, a black troll, a woman wreathed in flames, two large humanoid rock creatures, a Golem covered in large black spikes, and two large hounds, one black with thunder streaking around his snout, one with greenish fur and acid dripping from his maw. One the boy had never dreamed of in his worst nightmares, a black scar in reality.<br>
Volleys of magical lightning, fire, ice, darkness and steam tore through the ranks of the soldiers slaughtering them all in a viscous carnage that was their ghastly demise.  Appalled by what he just witnessed the boy, quivering behind his tree, scarcely noticed the mage mount the wyvern and soar into the sky.  The gore-strewn grass before them stunned the knights of Osaris, they had mere moments before the creatures attacked them from all sides, below and the wyvern mounted mage from above.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Matyr, being a sheltered child, looked away from the battle, only to see more soldiers, moving swiftly and quietly through the swamp.  Even the boy could tell that these men were hunters and archers.  Rangers in training, some of them were only flitting shadows through the underbrush.  Arrows knocked and ready, they moved rapidly towards the battle.  The company was almost past the boy when a small twig hit his shoulder.  Matyr looked up and saw an assassin, and several shadows.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The boy turned to the sound of a large screech.  He saw they wyvern plummet from the sky bearing his rider closer and closer to death.  The mage disappeared in a flash and appeared in the exact spot where he had begun the battle, giving a scorn at the heap of twisted flesh that was his steed.  Frega took several steps back, stabbing his sword into the ground, and dumped out an ordinary-looking backpack onto the grass.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A small assortment of wonders glazed over the boy’s vision and, for the moment the assassins, creatures and bloody battle were lost in that pile of treasures.  Frega swiftly and adeptly found a short rod and lifted it out of the pile.  The rod was something that hurt the eyes: midnight black with an ivory skull crowning one end and a silver-horned dragon skull on the other.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The mage raised the rod level with the wyvern and spoke a single word.  The creature began to glow with an unnatural light.  The wyvern’s white scales shimmered in the iridescent light and in that moment the boy knew the creature to be holy.  Frega reversed the rod and brought it about to face five of the soldiers nearest the fallen beast, chanting a magical verse when the rod’s ivory skull shaded their body from Frega’s sight.  A ghostly apparition appeared above each body, the white outline of men converged on the wyvern and disappeared into its dazzling flanks.  Bones and flesh twisted and turned back into place, the creature’s neck straightened as the Wyvern lifted its head.  The light faded and the beast’s eyes glowed white.  The creature looked once at his master, bowed its head in silent reverence and flew back into the fray.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The Knights were taking heavy casualties and what little damage they inflicted upon their adversary the omnipresent pixies cured in moments.  Many among the ranks wondered if the hired assassins had betrayed them, warning the archmagus of their plan and then deserting them when they were needed most.  In reality the assassins had kept their deal and were only to far ahead of the group to be of any use in the opening moments of the battle.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Bolts began to fly; a hail of arrows filled the air.  Frega turned and summoned a shield of flame one arrow too late. The arrow shaft cut deep into his left shoulder snapping his collarbone.  The assassins took this as a great stroke of luck; black robes usually cast with their left hand and wield weapons with their right.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp After a brief moment of agony the mage turned to his new opponents and sprinted towards them.  Feeling they had no need for the cover of the forest the assassins abandoned their trees and prepared for close range combat.  Some wielded sickles and hand scythes others had whips and a few had longswords of the own.  Thinking the mage no match for them in physical combat and unable to cast spells, they could take their time and enjoy their work.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp If they had made a single assumption correct they may have lived, but as it is they were caught flat-footed by what happened next.  The boy was close enough to hear the words the mage spoke and he would feel the repercussions of those two words.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Karali esrinal”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Upon speaking the first word the shield of fire that floated a foot away from his body bulged; from the center of the shield hands sprouted.  The second word solidified and amplified the hands one thousand fold.  Each finger became as thick as an oak and was 4 times as long as the boy was tall.  The hands outstretched and enveloped the assassins, all but one.  Trapped between walls of flame the assassins could do nothing to save themselves.  The boy cowered, caught near the center of the spell, he wept, for he thought he would never see his pond or his mother again.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  The mage swiped the air with his sword and slice of magic infinitely thin and longer than the hand-trapped area decimated the assassins.  Most were caught completely off guard by the slice and were cut in half; a handful evaded the attack and landed in the lower branches of the trees, only to be fried by the encroaching hands.<br>
Frega nonchalantly waved his hand, extinguishing the hands and his shield.  The boy lay on the ground screaming; the fire had seared his back before vanishing and the slice had severed his right hand below the wrist.  Fear turned to despair, despair was fanned by the waves of pain and erupted into pure rage.  The boy stood on wobbly feet and screamed at the mage.  The mage saw the boy and stared in shock, a tear running down the right side of his face, collecting in the corner of his mouth.  Frega stood appalled by the wounding of the innocent child.  He never saw the blade coming.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Leader of the assassins, Revin had amazing speed, stealth and agility.  Well amazing for human, flash elves, morphs and anfibites outmatched him in their respective categories, but this was to be expected.  Revin was ecstatic when he wet his sword with the blood of the mage that had destroyed the first company under his command.  His sword emerged from Frega’s stomach, staining the ground red with blood.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The impaled mage collapsed in a heap, landing on his back.  His sword gripped tightly in his hand, held fast against his chest.  The assassin knelt and pried the sword from the dying mage and turned it on him.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “You shall die by your own sword slimy toad.”  The man placed the tip of the sword below Frega’s chin.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The mage smiled and gurgled out his last words in his native tongue before the blade pierced his throat.  “I live by my sword, you shall die by its blade.”  The sword began to shine red and swirled with blue.  The assassin dove the sword tip into the mage’s neck as the colors flared purple.  A brilliant flash of light engulfed the assassin and mage for several seconds.  An explosion shook the ground and blasted the air.  When the light subsided the mage lay on the ground, untouched, the assassin scattered around the clearing and the sword was hovering six feet above the fallen mage.  The weapon shone once more and the mage’s body disappeared, only his cloak and robe remained.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The sword flew up into the air and flared brilliantly.  Cracks appeared in the sword, separating the blade into six pieces and the hilt.  The cracks shattered the weapon and pieces flew to the six poles of the world.  The hilt fell to the ground and landed in the folds of the mages robe.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The boy looked where the battle had taken place and saw only a wasteland, strewn with pieces of dead humans.  Matyr wiped tears from his eyes and hobbled to the pile of neatly folded clothes the mage had once worn.  Sparks of magical energy zapped the air around the once might weapon’s handle.  He gazed at, then into the shattered hilt of the sword.  His arm began to move involuntarily to the grip.  He knelt and lifted the hilt with his remaining left hand.  The boy’s arm felt as if it had been lit aflame by a cold fire; he tried to drop the sword, but his arm would not obey.  The cold burning moved up his arm through his chest and enveloped his back in freezing pain.  Matyr’s head spun and he fell to his knees, hand and stump cupped over his eyes.  The fire covered him completely, then he dropped the hilt.  The pain vanished and slowly the boy stopped trembling and took his hands from his eyes.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The boy sat staring at his right hand, not only was he not engulfed in magical fire, his hand was whole.  Matyr reached his hand around, touched his back with his new hand and found his shirt singed away, but the flesh was intact.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The boy stared at the hilt of the weapon for a moment then he threw it to the wayside and ran.  He ran in fear and confusion; he ran from the blood and gore.  He ran the entire way home through the marsh.  He saw smoke coming from his house, mother must be cooking fish he thought, then the smell hit him.  The smell he had been running from.  The smell of burnt flesh and charred forest.  He burst into the clearing that contained his home and fell once again to his knees.  He saw the charred remnants of his house; he saw his mother laying face down covered in blood with a stone dagger in her hand.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Exhausted and broken the boy collapsed into his pond, sunk to the murky bottom and slept.<br>
