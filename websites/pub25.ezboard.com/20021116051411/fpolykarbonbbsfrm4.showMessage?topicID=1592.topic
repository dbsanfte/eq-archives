DAMN DBZ!!!</span><hr size=1> All right, before an angry mob of DBZ acolytes show up at my doorstep with lit torches and pitchforks, let me explain.<br>
<br>
My dislike of DBZ is not necessarily based upon the show at all. In fact I rather enjoy it, as a silly yet action-packed half hour (though that action can become VERY redundant at times.). As I may have created further confusion, inciting the mob act rashly and press their lynching of me, let me explain further.<br>
<br>
Akira Toriyama, the creator of DBZ /GT is the culprit of all my dismay. He, in his own right, was a decent enough anime / manga artist with fresh (at their time) ideas, and by no fault of his own is he responsible for this problem. However, in creating a popular cartoon / manga and that creation enduring through the years, Mr.Toriyama has managed to destroy an entire generation of would-be artists. How you ask? Simple, his ever-popular creation, fed through the mass media, has inspired legions of my peers to abandon their innate creative talent and endeavor to become &quot;Akira clones&quot;. Fashioning their art and concepts of action after his, wholly indoctrinated by the unwitting poison that is DBZ, they have ceased to created anything new, push boundaries, or even study art.<br>
<br>
Long have I stood and watched my fellow artistically inclined friends fall into the Toriyama trap. Friends so gifted are intoxicated with an actual action cartoon, the power blasts and the grandiose battles. Soon they no longer care much for learning anatomy, for Goku's muscles are easily learned, with no real inkling of what they are, how they function, or why they are there. Often Toriyama's anatomy is grossly mutilated, even to the point of muscles appearing that do not exist on any plane. These physical inaccuracies are often overlooked by those in love with Toriyama’s art, and more frequently never noticed at all.<br>
<br>
Gone is the Toriyama clone’s drive to invent new and innovative battle scenes, weapons, and concepts. Toriyama disciples find it all too easy to become content with the locking of luminescent balls of chi that clash in mid air. Cell shading and harsh lighting have oft taken the place of once venerated skills such as actual shading, with color gradients mind you, and multi-light sourcing. Heads easily likened to melons look upon the world with eyes the size of small countries, suspiciously lacking pupils. Hair, which adds a meter of height to its head, stands spiky and impossible, while the ability to actually create and fashion semi-reasonable hair (and, “GASP”, actual parts, cowlicks, and normal sized craniums.) is considered drab by many and often scoffed at.<br>
<br>
I am young yet, and perhaps my peers will grow out of Mr. Toriyama and DBZ, perhaps they may only evolve his style into their own, but as it stands now, within my generation, DBZ has destroyed so much talent, as pop culture has a habit of doing. So again, I reaffirm my statement, Damn DBZ!<br>
<br>
Now please put away your pitchforks and torches, lest I open up a Ka-Ma-Ha-Ma-Ha wave on your Asses!<br>

Here's my 2 cents<br>
DBZ is great for beginners. Although the anatomy is wierd, so what? So was Akira, some of Gundam Wing, a bit of BGC and practically EVERY OTHER ANIME I'VE EVER SEEN.<br>
Ki balls are good for explosions, and very easy to do, because you never actually have to draw guns 600 feet in length. To get the same effect, try Goku's spirit bomb. Simple as that. Guns 600 feet in length would be impossible to draw and still be able to get any detail in for the character without having about 260 feet of paper. Oh, incidentally it's spelt kamEhameha rather than kamahamaha. And if it's the wave attack I think it's spelt kameiyameiya wave because it's not a proper kamehameha.<br>
How many times can I write kamehameha in one post? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=gax>Gax</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pre-Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(4/27/02 2:34:56 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1592.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Away put your weapons. I mean you no harm.</span><hr size=1> You're missing the point completely. I had no intention of attacking the show / manga or Toriyama. In fact I believe I made it quite clear that Toriyama's concepts and execution were fresh and interesting (though since him done to death.) The kameiyameiya (spell it right this time?) wave is perfectly fine when wielded from Goku's hands. Goku's anatomy and his imperfections are what gives him character. Heres my gripe, more simplified for those of you who haven't yet progressed past a third grade reading level:<br>
<br>
Toriyama's style has become so popular that it has caused countless artists of my generation to aspire to draw JUST LIKE Toriyama.<br>
<br>
Slowly I've seen great and original artists embody bits and pieces of Toriyama's work, so eventually it seems I am looking at a piece Toriyama has drawn from beyond the grave.<br>
<br>
Yes all anime / manga / comics have slightly warped anatomy, however, how many DBZ clone artists do you see in comparison to Gundam clone artists.<br>
<br>
I'd bet my bottom dollar its a 50 to 1 ration.<br>
<br>
The reason I lash out at DBZ is that it is the primary medium in which the masses are intorduced to Toriyama's work, and so many indoctrinated. And for no other reason than that. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/unaokochan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Naoko Chan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Hot Sexy B*tch <img src=http://contest.polykarbon.com/badge1.gif></span><br> <font color=#336699>(4/27/02 3:55:56 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1592.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://naokochan.xoasis.com/kururin90x81.gif width=90 height=81></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_exclamation_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  N</span><hr size=1> First off, I'm not a DBZ fan.

Maybe where you live, but in my University, the artists/illustrators' work don't even resemble Toriyama's work.  Even among the anime fans.  I have seen kids in my area enamored with Pokemon, much to my chagrin.<br>

In Japan, Gundam reigns supreme.  Comparable to Trekkies or Star Wars fans.  And guess what they base their artwork on?  DBZ stuff?  Hell NO!!!!  And in Hawaii, DBZ is passé...<br>
<br>
If this is all the basis of your argument, then I am sorely disappointed.  Come back when you have a real argument...  Bitching about how your peers lack of creativity because of their love of DBZ isn't gonna change them as well.  You are better off exposing them to alot of different styles and artwork (as non-anime art) rather than just complaining about it.<br>

<br>
And you're pretty much grasping at straws if you're trying to claim that cell shading is the fault of DBZ. Pretty much anything that is animated is done in this style of coloring, whether it be from Japan, or anywhere else. And just because it's simplified does not mean it isn't &quot;actual shading&quot; as you put it. Just like a stylized line drawing takes actual knowledge of the human body, so does a simplified, stylized way of shading. You still have to know where shadows fall, you have to know where they are darker than other areas, you just don't graduate from one color to another with smooth transitions. <p><table width=100% border=0>

I'm sorry, but I cant relate to what you're talking about, Gax. Most anime-based styles I see people draw in are quite creative and look NOTHING like DBZ. Unless of course, youre twelve or something. Then its all about that show with them whippershnappers. <br>
<br>
There are alot of things to complain about in DBZ, but the fact that alot of your friends like to draw like it isnt one of them. If they wanna draw like that damn show, so be it. Instead of worrying about it, why not benefit from it, showing off that you actually have a sense of creativity and artistic taste. <br>
<br>
But if you still have a problem with it, introduce them to Ranma or Slayers.

I'm tired of this crap. I'm tired of people just claiming certain shows aren't anime because they don't like them. Maybe you don't realize this, but just because you don't like something, that doesn't mean it isn't anime. Don't be stupid. And stop @#%$ insulting people just because they have different tastes. I don't go around trying to piss people off because they like Lain or some other anime that I don't like. I don't like it, but that doesn't mean the show has no good qualities. It's simply my opinion.<br>
<br>
What, you think just because people like DBZ that they have no taste? You think that's ALL they like? You think all DBZ fans have ONLY seen DBZ and that's WHY they like it? No. I never even heard of DBZ when I got into anime. I started with stuff like Ranma, Akira, etc, and now I also like things like Bebop, Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust, etc. <br>

Most anime I've seen counts as a cartoon, so you're slagging off all anime. The only 'true anime' if we're using your opinion, is shown on Sci-fi at midnight ONE NIGHT A WEEK and very few people stay up for it, or even tape it because it's not really advertised. It seems that most of Britain is anti-manga/anime because of the violence and nudity (sometimes) which are against the Brit's 'moral code' (PS I'm a brit so i'm not being prejudiced here, just rebellious) so it's very hard to get anime over here. So DBZ is usually the first thing we see anime-wise. It was the first thing I ever saw anime-wise, and one of the first thing most of my friends have seen as well. Yet it seems that all people can do is slag it off. Why? That's like slagging off a kid just 'cos they're not as tall as you, or slagging off a brick 'cos it's not as alive as you. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ualisama.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ali Sama</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>IRC Commando</span><br> <font color=#336699>(4/30/02 11:42:00 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1592.topic&index=11>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.perfect-limit.com/ali/remicon.jpg height=136 width=125 ></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: I'm gonna get alot of flack for this.

           Of him the harpers sadly sing:
           the last whose realm was fair and free
           between the Mountains and the Sea.

           His sword was long, his lance was keen,
           his shining helm afar was seen;
           the countless stars of heaven's field
           were mirrored in his silver shield.

           But long ago he rode away,

(its a team that animates it, and most of the artists are awful), and alucard, gimme a damned break, you know DBZ isnt an anime just like pokemon isnt, its no longer new or fresh, no longer up to par on quality, intelligence or keeping a f*ucking storyline straight, let alone interesting. its a show for kids. KIDS. just as every other CARTOON is, minus southpark and the adult swim line-up, mainly because some studio execs got the idea that itd be funny to have cartoons for the big people.<br>
<br>
Ali Sama...when is mad off on anatomy?? dudes brilliant, the only thing i can picture is that big red guy, but given the situation it fit the character. w/e bro, im not gonna get  into that.<br>
<br>
Well alucard, if i came off snobbish im sorry, didnt mean to, i only vented the frustrations given from watching that faggot hercule (or Mr. Satan, w/e u prefer, matters if u know the jap version.) prance around like a big dork, or seeing Goku win EVERY TIME. later.<br>

DAMN DBZ!!!</span><hr size=1> ...<br>
It's an anime. It's a cartoon. It's animation. 3 words that mean the EXACT same thing. But if you go by the popular definition of anime (anything animated from Japan), it's STILL an anime. Yes, Pokemon is anime, so is Digimon, or anything else you might put down.<br>
<br>
And the reason I think some people put DBZ down is because they take it too seriously. That's not what the show is all about, at least not all the time. Is it overdramatic? Yes. Is it highly exaggerated? Yes. That doesn't make it bad. I personally don't feel it's repetitive, but that's just my opinion. I definitely don't think it's moronic. And of course, if you compare the animation to an OAV or a very short animated series, then it is poorer quality. But that's because of the sheer number of episodes. Something like Bebop is animated better because they can spend more per episode.<br>
<br>
Anyway, none of that matters. I don't care that you don't like DBZ, everyone is entitled to their own opinion. What gets on my nerves is when people start pretending it's not a real anime, and start insulting the people that like it. I don't say people that like Lain have no taste, because they just have DIFFERENT tastes. People have their reasons for liking it, and all fans of DBZ are not retards that will just watch anything you set in front of them. <p><table width=100% border=0>

But I have to agree with Niea7 (is that spelled right?) on that most people I see drawing DBZ are 12-year-old boys at my middle school (and a couple of girls who are just into it, but don't draw it). But nearly all my friends are into Japanese anime and they do original stuff. And especially me. I make it a point for my art to be totally original, and if others really want to draw DBZ, that's their deal, just don't rub it in my face.<br>

I'm not into DBZ as much as I was in say 95 or 96, infact I hate what Funimation's done to it in the past couple years.<br>

DBZ wasn't one of the first that i saw but i do enjoy watching it...people slag it off all of the time and i say people can have there own opioins but theres a point where it has to stop.....i mean if some 1 likes it like i do then that is to there own and shouldn't be slagged off for it.....If we all liked the same thing then it just would be plan boring,...i agree that the manga is better <br>
<br>
and as for it not being anime then like some 1 said your wrong.....do u know not class pokemon or digimon or even things like gw or tenchi.....they all are wether u like to think so or not..<br>

DAMN DBZ!!!</span><hr size=1> hey im from the UK, I love DBZ, and I did even before I watched a single eppisode, I dont think the style makes it good, its good-but not brilliant, I think the concepts, characters, story and the style of fighting are what makes it good. First i downloaded a patch for jedi knight which was DBZ, I wondered what the heck it was so I asked a friend, he told me, and I didnt have cartoon network at the time so I read some of the manga, it was cool, I started drawing manga ever scince, I first stared with DBZ and then went to Final fantasy, then I started developing my own ideas, Im trying to improve my DBZ style at the mo, but I want to develop my own, I sort of have, but its in the works. I think the anatomy in dragonball is wrong on perpose because Akira Toriyama has done all the right muscle groups, but they are bulked out but not so they look over buffed.<br>
<br>
I havent seen (on TV) many other manga/anime i mean, its dbz gundam and tenchi, tenchi is interesting, but gundam reminds me of old japanese movies and transformers, I dont mind mech but it isnt what I like, I like Metalgear, I draw alot of metal gear too....<br>
<br>
hope you dont mind my comments :S<br>
