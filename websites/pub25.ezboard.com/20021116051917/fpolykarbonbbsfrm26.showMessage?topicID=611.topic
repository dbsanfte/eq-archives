&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A boy with a mysterious talent.  A talent that no one else has.<br>
  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A talent that is mutating.  And with every breath he takes, it becomes stronger...<br>
<br>
Site:01<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As I lay in the comfortable bed, sleeping, my dreams became scarier and scarier. I wake up.  It's only 2 weeks before I get out of this hospital, I thought.  &quot;I wonder if any one is going to visit today...?&quot;  I said as the cute nurse had walked in the room.  &quot;When am I gettin' out?&quot; I asked just to make sure of the date.  <br>
  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Well, you are recovering very fast from the accident.  I think you'll be out in about 2 weeks.&quot; So I guess  I was right.  “Hey can you get me anything to write with?&quot;<br>
I'm a pretty talented artist so I try to draw as much as I can.  It's going to be my career.  &quot;My mom's insurance covers this, right?”.  “Yes, it's good enough for this.”  I knew that it could pay since I’ve been in like 4 accidents before.  I was in a bus accident...that was what I kept on dreaming of.  <br>
&quot;I'll bring you some food, a paper and pencil.  I'll be back soon&quot;.  &quot;Can you bring me something sweet?&quot;.  &quot;Yes, I’ll bring you Orange juice.&quot;  &quot;Thanks&quot;.  As she left the room I started to get a really bad headache.  I had a vision...but it wasn't that clear.  I always draw my visions, that's how I inspired &quot;myself&quot; to draw.  <br>
When the nurse came back I started to draw what I saw.  “Wow, you have some talent.” Said the nurse.  “Yea I know.  I’m going to be an artist soon.”  “Yes, I can tell by the way you draw.  Very nice.”  While I was drawing, the nurse and I heard a scream down the hall.  I got up out of the bed and went to see what it was.  It sounded like an old lady.  One of the patients was going mad.  He had started to strangle the old lady.<br>
Security came by and beat him down to the floor.  My picture was the picture of a young man on the floor with burble coming out of his mouth.  I thought that it was just a coincidence that the guy strangling the old lady looked like my person.  “Heh, look at my drawing.  Kinda looks like that guy right?”  “Yea…Kinda.” The nurse and I were both looking at each other with a strange look.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A few hours later my mother came to visit me…my father is dead so I don’t think he’d be coming around here.  “Hi, mom.”  “Hello, son…How do you feel?”<br>
<br>

work on the mechanics of the writing a little more. it get's confusing they way the conversations take place in the same paragraph. anytime the dialogue switches to a new/different character you need to start a new paragraph. (this may be due to the way the board formatted something you pasted in, if not, you need to fix it.) <br>
you keep switching from present to past tense. not good. just so you know, first person present tense is really hard to write. it takes a lot of work to make it sound good and not repetitive. right now you say &quot;I wake up&quot; (present tense) and then one line later it's &quot;I thought.&quot; (past tense)<br>
there's really no need for him to ask about the insurance. firstly, 'cause he already knows it will cover him. secondly because it sounds like he's been in the hospital for a while already so that's something that would already have been discussed. <br>
i think it would be good if you described both the dream and the vision a little more. maybe discuss how long he's been having them, what they look like, how long they last, how they affect him. does he wake up in a sweat? you talk about his head hurting, but what kind of pain is it?<br>
don't go overboard on the details but give the reader a better picture of what's going on. <br>
i hope this helps. and i look forward to seeing more from you. <br>

The Enhancement<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As I lay in the comfortable bed, sleeping, my dreams became scarier and scarier. I wake up with small drops of sweat on my face and with a tear coming down my cheek.  It's only 2 weeks before I get out of this hospital, I thought to myself.  <br>
&quot;I wonder if any one is going to visit today...?&quot;  I said as the cute nurse had walked in the room.  She had blue eyes, nice curly brown hair, and she was slim.<br>
&quot;When am I gettin' out?&quot; I asked just to make sure of the date.  <br>
  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Well, you are recovering very fast from the accident.  I think you'll be out in about 2 weeks.&quot; So I guess  I was right.  <br>
“Hey can you get me anything to write with?&quot;  I'm a pretty talented artist so I try to draw as much as I can.  It's going to be my career.  I’ve been in 4 accidents before.  I was in a bus accident...that was what I kept on dreaming of.  <br>
&quot;I'll bring you some food, a paper and pencil.  I'll be back soon&quot;.  <br>
&quot;Can you bring me something sweet?&quot;.  <br>
&quot;Yes, I’ll bring you Orange juice.&quot;  <br>
&quot;Thanks&quot;.  As she left the room I started to get a really bad headache.  I heard something really high pitched, and I felt like something was pounding on my head like a hammer.  I had a vision...but it wasn't that clear.  I always draw my visions, that's how I inspired &quot;myself&quot; to draw. <br>
When the nurse came back I started to draw what I saw.  “Wow, you have some talent.” Said the nurse.  <br>
“Yea I know.  I’m going to be an artist soon.”  <br>
“Yes, I can tell by the way you draw.  Very nice.”  While I was drawing, the nurse and I heard a scream down the hall.  I got up out of the bed and went to see what it was.  It sounded like an old lady.  One of the patients was going mad.  He had started to strangle the old lady.<br>

“Yea…Kinda.” The nurse and I were both looking at each other with a strange look….<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A few hours later my mother came to visit me.  She had dark brown eyes, dirty blonde hair, and was kind of chubby…my father is dead so I don’t think he’d be coming around here…I had only gotten to see him twice before he died in a ship wreck.  <br>
“Hi, mom.”  <br>
“Hello, son…how do you feel?”… <br>
“I…I have a bad headache.”  I really needed something to calm the pain down.  I was still feeling thumps on my head, like when I had the vision.  <br>
“Mom, can you ask the nurse to get me something to make the pain go away?”… <br>
“Ok son.” As my mom left the room to get the nurse I laid on my bed with a sick feeling in my stomach.  Darkness fell on top of me and I couldn’t see anything for a few seconds.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I passed out.  When my mom came back, she started to shake me back and forward with her hands on my shoulder.  <br>
“Son, Wake up!!”…I could hear her screams but I couldn’t open my eyes.  I felt something sharp go into my shoulder.  Slowly I had opened my eyes, and saw 2 faces over me.  They were really blurry at first, but soon I regained my correct vision.<br>
<br>

The Training<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp My mother and the nurse were watching close for any signs of sickness.  “Nurse, is he ok?”… <br>
“He’ll be fine…you don’t have to worry about it.  I gave him his shot, he should be fine for quite a while.”  I was listening to the conversation, while trying to get up on the bed, and sit upright.  It all sounded like gibberish to me for some reason… I couldn’t get why…?  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I felt really drowsy.  Once my mom and the nurse stopped speaking I took my food that I hadn’t eaten in some time and started to drink some orange juice.  I took the small batch of peas that were on the plate and started to chew on them.  They were really bad.  I didn’t want to eat it, but I was so hungry that I just ate everything on the plate.  I began to feel better, and a little bit stronger.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I felt like I was changing…  I told my mom how I felt, and she said that it was just a stage I was going through.  Heh, I thought that I went through “that” change already. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “All you need is a little bit of sleep.”  She said, while giving me a gleeful grin.  Two weeks later the doctor said that I can now get out and do a little bit of exercise, but not too much because I had an almost healed knee and a swollen ankle.  At around 6:00 P.M. I left the hospital and finally headed for home.  When I got back into the dump, I went strait to my room and laid on the bed…feeling the comfort of being back.  The place was practically different to me, since I had been gone for so long and all.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I had sat down on my small, but efficient, desk to draw anything that came on my mind....<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
so wataya think?!...to me it's mostly my dream...a lil bit of it i had to think up by myself <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

wow, you are working hard on this <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    this is cool and has a lot of potential, I am definitely interested to see what happens.  I would endorse emma's crits.  The only other thing would perhaps be just a little more physical description of the characters.  Something, for instance, to bring an impact about the drawing of his vision...like he starts a drawing of a picture with this guy with a particular kind of birthmark and the guy that was strangling the old lady could have the same birthmark (it doesn't have to be that specific, but you see what I am saying).  its not really a big deal, but stuff like that can bring an impact to your writing.  Anyway, keep up the good work.  It is cool that this came to you in a dream, keep dreaming! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <p><p>peace<br><br>

also, what is &quot;burble&quot;? is that spit/spittle? or blood? i don't think i've ever run across that word and it's a little confusing. <br>
the second part is not as well developed as the first, but since you just started it, i'm assuming that it will get better. <br>
<br>
if you really want to email me you can send stuff to annasach_gra@yahoo.com<br>
you should be aware that i'm in college right now and things are hectic so i may or may not be able to get to your story very quickly. <br>
i really don't think you have to worry about people stealing your ideas, but if you don't like posting online then you don't have to put updates on the board. however, putting something online is probably the quickest way to get advice, etc. <br>
