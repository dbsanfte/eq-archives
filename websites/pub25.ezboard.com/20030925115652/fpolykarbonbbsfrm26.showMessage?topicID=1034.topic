now you may say, &quot;hey! look at this nut!&quot; or &quot;D@mn he's smart!&quot; who knows, im just here to tell the &quot;truth&quot; about this enless nightmare called life.<br>
<br>
now, as all of you mindless idiots out there who are not open to any new ideas leave right now. but the few of you, the precious few of you out there who will understand and will know what im talking about,... hats off to you.<br>
<br>
some of the people in real life know me as phreak,... the person who doesn't give a @#%$ about telling anything to anyone's face. you may get mad or you may say &quot;hey, ya know,... your right...&quot; if you know you will get offended, leave. i don't want to put up with a bunch of random rants and bull @#%$ letters. and for Gods sake, don't comment on my grammer!!!<br>
<br>
have any of you felt like you were alone in the world? not knowing whats next? or that your the only one with a brain screwed onto your head so tight that you can acctually think for yourself without someone else telling you what to do? thats me. i am the result of the urban world. im sick of all the nice people telling me &quot;ohh isn't he soo cute..&quot; or &quot;mie, mie... hasn't he grown...&quot; *pinches cheek* or the same house concept side by side by side by side and everyone has their own routine,... theres the crazy lady on the corner in scuba gear that works in the garden... and there is the old guy who goes nude all the time... <br>
- &quot;aww honey, i don't want you going over there anymore.&quot;<br>
im tired of my parents telling me not to hang out with certain people. the reason i acctually do hang out with certain people is because im told NOT to! its not because i acctually enjoy it.<br>
-&quot;those heathens...&quot;<br>
how here we go, we got school,... now along with television comes advirtising which tells the younge people of today to wear certain cloths and talk a certain way with a certain handshake. the girls have to wear slutty outfits and be hott to get the guys... but when it comes to doing what they are dressed for they say...<br>
-&quot;just because im dressed this way,... does not make me a slut...&quot;<br>
the guys have it bad too, we got to fit into the expectation of the girls to &quot;fit in&quot; and to, haha, of course have a big dick... because the girls as you know brag about how big their b/f's dicks are in the locker room... bigger the better... thats bull @#%$, isn't it? its been fed to you the day your born...the girls think that they got to look good to get guys. and the guys think they got to have the biggest dicks possible to get the girls! its PURE BULLSHIT!<br>
-&quot;bigger the better... my ass...&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
SnakeBlitz33: i mean, although i do fit in with the kinda guys they like... i still can't stand em'<br>
SnakeBlitz33: its pure bullshit, its fed to em' by the time they are old enough to hear. you got to look niiice, you got to be a slut, but not give it away,... and the guys think that they have to have a big dick to get all the girls... and the girls think they got to have the biggest dick they can find.<br>
SnakeBlitz33: its pure bullshit<br>
<br>
<br>
now with this thought that you have to fit in comes the ever lasting thing called popularity. if your popular,... you get the girls, and if you get the girls you get laid. ide rather not have all the girls and get all the std's!!!! popularity is what we all want... right <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ? <br>
-&quot;well, ya know, i did it with samantha the other day,... *scratch* *scratch* *scratch*...&quot;<br>
ok, now with popularity, you got to fit into the social norms,.. hair, looks, make-up, behavior, attitude,... cloths. if you don't do any of this @#%$ your looked down upon,... and considered,... not popular. so, lets pretend that you follow along with this. <br>
-&quot;oh yeah, dude, don't forget to buy your lunch at the caffeteria!!...&quot;<br>
now, lets pretend that your a &quot;popular guy/girl.&quot; you have to fit in with everything. every last thing that you say and think will be thought by others and commented on. if you say one wrong thing, you will be banished from the &quot;club&quot; the &quot;group&quot; the &quot;click&quot; the whatever it is. so, in this case, you don't think anyone else is open to new ideas and no one will accept your own opinion.<br>
-&quot;weirdo's... they aren't like us at all,... forget them...&quot;<br>
ok ok enough about school.<br>
now for those of you crack heads and pot smokers... heres a section your really going to enjoy. RELIGION!<br>
religion is the untimate manmade human bullshit story. -George Carlin. its made to keep us in control. the ten commandments are just ten things that you.... shouldn't do! its not really a big deal,... it just tells you that its wrong. and that you &quot;shall not do this and shall not do that...&quot; if you think about it, what is in the then commandments that one or more of the churches hasn't broken already? the catholic church said that it was infalleable... hmm lets think about the ten commandments... &quot;thou shalt not kill...&quot; ... take for example... THE CRUSADES! now heres a good one... &quot;thou shalt respect thy father and thy mother...&quot; Since when have they ever shown respect to you?!? <br>
-&quot;drop and give me 20 son... i still love you though...&quot;<br>
now, God loves you,... right? then why the hell do the baptists say that if you sin God will send you to eternal hell and damnation... but he still loves you... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
ya know, if you think about it,... jesus knew all kinds of medicinal herbs and things... and he also knew the wonderful weed called mary jane. why do you think there are so many different versions of the bible?! <br>
-&quot;whoa dude... look... its a... spirit in the sky... naw man its a dove!&quot;<br>
-&quot;can someone pass the corn flakes?&quot;<br>
I know the bible is filled with amazing things that want my mouth to gape... but come on,... do you acctually believe that jonah was spit out by a whale?! or that noah built a @#%$ to host all those animals? why didn't he just get rid of the masquitoes and ticks and all of that?!?! if your reading this far... i want you to answer a question... do you really believe everything that the bible says,... word for word... and do you believe everything that your church says word for word???...<br>
-&quot;why yes, we do accept credit cards...&quot; (for those of you who are smart enough to catch the joke...)<br>
-&quot;please donate your money to God! Send it to this address... ----------&quot;<br>
<br>
now, my now well educated friends, if you want to comment or send something to me either post on here... or plainly e-mail me at SnakeBlitz33@hotmail.com ... or you could cuss me out over Instant Messanger at SnakeBlitz33<br>

i know you said you didn't want people writing crits about it. but too bad. you sound like a ranting teenager. clean up the grammer, punctuation, spelling and you'll actually start to seem more like an intelligent adult. <br>
<br>
incidentally your so-called new ideas aren't. people have said for years that Jesus smoked weed. people have complained about the blatant use of the &quot;sex sells&quot; idea and the way it warps young people, old people and everyone inbetween. <br>
<br>
if you really want to work on this piece you need to show us (the readers) how your perspective is somehow different than a million other writers who have all talked about the same material. what do you know that they didn't? that the rest of us don't know? who are you and why is this issue important? flesh it out and instead of just ranting make an argument. why (in your mind) are girls who dress like sluts slutty? you say they argue differently (the clothes do not make the woman, so to speak) and hint that you disagree but you never explain why. <br>
<br>
you have interesting ideas but you need actually concentrate on what you really want to say rather than just lambasting the population in general without really explaining their crime. <br>

You seem to be rather ignorant of the facts for trashing things. Just a guess, but im thinking you either went to a cathlioc school, or you parents rasied yuo real strict. Its a sad thing i see alot with my freinds; their view gets so distorted. I feel sorry for you, to tell the truth. <br>

Not a psychatrist if you don't want to ( I wouldnt' reccomend it anyway... All they do is put you on drugs, which is really no solution in my eyes ) but a counselor you can just spill your guts to.<br>
Just being able to vent your frustration will help you clear your mind so that you can analyze the real problem you are having:<br>
It is obviously something about yourself. Yes, the world is full of lies, nonsense, and hypocrisy. However, the difference between being a whiny teenager and a reasonable, mature person capable of explaining their feelings is being able to calmly evaluate a situation and offer your own ideas without freaking out. Approaching problems with a hot head only causes you to look immature and lead you further into your rage. Everyone has self-worth/hate/ect issues because that is a part of growing up. It is a painful, but essential step.<br>
Please, for yourself, seek out a counselor. I hope you understand my concern and don't brush it off because I am not insulting you, only offering a strong suggestion as someone who might understand how you are feeling.<br>
God bless, and good luck. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=deadcell4>DeadCell 4</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/15/03 8:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1034.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: this is p*ssin me off</span><hr size=1> Well the real question is..<br>

Does God really Exist????<br>
I mean with the Theory of Evolution im starting to have my doubts maybe religions just something made up to give Human race hope tht after death its not the end after all....<br>
Also the bible was mistranslated as well and proven not long ago they found out that the sentence that said'<br>
<br>
&quot;JESUS WALKED ON WATER&quot; Actully meant &quot;JESUS WALKED <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>BY</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> THE WATER....<br>
<br>
Plus the Christian bible was ripped off from the Hewbew bible their bible says when slapped fight back our says turn the cheek... who knows.. once i watched a very intresting interview with a high rank Rabi he said that the GOD ALLAH was actully made up by terrorists..<br>
<br>
Terrorists kidnapped a Priest and a Rabbi and locked them up and forced them to write them a bible since the terrorists didnt make sense and ALLAH actully means THE GOD OF WAR so no wonder we got some much people blowing them selves up...<br>

<br>
Now my turn. SnakeBlitz33 you sound like an ingrate who is angry because you can't have things all your way all the time. Truth is crap happens and you can either whine and moan that your parents don't give you any respect, when really they've only taken care of you since you were born. New ideas you say? Heres one that may be new to you. They've wiped your @#%$ and your snotty nose and given you all you have. No doubt they've had to put up with a bad attitude indicated by your post. By default I think they get a grace period where you owe them some @#%$ respect. Try giving it to them and you'll be surprised at how much they give you back. And if you're hanging around a crazy old woman and an old naked guy just because your parents said not to . . .<br>
<br>
Turn off the HBO George Carlin special and think long and hard about what he'd say about a kid like you. Don't forget to turn of the punk music as I don't think you can catch the fact that it also dictates a certain way of life. Your hang up about popularity and the use of sex and status in the media is well founded and should be commended. Heres another new idea though, get over it. You obviously aren't falling for it so why tell us all something that we all know already. I bet you can ask the guys with the big packages and the slutty girls and they'll tell you they realize what is being sold to them and how. Usually the kids that despise the popular kids have what you say as a mantra running through their heads. Get to know peoples minds and realize that you've been judging clothes all along. Granted there are stuck up people who probably could care less about you but do you really need to stress about them? Forget 'em. You'll find that you can have more and better friends than the elitists by being yourself. Unless all you care about is having &quot;popular&quot; friends.<br>

Learn to rebel with intellect and well formulated , not to mention complete, thoughts. As for the whole weed and Jesus thing. Marijuana, until relatively recently, was an integral part of many societies. It was probably among the first plants cultivated and definitely amongst the first used for medicine. This was way before Pink Floyd, Half-Baked, and the marijuana counter-culture as a whole. It wasn't &quot;cool&quot; to get high. I think theres no doubt that many people in Jesus' time used it for medicine and recreation as well. There are many instances in which it was used to help field workers cope with fatigue amongst its many other uses. Now if you think Jesus said, &quot;Hey lets roll up a fatty and trip out dudes,&quot; then you need to seriously rethink your whole thought process.<br>

It is commendible that you think about these things. Most people get spoon- feed this stuff and take it,  no questions asked. But think about it and rationalize your thoughts, and separate the truth from the ignorance, and find some answers of your own. Ranting on about who stupid it is isn't going to help anything. You might be informing some people about what is &quot;wrong&quot; with the world, but by not helping with the answers you are just confusing people. Like I said before, most people like to be spoon-feed, they like to go along with the trends, and fit in with the people. Telling them how you don't like it isn't going to help change it. People have been like this for years, trends come, trends go, oh well. Set your own trend, be yourself. If you dont fall into that trap, then maybe you can help other people not to fall into it either. Some peoples' point of veiw is different than another person's. True, today, the ideas people are being spoon-feed, I think, aren't the best of ideas, but who's to judge? We all are nothing more than infants in the great mess of things, and we all are in some way, following the modern society. You just need to find yourself and then become yourself. Don't focus so much on what other's do. And don't focus so much on words, find the meaning behind the words.<br>
  I can go on and on about life and everything, so if anyone wants to talk about it, email me or something, or set up another post.

Yo snake.....every teenager goes through this and everyone realizes how messed up middle school is sooner or later. <br>
<br>
Your grammar leads me to believe you are a disgruntled teen (not that I disagree with your main idea). <br>
<br>
I know you hate being told this, but I went through what you are going through. Calm down, because you cannot change the world. You can only control yourself. Who cares if the people around you are stupid f*cks you don't know s*** (to paraphrase your statements)? Let them be dumb and move on...because adulthood is the great equalizer. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=blackrain704>blackrain704</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pre-Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/23/03 8:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1034.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.endoropolis.org/sampizzacat/teyandee/fa17.jgp height=150 width=120></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: this is p*ssin me off</span><hr size=1> Personally, there's only two ways to live in this world.
