So to help everyone out, let's create one large list of good books and authors to read.<br>
<br>
I'll start off <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Michael Crichton:  He's a really good author, and always *always* does detailed research before writing his Sci-Fi novels.  No man I know of is as prepared for writing as Crichton.  Books: Terminal Man, Jurasic Park, The Lost World, Red Sun, Sphere, and The Eaters of the Dead (aka 13th Warrior).<br>
<br>
J. R. R. Tolkien:  Anyone who wants to write fantasy *NEEDS* to read Tolkien, it's that simple.  This is the man that started the whole revolution, he's also another great author that used a LOT of preplanning.  In fact, he wrote short story after short story about Middle Earth before he wrote the Hobbit in the late 30's, and The Lord of the Rings in the Mid-late 40's, early 50's.   Books: The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, and History of Middle Earth<br>
<br>
L. Ron Hubbard:  If you saw the movie &quot;Battlefield Earth&quot; with John Travolta, you might shiver in fear when I tell you that this is the guy that wrote the book.  But fear not, for to us loyal fans of the books, the movie SUCKED!<br>
L. Ron Hubbard, just like Crichton, is a master of mutliple POVs/Storylines, foreshadowing, and symbolism.  He is not a pure-blood Sci-Fi author, but was actually a well known author of adventure novels before he wrote Battlefield Earth.  He has writen 18 New York Times Bestsellers, and several International Bestsellers.  Books: Battlefield Earth, Mission Earth Decaology (10 books in all), The Automagic Horse, Fear, and Empty Saddles.<br>
<br>
Brian Jaques:  You guys may not know this name, or you might.  I was turned onto the series by my 7th grade English teacher, who is the next author on the list, before he got popular.  Jaques writes a very entertaining series called &quot;Redwall&quot;.  It may seem a tad childish, but his love for storytelling makes for great entertaining books.  There are currently 15 books in the Redwall series.<br>
<br>
Charles Oberndorf:  My 7th grade teacher.  He's writen quite a lot of books, and I've even had the chance of seeing one before it was published.  Most memorable story about him was when he accidently pushed *print* in the school computer lab.  The problem was that his story was 700+ pages, so the printer just printed and printed for two days, no one could use it! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Anyway...  He is a great author, and when you read his work you might notice a slight resemblance to my writing style, I think you might be able to figure out why that is. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Most of his books are out of print because of unpopularity, really a shame too.  He is an excelent writer.  If you find one of his novels, get it at all costs, you won't regret it.<br>
Books: Testing, Foragers, Sheltered Lives.<br>
I own them all, but won't give them out to borrow.  (They are all Signed Copyies <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>
<br>
Tim O'Brien:  I like Tim O'Brien's ability to capture the heart-ache and pain of the Vietnam War.  Reading his books is like getting a slap of reality to the face.  Nothing can prepare you for his stories, but you will be glad if you do read them.  There are many valuable lessons to be learned from his fictional Vietnam war stories.  Books: The Things They Carried<br>
<br>
Some good classics to read:<br>
<br>
The Last of the Mohicans<br>
To Kill a Mockingbird<br>
Don Quixote<br>
The Tales of Sherlock Holmes<br>
Edgar Allan Poe, especially &quot;The Raven&quot; and &quot;The Pit and the Pendulum&quot;<br>
<br>
If you have anyone to add to the list that I forgot, or don't know about, do add on <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><img src="http://winlabik.virtualave.net/images/winlabik.jpg"> <br>

If you're after something a little more light hearted then go and read some of his stuff.  He wrote the Discworld series (26 books), Good Omens with Niel Gaiman (of Sandman fame), and various other assorted books.  One the major trends in his writing is the way he mirrors real life, referencing things such as well known films (US trans - 'movies'), other books, myths etc.<br>

Right, now I'm fresh out of ideas, but take a look at Harry Turtledove's stuff. He's not the most famous author, but I like how he manages to do all series, without ruining a single book (unlike ME…<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :hat --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/pimp.gif ALT=":hat"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) <p><b>Gaealord Gabriel Angelo Maokai III</b>

<br>
Greg Bear (Blood Magic, The Forge of God, Darwin's Radio)<br>
Isaac Asimov (Foundation series, Robot series, Nemesis)<br>
Thomas Disch [sp?] (Camp Concentration)<br>
Orson Scott Card (Ender series, Homecoming series, Pastwatch)<br>
<br>
Fantasy, I don't read as much, but Marion Zimmer Bradley and Mercedes Lackey are my wife's major reading, as well as David Weber, think of it...<br>
<br>
When it comes to required reading, I'd have to say that the ultimate novel would have to be Moby Dick.  You have several plot archetypes [the quest, vengeance, the chase], several conflicts [man vs. man, man vs. nature, man vs. self], you have an excellent immersion into a self-contained setting, good pacing, the ultimate metaphor (besides the Titanic), the mutual annihilation of nemises, and the chilling image of Ahab beckoning from his death those who dare not learn from his failure. All of it is set on the most austere landscape possible for its time... the ocean. And, of course, it has one of the greatest openers of all time. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uwinlabik.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Winlabik</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(7/16/01 6:32:03 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=234.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://winlabik.virtualave.net/images/hikibi.jpg length=96 width=120></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: List your Favorite Authors/Books</span><hr size=1> ^^^^^^<br>

And it is a little interesting that Travolta did a movie based on a book that the founder of his religion wrote. hmmm.<br>
<br>
Anyway, if your looking for a good sci fi short story writer i suggest you read The Martian Chronicles or Golden Apples of the Sun, by Ray Bradbury. <br>
Also read Brave New World by Aldous Huxley, its a futuristic sci if book about a utopian society that basically grows kids for different classes of people, but its a lot more complicated then i have made it seem. Really good book. <br>
And the whole lord of the rings trilpgy is good if your into fantasy. Tolkien actually invented a language for the book, the last one even shows the alphabet, and correct pronunciations of the words he used. Sickeningly good.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=neon>neon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(7/19/01 2:13:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=234.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://liquid2k.com/neonsan/naota.jpg width=90 height=71></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: List your Favorite Authors/Books</span><hr size=1> Phillip K.

Frank Herbert<br>

<br>
Timothy Zahn<br>
Heir to the Empire, Dark Force Rising, The Last Command, if I could have only one guy write all the Star Wars novels then it'll be this guy, their just so fun to read. Unfortunately, his stories seem to be interesting only when he's writing Star Wars<br>
<br>
Neil Gaiman<br>
So he doesn't write novels, but his still a real good writer.

He's truly a bard. Excellent storyteller, excellent master of language.<br>
<br>
And, of course, he did the dub rewrite for Princess Mononoke... next to impossible task, but hell, he did it very well.<br>
<br>
As for Hebert, I'd say Dune is an excellent novel, that should have ended there. His plethora of sequels cheapened the story, IMO. He was a one-trick-pony.<br>
<br>
And as for Zahn, not to be terribly negative, but if you really study Zahn's prose style, you'll realize that he's a terrible novelist. His grammar and sentence structure, etc., are ok, but his plot threads collide with the force of a Mack Truck, giving the reader existential whiplash. He leaves plot holes wide enough to drive said Mack Truck through, and his love affair with cliche is legendary.<br>
<br>
Sorry, not to take to terribly sharp an exception to your opinion. I just wonder how in the name of all that is holy did he ever get published? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=neon>neon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(7/19/01 4:51:45 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=234.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://liquid2k.com/neonsan/naota.jpg width=90 height=71></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: List your Favorite Authors/Books</span><hr size=1> Two words<br>

(But it's not his best)<br>
The research he put into LOTR is AMAZING. He either was extremely dedicated, exremely insane (probably some of both)or had actually been there (which i doubt)<br>
As for Mr. Crighton. Great stuff. Too bad he didn't have anything to do with JP3. It might have had a better ending then. }=(<br>
Another good auther is James Clavell. He wrote some very detailed books about feudal Japan. Gai-Jin and Shogun. Good books. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=doctord>Doctor D</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(7/22/01 11:33:35 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=234.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: List your Favorite Authors/Books</span><hr size=1> <br>
Arthur C. Clark is an excellent Sci-fi writer (there are some very odd similarities between his 2001 series and reality)<br>
Try looking for Timothy Zahn's work too, he's done some very excellent work for the star wars series<br>
<br>
some individual reads<br>
Rats saw God; by Rob Thomas<br>
All the King's Men; by Robert Penn Warren- if you want to include politics in anything you must read this<br>
The art of War; by Tsun Tsu- this book is essential to everything; it captures the correct way to wage war or cook chickens, READ IT. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ubritboyj.showPublicProfile?language=EN>britboyJ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(7/22/01 4:36:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=234.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.angelfire.com/md2/henryl/dende1.gif height=73 width=90></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: List your Favorite Authors/Books</span><hr size=1> HARRY TURTLEDOVE<br>
This guy is amazing. He ahs a trilogy with similarities and parallels to world war two, but set in a fantasy world. <br>
He also does alot of alternate history. He's good stuff.<br>
Check him out. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uravenofmemory.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ravenofmemory</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(7/22/01 7:22:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=234.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: List your Favorite Authors/Books</span><hr size=1> Okay, I don't have time for a long post about the good authors I know of but here's for now:<br>
<br>
1. Battlefied Earth, the movie, IS actually a good movie as long as you don't compare it too much to the book - judge it on its own merit. John Travolta makes a TERRIFIC Terl, IMHO.<br>
<br>
2. JT's a scientologist? I didn't know that...<br>
<br>
3. Neil Gaiman may do mostly graphic novels and such, but he has written at least two KICKASS novels - Neverwhere, which is a must-read for any aspiring fantasy writer, and Stardust, which is also. Neverwhere is my fave though.<br>
<br>
4. I also didn't know that NG did the dub rewrite for Mononoke - apparently he does kickass jobs of things like that too ^_^<br>
<br>
5. A GREAT author is Diane Duane, who has written several Star Trek and Marvel Universe novels as well as her SUPERB &quot;Young Wizards&quot; series - the books I know of are &quot;So you want to be a Wizard&quot;, &quot;Deep Wizardry&quot;, &quot;High Wizardry&quot;, &quot;A Wizard Abroad&quot;, &quot;The Book of Night with Moon&quot;, and &quot;To Visit the Queen&quot;. They are excellent fantasy books and in my opinion blow Harry Potter and most other fantasy (with the exception of Tolkien, of course) AWAY.<br>
<br>
7. If anyone knows any other Young Wizards books, please tell me!<br>
<br>
6. Also, possibly my favorite author is the one and only Piers Anthony - he's written numerous short stories, and his Xanth (UNBELIEVABLY funny), Adept and Mode series - for anyone who likes puns, Xanth is a must-read - every last more-than-20-odd of them.<br>
<br>
Thanks, I have to go now, g'nite all! ^_^ <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uwatermei.showPublicProfile?language=EN>WaterMei</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.gsarchives.com/snes/nanim_sprites/ct/npc/cat.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pre-Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(7/23/01 9:33:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=234.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.disc13.com/features_battle/battle_marle_ct.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: List your Favorite Authors/Books</span><hr size=1> I am currently reading Brian Jaques, The Legend of Luke. It is the twelth book in the series and they are all really good. <br>
<br>
Terry Pratchet: If you like Monty Python and wizards, you'll like the Discworld series.<br>
<br>
Douglas Adams: This guy is the greatest. My parents got my hooked on the series, Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy. My parents loved it so much they named me Trillian, really, not kidding, who is a character in the book. <p><img src=http://www.facelink.com/edit/raw/rawimage/82/2013782.jpg>

Her Valdemar series is phenomenal epic fantasy, and she's also written tons of great sci-fi or dark fantasy books and short stories; my favorite Valdemar books are the Owlsight, Owlflight and Owlknight trilogy, and two great examples of her other literature are the Diane Tregarde book &quot;Children of the Night&quot; and the short story collection &quot;Werehunter&quot;, which also has another Diane Tregarde short story in it.<br>
<br>
I'll look for the Neil Gaiman book....my library here has a small but growing 'graphic novel' collection - they've already got Maus I and II, some of Will Eisner's stuff, a collection of X-Men 1-25, and several Books of Magic collections that Neil Gaiman either wrote or had a major hand in, I'm not sure which; they also have 'The Complete Concrete', which I'd never heard of before but which proved to be a very good 'underdog' comic. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ucgraven.showPublicProfile?language=EN>CG Raven</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(7/24/01 5:00:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=234.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: List your Favorite Authors/Books</span><hr size=1> I probably should have mentioned that Good Omens is a novel, not a graphic novel, oops.  <p>---------<br>"When You're Up to Your Ass in Alligators, Today Is the First Day of the Rest of Your Life"
