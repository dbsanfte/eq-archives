This one i was trying to make her head and body both be to the left some at a 3/4 angle and then having the arms be much more (cant think of word, like depthed) and anyway it didnt work. i was going to make it look like how those people in dbz power up, floating in the air with arms kinda back and legs and chest out. but well lol after i started drawing the main body shape and many erasings i couldnt get it to work so i just drew a more plain picture. i really need some help. oh and more info.. i can draw pictures fine when i look at them. but when i have to think up the angle and how the pic is going to come out it messes up, lol its anoying. well heres the pic. <br>

This pic is just one i did. its how its suposed to be but just to show you a lil bit more of what i can do. i still need work on how to get the feet to look right too. sorry about it being so bright, only way i could get it to look decent on my comp(i use a digital camera to get em on my comp, no scanner heh)<br>

I tried drawing a DBZ-style thing, with all my construction lines left in, but I didn't think it looked good enough to act as a decent example, so I haven't posted it. I'll try again later. but YEAH!! Basically, if you wannt more 3d, you've got to think and draw in 3d. The thinking bits the hard part, that's why I couldn't do it earlier, my head's just not &quot;there&quot; at the moment. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   But yeah, I find it helps to sketch out where the body's gonna go first before I flesh her out, using balls for joints and cylinders for appendages. I think it's also vital to draw in a line to show where the backbone goes, just for reference, 'cos it's very difficult to remember which was her body's going when you get down to drawing in the chest/torso/hips. But yeah! I'll post an example once I've worked out how to draw it myself....<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><a href="http://www.buttonpusher.net/kindamanga">KINDAMANGA!</a> <BR>

Heh heh! Your character looks kinda like one of mine, so I'm gnna draw Brianna as an example. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   This is my method do drawing 3d, it's kinda similar to the tutorials in PolyKarbon. I've probably screwed a lot of stuff up, and my tutorial is by no means definitive, but hey, check out both, it can't hurt! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
I start like this, using joints &amp; stuff as reference points. Work out where you want the joints, and then just join 'em up! Think about how the characher would look, ie, the shoulders would be set back, chest pushed forward. If you're unsure, do the pose yourself, and look at how your own body arranges itself. You don't even need a mirror, just be aware of what your body is doing.<br>
Remember to also put in the backbone, and any lines (between shoulders, hips, nipples (Don't laugh!! I'm serious! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) etc) that you might find helpful. On this pic I DID put in the backbone, but decided a line across the stomach through the navel would be more useful, so I did that instead. I also did lines to help me remember where the front of the legs were so it'd be easier to judge how the calves &amp; feet would be angled. Oh, and don't forget to put in the neck, like I nearly always do...<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.buttonpusher.net/kindamanga/1.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
Then, add clothes &amp; some details, tidying up the lines and correcting any mistakes you made earlier. (Like I forgot her left hip on the original drawing) Add little details, like the collarbone, any lines on the neck, etc. Smooth it all off a bit too, kinda like stretching tight rubber over the skeleton you constructed earlier.<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.buttonpusher.net/kindamanga/2.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
Clean up all your construction lines. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Finally, shade it!! Things look MUCH more 3D when shaded. Yo can also add a few more subtle details that you wouldn't see with just the lines, like the angles in the face, muscles in the legs and the curve of the breasts, as well as defining the arms &amp; stuff a bit more.<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.buttonpusher.net/kindamanga/3.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
Yeah, that's how I do it. Those pics aren't perfect, but I hope it helps! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Also, getting one of those wooden posable figures from an art shop might help. I haven't got one myself, but I'm SERIOUSLY considering getting one! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><a href="http://www.buttonpusher.net/kindamanga">KINDAMANGA!</a> <BR>

<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.8ung.at/pain/manga_constr.JPG"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
besides the orange annotations, i have to say:<br>
with &quot;seeing expression&quot; @ the head annotation, of course don't mean every emotion, just roughly, where the chara's looking at, the way he/she holds his/her head etc... elemental things <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
i drew the front and side view of the simplified chest and &quot;panty-area&quot; for making clear how these construction helps look like (in my head) they don't need to be exaggerated exactly, just to see what's going where.<br>
<br>
hint for drawing women: add 3 lines to the chest: 2 verticals and 1 horizontal. the horizontal one is the one i marked in my template above, the two verticals should roughly be the edges of the chest's front. when drawing 3/4 view, the one line should be also the contour of the chest(roughly).<br>
these lines determine the outer and lower frontier of breast-area quite well. if you add the middle line vertically like i did, you have two rectangles (upper side open) where you just need to draw breasts in <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=gekitsu>gekitsu</A> at: 10/1/01 1:53:25 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/u0megaweapon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>0mega weapon</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_ball.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(10/1/01 2:11:32 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.dbzhost.com/anime/terraforming/Pictures/Omega-Weapon.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I have a really bad problem with body veiws*helpme*</span><hr size=1> get ur mom to pose for u and practice that.... <p>[ Without order nothing can exist - without chaos nothing can evolve ]</p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm2.showMessage?topicID=2086.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm2.showMessage?topicID=2085.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm2.emailToFriend?topicID=2073.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm2.threadControl?topicID=2073.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm2.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2073.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm2.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2073.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub25.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="polykarbonbbsfrm18">PK-BBS Rules and Regulations!<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm3">News and Updates<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm2">Photoshop and Art questions<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm4">General Manga/Anime Discussion<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm5">Japanese Language Help<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm23">art in progress<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm13">Black and White Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm14">Color Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm19">Member's Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm17">Moderators Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm6">Member Photos<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm22">How to use Fight Club<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm20">Challenges<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm21">Matches<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm25">Pose Forum<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm26">Writer's Forum<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm27">Board F.A.Q.s<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm29">Christmas Contest</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#336699>- </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs>Polykarbon BBS</a><font color=#336699> - </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm2>Photoshop and Art questions</a> <font color=#336699> - </font><a href="http://www.polykarbon.com">Polykarbon: Manga & Photoshop</a><font color=#336699> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.4 b7<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
