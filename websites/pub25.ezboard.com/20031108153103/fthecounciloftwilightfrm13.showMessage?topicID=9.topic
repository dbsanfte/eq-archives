<br>
A long long time ago... <br>
I can still remember <br>
how that fighting used to me smile.  <br>
And I knew if we had a chance, <br>
to pull a mob and take a stance, <br>
that maybe, we'd be happy for a while.  <br>
Cascade of Hail would make me shiver, <br>
with all the damage we'd deliver.  <br>
Bad news at the zone in; <br>
as more mobs started pouring in.  <br>
I still remember how I sighed, <br>
as our party started to get fried.  <br>
It was too late to run and Hide.  <br>
The day our party died.<br>
 <br>
So bye-bye, looks like we're gonna die.  <br>
Tried to Evac and then come back  <br>
but our mana ran dry.  <br>
We tried to fight while munching Beetle Eye Pie, singin', <br>
&quot;This'll be the day that we die.  <br>
This'll be the day that we die.&quot;<br>
<br>
Did you equip your Ry'Gorr glove, <br>
and do you have faith in the gods above, <br>
(unless your god is down below.)  <br>
Did you bring your Trueshot bow, <br>
and can you deal a crippling blow, <br>
and can you get the mob to fight real slow?  <br>
Well, I know that things are looking grim, <br>
and our chances getting rather slim.  <br>
The monk's pulling the blues <br>
Off the train that's running through.  <br>
Reminding me of Lower Guk, <br>
I think we're running out of luck.  <br>
But I knew we were sitting ducks <br>
when our enchanter died.  <br>
We started singing...<br>
<br>
&quot;Bye-bye, looks like we're gonna die.&quot;  <br>
Tried to Evac and then come back <br>
but our mana ran dry.  <br>
We tried to fight, while munching Beetle Eye Pie, singin',<br>
 &quot;This'll be the day that we die.  <br>
This'll be the day that we die.&quot;<br>
<br>
Now for a long time, I've been on my own, <br>
fighting with a hammer made of a wraith's bone, <br>
but that was not as fun for me.  <br>
When the druid saved me from the Klicknik Queen, <br>
and I think of what it might have been, <br>
and then she  /guildinvite-ed me.  <br>
Oh and while I stopped and looked around,<br>
another Darkpaw was brought down.  <br>
Another lesson learned; <br>
experience was earned.  <br>
While Fippy yipped his final bark, <br>
my arrow finally found it's mark, <br>
and we went fighting in the dark.  <br>
My guild became my guide.<br>
<br>
We were singing... <br>
&quot;Bye-bye, looks like we're gonna die.&quot;  <br>
Tried to Evac and then come back <br>
but our mana ran dry.  <br>
We tried to fight, while munching Beetle Eye Pie, singin', <br>
&quot;This'll be the day that we die.  <br>
This'll be the day that we die.&quot;<br>
<br>
Helter Skelter in a desert swelter, <br>
heading for an Oasis shelter, <br>
Incoming spectre floating past.  <br>
As we started to attack, <br>
it resisted and began to cast, <br>
then the add-ons came upon us, very fast.  <br>
Now the healers tried to heal our wounds <br>
while the bards all played their fighting tunes.  <br>
Though our skills were all enhanced, <br>
Oh, but we never had a chance!  <br>
As we tried to fight on the battle field, <br>
the attacking mobs refused to yield, <br>
Do you remember who got killed? <br>
The day our party died...<br>
<br>
We were singing... <br>
&quot;Bye-bye, looks like we're gonna die.&quot;  <br>
Tried to Evac and then come back <br>
but our mana ran dry.  <br>
We tried to fight, while munching Beetle Eye Pie, singin',<br>
 &quot;This'll be the day that we die.  <br>
This'll be the day that we die.&quot;<br>
<br>
Oh, and there we were all in one place, <br>
leveling up at a frantic pace.  <br>
With no time left to start again. <br>
So come on: Let's be nimble, Let's be quick!  <br>
The mobs are coming in rather thick <br>
'cause mana is the caster's only friend.  <br>
Oh, and as I watched him loot that page <br>
and turn and give it to our Mage.  <br>
Our cleric prayed to Brell, <br>
to break that rooting spell.  <br>
And as our battle raged into the night, <br>
and things were getting rather tight, <br>
we fought and laughed with much delight, <br>
The day our party died.<br>
<br>
We were singing... <br>
&quot;Bye-bye, looks like we're gonna die.&quot;  <br>
Tried to Evac and then come back <br>
but our mana ran dry.  <br>
We tried to fight, while munching Beetle Eye Pie, singin',<br>
 &quot;This'll be the day that we die.  <br>
This'll be the day that we die.&quot;<br>
<br>
I met a bard who sang the blues, <br>
and I asked her for some happy news, <br>
But she just smiled and turned away. <br>
I went down to the jeweler's store, <br>
where I'd bought that gemstone once before.<br>
But the merchant seems to have gone astray.  <br>
And in the streets: the players screamed, <br>
the quest was nerfed, or so it seemed. <br>
A lot of words were spoken; <br>
The quest we tried was broken.  <br>
We ran to fight again and boast, <br>
but I think we've cut it just too close.  <br>
It looks like once again, we're toast.  <br>
The day our party died. <br>
<br>
We were singing... <br>
&quot;Bye-bye, looks like we're gonna die.&quot;  <br>
Tried to Evac and then come back <br>
but our mana ran dry.  <br>
We tried to fight, while munching Beetle Eye Pie, singin', <br>
&quot;This'll be the day that we die. <br>
This'll be the day that we die.&quot;<br>
<br>
We were singing... <br>
