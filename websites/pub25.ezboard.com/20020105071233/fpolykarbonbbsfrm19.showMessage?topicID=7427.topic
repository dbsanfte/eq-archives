This particular problem is one I've had ever since I started drawing so I wondered if anyone else could relate or if I'm being really self conscious.<br>
<br>
I want to do something meaningful with my art, not just a bunch of cute anime girls.  Some of you might have noticed that's almost the only thing I draw.  I can't because every time I try to draw something with some emotion or action in it I get teased by someone.  I know you aren't supposed to be so sensitive about that kind of thing, but my family is horrible.  The theme &quot;hope&quot; might as well have been &quot;lesbians and bacon grease&quot; as far as that goes.  <br>
<br>
My &quot;friends&quot; and classmates and teachers are awful.  I can't draw any figures without somebody thinking I'm drawing naked people and freaking out.  The think when I draw the figure boxes that I am drawing panties on them (these are the male students).  I can't even do any non-anime artwork in art class that means something to me because people have to have explanations for things, and then they don't understand it.    <br>
<br>
I guess that might be hard for you to understand but maybe if a couple of you could relate in some way it would be good for me, or if you could just tell me I'm crazy for caring about what they think that might do it.   <p><a href="http://geocities.com/member_ring" target="_blank"><img src="http://celes99.homestead.com/Files/mrbutn2.jpg" border="0"></a>

I drew a house last year, and, it was a SQUEE house I must admit, and people kept saying, &quot;Nice barn!&quot; just to piss me off! &gt;_&lt;<br>
And if I draw ANYTHING everyone who sees it has to make smart remarks about it! Except for my mom and my dad, oh, and my sis.<br>

I hate it when people treat others like crap just because they're ignorant.<br>
<br>
My best advice is to not let it get to you so much.  If you're showing signs that it bothers you all the time, then that just causes some people to bother you more.<br>
<br>
Try to draw when nobody is around you.  If someone asks what you're doing, just make something up.  Tell people it's for a class assignment or something.  <br>
<br>
Or, if they say dumb things like &quot;Are you drawing porn?&quot;  just say &quot;yes&quot; and then let them sit there confused for a few seconds.  Again, if you get defensive, that just makes people do it more.  Some people are stupid like that.<br>
<br>
Another good tactic is to change the subject.  If someone starts asking about what you're doing and you don't want to talk about it, start asking them questions about something else.  I use that all the time with my parents when they're bugging me about something I don't want to talk about.  Works most of the time. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ubluedolphin22.showPublicProfile?language=EN>BlueDolphin22</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_bluespot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(12/9/01 6:58:03 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.shorinjikempo.or.jp/news/image/anime.gif height=100 width=100></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cry.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: ....</span><hr size=1> i hate it when people do that!!!<br>

Well...I can tell you it is not.  I have only seen 2 videos, and the only series that I have seen entirely is Tenchi.  I have seen part of several gundam series, EVA, and some others.  <br>

I just barely found someone else at school who likes anime beside me...and am sooo excited!  He likes to draw his own characters...regretably DBZ based...but no one is perfect!  (j/k).<br>

X) Yeah, just gnore 'em. You're drawing for you, not them, always. You're under no obligation to do anything anyone elses way, it's your art and every one else can just like it or bog off. :D  That's my attitude, anyway. If someone gives a relevant and informed crit, then fine, but it's not worth being affected by idiots. Like Shou said, do your stuff somewhere where you don't get any flak. You'll be more relaxed when you do it anyway, and your art will be better as a result. You're drawing for noone but yourself. Ignore everyone else, be stubborn!! XD<br>

So <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> she</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> flipped through it to a page with two of my characters after they uh... you know... He (has shoulder-length hair, for one) was asleep with his back to the viewer, she was sitting up, exposed for all the world to see more or less, smiling all sweetly, yada yada yada... This ditz gets up in the middle of class and plants the thing in front of me and asks, &quot;Are they lesbians?&quot;<br>
With a flat brow I grab the book out of her hands, sigh, and say, &quot;You know what, if it looks like it's two girls, then it's two girls; if it looks like two guys, it's two guys. I don't care anymore, this is why I don't pass my stuff around.&quot;<br>
And she knows I don't like her anyway... Let's not go into this punk who I had NEVER MET BEFORE walking up to me and accusing me of drawing porn when he had never seen my drawings before... *grrr* <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  No estoy contenta...

Guys kept asking me why Kung Low was wearing a mask...you would think I would turn red enough then, but guess what happend when someone from my music class got a hold of my sketch book..<br>
<br>
(eyebrow raises) &quot;You actually like that opera stuff?&quot; heh, time for me to squirm and say, &quot;No..but....yes, I mean.....no, no of course not, it's just.....just...&quot; *sigh* &quot;I just never really heard music like that before...well, I mean I-I did but..I mean...&quot; GAH!
