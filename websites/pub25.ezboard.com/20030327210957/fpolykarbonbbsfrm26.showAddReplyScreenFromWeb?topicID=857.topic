Feel free to join, but please, incoporate your own characters into the story, making sure not to start your own independent one.  <br>
   Making a quick origin is fine, but hopefull you understand what we're going for.  For help, please look at the RPG by NeoAngel and Bythegun.  So, without further ado... here we go!<br>
  (One more thing... please leave sort of a hook at the end of your story so that we can take off from where you left off.)<br>
<br>
<br>
   Sid look out the window of his two story apartment.  Outside he saw Mrs. Murphey and her two kids piling out of their old Jalopy of a car and hustle into their city-sponsered living domicile.  He heard the heavy metal cords of a radio playing five blocks away.  As far as the eye could see the common people of the city, or so affectionatly called 'rats' were out and about.  Doing what they could to survive.  <br>
   Just down the street three gang leaders, or 'wolves' were beating down a common man.  No matter what you did, in this neighborhood, you just couldn't get away from wolves.  <br>
   Course wolves were just answering to their superiors, lions, and lions to the top section, sharks.<br>
   Slowly twirling around the cigerette in his hand, Sid took a drag and puffed it out slow, thinking about moving to a nicer part of the city.  A place where wolves, lions, and sharks just weren't heard of.  Shaking his head, he quickly dismissed the thought.  He couldn't live anywhere else but here.  He was too old, too tough.  Besides, no matter where you go, you can't get away from a wolf or two...<br>
   Just then, a classy dame walked into the dark office.  The ceiling fan just barely making up for the extreme heat, she was wearing a long silky outfit.  The sorta outfit with class.  Sid looked up.  Buisness?<br>
    She started the conversation.  &quot;I gotta problem.  I heard you could help.&quot; Her voice sensual and full of flavor.<br>
   Gruffly he replied, &quot;Yeah, well honey we all got problems.  Some of 'em you can fix, and some of 'em y'cant.  For example, I got this rash just below my belt an-&quot;<br>
   &quot;This is one you can fix.&quot;<br>
   &quot;We'll see.&quot;<br>
   She paced the room slowly.  &quot;There's a bounty on my head.  50 million credits.&quot;<br>
   He sneered. &quot;So what makes you think that I aint gonna turn you in and make a tidy profit.&quot;<br>
   &quot;Because I have 100 million.&quot;<br>
   At this he sat back.  &quot;100 mil?  Let's talk beautiful...&quot;<br>
   &quot;You find who did this.  You find who's behind my bounty.  I've never done anything really bad in my whole life, and-&quot; By this time she was crying &quot;-and I don't want to die.&quot;<br>
   &quot;I'll need my money upfront.&quot;<br>
   &quot;I have my identity card right here.&quot;<br>
   &quot;Fine.  I'll make sure you have it, withdraw when I'm through.  And if you cheat me lady, if you cheat me?  Well let's just say I ain't never hit a lady, but shoot'em?  That's a whole different story...&quot;<br>
   &quot;I see.  I'm going to be in a safe place for awhile.  Ten days.  You have that much time to find him.&quot;<br>
   &quot;I do huh?  Well I better get to work.  Get out my office.  And don't let the door hit your-&quot;<br>
   With that she left at a quick pace.  She left behind her bank card with a lipstick kiss on it.  &quot;Signed Roxy&quot;  Sid sighed.  Gonna be a long night.  But he knew just who to talk to... someone with all the answers... with that he walked downstairs and out the street to ____________'s house.  <br>
<br>
<br>
SEE?  Just copy the last sentence and go from there.  Sorry it was so long, just had to begin the story... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=milkboy>Milk Boy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(12/14/02 10:05:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=857.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Beaver-Shockner RPG</span><hr size=1> Gonna be a long night. But he knew just who to talk to... someone with all the answers... with that he walked downstairs and out the street to Leo's house. <br>
<br>
Leo was the type of person you never turned your back on, and never looked directly in the eye for too long of a time. His blood shot gaze could scare away any rat in the city with but a look, only the sharks who gave him orders would make eye contact. Not even his wolves would dare to do that. Sid didn't like dealing with the maniac, but buisness was buisness, work was work, and both of those had been hard to come by lately. A rat could get a lion out of a net trap, and Leo owed him a favor. <br>
<br>
Knocking on Leo's door with his knuckle, Sid took a final drag off his ciggy and flung it away. A panel slid open revealing those dark eyes, and darker hair all but covering one of them. Leo's voice was as gruff as his appearance. <br>
<br>
&quot;Whadya want?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;A favor.&quot;<br>
<br>
The eyes blinked, apparently recognizing him. &quot;Oh,&quot; said Leo,  and the heavy iron door creaked open. <br>
<br>
Leo's office was twice as messy as his own, and with Sid's disaster of an appartment, that was saying alot. Before the door slammed shut behind him with a resounding bang, Leo was already in his seat with his unshaven chin on his hands and his elbows on his desk. Tossing &quot;Roxy's&quot; card onto the table Sid said, &quot;Check her out for me.&quot;<br>
<br>
Leo held the card under the light and considered it for a moment, then said, &quot;Ok, gimme a couple of days.&quot; With that said, Leo promptly ignored Sid until he let himself out. <br>
<br>
Sid had no intention of letting those two days go to waste. 100 million creds was alot of cigerettes. He had posed as a bounty hunter before, and he could do it again. He knew where they hung out, and so he made his way to _________. <p>&quot;Death is lighter than a feather, duty, heavier than a mountain.&quot;</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mrbeaver@polykarbonbbs>MrBeaver</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(12/15/02 10:48:46 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=857.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Continuing...</span><hr size=1> He knew where they hung out, and so he made his way to the local bar down the the street a ways.  The Hole.  <br>
   The Hole was the type of place that people didn't go to unless they had a mean bit of buisness to attend to.  Sid had plenty of this on his plate, and he pushed the door open and walked in.<br>
   Smoke hung like fog and the stench of Rats and Wolves lingered in the air.  Noting to himself that it had gotten a bit cleaner since he got here, he brushed off the stool and sat down.<br>
   &quot;Whadda ya want?  Shnaps, Vodka?&quot; Asked the bartender.  A big burly man.  &quot;Course it'll cost ya quite a bit.  Alcohol's scarce in this part of Grunge-City.  Especially good alcohol...&quot;<br>
   Trying not to look to obvious, Sid lit up a cigarette.  &quot;I need information on a job goin' down.&quot;<br>
   The bartender's gaze wasn't directed at Sid, but his voice was.  &quot;What job?&quot;<br>
   &quot;A dame's being hunted down.&quot;<br>
   &quot;I don't blame 'em.&quot;<br>
   &quot;So you know about it.&quot;<br>
   &quot;Course I do.&quot; The bartender said igdignitly. &quot;Just about every bounty hunter's been hanging around lately.&quot;  He pointed to the far corner, where three men sat on the sticky vinal bench.  &quot;Those three?  They just came in today.  50 million will do that to you.&quot;<br>
   &quot;Y'know why they want her?&quot;<br>
   &quot;This chick?  Na, I know that people are after her, but I don't know who.  Word is...&quot;<br>
   &quot;What?&quot;<br>
   &quot;Well I can't remember.  Maybe if I had a little grease to help the wheels turh a bit smoother...&quot;<br>

&quot;OK, I'll tell you.&quot; The bartender said.  He gruffly leaned close.  There's this thing goin' down on a higher level then you and me.<br>
  <br>
&quot;Like how high?&quot; asked Sid<br>
<br>
&quot;High.  We're talking people above the sharks.  People who give the sharks orders&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That's high.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yea.  Yea it is.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What'd they call'em?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Devils.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sid pulled out a cig.  &quot;Creative&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Damn straight it's creative...  Turns out one of these devils had this lady... what's her name?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Roxy.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Right.  Roxy.  Turns out one of these devils had this Roxy lady as a 'special servant'.  You dig?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yea, I dig.&quot;  Said Sid as he put the cig in his mouth and lit it.<br>
<br>
&quot;She got in a realationship, a special one, and next thing you know, she's pregnant.  She gets an abortion.  Devil don't like that too much, so he gets angry, and puts this warrent on her head.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sid puffed out smoke.  Muttering to himself, &quot;These things are gonna kill me...&quot;<br>
<br>
The bartender continued. &quot;See, but the only problem is... I can't let anyone know about this little, 'conversation' between us.  Lot of bad buisness see?  So this is where we say goodbye.&quot;  The bartender slowly pulled out a handgun from under the bar.  Sid saw this and took the cig from his mouth and shoved it into the bartender's eye.  He screamed.  Opening his other eye, the bartender tried to aim the gun.  Sid lept over the bar and picked up a bottle of wine.  In one continous movement he smashed the side of the bottle into the bartender's face.<br>
<br>
Wine, glass, and blood splattered the nearby ground.  Sid took out another cig and lit it up.  Stepping over the bartender, he almost to himself said, &quot;Here ya go. Drink's on me...&quot;<br>
<br>
Outside the bar, Sid decided to go see someone he knew.  A rat that had a few connections here and there.  Sid needed an address.  And he knew just where to get one... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mrbeaver@polykarbonbbs>MrBeaver</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(12/15/02 8:13:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=857.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Please, please....</span><hr size=1> Try and keep this post on the right subject.  It gets sidetracked pretty soon.  I'm so glad that people are actually doing this!<br>
<br>
    And he knew just where to get one...  Tommy Dee.  Tommy was the type of guy that you assumed saw nothing but florescent light.  His pale white skin and his scrawny body only served to make him look all the more...disturbing.  Twitcy too.  Sid didn't like him, but you did what you had to do when you had a job.  <br>
   He walked into the store where Tommy Dee was assumed to be working now.  A computer electronics store that probably held half of it's stock in stolen goods.  The bell chimed when Sid walked into the store, and a voice in the back faintly said &quot;We're closed.  Go  away.&quot;  Sid grinned.<br>
   &quot;Tommy, Tommy, Tommy.&quot;<br>
   Tommy peeped out the door and rolled his eyes.  &quot;You again?  I don't know anything that would even relate to you.&quot;<br>
   Sid threw his cigarette away.  &quot;Really?  And how would you know?&quot;<br>
   &quot;Word is around the street that you got something goin' down.  I get news.&quot;  Tommy replied in his nasal voice.<br>
   &quot;Sure you get news.  That's why I'm here.&quot;<br>
   &quot;But I can't help you with this whole chick thing.  Devils is just too big.  They can't be brought to justice...&quot;<br>
   &quot;So you aren't going to cooperate?&quot;<br>
   &quot;Co-operate?  There isn't anything to cooperate about!&quot;<br>
   Sid grabbed a computer cord from the wall.  &quot;Perhaps you need some persuasion.&quot;<br>
  &quot;Perhaps you better not touch me.&quot;  Tommy hastily said, pulling out a gun that looked bigger then him.<br>
   &quot;I got things to do Tommy, I don't want to hurt you.&quot; chuckled Sid.<br>
   &quot;We are not friends Sid.  You're just a guy who trys and solves things, but really never does.  What's the last case you've solved?  Huh?  Answer me that.&quot;  He paused.  &quot;That's what I thought.  Get out of my store before they have to carry you out in pieces.&quot;<br>
   Sid walked out of the store.  He lit a cigarette, and walked down the street.  Even from the corner he heard a terrified high-pitched scream, and then a couple of gunshots.  He walked back to the store, and opened the shattered glass door.  He paid the wolves, and walked to Tommy.<br>
   &quot;Let's start over Tommy.  What can you tell me about Roxy and her Devils?&quot;<br>
   Tommy was tied to a chair bleeding perfusly out of what was left of his arm.  He wimpered, &quot;Why should I tell you...?&quot;<br>
   &quot;Cause if you don't, I let you bleed to death, while our common enemies, the wolves out there, keep guard.  If you do, I get your and my good friends, the wolves out there, to come in and save your ass.&quot;<br>
   Defeatedly, Tommy said, &quot;OK, ughh, Ok, this devil character isn't so high up after all.  Fact is, he's living in Grunge-City right now.  Rumor's are flying around however, that he's living in inner-city Grunge.&quot;<br>
   &quot;Now, Tommy, why'd anyone want to live here, huh?&quot;<br>
   &quot;Cause it works better.  No one suspects you.&quot;<br>
   &quot;Says you.&quot;<br>
   &quot;Says me.  Now get those wolves in here you c*cksucking-&quot;<br>
   Sid picked up the gun and aimed it at Tommy.  Before Tommy got a word out, a loud blast echoed through the store.  Sid muttered, &quot;Kid's these days... give 'em in inch... and then blow their heads off...&quot;<br>
   He paid the wolves again for their service and proceed to Leo's house.  Maybe he knew about these Devils...<br>

Sid wasn't worried. A Shark isn't anything to worry about when it's out of water, and a Devil isn't anything to worry about when it's out of Hell. Looking around him at the filth known as Grunge-City, he wondered how much the latter held up. Fishing in his pocket Sid produced yet another cigarette, then relized he had been chain smoking the mother f*ckers all day long and put it back. Then he took it out again and lit up. &quot;F*ck it,&quot; he said. He would quit AFTER he had sequred the 100 mil. <br>
<br>
Sid had to think about this Devil character. What kind of player with at least a cool 50 million credits under his belt would live in this... hell? He had more street power than your average shark, probably hundreds of wolves at his command, and he puts a public bounty on this Roxy b*tch? The 100 million credits were probably stolen, and Sid would probably have to fend off multiple attempts on his life if and when he got the reward. And yet with that beautiful dame running around in his mind, he found himself more than half way to Leo's. <br>
<br>
The soft footsteps behind him were barely audioble over the gunshots and wailing that were the norm in Grunge-City, but they were enough bring his mind off that hot Roxy chick. Taking a quick right into a dark alley Sid scrambled into the darkest corner, easily hiding behind a garbadge can. His followers would think he dissapeared. <br>
<br>
Lo' and behold the fat barkeep from eailer came in moments after him, an even fatter rifel in hand, and a pack of wolves at his shoulder. Dripping blood (or was that wine?) he ordered his cronies around like the dogs they were. &quot;He's in here, find em, and shoot that bastard!&quot;<br>
<br>
Sid held his breath as the wolves filed into the alley. He slid off the saftey on his gun......<br>

   He held up his gun and aimed it from behind a garbage can.  He could probably take out the bartender if he tried... but then there were the other four.  And this garbage can wouldn't hold out after three or four shots.  <br>
   He heard footsteps coming toward him.  The @#%$ of a gun, and then the sound of a bullet being blasted out of the barrel.<br>
   Sid recoiled as he expected the bullet to rip through the thin tin of the garbage can, but there was none.  Not even richochet.  He glanced upward above the can and saw a siloutte in the bright light of the street.  Below it was three dead bodies... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gothicchaos>gothic chaos</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(12/16/02 1:53:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=857.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://the.animearchive.org/vampirehunterd/1/hunter_d.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: continuing</span><hr size=1> The figure glanced lazily at the streetlight, gave a bit of a sniff and silently stuck thier hands in the pockets of their worn coat. The figure turned their head towards Sid,no more than a mere glance but in spite of the bright light and dark hood the figure wore, he saw their face.<br>
<br>
A pair of smokey eyes, a full pink mouth set in a cold frown. He could catch no more before the figure turned back to regard the bodies. Carefully stepping forward, the figure crouched beside the bodies, slowly setting some small object in the middle of a pool of blood. <br>
<br>
In one quick motion Sid had risen and pointed the barrel of his weapon to the back of the figure's head.<br>
<br>
&quot;Give me one good reason why I shouldn't blow your head off,&quot;<br>

Just then the other two gunmen appeard from behind the shop and shot at the figure.  Soon after, the figure crumpled down holding it's gut.  <br>
   Sid aimed his gun and fired.  He fired until there was no doubt that the other two were dead.  Then he noticed his arm.  Bleeding on the one side, and a tear in his big coat, a bullet had glanced it.  He grimiced and continued on to the figure. <br>
   &quot;Who the hell...&quot; He muttered, taking of it's hood... Sid almost jumped back.  &quot;Aw damn...&quot;<br>
   &quot;I tried...to warn you... Leo's on the run... he's got every hired...ugh...gun on your ass.... you better get outta town...before...&quot;  Gasped Roxy with her last dying breath.<br>
   Sid closed his eyes for a second, and for the first time in a while he almost felt sad.  Closing her open eyes with his rough hand he muttered, &quot;Don't worry lady... I never gave up on a job yet... and I sure as hell don't intend to now...&quot;<br>
   He drug her body into a nearby dumpster.  Not much of funeral, but given that it was Grunge City, it really didn't matter.  Sid got up and made his way to Leo's house.<br>
   When he got to the large building, he check the door.  Locked.  Sid pulled out his handgun and blew off the lock.  Not too many people noticed, and those who did figured that if he was messin' with Leo, he probably was going to never shoot anything else again.<br>
   Walking into the messy building, Sid noticed a noise in the back.  Walking over drawers that were out, and papers that were still flying in the air, he got into some kind of back room.  In it, was an old TV hooked up to a VCR.  Static was playing, and attached to a video tape, a note said, &quot;Play me&quot;.  <br>
   Sid put the tape in, and sat back.  Leo's terrifying mug came into view.  &quot;Sid!  Hello my good friend.  Turns out that you never miss a solid dish in your life.  That card of that chick Roxy?  Pretty good deal I tell ya what.  Her real name's actually Roxane Summers, but given her line of work, I don't think it made a difference.  44 years old.  Can you believe it?  She don't look a day over 24.  But that's what happens when you know a good plastic surgeon.<br>
   &quot;She's got the money Sid.  Even if she was a no good whore, she still was good at getting the fat cows to hire her... So, the credibility issue isn't and issue anymore.  You dig?&quot;  The camera panned to three men, all with guns, axes, and knives.  &quot;These guy?  These are my guys that make sure Roxy can't ever withdraw her money again, if you know what I mean.  But if you do get a message from her, or if you come in a couple days to see if I'm still around...<br>
   Well, I'm not.  You're a detective, detect!  Although it's going to be kind of hard when you have all my wolves, lions, and sharks on ya.<br>
   I'm not afraid of you Sid.  You're old.  You're out of touch.  I got your reality check right here buddy.&quot;  Leo said waving a gun about.  &quot;Right here... but I want to see if you can find me first...  It's going to be a tricky one it is.  After all, when you're the devil, you got plenty of places to hide, and best of all, you got plenty of goons to do your dirty work.&quot;  He held up a blinking light.  &quot;See this?  This is what I can my 'insurance'.  It's a homing beacon telling whatever sharks, lions, wolves, or even rats that I've hired to come and kill you.  And believe me.  It's started.  It's on the back of the VCR, and I had to talk enough to give 'em a chance to get ya...&quot;  <br>
   Leo took out a cigar.  &quot;You got real issues Sid.  Maybe you should work'em out... but given the situation, the only doctor you'll be see'in is the mortition...&quot;  He cackled with laughter... &quot;See ya around...&quot;<br>
  Sid picked up his gun from the endtable.  Things were going to get a whole lot worse real quick.  He turned around to the sound on cocking guns, to see three men and two women with semi-automatic weapons pointed straight out of him.<br>
   No way he was going to get out of this one... No one could save him now...<br>

Nope... Sid looked around and surveyed his options.  The way he saw it, it was going to be a hell of a fight.  Sure, he had held his on on more then a few occasions.  But this was going to be tricky.<br>
<br>
   His finger found the trigger, and he almost flinched anticipating the oncoming excitment.  And death.  Then he thought about it.  Who were these guys?  Sharks?  A few Lions maybe?  Probably mostly Wolves and Rats.  Sid smiled.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Guys, guys, can't we just all get along?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Not for what we're gettin' paid.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But what if I told you that I could get you more?&quot;<br>
<br>
The gunmen paused.  One even lowered his gun.  Great.  Just great.... If only he could keep this up.  An old lady holding a double-barrel cackeled, <br>
<br>
&quot;More?&quot;<br>
<br>
Sid nodded his head vigourously.  &quot;Yes more!  Listen, I can cut you the deal of a LIFETIME!&quot;  You do know who I am right?&quot;  All of them nodded their heads.  &quot;Yeah!  I'm Sid, and when have I double crossed any of you before?&quot;<br>
<br>
They started to name off some times.  Then they started to name off quite a few times.  Then they just sat there and named more and more times that Sid had ripped them off.  Never said he had to be trustworthy.<br>
<br>
Sid lifted his gun and pulled the trigger.  It hit the light.  By this time in Grunge-City, it was dark.  The pollution made sure of that much.  Sid grimiced about what he was about to do, and went to work.... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=milkboy>Milk Boy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(12/18/02 6:00:43 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=857.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: yeah, Kudos on writing</span><hr size=1> Sid grimiced about what he was about to do, and went to work.... taking out the male and female rats using memory. Their silent deaths proved his memeory was still good in his ripe age, They were both head shots. <br>
<br>
The sound and smell of firearms filled the room as Sid silently whirled into position behind his filing cabinet. Not that it would provide very good cover, but they were still shooting behind his desk anyway, the morons. Sid had expected more, from the male wolf, and lion. The last female was a shark. In the 15 seconds of studing his assailents Sid had already figured out what each one was. The female might has well have been sporting a dorsal fin for how much she looked the stereo typical shark, except for that she was female. <br>
<br>
Sid leaned over almost right into the fray of flying lead, and carfully picked up his trusty paper weight. Hardley ever used before, Sid hoped it would finnally do him some good. Into the oppisite corner it went, easily drawing the fire of the three thugs. Out came Sids more stealthy weapon. His balisong, known to most in Grunge-City as a &quot;butterfly knife&quot;<br>
<br>
From there it was just knife work. The male lion went down with a quick slit to the throat. Down but not out, unfortunatly, as he slumped into Sid's arms, his life blood pouring out of him in the darkness, he scremed like a little girl. Reacting like lightning Sid used the soon to be corpse as a body sheild and using sound alone popped one into what he hoped was the remaning male. The lion. Then with hot blood continuing to pour on him he remained silent. <br>
<br>
The remaining gun shot off a couple more rounds, one of them actually hit her former comrad, shaking Sid's sheild above him sickenly. Finnally she stopped, Sid knew it was the remaning &quot;she&quot; because foolishly she said aloud &quot;Jack? I think we got him, you ok?&quot; And that was all Sid needed to locate her exactly, throw the bleeding corpse at her as a diversion and quickly dive and grab her to the ground. <br>
<br>
Easily over powering her and knocking her gun away, Sid could feel her panicked breath on his face as he slid his knife onto her neck just soft enough for her to feel.  Minty freash breath. &quot;You're going to tell me everything I want to know b*tch,&quot; he told her. And she would too, but only after Sid found a way to turn on some lights and get a look at her, because from the way her large heaving breasts pushed against his chest, Sid knew she was a sexy dame. He brought her to her feet and began walking her into the next room.... <p>&quot;Death is lighter than a feather, duty, heavier than a mountain.&quot;</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=shockner>shockner</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Fresh Meat</span><br> <font color=#336699>(12/18/02 9:35:23 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=857.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> test</span><hr size=1> test <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=shockner>shockner</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pre-Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(12/18/02 9:48:01 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=857.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> continue</span><hr size=1> sorry about that other thing before this. i was making sure the password was right.<br>

He brought her into the next room and turned on the light. Sitting her in a chair, he tied her hands to make sure she didnt try anything.<br>
Standing back he finally got a good look. He wasnt mistaken. She was a fine dame. A little dirty and beat up, but fine never the less.<br>
Making sure she could see his gun, she started asking questions.<br>
&quot;So, Leo's a devil, huh?&quot; Sid asked<br>
She simply nodded her head<br>

She shook her head no. <br>

After a long pause she started to say&quot;I dont know much, but...&quot;<br>
She was cut off by a gun shot and a bullet that flew through her forhead.<br>
Dropping to a knee, Sid turned around and shot the dame's assailent.<br>
Turning back to the lady, he sighed.<br>

Sid darted outside and ran down the block.  It was stressed times like these that Sid noticed the little things in life.  Old man Mcliney's whores trying to round up business, the drug dealers on the corner, trying to make a deal... And all of this, every iota of it was Leo's doing.  Leo just wasn't the devil, he was Satan himself...<br>
   Sid had found papers and documents in the house with numbers of other devils and sharks.  Lions and wolves weren't important or rich enough to have phones...  but with it were documents of bribary, death certificates, everything that pointed to Leo being the top man of Grunge City.  Maybe even the country... <br>
  But Sid had danced this dance before. He knew the signs of a fishy situation.  Leo was smart.  Wasn't any doubting that.  Then why would he leave this stuff for Sid to see?  <br>
  So Sid sat.  And he rummaged.  One place was mentioned over and over again.  An old warehouse by the dry docks... 1542 Chelsy Avenue... Abandoned for quite some time now... If there was ever a sign, it would be this one.  Hell, Sid almost felt this one bite him on the lip...<br>
  So this was where Sid was now.  Running.  Cars didn't exsist in Inner-Grunge City because of looters and such, so you had to use your feet.  Along the way, Sid shot three pimps out for revenge and a mugger who didn't know who he was.  But this was all very mundane.  <br>
   Sid arrived at the warehouse and walked inside.  Cigarette smoke filled the room.  Noticing that he wanted one, Sid reached for his pocket.  No, not now.  Maybe later...  He walked a little further with his gun in his hand, his finger tense on the trigger.  Then blinding lights came on.  And there, in the middle of the room stood Leo.<br>
   His shadow casting a dark and sinister siloutte on the floor, Leo grinned.  &quot;You bastard.  You finally found me, and even with the cigarette smoke, you didn't... didn't light one up.&quot;  He chuckled.  &quot;The rooms full of a gas that will explode when the slightest flame is expelled.  Even a gun could do the trick.  So I wouldn't...  Radion-oxide I believe... But in any case, it would blow us both up.&quot;<br>
  Sid stared at his assalent.  &quot;What the hell is the meaning of this?!&quot;<br>
   &quot;You know what the meaning of this is Sid... Hell, you know the meaning of all of this...&quot;<br>
   &quot;All of what?&quot;  Sid snapped back, getting angry now.<br>
   &quot;All of THIS...  Grunge-City!  You fool!  You see the world for what it is!  And with me, that makes two of us...&quot;<br>
   &quot;Talk like you know what your talkin' about Leo.  Or else I might be inclined to pull this tr-&quot;<br>
   &quot;I know you would.  So let me explain.  When you saved me from that nasty gang buisness three years ago...  You remember it don't you?  I finally opened my eyes and saw the world for what it was.  A cold heartless place.  And when you rescued me... Well, let's just say I admired you because you didn't change for the world.  You just stayed the same.  You WERE the world...<br>
   &quot;And you see that don't you?  Below all that toughness, below that cold-heartedness... You see the world for what it is too, don't you?  That's why you can shoot a man and never look back.&quot;  Leo stepped towards Sid.  &quot;So I built on this basis.  Doing what I had to do, cutting any throat in my damn way, and I got to the top.  And don't you point your finger at me Sid, I am at the top!&quot;<br>
   Sid stood there silent.<br>
   &quot;And now, I'm going to get away.  Why?  Because I say so bastard.  That, and you can't escape from the building.  Doors are locked.  And this-&quot;  Leo said knocking on an invisble barrier, &quot;This, is my insurance.  C'mon Sid, you didn't think that I would buy a piece of crap building like this just to meet you here, do you?  Come closer.  Feel the glass.  Unbreakable.  Guarunteed.  Not even a sonic could break it.  But you're welcome to try.  And that gas?  Well let's just say merry christmas.&quot;<br>
  Sid sarcastically muttered, &quot;And a happy new year...&quot;<br>
  &quot;The gas is nothing but perfume.  Bad smell abeit, but perfume none the less.&quot;<br>
   Sid shot his handgun at Leo, dead on.  The bullet made a clinck sound when it hit the glass, and fell to the ground.<br>
  &quot;But you'll starve in here Sid.  You will.  Wolves will protect this building every night until you're dead from starvation.  Ironically, sort of like the world you model so well after.  Starving and dying.  But I intend to be the top man Sid, I really do...&quot;  Leo laughed as he left the building, the last sound he made the clicking of the door latch... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=theunknownwriter>TheUnknownWriter</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pre-Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(12/21/02 9:46:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=857.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ...</span><hr size=1> Frank hated his job.  He really did.  He didn't really mind pushing around the different low lifes and that, but killing them's what got to him.  What had he sunk down to...?<br>
<br>
But the last few weeks had been different.  The last three weeks anyhow... He'd just been told to guard this warehouse on the otherside of town for 12 hour shifts.  Not to fun, but not to grisly either. <br>
<br>
So Frank did.  He guarded the warehouse, and shot anyone who got close.  He was told there was a guy in there, but... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mrbeaver@polykarbonbbs>MrBeaver</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(12/21/02 9:57:24 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=857.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Continuing...</span><hr size=1> but... he didn't like to get in the way of his shark's buisness.  People who did that... well they 'disappeared'.  So Frank guarded.  And guarded.  Until one morning when he got a note from his shark.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Frankie, open the building up, clean up.  Kill Drugdeala number 45 on Sixth st.&quot;<br>
<br>
So Frank did as he was told.  He got the key to the warehouse, and he went to door.  He opened it up, and  looked inside.  Good God did it smell like crap in there.  Frank wondered what those Sharks could of done...  In the middle of the room he noticed a large pile of crap, and he nearly threw up.<br>
   Then something hit him in the back of the head with a brick, and Frank didn't have to worry about being a bad person anymore.  The something struck out and hit him, and hit Frank, and hit the first person to come into that door for three weeks.  And within 10 minutes, it was over.<br>
   A drug dealer on sixth street needed to be attened to, said the note on the dead body, so something went to sixth street.  Something took a butter knife.  Something carved out the drug dealers heart with that butter knife.<br>
   Three sharks were having a meeting downtown at three o'clock.  Something went downtown.  Soemthing took a pair of wire cutters.  Something cut off the sharks' fingers, toes, noses, and testicles.<br>
   All over Grunge-City something was brewing.  Something was brutally killing or torturing anything that had to do with sharks or lions or wolves.  And something was coming for Leo.<br>
   Leo knew this.  So he built the most elaborate security system that money could buy.  But Leo denied it could be HIM.  HE was DEAD.  HE had spent THREE WEEKS in that building.  Then alarms went off.  Secruity guards screamed for mercy.  And Leo ran for his gun.  Something was coming, and he would be prepared.  Almost shaking when he heard his secretary die from what sounded like a paper shreadder right outside of his office, Leo quivered.<br>
   The door slammed open, and there before him stood something.  With a torn trench coat, a dirty face, and a smell that could kill a cow, stood Sid, with a look from hell on his face.<br>
   &quot;Hello Leo... &quot;<br>
