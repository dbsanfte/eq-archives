It was almost flawless.  No Tom Bombadil was a small price to pay.  I wish the had shown the Barrow-Wights.  Despite the little things, it fits nicely into my &quot;best movie of all time&quot; slot.  In the book, didn't they run into &quot;dark dwarves&quot; in Mithral hall?  <br>
<br>
A few people don't seem to understand the meaning of this movie.  Tolkien was the first author ever to create a fantasy novel with such imagination and life.  It is like a foundation for everything fantasy today.  <br>

Vigilante -&quot;The only thing I didn't like was Gandalf...where's the magic.&quot;- (trying not to give away the next movie) You have yet to see magic!  Just wait for &quot;The Two Towers!  And what about the Bulrog?  Didn't the bridge scene show some serious power?<br>

<br>
First off, I haven't read the books yet, but I <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> liked</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> the movie a lot.  With that said, this movie <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> DID</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> have a terrible ending.  <br>
<br>
People that hated the ending haven't read the books.  We all like closure, we all need to know how things end or else we feel cheated.    <br>
<br>
All you people that say the stuff like the quote above have read the books and know how everything ends.  Everyone else is either gonna hafta sit through another movie with a crappy ending a year from now and one more in two years, OR go buy the books and read them to see what happens.  I'm gonna read the books.  Hell if I'm waiting two years.<br>
<br>
Anyhow, my point is that the people that didn't read the books have every right to say the ending of this three hour movie sucked without being called &quot;You retards&quot; because they (and me) were left hangin' after such a good movie.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
PS--I think if they would have released all three movies at the same time it would've been awesome, but something like that would never happen.  They want to milk each one for all they're worth.  That and the fact that it takes too long to complete 3 movies all at once.<br>

<br>
Now the two things wrong with this movie were the ending and all of the lulls.<br>
<br>
The ending did end on a cliffhanger, but not on a high note.  There was no closure for someone who has only seen the movies.  To say that someone should have to read the book to get it is unfair.  If you are going to make something into a movie, then the movie become the representation of the story.  The movie needs to do a good job at being a movie, not just a re-iteration of the book.<br>
<br>
The lulls.  We do this.  We walk.  We do this.  Walk more.  At some point the walking scenes could have been integrated with the talking scenes and then there would have been more of a steady flow.  Something that is very important to a 3 hour movie. <p> "There is a theory which states that if ever anybody discovers exactly what the Universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable. There is another theory which states that this has already happened."

I cant believe how many things they left out of the movie and changed. I can almost compare it to the Akira manga. And as to the ending, if they stuck to the original ending of the book it would have been a lot clearer. It shows the heroes heading off somewhere. To me that would be a decent ending, but oh well. If they made this a 4 hour movie it could have been a lot better. they could have stuck to the book more and given a better explanation of what the hell was going on. <br>

And i was very disapointed with Bombadil not in the movie. Him and Glorfindel. And that they never met the elves in the forest, poor Sam.<br>

Glorfindel was a cool character...but he appears a whole 2 times in fellowship.  They needed to increase the role of Arwen so they just replaced Glorfindel with Arwen.  She pretty much did all that Glorfindel did.  As for Bombadil....if you included him...it would only make the movie longer.  He's a fat guy running around the woods.  If they had to take anything out...I'm glasd they took him out rather than anything else.  <br>
<br>
All-in-all...I am quite satisfied with the movie.  There have been a couple attempts at creating this series of books...and to be percectly frank...they all sucked.  Really.  The animation was crap...and...the animated series I saw this is the order in which they made the movies:  Hobbit, Return of the King.  That is it.  All of a sudden you see Sam pounding on a door of a huge castle trying to get to Frodo.  You dont know how they got there...what they're doing...or anything.  It made me sick.  They apparently made another movie...though I never saw it.  I heard nothing good from it so I didnt.  I did see a clip of the sucky animation, however. <br>
<br>
They did a superb job with that movie.  They had a huge potential to screw up big time...and they made a movie, for the most part, true to the book.  The graphics were great, and it wasnt a movie tht was made just for the sole puprose of saying &quot;look what we can do&quot;...the computer stuff was really integrated into the movie well.  As for someone's comment about falling asleep...well...I saw a lot of action...perhaps you shouldnt have fallen asleep.  As for the first being the most exciting part...&quot;welcome..to my birthday party....etc...bunch of talking&quot;...well if you find that exciting, I could send you a very large phone-book that you can read!  <br>

Why dont we try and see all that these people DID do right...then the minimal tidbits some people seem so upset about...will seem like nothing. <p><center> -No, Mom!  I don't need college.  I'm going to follow my dream, and become a clown!-<center>

Trust me, I hate it when I see a movie that takes out something from the book, but you can't fit everything into a movie.<br>
<br>
If you think this was a bad translation from book to movie, just think of Jurassic Park, and you should feel a lot better. <p><table width=100% border=0>

All the sets were just as I'd pictured them in my mind - not surprising really, theres a lot of detail in the books. I thought the fight with the troll was excellent.<br>
As for having a bad ending I think thats a pretty small minded view, even if youve not read all the books. It is part of a bigger story, and you have to take that into account. You cant go around blaming the guys who made the film, they stuck to the book really closely, and as Ali said - even added part of the next book to make it a bit clearer. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/usakuyanekoinu.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sakuya Neko Inu</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.tamalina.com/banners/simple21.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(12/23/01 2:37:13 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.industrialhead.com/memberpics/JTHMgod.jpg length=125 width=136></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: What Joy!

That's basically how the book went. Talk, talk some more, walk walk walk, fight, walk, talk. And it was fine. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showMessageRange?topicID=7600.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showMessageRange?topicID=7600.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showMessageRange?topicID=7600.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a> <b>4</b> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showMessageRange?topicID=7600.topic&start=81&stop=87>5</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showMessage?topicID=7726.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showMessage?topicID=7690.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.emailToFriend?topicID=7600.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.threadControl?topicID=7600.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=7600.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=7600.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub25.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="polykarbonbbsfrm18">PK-BBS Rules and Regulations!<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm3">News and Updates<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm2">Photoshop and Art questions<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm4">General Manga/Anime Discussion<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm5">Japanese Language Help<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm23">art in progress<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm13">Black and White Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm14">Color Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm19">Member's Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm17">Moderators Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm6">Member Photos<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm22">How to use Fight Club<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm20">Challenges<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm21">Matches<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm25">Pose Forum<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm26">Writer's Forum<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm27">Board F.A.Q.s</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#336699>- </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs>Polykarbon BBS</a><font color=#336699> - </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19>Member's Lounge</a> <font color=#336699> - </font><a href="http://www.polykarbon.com">Polykarbon: Manga & Photoshop</a><font color=#336699> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.4 b8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
