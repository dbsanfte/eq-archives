2. why does photoshop cost so much!? and 3. should i consider buying photoshop in the next couple years?  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ukingtez3031.showPublicProfile?language=EN>kingtez3031</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(7/4/02 7:11:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3871.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: is photoshop appropriate for me?</span><hr size=1> im a 14 year old booy and i have photohop<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>yes for the money i think its definatley worth it because theres so many feautures and when you get really good you can make just about anything. not to mention it comes bundleded with imageready which is a slightly helpful program..<br><br>as for the college thing.i really dont know.maybe you should wait and think about it or maybe go for a double-major so you can get a major in 2 things just incase the whole thing doesnt work out.<br>but think about you got ttime ahead of you <p><HTML><BODY><b>Making Wallpapers & Flashy images your thing?<br>Maybe it's poetry or skinning. Whatever it is, you can be a part of the Manifest Knowledge art group. <br></b><a Target="_top" href="http://lineargtstudios.tripod.com/ericpage/index.html"><img src="http://images.deviantart.com/large/designs/dbutton/Manifest_Knowledge_Quik_Banner.jpg"</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=dumblonde52688>Dumblonde52688</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pre-Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(7/4/02 8:21:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3871.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: is photoshop appropriate for me?</span><hr size=1> well thanks! it helps alot to get a reply from someone the same age as me, and probably understands how i feel.<br><br>p.s. if anyone else wants to make a comment feel free to, i'm still looking for some more comments on this issue!<br>ta ta <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ulinabo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>LinaBo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>PK Angel</span><br> <font color=#336699>(7/4/02 2:31:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3871.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.marua.com/ifk/avatars/Linapic.jpg width=100 height=78></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: is photoshop appropriate for me?</span><hr size=1> I have 7-8 years of experience with Photoshop (I'm on the near 20 side of 19 years old, btw)<br><br>Photoshop is indeed worth it. It's the leading program of it's kind for the commercial art industry, and you're required to know it if you ever want to make it as an artist in that field.<br><br>But seen as you're only 14, I suggest that you don't buy it right away without having experience with it, first, especially given that it's extremely expensive. There are several ways to do this: Depending upon where you live, you might find a course or workshop that can familiarize you with the program, first. There is also the possibility of a 30 day trial ( <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.adobe.com/education/ed_products/psel_demodnld.html">www.adobe.com/education/e...odnld.html</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> ) of Photoshop Elements, which as far as I know is a basic version of the full program, and should give you all the basics you require with the same feel as the full version.<br><br>You could also <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> buy</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Photoshop Elements (I got a Wacom Intuos2 4x5&quot; tablet, and it came bundled with that as well as some other stuff. If you need a tablet, too, the Intuos2's come bundled with it), which is much cheaper, anyhow. You could also look for an older version of the program (probably used) for way cheaper, as the main thing that you really need to look for is a version new enough that it uses <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  layers</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. which are extremely important for editing your work. Those can be found as far back as a few versions. I myself use PS6, but I've used 5, which isn't much different. I haven't used 7 yet, but I'm getting along really well with 6 right now (though I'm in college this year, so I might buy 7 while it's cheap). A lot of new features added in are just elaborations on an already good thing. Slightly older versions are far from being unservicable.<br><br>I believe that there are also student versions for cheap, the catch being that you can't use the program to make stuff for sale (educational version) (I think this is right... have to double check. It could actually be more like what I list below)<br><br>If you have a friend or family member in college/university, it's not uncommon for the college bookstore to carry the full version of the latest released Photoshop, at a fraction of the price (as low as 1/4, where I live). You could ask them if they can get you a copy for cheap, that way. Paraphrasing my father (who is a college student right now):<br><br>&quot;The version that they carry is fully licensed for individuals. You can make stuff for sale. The only disadvantage is that it's not licensed for a business&quot;<br><br>Basically meaning that an individual can use that copy for profit, but not a group. I think this might be the educational version that I've heard about...<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br><br>hope that helps<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <p>'I like people who acknowledge that they're human without confirming that they're stupid'</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ulinabo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>LinaBo</A> at: 7/4/02 2:34:12 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ucaptainmeth.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Captain Meth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Violent Femme</span><br> <font color=#336699>(7/4/02 5:54:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3871.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.methart.com/t_meth1.jpg  WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: is photoshop appropriate for me?</span><hr size=1> Well, I would definatly say that Photoshop is appropriate.

Thats what most people do and Adobe doesnt really care, infact, they actually like the idea of 14 years going and what could be veiwed has &quot;stealing it&quot; from them.  The thing it, Adobe doesnt lose money because you werent gonna buy anyway, most likely you cant afford it.  However, you are using and getting used to the program and becoming yet another person who might use it in there job. <br>     Now Adobe does care if things like Big Buisnesses or Schools that can afford it uses their software illegially, infact, they care a lot and will take you to court and make you suffer has much has possible for it. <br>   So basically, Adobe makes all their money from places like schools and buissneses that have to buy a copy of photoshop for each computer its on.  And schools and buisnesses have to buy it because thats what people use, and so many people use it because they got it illegally at first, but if they didnt get it that way, they wouldnt have bought it cause it cost so much.  Then photoshop wouldnt be has popular has a tool it is now and schools and buisnesses wouldnt buy it that much.
