<br>
Okay first off, my friend said he'd be fine with us using the Academy as the physical aggressors.  Even got him to agree to drum us up a few cadets that are doing the dirty work.<br>
<br>
Also I got two Soldier sketches in the works (the two who visit the torn town).  But how about a quick description?  Well fine since you asked <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
First one is a priest I've had in my head for some time now.  As far as look goes I was thinking of a old Spanish (I think that's where the look came from) priest, the type with the long black coat, small yet defined white neck collar, and those neat flat hats.  He's one of few, but noticeable none combatants of SOLDIER.  All of his talent and skill comes from his mediating abilities.  I'm a little uncomfortable with that being related to god, seeing that he is a clergy man, but I'll work a way around it and make him work (I don't intend to get all that into religion with my stories, just not the atmosphere I want).<br>
<br>
The second Soldier how ever I have not clue.  I love different or not SO cliched things, so if you two have a thought that'd be great <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
<br>
But I think it'd still be best to come up with a reason why someone/something/a company would feel it was needed to tear apart a calm little town (secret artifact of something of the sort perhaps?) and worse yet why they thought they needed such a extreme set of people as the ones from the Academy and further more why they'd dare to piss off SOLDIER and even further gruesome in thought why they'd have the balls to try to kill two Soldiers.<br>
<br>
I know it may sound like a lot of loose ends but once we come up with a good reason for the aggressive group (the one that hired the Academy) than we would have most of the background story rapped up.<br>
<br>
Also, I prefer to start off with story and character development.  Nothing worse than having a good fight interrupted by pointless flash backs and things of the sort getting in the way of the action <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Plus, and I hope you agree, it's a lot more tense when you see the characters develop and unavoidably end up fighting, you know, get people caring for these characters and make it hard for them to decide who should win.<br>
<br>
And don't worry Andrew, sometimes the simplest things can be the greatest, your gal doesn't need to have a epic background, just something with enough substance to get people to feel for her.<br>
<br>
Oh, and if you two reply with, &quot;I don't know,&quot; then I WILL come up with something.  But in group projects like this I prefer when everyone has a say in the creation of the story, more the views, more the ideas, greater the product <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

I think the 2nd soldier should be sort of a brute male or female, maybe a lil knight-ish?  Like shiny armor, a buster sword, or maybe even 2 swords...  He/She could maybe even be the priest's bodyguard or something; I dunno...<br>
<br>
As for the story, I'll leave it up to you, because when I think of something, it just ends up getting confusing and convoluted...but I could talk a little about Aisya's role a little later, maybe<br>
<br>
As for Rogue's char, I wanna hear a lil more about her history, and how she got ditched... Maybe we can incorporate it into the story...<br>

<br>
The Complete and Mostly Unabridged History of Kiyone!<br>
<br>
Back 21 seasons in an unamed, beach side, Neko-Kin hamlet, Kiyone was born to her family, consisting of her mother Erika, father Tiono, and her brother (3 at the time) Eyu. Now, Kiyone's family line was that of (in)famous adventurers, and like a majority of her family, she was strong. And like most members of her species, she was flighty. Problem was she took both to the extreme. Kiyone lived happily, and later her mother bore another child, another daughter, this time named Niyoko.<br>
<br>
Sadly, ten years after her birth, Kiyone lost her mother. She was slain by an adult dragon that lived nearby. In a vicous battle, Kiyone's mother and father rejoined with old companions to slay the beast. They were successful, but not without loss.<br>
<br>
It mattered not though as Erika Foreststride died as any Neko-Kin should, bravely striking out. Her accomplishments were celebrated and she honored, leaving Tiono alone to raise his three children.<br>
<br>
Eyu grew up to exhibit magical prowress and became a sorcerer, and Niyoko, shy and embarassed as she lacked the strength of their family, became a bodyguard devoted to protecting others at the expense of her own body.<br>
<br>
Kiyone though, took up sword and shield. Her father tried to teach her, but realized she did not have the displince he did. So he taught her what he might as she learned her own barbaric fighting style.<br>
<br>
Eventually she set out from home, as any warrior should, to find adventure. How she survived to meet Terry was unknown. But he saw her single-handedly win a bar brawl, against most of the patrons, he knew she would be a useful commodity to extract money he was &quot;owed.&quot; Exploiting her rather naive nature, the two formed an amazing team. <br>
<br>
Eventually, two dwarves with a hint of wanderlust encountered them, and invited them to join. Terry accepted to get rich, Kiyone to find adventure. They had many exciting adventures with a pair of elves, from ridding a small town of vicous gnolls in a nearby cave to exterminating massive insects in the home of a noble. Eventually, the elves went their own way, leaving the four companions alone. <br>
<br>
It mattered not though. On an expedition to save a town near Kiyone's home from evil Sahaguins, they joined with an elven Druid. They vanquished the foul beasts (with many close calls and harrowing escapes of course) and next defended a nobles home from a goblin army. <br>
<br>
Much to their delight, he gave them a mansion, but apparently the previous occupants hadn't vacated./ So, battling through undead and a powerful wizard, they conquered and established a town at the base. <br>
<br>
After hearing rumors of a nearby temple they invetigated, and were forced to each face a guantlet alone. Kiyone slew threw Wyrmlings alone, one after the other, almost dying in the process. Her companions fared equally well, to only have their goal stolen by the wizard they previously defeated.<br>
<br>
Returning home to the peace of their village, Kiyone's sword began exhibiting intelligence (too much exposure to magic mayhap?).<br>
<br>
Peace was shattered as the village was attacked by an army known only as the scropion clan. So, leaving the dwarves behind to care for injured people, they set off and struck a hideout in an old mine. They battled their way through, and faced against a high ranking sorcerer. Coming close to death for the druid and being turned into a rabbit for Terry was enough for a whyile.<br>
<br>
So, here we are now. On vacation in a far off town, Terry and Eden have snatched away to get a day or two without nearly dying leaving the poor Kiyone alone to mourn the fact that her friends are &quot;out adventuring without her.&quot;<br>
<br>

Though, maybe not deep personality-wise, she certainly does have alot of history (once again ALWAYS a good thing).  So, in retrospect, she IS deeper then anyone (including me) thought.  <br>
<br>
Also, after reading, it seems that she is VERY experienced and skilled; if a little headstrong and ditzy (seeing how her entire life and bloodline revolves around adventuring and battles).  I'll be sure to incorproate that in the battle.<br>
<br>
How about that sketch of Aisya?  Can't wait to see it!  And how are the pages coming?  I'm not trying to rush u or anything- just saying if u need help, or run into a snag, just ask us.<br>
<br>
Oh, yeah...I added that 3rd bang and fixed the sword like u wanted.  Maybe I'll update those sketches soon (tomarrow, maybe? depends)... <p>"Black is...

And looking back, she does have one hell of a history. Seriously isn't much to her personality.<br>
<br>
She's happy-go-lucky, headstrong, ditzy, and overly emotional at times. She is rather impatient and lacks very much common sense.<br>

<br>
Let's not give the &quot;organization&quot; a name yet per say.<br>
<br>
While muddling through my thoughts I could not come up with an idea of a &quot;organization&quot; that would suit the role well and, well, basically be any good.  Except for the mentioning that the &quot;organizstion&quot; exists there's no other real point to giving the &quot;organization&quot; a name.<br>
<br>
It's like, if we continued the story from here, than there'd be a reason to the &quot;organization&quot; a name and a history, but as of now, there's no real reason to give a name and or a history to the &quot;organization&quot;.<br>
<br>
On top of that, leaving a element of mystery will encourage for further instalments of your character Kai <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->              <br>
<br>
The Academy doesn't even need to be mentioned except for giving reason for my group (SOLDIER) wanting to be involved with this whole mess.<br>
<br>
But what about the attack on Aiysa's town to begin with?  Surely we need a reason for this, well here's what popped up in my head at first.  The goal of the &quot;organization&quot; for one reason or another is immortality (actually thoughts about a bitter old man is what gave me this idea, after all, who else would be the head of a organization of some kind).  This is a messy subject and exceptionally complex when it comes to it's problem solving.  There are many components and methods for going about immortality.<br>
<br>
Aiysa's town was a town of old traditions, right?  Perhaps a town with some rather old ceremonial items.  Very important items, not for any economic reason, but the value is based solely on religious and tradition reasons.  How ever these items could have importance to others for other reasons.  See where I'm going here?  The Academy was hired to sac the town until they found a item or a series of items they were hired to get.<br>
<br>
This could be reason for Aiysa staying under the &quot;organization's&quot; control.  Like her kin-ship she very much wants to retrieve these items before any harm can be done by their use.<br>
<br>
--- --- ---<br>
<br>
Kiyone's only flaw is she has no character inflicting flaws.  So she's a ditz, but does this have a effect on her?  well, how about this.  She's seemingly been to hell and back, she's met friend and lost friend, and now by all accounts has been abandoned.  Doubt in one self could come from here, give her a reason to be drinking in a bar like you had suggested at the begging and start creating a tragic character others could relate to and possibly even love.<br>
<br>
It doesn't need to be anything to dramatic, but this could be where the seeds of change begin and where her character finally begins to develop into something a new.<br>
<br>
Andrew, your gal, she's and adventure, no?  Perchance she has come to the position of handling a exceptionally powerful item.  She does have a magical sword after all?  It could very well be an excellent source of power for conducting certain types of experiments and is bound to be far easier to acquire than anything from a Soldier.  Reason for the fight starting at her feet.<br>
<br>
--- --- ---<br>
<br>
actually, this probably would work better, considering it'll cover my characters and Kiyone.<br>
<br>
Lydon Royrenite (soldier boy) has come to acquire a unremarkably powerful weapon, the spirt sword Gaia.  It works on the bias of ones own strength, the sword is equally as strong as you are, mind, body, and soul.  (there's a reason for that to <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     but that's another story)  It effectively will continuously double it's wielders strength, that is if used right.<br>
<br>
-- note -- the sword's damn near impossible to use, mostly because of Soldier Boy's mental state's.  The sword has a mind of it's own, and will only allow itself to be wielded when it wants to.  I don't plan on having Soldier Boy ever learning how the sword works, and, or how to gain full control over it. -- note --<br>
<br>
Point is, the other idea of Kai's, Aiysa being after Ever Moon.  <br>
<br>
Ever Moon is constantly at Soldier Boy's side, and has been known to wield Gaia herself.  The sword isn't registered with SOLDIER and so it's actual owner could have been misconstrued, leaving some to believe Ever Moon has the sword.<br>
<br>
And as I said above, the &quot;organization&quot; that's backed Aisya into a corner is after great magical elements, and keeping with your idea in mind Kai, has sent Aiysa to extract the sword from Ever Moon.  By bad chance though she stumbled across Kiyone.  Moon and Lydon was SUPPOSE to be in that area, so it was easy for her to have accidently miss identified Kiyone as the target she was sent after.<br>
<br>
Kiyone's self doubt, and wanting to find a way to prove herself could be the back bone to her reasoning to stay in the fight once it's figured out she was just attacked by accident.<br>
<br>
And, so there we have it... We don't get to know much about the &quot;organization&quot; forcing Aiysa to do what she is. All we know is that they are after great elements of magic and using Aiysa to gather them.  This fight is a result of misunderstanding, good intentions, last resorts, and being in the wrong place at the wrong time.<br>
<br>
So,... what do you guys think?  what works what doesn't?<br>

Maybe its just too late for my brain to work on anything <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Well, here's my rundown of everything you posted-<br>
<br>
1. This character you are talking about, huh? You lost me on every level with that one.<br>
<br>
2. The relic idea sounds good, especially in our setting. Something like that might be quite influential for its holder, and of course any bad guy-ish group is going to want it. What do you think Kai?<br>
<br>
3. As far as inflicting character flaws, I missed an important word for Kiyone: Impulsive. She blindly charges forth through life, often causing numerous problems. She gladly charges into the heart of a group of enemies alone.<br>
<br>
But on another note, that isn't too bad an idea. I've been searching for a new twist for Kiyone in the campaign and this could be a good one. For now, with her small foresight, she could easily believe that her friend has left her. Since being &quot;deserted&quot; by friends isn't good for self esteem. Thus she thinks she lost her edge or that Terry thinks she's useless now. This sets her to drinking in the bar. When Aiysa &quot;picks&quot; the fight, her anger and depression is unleashed, setting up for a serious fight. Then after Soldier and Moon enter, she is left out of the fight. But, still blurred by a mix of depression, anger and the unbridled rage of a barbarian, can't let the fight end no matter what. She won't &quot;lose&quot; the fight and she charges back in, determined to take all of them down. Sounds nice to me. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=psychosoldier>Psycho Soldier</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(2/5/02 10:22:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=503.topic&index=73>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://twentyonedealer.com/lydon/PsychoSoldier%20-%20head%20-%20DONE%20-%20avatar.jpg height=150 width=130></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> 1) erhm, <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     Um, heh, I was referring to what Kai had originally called &quot;the organization.&quot;  I keep reffereing to it in loose terms, cuase, well, it could turn out to be anything.<br>

<br>
The &quot;organization&quot; hears about the town's hard times (along with a legend of a lost artifact) and offers to lend a hand to the town...when actually that 'hand' was a tyrannical rule over the townspeople until they find the artifact. Sooner or later, the people got sick of the way things were going, and decided to rebel.  <br>
<br>
As soon as things got out of hand, the &quot;organization&quot; then enlists the aid of the Academy to quell the villagers/and or raid the town of their artifacts. But during some of those skirmishes, the &quot;organization&quot; spots the talents of Aisya and decides to put her to work for them (thus the kiddnapping and involuntary employment).  Basically her job is to be the &quot;organization&quot; 's hitman(girl)- which at its core means, attack anybody the &quot;organization&quot; sees fit to.  She hates this job with a passion, but with no other option to keep her town from harm, she does the job, and does it remarkably well (with her town's safety as her drive).  She's still a good person at heart, but can come off to be as a byotch (though she tries to stray from killing).<br>
<br>
So the reason they still have the town under the &quot;organization&quot; 's control is because they haven't found the artifact yet, or just to keep Aisya under their control (or both)?<br>
<br>
....ok, so she was given a message from her superiors to search for a girl named Ever Moon, who weilds this special sword.  Her instructions are to kill Ev and anyone who accompanies her, and bring the sword back to the &quot;organization&quot;.  She is not given any specifics as to why this sword is so special or even what the girl looks like; she only knows that she is in some specific town.  So she goes on this aimless search in the town looking for this one girl w/ a sword.  Naturally, the first place for any good hit(wo)men to check is, of course, the local bar. Meanwhile, this is where Kiyone is drowning away her sorrows; just her and her sword...  ....And the rest is where the fight begins...<br>
<br>
Am I going in the right direction?  Anything else we should add to?<br>
Rogue:  I think the sketch of Aisya is niiiiiiiiice! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    And I really love the expression on Kiyone's face (fangs n all), lol <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  .  I pretty much completed the concept sketches of ur char; it should be up as soon as this kid gets off the comp with the scanner.....!!!!  Look for it later on tonight<br>
<br>
*edit*...how does Kiyone's sword show signs of intelligence?  What are its special talents?<br>

<br>
&quot;Hey is that a guy? A girl? Your mom? Me? Is she wearing one of those indian skirt things? Are those her legs?&quot;<br>
<br>
I wonder why I still draw in class sometimes :rollseyes<br>
<br>
Glad you also like my Kiyone sketch. I took a while to get that one looking right. It was originally only gonna be a face shot, hence the time I spent on that portion.<br>
<br>
As far as intellignece goes... First of all the sword is talkative. It is pretty sharp, no pun intended, but it lacks tact. A perfect companon for our none to bright warrior, no?<br>
<br>
As far as magical abilities go... It enhances Kiyone's ability to rage, making her stronger then she already is and able to endure punishment that would easily kill others. When he rage ends though, thats another story.<br>
<br>
Hmm, the other abilities I can think of as of now are the fact that it can cut through some magical defences, as well as weild itself if Kiyone is incapacitated. Finally, it helps Kiyone parry blows by guiding her into blocks with itself. Not much else I can think of right now, but it is still a fairly powerful weapon indeed. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=psychosoldier>Psycho Soldier</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(2/6/02 3:56:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=503.topic&index=76>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://twentyonedealer.com/lydon/PsychoSoldier%20-%20head%20-%20DONE%20-%20avatar.jpg height=150 width=130></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> MURDLE, this is why it bothers me to handle the story all on my own <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   It can be painfully difficult to get what you want across by words alone <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

  Wow, they look pretty bad on the comp; I might have to do somethin about that...<br>
<br>
As you've probably seen, the sketch of my char (Aisya) hasn't even been past stick figure stage, except for a couple of faces.  Well, I never really actually tried to finish it, and probably won't, as the same can be said about the other pages.  <br>
<br>
I guess the only real reason to post Aisya's image is to show that she has 3 stripes on her face...lol  Other than the stripes on Ev and the updated sword and shield (the sheild design WILL be scrapped), all other changes are so minor, they're not even worth mentioning. <br>
