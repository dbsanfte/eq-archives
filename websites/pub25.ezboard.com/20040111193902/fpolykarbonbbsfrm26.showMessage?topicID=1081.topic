Just wanted to see if it's good or not.  Need to finish this in like an hour, lol.  Well, here it is.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp       Over and Again<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp So this was it... This is how it would end.  I lay there, feeling water draining into my ears.  The cold, dark feeling all over my body made me tremble.  What I had not feared, had finally come to take me.  Though it was only minutes, it seemed as if hours had gone by as I awaited the coming of my end.  Finally it had reached the point where the outside had gotten blurry, and I could not hear, smell, nor see the outside clearly anymore...<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Haha, man what are you doing?  Stop wasting the ink on it!&quot;  Said the boy, as he pressed keys on the keyboard.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Heh, nah', I'm not wasting it.  I need it from last year.  Ms. Calvo had said it was due after summer, remember?&quot;  Asked Andres.  He stooped over and grabbed papers from an old printer next to the book shelves.  It was a small book unformatted, and unchecked.  &quot;Summer projects are serious crap, man.  You're lucky you didn't get one, you know?&quot;  Claimed Andres, with pride in his unfinished work.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;School starts tommorow, I don't think that will cut out for what she asked you to do,&quot;  Said the boy,  &quot;and no, I'm not lucky I wasn't given a summer project, I just did all the work assigned to me during the year, unlike you.&quot;  He continued.  &quot;Well, you got what you needed.  Let's get out of here, I hate this place.  Too many books and stuff.&quot;  Finished the boy.  The two boys walked out of the building, and down the street towards their homes.  A few blocks down, Andres stuck out his hand and the boy shaked, in a teenage manner.  &quot;See ya in school, or whatever.&quot;  Said the Andres, as the boy nodded him goodbye.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He walked facing the ground, as his pants almost dragged off the floor, and as the sunshine hit his face making him look a pale color.  Finally being a few steps from his stoop, a dark skinned person walked out of the backstairs.  &quot;Yo', where you goin'?&quot;  He said.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Um, home...&quot;  Said the boy nervously.  &quot;You need anything, Devin?&quot; he continued.  &quot;Nah', I jus' wanted ta' see if ya' bro' was home, peace out.&quot;  He mumbled, as he walked away.  The boy walked up his stairs, and reached his door.  He opened it, and as he made it creak, heard footsteps on the floor coming towards the door.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Listen Rix, I'm leaving and won't be back for two days.  You better go to school you hear me?  You know I can find out if you skip, or anything.  Ok, honey, I'll see you on Tuesday, alright?&quot;  Said the thin woman, dressed in a short leather skirt, belly  shirt and leather jacket with feather-like fabric on the collar.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Ok, bye.  Love you, mom.&quot;  Said Rix as he stepped aside to watch her leave quickly down the stairs and into her Alero.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He walked into his small apartment.  The first room, a living room, with a small glass table in the middle.  A vase with fake flowers on it, a couch in front of it and to the side of it.  A large wooden, old fashion set which had a stereo, and small TV on it.  A wall-lamp on the top left corner of the room, next to the large windows which were the only source of light to that part of the house.  The walls were dull, and white.  The wooden floor creaked as he took steps across the living room and into the kitchen.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A small room, with a few cabinets, a double-sink and a small refrigerator in the corner.  He opened up the 'fridge and took out a small bottle of iced tea.  Across the fridge was a door, which lead to the tiny hallway.  Just out of this door was his room.  Rix stepped in and sat, like he would always do, on his couch which he used for a bed.  He took a sip of the iced tea, and put it on a small table next to the couch.  He stared across his small room and looked at the black screen of a 12 inch TV, then to the side of it an open window with closed blinds, which would let in a small ammount of light.  He closed his eyes and lay there for just a few minutes as he started to black out...<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Bloory?  Rixius Bloory?  Is there a Rixius Bloory here?&quot;  Shouted out the assistant principle while calling out the names of the students in Law class.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Here, I'm over here 'miss!&quot;  Said Rix, raising his hand high, making sure he was not marked absent for the first day of school.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Good, Hernandez?...&quot;  She went on with the names, as her voice faded away from Rix's mind.  He looked around to see if any of his old friends from last year were in his class.  He didn't recognize anyone there by name, but had seen some faces around the school in his second year.  He sat in his seat, patiently waiting for the bell to ring.  His small card still in his hand with his name, and home information written on it.  They were to be given to the assistant principle at the end of the period as everyone walked out.  Rix stared at the clock, then lay his head on the table with his arms crossed under it.  He stared at the blackboard, and kept staring until he heard a high pitch sound, and got a sudden jump out of it.  He got up and walked to the door.  He looked at the tall, old woman in a red dress, with hilighted light blonde hair and thick glasses.  He handed her his card, then walked out to go to his next class.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp His next few classes were all about &quot;What did you do this summer and blah blah...&quot;  Finally, at mid-day, 12o'clock, Rix had gone to lunch.  At the time he had assigned tables to him, and his class.  He looked around the classroom to find Kyle, and Andres.  Both being his friends for years.  He got up and left to their tables.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Yo', what's up guys?&quot;  Rix said as he stuck his head inbetween theirs.  They turned to him and looked excited.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Rix!  Hey man, I didn't think you'd have lunch with us!&quot;  said kyle.  &quot;Man, i thought they put you in the 'smarter' classes.&quot;  He said with a surprised look on his face.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Nah', I ain't as smart as you think I am.  Just because I did my homework, and passed my tests with like 80's doesn't mean I should be in honors, dude.&quot;  Said Rix as he made space for himself to sit down.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Hey, I heard that Lucy is sitting on our table this year, 'also heard that someone named KYLE was going out with her.&quot;  Said Andres as he teased Kyle.  They laughed, and saw a short, baby-faced kid walking down with a lunch tray.  He was followed by a tall, chubby, spikey haired kid who had on black clothes and a small chain hanging down from his side pocket to his back pocket.  They sat accross of Kyle, Andres, and Rix.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Oh my god, Rix grew an inch!&quot;  Said Adric, with a funny looking grimace on his face.  He lifted his hand and dragged it up his hair as so to fix it, making sure it was still spiked.  The short one, Michael, laughed at Adric's remarks towards Rix, and Rix took his hand and started poking at Adric's hair.  The small group of five seniors at a Junior high school seemed to be having fun on the first day to come back to learning.  A few periods passed by after lunch, and it was the last period of the day.  Art class, the class Rix had actually enjoyed more than any other.  This year, there was an unusuall seating arrangement.  He had been put next to a cute chinese girl, with small thin glasses, and had a great smile which showed white teeth every time.  A punk girl, who had wore her hair back into a ponytail colored blue, and a dark skinned boy, older than he should be.  Rix wore the same type of clothes as the boy across him wore, baggy pants and a baggy T-shirt with a long-sleve shirt under it.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp They both slouched over on their chairs, and put their legs out of under the desk.  Rix examined the three thoroughly and looked over at the teacher.  The teacher, ever since day one she had been crazy, but fun.  Sometimes would lose her temper for no reason, even if anyone had not been talking and doing all work which was to be done she would scream out of will.  The kids all seemed to like her, and be happy to be in her class.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Welcome back everyone, can anyone tell me what we're gunna do this year?!&quot;  She blurted out, and gave everyone a sudden rush of energy.  People started calling out and talking constantly, and she smiled at the class.  &quot;Well, looks like i've got the same kids as last year, hah!...  You're all my little slaves again.  Anyway, let's get to work.  You all know the routine, get your pencils out and do whatever the hell you want.  I'll be taking attendance.  Remember, if I call your name out you say 'Yea' or whatever you want to...&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rix reached down for his bookbag, and opened the back zip.  He reached in and felt around for a pencil.  He took a mechanical led pencil out and layed it on the table.  The chinese girl got up, and walked to the teacher's desk.  She took a few pieces of paper and brought them back to our table.  She put them in the middle of the large desk, so the four could reach for it when they needed. Rix took one, placed it in front of him and raised his pencil.  Then he froze and just stared at it.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Rix!!&quot;  Shouted the teacher.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Stokolosa!!&quot;  Shouted Rix back.  He laughed, and looked up from his paper.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Joanne!!&quot;  Again, shouted the teacher.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Miss!&quot;  Said the chinese girl, looking at the teacher sitting on her desk.  She turned her head and looked over at Rix, then back at her paper.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Antonella!!&quot;  She shouted again, as she stood up and started walking around the room.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Over here miss!&quot;  Shouted the girl next to Rix, as she drew doodles on her paper.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Jason!?  You're still here!?&quot;  Said the teacher with a surprised look on her face.  She walked over to him and gave him a tap on the head.  &quot;You should be in highschool young man, you better pass your classes this year or else.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Whateva' miss, I'll pass.&quot;  Said the boy accross Antonella.  Rix looked at him, then back down at his paper.  It was still blank.  The teacher walked away to the next table to take attendance there.  Rix looked up in front of him, and Joanne gave a light smile.  Rix smiled back as everything went black.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Only four months left of school...&quot;  Said Rix, while walking down the hallway with Joanne.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Yea, you should really get your act together.&quot; said Joanne.  &quot;You DO want to get into highschool don't you?&quot;  She continued.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Yea, but it's been hard.  I still need to finish a twelve page essay on the 'Life Functions' and my english teacher says that I may fail his class because of homeworks and absences.&quot;  Said Rix.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;You've been absent for almost a month Rix, how do you expect to pass without doing tons of work?  You need to start coming to school more, and you need to ask your teachers for more work to give you atleast a sixty-five...&quot;  Said Joanne as she started walking a bit quicker to get to her class.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;It's not as easy as it sounds you know... But even if I do pass, the school i'll get into--&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;The school you get into will atleast get you a highschool diploma, won't it?&quot; Interrupted Joanne while reaching for the door to her class.  &quot;I'll talk to you at the end of the day, ask your teachers for extra work and make sure you pass.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;But...&quot;  Rix stood there for a second to watch her enter her class, then walked off to his class.  He opened the door, and saw everyone staring at him.  He was late to his class.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Late again Rix... Speak to me after class.&quot;  Said his english teacher.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Ok.&quot;  said Rix.  He sat down, and everything faded to black again.  The end of the year, everyone was in the auditorium waiting to receive their report cards, and school acceptances.  Rix was sitting close to the middle of the large stadium like room.  He saw a teacher with a box coming by his row.  She layed the box down, and took out files which she began to read.  She began calling out names.  Rix waited for his name to be called.  He hoped to pass to reach highschool, and to be accepted to one school of his choice.  Finally after twenty minutes of waiting he heard his name.  He got up, reached for the folder and sat back down.  He looked at it for a minute, hoping he would be happy with his outcome.  He opened up the folder, and smiled.  He had passed with a sixty-seven.  He took the piece of paper with his grades on it, and put it behind the rest of the papers that were in the folder.  He took read the results of his highschools.  No school had accepted him.  He would have to go to his zoned school, Franklin K. Lane.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He didn't seem to care for the non-acceptance letter, but was proud that he atleast passed.  He got up, and walked out of the audotorium.  He walked outside and saw his mother in a different car than she usually drived.  This one was cleaner, and looked new.  She got out, and jumped with exitement.  Rix started walking towards her.  He gave her a hug, and then stared at the new BMW.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Whoa, what're you doing?  Why'd you get something like this?  Isn't it too expensive; how're you going to pay for it?&quot;  Asked Rix in a nervous voice.  He had forgotten of his passing, and now had the car in his mind.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Steve, my boyfriend, he payed for it.  He bought me it!  Isn't that great!?  Come on let's go, this thing rocks.&quot;  She shouted with glee.  Rix remembered his folder, and opened it.  He took out his grade and showed it to his mother.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;What the hell is this?  I thought you said you were going to do better this year!?  Come on, Rix, I can't be worried about you doing good in school all the time.  I have a life, you know?.  Please, stop dissapointing me.  You're ruining my moment of joy with my NEW CAR.&quot;  Screamed Rix's mom, as if she was scolding him.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Atleast I passed, I mean I get to go to highschool don't I?  Don't bitch at me, you know yourself that with a highschool diploma I can get a job and have an independent life of my own.  So be proud for me, like I am for myself!&quot;  He responded.  He sat there, staring at his grades.  &quot;Mami, I want to move to my dad's house... I don't want to go to Lane. That's where Denis went... and...&quot; He went on, in a soft voice.  His mother kept quiet, not looking at Rix.  She just stared at the road, with a cold look on her face.  There was silence for a minute.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Fine, we'll say you live with your father,&quot; She said &quot;but you're staying with me.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Ok...&quot; Said Rix.  He lay his head back, and moved the seat back.  He closed his eyes, and the thoughts faded white.  It's summer, and the sun's burning everyone up.  There's people out in pools, people playing with water all over.  It's close to the end of the second month.  Rix is outside, sitting on his stoop while waiting for his friends to come over.  He goes upstairs to grab a bottled iced tea, then back down to see Adric walking down the sidewalk to his apartment.  Rix gets up and gives a big, clownish smile.  He ran over to him and walked along with him.  &quot;Let's go to kyles'.&quot; He said, as they walked down a block to reach Kyle's house.  They stood there for a second staring at it.  He was the lucky one, had a big house and everything in it.  A pool table, big screen TV, four computers, and too much entertainment.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rix rang the doorbell, then put his ear on the door to hear footsteps walking down the door.  After a minute kyle got to the door, then stared out of the windows on it.  &quot;Come on, come outside!!&quot; Shouted Rix while sipping on his drink.  &quot;We're going to 113, Lucy's going to be there!&quot; He said while trying to get him to come out.  &quot;Come on, quit playing your games on your computer and stuff and come outside!&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rixiusbloodiner>Rixius Bloodiner</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pre-Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(11/24/03 4:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1081.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> forgot how to edit</span><hr size=1> :forgot how to edit:  Anyway, i wanted to know what people do if they felt like quitting school, or having to do something really bad to someone else if they didn't.<br>
