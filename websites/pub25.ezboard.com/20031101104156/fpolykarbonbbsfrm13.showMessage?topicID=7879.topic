person but we scratched that idea, so i just drew her in plainclothes.

im not afraid to try anything you suggest on that pic since i don't like it very much, so if you think shadows, more realistic clothes folds(i read the tutorial but its still hards), a more ineteresting face/hair, more interesting clothes would help, tell me and i'll try. but mainly i really need to know if anyhting is anatomically incorrect. you can see in my &quot;stages&quot; pic i DID fix up some stuff like a super elongated neck and torso <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=pravit>pravit</A> at: 7/25/03 2:27 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kittykelby@polykarbonbbs>KittyKelby</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(7/25/03 5:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7879.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: chara studies attempts</span><hr size=1> Well, first of all, kudos for taking all the suggestions and comments on your previous post in stride.  You took an awful lot of constructive criticism and decided to work with it.  Good for you!<br>
Now about character studies...I like the way you kept scans of the process.  It not only allows the critics to take a look and see your effort, but I would think that it would benefit you by allowing you to see where you need to make improvements along the entire creation process.  You did a good job catching your own areas in need of improvement, and I can see your style continuing to develop.  Taking her apart piece by piece, hopefully a few more crits will help you out even more.  <br>
Her ears and hairline could come forward some more, and her ears are a little small.  Also, she has a pretty good sized chin and a little mouth.  I think you are trying to show how her head is turned with the lines under her chin, but they are too straight.  Have someone turn their head for you and see how the skin really stretches.  Her should slops a bit too much, and her arms and legs are very skinny.  As far as her legs go, it is clear the way you intend them to be crossed, but I think you need to work on it some more.  Her legs look like they're crossed too far.  It's just not normal!  I don't have a picture right in front of me, but I think if she were to stand that way, one leg should stay pretty straight and the other bend around it, instead of both kind of wrapping around each other.  You complain that your drawing is boring...well, that's not a very exciting pose you've put her in.  Try giving her something a bit more exciting, and that in itself will spice up your picture.  And there isn't anything wrong with plain street clothes, but hers are pretty tight...as a female of the species, yes, I enjoy looking good, but comfort is a huge priority!  Try making her clothes a little looser, but not necessarily baggy.  Oh, and one more thing...her hair.  It's nice and simple, but try giving it a little more volume instead of just stuck to her head.  Also, look at how nice the ponytail is with so few lines, then all the lines you have on the main portion of the hair on her scalp...I think &quot;less is more&quot; may be a fitting discription of what can help there.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
You've got a good start, just keep at it!  I will be watching for more of your work! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=infiltrator@polykarbonbbs>Infiltrator</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://images.deviantart.com/deviants/fallenangel77.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(7/25/03 6:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7879.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: chara studies attempts</span><hr size=1> Well, KittyKelby pretty much covered it. The crossed legs are the only thing that really kill the image (well, that and the size of her head) in my opinion. Everything else is minor. I say start basic...draw the easiest, most boring standing pose imaginable to help you get the concepts down, then work on changing the body position around. Before trying to draw a complex pose, put yourself in the pose to see if it works. It's okay to exaggerate but a pose must still look somewhat natural. <p>As you make a living, don't forget to live.<br>

So I just want to say Hurrah ! For you and offer some encouragement. I think that you are going to be really something in a couple of months if you keep trying to improve and get down some of the basic rules. <br>
<br>
I agree with infiltrator start small and build from that. What I did when I was trying to get my anatomy to improve was I worked on doing just pics of characters from the neck up. Worked on drawing faces till I could do it nicely. Then I focused on drawing basic poses. Then more complicated poses and finally movement and perspective. ( still working on that)<br>
<br>
So good job ! Keep it up ! I want to see more from you! <p>I live on a virtual island where it doesn't snow but ever so often it does get battered by an occaisional hurricane in the form of a exam/test. ^__^ <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.tempestrush.tk">Full of Piratey Goodness</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=pravit>pravit</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(7/26/03 10:56 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7879.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: chara studies attempts</span><hr size=1> thanks for pointing everything out - that is EXACTLY what I needed to hear so I can make those minor adjustments, etc. but I will now pay more attention on making appendages a bit thicker.

I think it will be interesting if you guys can continue to critique this and maybe I can turn it into something good bit by bit. <br>
<br>
i agree that the crossed legs look weird, i tried standing in the mirror like that while drawing it but i couldn't really capture it(well, my legs aren't that slender and i wasn't wearing skintight jeans). the feet also make it look strange, but i was confused about where to put them. So I've just changed her legs to be pointing straight(for now). As for her butt, I think the line is too pronounced but I'm not sure how to reduce it while still showing that well, shes in good shape <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
As for her clothes being tight it's because I just decided to draw some clothes on quickly to her body so I could change them later when we figured out what she was supposed to be. For fun I decided to change her clothes to more of a &quot;black ops&quot; character - hopefully that will make her a little less boring. <br>
<br>
PK warned in his tutorial not to post images of plain standing people and to try to pose them, so I tried to pose her but right now I will start on a plain standing guy. <br>
<br>
chin and mouth - i have to admit drawing cartoon faces is one of my weaker areas, so i usualy draw a little line for a mouth and a little wedge for a nose. i may try what sniggle said and just draw faces for a while. i am more used to drawing guy heads/faces so she had pretty boring features. Do you think her head should be smaller overall? I may just have to give her a skull reconstruction <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

this is how far i've gotten with the girl:<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.freewebs.com/projecthax/israelgirl4.jpg">www.freewebs.com/projecth...lgirl4.jpg</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
she was initially supposed to be some kind of SOCOM soldier, but with the guns and the black hair she really reminded me of those israeli women soldiers. so I slapped a quick israeli insignia on her <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->      i even experimented with giving her wavy hair, but it didn't turn out very good. as you suggested i increased the thickness of her arms and legs, reduced her head size, loosened up her clothes a bit. Perhaps later on I'll give her a Galil or Uzi instead so she can be an IMI baby <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
although HKs are so cute and perfect for women. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  oh wait! oo000o0oo! I was looking at IMI stuff and I saw a &quot;Micro-Galil&quot; that would be just perfect for her! When I'm done with her I'll go through a Jewish baby name book and pick out a nice one <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
I think now I need to darken and sharpen her. I'm aware the strap on the HK is incorrect but I'll leave it like that, or else it wouldn't hang straight on her back. <br>
<br>
There wasn't really much steps to post, but you can see the &quot;1st&quot; step here if youd like, before I fixed her behind and made her an Israeli:<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.freewebs.com/projecthax/boringgirlv2.jpg">www.freewebs.com/projecth...girlv2.jpg</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
you also suggested I draw a standing man, well here he is so far, although he looks rather boring. hes a russian spetsnaz soldier(the weird cap thing he has is actually a handkerchief tied around his head). I had problems drawing his boots because I wasn't sure how his pants should tuck in. <br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.freewebs.com/projecthax/standingman.jpg">www.freewebs.com/projecth...ingman.jpg</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
i liked him so much i drew him in an action pose(yes, i'm aware he's using a PPSh-41 and an SVD at the same time. Maybe he just enjoys both antique and modern guns <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     )<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.freewebs.com/projecthax/russiansensation.jpg">www.freewebs.com/projecth...sation.jpg</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
maybe he will pop in later in the comic, or i'll have him handy if we ever do a &quot;Stalingrad&quot; manga(which is a pretty cool idea actually....)<br>
<br>
hmm...i should have really started this thread in the &quot;art in progress&quot; section. oh well...<br>
