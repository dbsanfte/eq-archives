Windgirl sounds good for speed so silver bullets would be good.<br>
BTW, there are more than 4 elements. NE1 played final fantasy?<br>
We have earth, fire, water, wind, spirit, holy, darkness, light, ice, lightning, crystal, metal, wood (ancient jap element cycle - wood-earth-water-fire-metal).<br>
So we have space for at least 9 extra characters, with more space if we make them a mixture of elements (like metal and fire - lobs balls of molten metal at people! or ice and wind - can create blizzards. Understated fact - a blizzard is not just an ice move, you need a fair bit of wind in there for propulsion)<br>
There has been a theory that vampirism is a disease that kills haemoglobin and plasma production, and also stops production of the enzyme that protects our skin from uv rays (which would explain the photosensitivity). It would also make half-vamps not likely, but it is possible for the carrier to control the disease. Downside is they're still mortal and die from anything.<br>
Anyway, silver bullets aren't easy.  Don't forget the vampire's thralls and undead minions (zombies and skeletons - vampires are usually hugely powerful necromancers).  the problem with zombies is that only fire or complete dismemberment and mincing can stop a controlled zombie, 'cos it doesn't need its head.<br>
Shotguns can also be used to kill vampires if pieces of wood are in the shell or the barrel when it is fired. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=windblade>windblade</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(2/28/02 5:45:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=494.topic&index=43>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hitting vampires</span><hr size=1> once again.<br>
silver things are for werewolves. most of the time, lycanthropes are the enemies of vampires.<br>
you can use holy things against vampires. most crosses (or other religion's holy symbols, though a brass buddha statue would look kind of weird) would be considered holy. vampires are VERY sensible to fire. you CAN shoot down a vampire, but it will not always kill him. it would be a good idea to keep it simple: sunlight, fire, wooden stakes and holy stuff.<br>
<br>
if you want ways of destroying a vampire: knock on his door at about noon and shoot him, or get a very strong guy to carry the vampire in direct sunlight. you can also set fire to his house (fun!) or get the very strong guy to carry the vampire into a church (wheee!). wooden things could be shot by a crossbow (I wouldn't recommend anyone close-combat with a vampy, unless you are a very strong guy)<br>
<br>
all my informations come from vampire: the table rpg game, and from my DM. he played as a vampire who could ghoulify living creatures. he used a cat to make a walking bomb (of course, he also had a lot of c4). <br>
step one: ghoulify dead cat<br>
step two: stuff with c4<br>
step three: send cat across town to find enemy to bomb<br>
step four: wait for enemy<br>
step five: detonate cat <p>baby orang-utans look like surprised coconuts! -Terry Pratchett</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/unemesis800.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nemesis800</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pre-Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(2/28/02 5:56:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=494.topic&index=44>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.dsdesigns.org/images/nemesiszeropic.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hitting vampires</span><hr size=1> Ummm...I'm sorry to bust anyone bubble, but the only real way to kill a vampire is by killing off its head or striking with one mortal wound (ex: cutting the body in two)....the whole myth with crosses, garlic and stakes can with most of the hollywood scene rewritten books on Dracula. <br>

First coupla pages - the creation of the slayer type people. Plenty of opportunity to get techno stuff as well as priests blessing them etc. Loads of techno - plasma stuff, nanobots, genetic modification (like with the needle going into the cell etc)<br>
Next coupla pages - 17 years later. Main character (probably earth) gets up, goes to school etc. For some reason (insert reason here) gets exposed to UV light, sees that there is a mark on his hand (a sword, but blade down with Jesus on like a crucifix). Looks it up. Jump to the lab - computer is showing that the mark is being researched. Scientists e-mail Earth anonymously, inform that he's actually a vampire slayer. Or you could get him getting a tape, he listens to it on his walkman but it pumps the knowledge into his head, one or the other.<br>
Next few pages roughly the same for the other characters, except that if Fire's gonna be that hot-headed he probably would have dropped out of school before A-levels or something, and have a crap job. Each finds out about the closest 3 others from the original 100, discover that they're all in the same town, some sentimental meeting crap etc and we're done for an intro.<br>
PS yeah, you can kill a vampire any way you want, but it's very slow and they heal very quickly if they drink someone. Also, holding one under running water e.g. river is bad for them and they die quite quickly (though not as fast as just slicing their head off) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uagentcryrid.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Agent Cryrid</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(3/3/02 8:59:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=494.topic&index=52>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: OK then</span><hr size=1> if the Earth guy is in school, maybe his science class is doing something with uv lights, so that could be a pretty good reason. <p>I'd rather be judged by 12

I was thinking we could have instead of an e-mail or a tape he has part of his brain partitioned and it unlocks when he sees the mark but only after his 17th birthday. Also to prevent embarrasing falling over and clutching head in school (gets you laughed at - not good if u'r a migraine sufferer *points at self*) it could happen at that night when he is sleeping.  The same could happen with the others, but I have an idea - we could make Fire a junior police officer, so the first time we see him he's shooting a target or something, and not being very good because wind would be the gun-style person. I have an idea of her kinda crouching supporting herself with one hand like she's just dived away from something and tracing fire from an uzi up some kinda huge monster. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uotakufool.showPublicProfile?language=EN>otakufool</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(3/6/02 6:03:01 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=494.topic&index=54>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.irken.cjb.net/ WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Need workers for manga </span><hr size=1> yup all of that is real good but i'd say there about 16 years old...dunno why but I think it sticks better... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uohhenry18.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ohhenry18</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://persondoingstuff.homestead.com/files/chibime.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(3/6/02 1:09:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=494.topic&index=55>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Need workers for manga</span><hr size=1> this sounds pretty sweet,<br>
