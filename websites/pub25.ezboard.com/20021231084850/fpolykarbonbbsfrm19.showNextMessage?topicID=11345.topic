(Zen Koans if I remember the name correctly, for the curious). I could sit all day and just ponder some of the more cryptic ones.<br>
<br>
Well, I decided to see the PK community reactions to one of my favorite stories. The PK crew seems to pretty open-minded, and it's fun to make people think a little. Just keep in mind I'm not trying to change anybody's mind about anything, and I'm not going to. If you think these things are silly, that's just fine with. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
If there's enough interest, maybe I can post a Koan a week or so or something along that lines for discussion. Or if people seem offended or just don't like the idea, then I'll of course just it die down.<br>
<br>
So anyway, without further interruption, the story:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>There was once a stone cutter who was dissatisfied with himself and with his position in life. <br>
<br>
One day he passed a wealthy merchant's house. Through the open gateway, he saw many fine possessions and important visitors. &quot;How powerful that merchant must be!&quot; thought the stone cutter. He became very envious and wished that he could be like the merchant. <br>
<br>
To his great surprise, he suddenly became the merchant, enjoying more luxuries and power than he had ever imagined, but envied and detested by those less wealthy than himself. Soon a high official passed by, carried in a sedan chair, accompanied by attendants and escorted by soldiers beating gongs. Everyone, no matter how wealthy, had to bow low before the procession. &quot;How powerful that official is!&quot; he thought. &quot;I wish that I could be a high official!&quot; <br>
<br>
Then he became the high official, carried everywhere in his embroidered sedan chair, feared and hated by the people all around. It was a hot summer day, so the official felt very uncomfortable in the sticky sedan chair. He looked up at the sun. It shone proudly in the sky, unaffected by his presence. &quot;How powerful the sun is!&quot; he thought. &quot;I wish that I could be the sun!&quot; <br>
<br>
Then he became the sun, shining fiercely down on everyone, scorching the fields, cursed by the farmers and laborers. But a huge black cloud moved between him and the earth, so that his light could no longer shine on everything below. &quot;How powerful that storm cloud is!&quot; he thought. &quot;I wish that I could be a cloud!&quot; <br>
<br>
Then he became the cloud, flooding the fields and villages, shouted at by everyone. But soon he found that he was being pushed away by some great force, and realized that it was the wind. &quot;How powerful it is!&quot; he thought. &quot;I wish that I could be the wind!&quot; <br>
<br>
Then he became the wind, blowing tiles off the roofs of houses, uprooting trees, feared and hated by all below him. But after a while, he ran up against something that would not move, no matter how forcefully he blew against it - a huge, towering rock. &quot;How powerful that rock is!&quot; he thought. &quot;I wish that I could be a rock!&quot; <br>
<br>
Then he became the rock, more powerful than anything else on earth. But as he stood there, he heard the sound of a hammer pounding a chisel into the hard surface, and felt himself being changed. &quot;What could be more powerful than I, the rock?&quot; he thought. <br>
<br>
He looked down and saw far below him the figure of a stone cutter.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

So, there it is.<br>
Discuss <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
<br>
(And post up any feedback of course!)<br>
(Note: I'll post my take on it a little later. I'd rather people really think about it than read my take and possibly go 'yeah, that sounds good' and defeat the purpose of this. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>

As for more stories and proverbs, I've plenty. I've stacked up a pretty decent collection. But would it be better to post a new thread every few days or when this ones dies down to avoid clutter here, or post them here every few days to avoid potential thread spam?<br>

I agree, it's essentially the 'grass is always greener on the other side' idea. People tend to lose perspective, so involved in what they do in their lives that they over-think the negatives, and put what they don't feel they can achieve on a pedestal... because it's common behaviour for many of us to feel like we have it worse than everyone else...<br>
<br>
