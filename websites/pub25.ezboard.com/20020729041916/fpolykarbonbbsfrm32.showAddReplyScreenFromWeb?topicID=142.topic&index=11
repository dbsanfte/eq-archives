er, there is a legal drinking age though isn't there? which would tend to indicate that drinking does have risks. <br>
<br>
i understand the problem with blaming the video games and i think that it's silly to blame the companies that make them for every stupid thing that someone does, supposedly because they were influenced by the game. <br>
<br>
on the flip side, i think there are times when people who design games (also those who make movies, etc) really need to think about what kind of message they are sending to people with their game (or movie or whatever). they can't and shouldn't be responsible for how people respond to what they present. however, they should be responsible (to a certain degree) in how they present the story. just randomly killing people is not the best kind of alternate reality to present young people with. <br>
<br>

There are age limits to movies and video games as well. If you were just randomly killing people, it would not be in a rating for children. Ticket sellers and the store clerks aren't suposed to sell things to children that are out of their age range, even though this doesn't always happen. <p><table width=100% border=0>

super smash brothers is in many ways the epitome of random violence. and it's a game that's rated for children. <br>
now, i will admit it's not graphic, but i don't think you can say that it has no effect on kids who play it. this doesn't mean they will go to their school and start beating everyone on the playground, but violence portrayed in any manner always has some effect on those who watch it or play a game with it. <br>
ever notice how little kids get more aggressive after watching loony tunes? it doesn't last but there is an effect. <br>
i don't think that we should put warning labels on games like super smash brothers but perhaps more people should be aware that (particularly with young children) what we watch and play does have an effect on us, and not always for the better. <br>
so, that's my two cents. <br>

I can, and do.<br>
<br>
First of all, you said KILLING in the first part, now you're saying fighting. That's not the same thing. Sure, it's still violence, but it's not lifelike, and unless kids have all of a sudden developed the abilities to jump several stories into the air and can toss bombs and projectiles at each other, it's kind of hard to emulate what's going on. I'm sure there are a few morons that will try to copy what they see, but I believe that's the exception to the rule.<br>
<br>
I grew up on violent movies and games and I wasn't violent. I never got into fights, because real life is not a movie, real life is not a game. <br>
<br>
Go ahead, put warning labels on games, I don't see a problem with that. I just don't see why everyone believes that games are going to affect people so incredibly that they'll do some of these crazy things. It's just an easy answer. There is probably not just ONE thing that makes people one way. Have you ever considered that it isn't the violent games that make kids violent? Maybe their violent tendencies make violent television or games more appealing to them? <br>
<br>
And let's not pretend that violence is some kind of new problem that just sprang up out of nowhere. Kids were still fighting and hitting each other way before video games or television.<br>
<br>
Besides, this has very little to do with this guy. He wasn't a little kid, he was an adult living on his own. It wasn't the game that made him the way he was. If he was so alone and depressed and he had no Everquest, he would have found something else to obsess himself with.<br>
<br>
I don't get these arguments anyway. People should stop making games or movies because some kid MIGHT get their hands on it and MIGHT try to emulate something from it? Instead of trying to eliminate the violent movies and games, why not just make it more difficult for it to get into the hands of children? Because I don't like having to live in a child's world. <p><table width=100% border=0>

<br>
that said, i do think you are misinterpreting what i was trying to say. <br>
i know that kids have violent tendencies that are just part of human nature. i am not trying to say that video games turn every kid into a rabid killer, that's hardly the case. all i'm saying is that people who say that video games and movies that depict scenes of violence have no effect on those who play and watch them are deluding themselves. <br>
human nature becomes desensitized to anything they see repeatedly. there were widespread reports in the aftermath of Sept. 11 that children were telling their teachers that they simply couldn't be upset by the collapse of the Twin Towers. it reminded them too much of scenes they had seen in movies like Independence Day for them to be able to grasp what had really happened. <br>
we respond to the environment around us and as violence in games, movies and TV becomes more and more acceptable as a form of entertainment we become less sensitive to it. <br>
that was what i was trying to say before, not that violent games spark the same kind of violence, but they slowly create a spirit of indifference. again, that indifference is nearly imperceptable in most people but it is still there. <br>
<br>
*whew* well, i hope that cleared things up, although i may have just muddied the waters. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
oh, and i realize the guy who was the initial focus of this discussion was an adult. it just seemed that the posts that followed were making the argument that games don't affect anyone. i think that children/young people are actually more susceptible because they don't have &quot;real world&quot; experience that most adults do. <br>

Like I said, I grew up on horror movies, action movies, games etc. and explosions were everywhere. But that does NOT mean that I can't tell the difference between reality and fantasy. When you see a building crash in a movie, it's WAY different than in real life, and I, for one, can tell the difference. I'm sure there are many others here who grew up on the same type of movies (at least action movies) and were still affected by the real life destruction.<br>
<br>
If there are kids that can't tell the difference, that's really sad, but I don't think it's ONLY the fault of what they've been watching. There are going to be multiple factors influencing that attitude. <p><table width=100% border=0>

<br>
As for kids, all media is full of literature not suited for everyone--literature, movies, you name it.  Why should video games be restricted more heavilly?  It is a form of media after all.  Sure, it should be kept away from kids without proper guidance if it contains certain material just like movies are.  That's been done with the ratings.  The rest is up to people to actually check the ratings before they let their kids play.  I remember I wasn't allowed to play Mortal Kombat and other violent games when I was younger :P  My mom didn't need a sticker, she just took a hint that mangling bodies wasn't wholesome entertainment for a child.  Imagine that.  And it didn't keep me from being any more messed up if you ask me.  Some people are just going to be messed up. <p><a href="http://magitek.nu/moonpie" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.tbns.net/sistaninja/turkbanner2.jpg" border="0"></a>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Sometimes it's tough to say whether a movie or a videogame convinced anyone to kill.  History has shown us that before EverQuest' of course' suicide didn't exist.  However' the victim in this case was diagnosed with depression and schizophrenic personality disorder.  That might have had something to do with it' but keep in mind I am not a trained psychologist.  If someone you know dies' you don't get to file a lawsuit just because they had a crappy hobby.  If that was the case' Matlock and National Geographic owe me five million dollars for a dead grandpa.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

people are suing for everything now<br>
theres a case where someone is sewing MCDonalds because they spilled a plastic cup of coffee and the cup didnt have a label on it saying: &quot; WARNING: HOT&quot;<br>
they might make a few million dollars too.... yuck, soon we are gonna have warning labels on our foreheads.<br>

May Cause Injury.&quot;<br>
there's been dozens of cases where people have sued over stuff like that. lawn mowers tend to have stickers on them that warn they shouldn't be used as hedge trimmers 'cause some guy picked one up by the sides thinking he'd trim the bushes with it and chopped his fingers off. <br>
those cases are a little different than the video game thing though. yeah the guy was being an idiot to pick up the lawn mower but some people simply don't think of things like that. <br>
this guy who commited suicide was obviously already disturbed. i don't think the game had any direct influence on his decision to kill himself and i don't think that games should have warning labels on them (aside from the already existing age ratings.) as i mentioned earlier i don't think games or movies make people go out and kill other people, but i think they do have some affect on us. that's what always bugs me is that some crazy goes and shoots himself in the head after spending three weeks playing some game and half the people say &quot;oh, the game made him do it&quot; and the other half say &quot;games don't affect anyone like that.&quot; neither one is true. <br>
anyway, i'm ranting again. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
