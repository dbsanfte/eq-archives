Id like it to be a series probably, but not necessarily an incredibly long one. I figured you could could come up with charcters and i would draw them as you describe them, names dont matter much, as long as they arent really long and ridiculous and they sumwhat suit the characters. early 20's and teens is good, make the hero 20 and his hot <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  sidekick should be about 18. Make the villain cool and have him wield some kinda powerful magic...<br>
its easy for me to think up all that, its the motives and the world and all the adventures and stuff that i have trouble with. but in the end i just want the story to be suited to be made into a comic. =D thx again! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/umylak.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mylak</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(10/15/01 1:29:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=352.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://mylakovich.homestead.com/files/pics/ngpclance.gif height=66 width=75></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> okay</span><hr size=1> okay, make the main hero kid be a moderatly succesful student at a big university in one of the more metropolin cities. He could be a player of sports, specifically fighting sports like fencing, archery, martial arts and wrestling.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile a high ranking council member of one of the surrounding nations is trying to unify all the city states under his rule. He believes he has the right to lead because he has just unearthed some ancient black magic. he pobtains many reagons, but the fighting university refuses to give in to his prestige and money. The evil council member becomes angry, and decides to take it by force. The school fights back, but it is a hopeless battle, because of the armies of the council and their new magic powers. So the schools oldest relic is entrusted to the main hero kid and he is sent to flee the besieged university. The only way out are the hawk riders, people who are trained to ride big giant birds, and the dean of the school and important people escape, along with the main character.<br>
<br>
The girl sidekick is the hawk rider that he gets away on. During the escape, they get seperated from the rest of the people and get lost. when the kid finds out that the relic he is entrusted with has magic powers, he sets out to fight back against the evil council guy.<br>
<br>
How about that? You can change anything or add to it if you want. just base the characters on that. The main character kid wears shorts and maybe a shoulder pad, the girl can wear a hawk rider uniform of brushed fur lined leather, and the evil guy wears a big purple and dark blue cape and helmet, and has spikey shoulder pads and gauntlets.<br>
<br>
Is that a helpful start? <p><BR>

<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In this world (which hasn't got a name yet) there are 4 continents.  Each of these continents responds to one of the four elements: wind, water, fire, earth.  There are normal landscapes and habitats on each continent but each one is most greatly influenced by their cooresponding element.  And, each of the four races living on these continents is born with elemental attributes.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The water continent is a large group of tropical islands and lagoons that cluster around a larger land mass.  The native people here are blue-haired and generally slender people, good at swimming.  They live in harmony with their surroundings and especially with the ocean and it's creatures.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The wind continent is connected to the water continent in the same way Europe is connected to Asia.  They are seperated by a long, snowy mountain range (water plus wind-ice, get it?) which gives way to a beutiful green land, with forrests and feilds.  The people here are normal, they live under a good king and settle in towns and small cities.  Natives are born with green or blonde hair, but the place is diverse enough with people from other continents that not everyone looks similar.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The fire continent is a technological place.  The entire continent is like one huge city.  There is barely a speck of land that isn't covered by human expanse.  The natives here have (you guessed it) firey red hair, but there are very few purely native people.  There have been so many immigrants for so many years that only the rich nobles who have arranged mariges have the rich red locks.  This place is supposed to be democratic, but the noble class run everything.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The earth continent is a barren place.  It is covered in perilous mountains and deserts.  There are no civilizations here and only outlaws who can't remain anywhere else even try to live there.  There is a legend that this place was once lush with vegitation and bueaty, but for some unknown reason allthat disapeared along with the inhabitants.<br>
<br>
There are two forms of technology and warfare that are used in the world--magic powered and steam powered.  Magical weapons and vehicles are made from ancient artifacts.  They are sleek and organic looking.  They are extremely rare, but very powerful, and so they are sought after by treasure hunters.  On the opposite side of the arms buisness are mass-produced steam powered engines.  These are large and clunky and not very dangerous, but their technology is based on science and not willpower and they are cheap.  So, they are the more widely used.  <br>
<br>
A young man and his beutiful (in his words it was &quot;hot&quot; lol) lady side-kick are traveling all over the Wind continent looking for work.  Josoa (names subject to change) trained since he was a child too be a knight.  When he turned 19 he was accepted to the order under the good king (who has no name yet).  But, shortly after he joined, the entire order was shamed and dismantled.  They were replaced by much more reliable, technological gaurds.  So now 2 years later, he's had to go into another line of work, and wouldn't you know treasure hunting looked like a pretty good deal.  He's got brown hair and eyes which is unheard of in this world.  Though this should be a subtle plot point, it suggests his anscestors were of the legendary earth continent.  He is skilled with his sword and shield, being an ex-knight.  Miho, his female accomplis, is a knife-weilding sorceress with a head full of spunky red hair.  She ran away from her noble family on the fire continent right before her pre-arranged marrige and met up with Josoa.    <br>
<br>
<br>
You can use it or just some elements of it or if you don;t want it at all I'll give it to some other needy writer ^_^ <p><a href="http://geocities.com/member_ring" target="_blank"><img src="http://celes99.homestead.com/Files/mrbutn2.jpg"></a>

The different races and setting is cool, and each has its own distinctive style.<br>
<br>
heres kind of a merged version:<br>
<br>
The josoa character is exactly the same, but after wandering looking for work, he finally ends up on a red continent border town in a forrested mountain. There he stays with a kindly elderly couple and trains under the man in the villiges practice hall. Some time later he meets a traveling banc of recruiters who represent a big fighting university in the red kingdom, and the offer his to attend. He is unsure, but theu sign him on amid doubts that he may never see his adoptive parents again. He goes to the university and though he enjoys improving his fighting style, he has little friends amoung the snobbish noble kids.<br>
<br>
Then the evil council member attacks, and during the escape he meets miho, and other stuff like that. The fighting rune he posesses could be one of those rare magic tools. I like the concept of steam powered weapons, it conjures up images of armored steam-knights who have mechanical extending swords and swiveling shield plates and chain driven gauntlet drivers and wierd stuff like that.<br>
<br>
heck, i might draw a little of this, its sounding better and better. <p><BR>

The elements thing is overworked on purpose because there are so many stories that use the cliche old four elements thing, I thought it'd be cool to go all out with it.  Actually this whole thing sounds like one of the older Final Fantasy's twisted on a stick with Battle Chasers or something of the like.  You could keep the two main characters, but then add some secondary people along the way.  Maybe some more villains and some villianous underlings for the main dude. <p><a href="http://geocities.com/member_ring" target="_blank"><img src="http://celes99.homestead.com/Files/mrbutn2.jpg"></a>
