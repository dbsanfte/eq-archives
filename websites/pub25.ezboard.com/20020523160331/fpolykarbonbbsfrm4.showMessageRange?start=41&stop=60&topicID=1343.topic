Grifter - I AM a parent and I really don't think my 6 year old has the skills necessary to keep up with a subtitled version of anything. He's not easily entertained by a bunch of pretty pictures on the screen either. If he can't understand the story he loses interest and finds something else to do. I don't think it would serve any purpose to have kids reading subtitled anime ... I'd rather my kids pull themselves away from the tele and read a book ... which they are likely to gain far more from than reading anime on tv. I stand by my statement, you wouldn't get a mess of 5 yr olds to sit down and watch Pokemon and Digimon on Saturday mornings. Not all children are easily entertained or are raised in such a manner that pretty pictures are enough to entertain them.<br>

I wasn't questioning the intelligence of your kids, or any kids that watches cartoons for pretty pictures. I don't think anyone has less intelligence just because they like pretty pictures. That wasn't the point at all. The fact is, when you have a cartoon like pokemon, whose animation is far greater (in MY OPINION ONLY) than 99% of all the cartoon shows for kids out there, I think that kids will want to watch Pokemon over the rest, regardless of whether it's subtitled or not. This is something I think, only because I remember as a kid, it was the way I chose the programs that I watch. When something LOOKS COOL, I just pay attention to it. If I didn't understand something, I tell my mom to explain it to me real quick. Not everyone has a parent sitting by them, but most children shows can be summarized in a few lines, so its not hard to summarize what the characters are saying I'm sure. I think it helps children learn to read faster. Yes, I would rather have a child read a book as opposed to reading text on the screen, but the question was whether I would rather have them watch dubbing or subbing, not reading a book. The other side of the coin is that some people would rather the children learn something from what they watch, and they can't learn anything if they don't understand all of the things being said. So there really is two different ways to look at things, I'm just saying, that for me, both as a child and as a parent (not that I'm a parent yet) I would choose subtitles over dubbing.<br>

You don't have to watch it as an art form. Just that I believe it IS an art form, and when I watch it, I like seeing it the way that it was created. Just a personal preference, I'm not attacking anyone. You should know though, that many Japanese anime directors are afraid of dubbings, which is a reason that many animes aren't brought to the US. This is the same case for manga as well, but that's a different subject altogether. All I'm saying is, it IS an art form, and it's something I like to enjoy the way the creators created it to be watched.<br>

I hope my last post didn't seem like it was coming off as if I was attacking you and insulting you, because I wasn't. Your reply seems very defensive. You don't have to have the original art, all I was saying is that copies are never as good as the original. Yes, the difference could be something as small as a 0.000001%, I'm just stating that there is a difference regardless. Posters are a different subject because the intention for it is to have it blown up bigger than the original art, so in a sense, the poster IS the original art. <br>

As a final note, I just wanna emphasize again that I'm not in any way attacking you or anyone that likes dubbing. I'm merely giving my opinion as someone who enjoys subtitles more than dubbings. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
My son could care less to watch something that has simply been summed up for him, he wants to know what they are saying.  I do have movies that are subtitled and I have watched the subtitled versions of some anime.  He won't sit still for it.  To him it's just not worth it to be told what it's about and then just watch the images.  He'd rather go read a book or play with his legos.  As far as I can tell, in his mind it's empty entertainment if he cannot tell for himself what is going on every second.  He's the same way with movies with complex storylines and plots.  He's not getting as much from it and is not interested in watching.  I'm actually quite proud of the way he picks and choses his entertainment.  <br>
<br>
If a child can sit through a sub and get something out of it that's great, but if it's just empty visual entertainment I don't really think that's so great.  But then I'm one of those insane parents that won't let my children watch tv all day, play video games for hours on end, or sit on a computer all day. <br>

Being able to watch a movie with subtitles, or a movie in a language you don't understand(No subs), are both good abilities to have. Not essential. Not even important. But still good to have.<br>

Don't stress it. It's not a big deal. But being able to read subs makes you able to experience more, and get more out of some experiences. Simple as that.<br>

Point is, I don't think most people grow up on subtitles, but that doesn't mean they won't prefer them later. Your tastes mature and evolve as you get older. You don't dislike something as an adult just because you weren't accustomed to it as a child. <p><table width=100% border=0>

You do not need to be exposed to something at a young age to fully enjoy it as an adult.  It's easier to learn a second language from a very young age ... but that doesn't mean you if you don't learn it young you won't have the patience to learn it when you are older. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uchernobylblast.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Chernobylblast</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(2/6/02 6:20:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1343.topic&index=55>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.lycos.co.uk/chernobylpoiuyt2/pictures2/cherno_copycolor_copy.gif height=99, width=90></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sunglasses.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: sub vs dub</span><hr size=1> you know, im sure that when i was 6 if i saw a cartoon or a show with subtitles i wouldnt have even spoent a minute trying to watch it. but know i dont care, ill watch whatever, if i have the time(mentioned earlier). but as for Pokemon having 99% better animation than the other cartoons, and thats why kids watch them,i have to disagree. kids dont care very much about the quality of the animation, theyre not thinking about that when they watch cartoons. they are just looking for a show with a fun concept and fantstical places. so to me, if i were a kid, collecting little monsters and fighting them against other people would seem like a really fun idea, and thats why i would watch it. thats why Poke is such a big hit. not because of the animation but the story. <br>

Watching wrestling, football(Or what you strange americans call football), hockey, and\or Disney is not a skill.<br>
<br>
Reading text displayed rapidly at the bottom of a screen, while still managing to follow the moving images displayed above(And behind) the text, is a skill.<br>
<br>
No, there's no study to prove this(Although it seem VERY logical to me).<br>
<br>
Yes, you can learn it later.<br>
<br>
Yes, you can still prefer dubbing.<br>
<br>
But, as with any skill, experience counts. As someone who's been exposed to subs all my life, I read them without thinking about it. It just comes naturally. And that's just a good thing. No more, no less.<br>
<br>
I'm not trying to create an argument here, I'm just trying to make a point... and that point is that reading subs is a good thing. <br>
A lot of movies\ cartoons will never be dubbed. Dubbing costs money. Additionally there's a lot of bad dubbing which can ruin films. Imagine watching a Bellini, Bergman, or Von Trier movie with the voices from pokemon. Or a dialogue intense movie such as &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; in Albanian. <br>
I actually saw &quot;The Terminator&quot; in Polish once. One guy did all the dubbing, and in between the dialogue he just kept on talking(I guess he told the whole story, but I don't know a sinlge word in Polish). It was pretty horrible(Although it sort of added a whole new dimension to the &quot;I'll be back&quot; scene).<br>
 <br>
I've often wondered how a sex scene will sound with only one polish guy doing the dubbing. It could be quite hilarious.<br>
<br>
But hilarious or not, dubbing will never be able to transmit the full experience of the original. It over-rides the actors and the directors work. Which is not a very nice thing to do.<br>
<br>
Hopefully most DVD's(And other future ways of storing movies) will feature various dubbing and subtitle options, which really makes dubbing a non-problem.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uqwxgraboy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>QWXGraboy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(2/7/02 11:42:35 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1343.topic&index=58>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sunglasses.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: sub vs dub</span><hr size=1> yeah but with kids obviously they have a shorter attention span i mean my cousin came over my house the other day and said if he could watch a manga movie so i gave him th choice, he could watch street fighter 2, dubbed tenchi or one of my subtitled videos.  He chose a subed video i can't remember really which one it was but anyway i had to pause it to summarise what the heck was happening which was annoying but i am really trying to get him into more manga and anime so soon his vocabulary will widen and he'll become a mold of myself, getting good marks at school and being able to read even the most complicated subs its really the only way to learn.<br>
Even if it isn't dubbed or subtitled kids really don't know what the storyline is as long as there is something to giggle, comment or go &quot;cool&quot; at it's a matter of putting yourself in the kids shoes.<br>

<br>
The little one is learning how to read using books.<br>
<br>
And neither of my kids are into empty entertainment.  They are not looking for pretty pictures as a means of entertainment. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uwithroo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Withroo</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_purplespot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(2/7/02 7:01:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1343.topic&index=60>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.boomspeed.com/withroo/kamui6.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sunglasses.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: sub vs dub</span><hr size=1> In general, I think the idea of dubs is great. Yes, kids have short attention spans and whatnot, and like anyone else (more so at times), they dislike being out of the loop (I can attest to this).<br>
<br>
Subtitles generate some confusion to people (regardless of age) who never have had experience with watching words at the bottom of the screen while alternately watching the pictures move. When I first saw something subtitled, it was very muddlesome, so I understand why some dislike subtitles.<br>
<br>
However, I am not saying one is better than the other. They both have very good points, and worse ones as well. I've only illustrated the main negative point of subtitles, but here's one with the dubs:<br>
<br>
Poorly translated/horrifically altered culture references.<br>
<br>
I remember watching an episode of CardCaptors, and seeing the characters eat something with chopsticks. They said it was 'hamburgers'.<br>
<br>
I severely dislike this kind of thing. Yes, the show was made in Japan and the culture references are different from what we're used to over here in North America. But the dubbing company feels as if the kids are stupid enough not to catch the eating-hamburgers-with-chopsticks reference. With all the stereotypes abound these days, nearly everyone knows that chopsticks equals noodles.<br>
<br>
In my personal opinion, there's nothing really wrong with dubs except for the terrible culture references the majority make, the ridiculous amount of things censored (have they not thought that this may not be meant for younger audiences?), and the horrific changes that are made to characters.<br>
<br>
Really, the act of trying to 'westernize' or, namely, 'Americanize' the dubbed animated show is ridiculous. So what if the kids are Japanese? We aren't as xenophobic as we were back in the day. So what if their names are like Seishirou or Ayako? Shortening names is as common a practice in Japan as it is here. It doesn't give the dubbers a reason to turn them into 'Sean' or 'Amy', except maybe make them look idiotic.<br>
<br>
Kids these days know that anime comes from Japan. They know that Japan is a different country, with different names, customs, and religions. Don't make the kids more ignorant by handing the show on a shiny platter and saying 'Meet Jon, the guy with a giant robot who fights the evil Blackeye!'.<br>
<br>
By leaving the culture references intact, dubs may be odd for some, but for the majority of kids, they'll ask someone about the 'odd' references. I happen to think that they'll grow more inquisitive and smarter, even. They *might* take an interest, and start reading more about it and researching it. Knowledge of different cultures may be useful to them in the future, whether they leave their home country or not.<br>
<br>
So I say this. Dubs are useful because they give people a new genre of television, a new something that's often a change for the better from the mindless pop-culture and 'flat' cartoons that scurry around the cable channels too often. Subtitles are useful for those who want to see the original anime, but still want to understand what's going on (if learning the subtitled language, all the better). <p><center><hr width=50% color="FFCCCC"><br><br><i>I have no signature,<br> dee woo dee woo...</i></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=1343.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=1343.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a> <b>3</b> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=1343.topic&start=61&stop=72>4</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4.showPrevMessage?topicID=1343.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4.showNextMessage?topicID=1343.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1343.topic&index=60><img src=http://www.polykarbon.com/bbsimage/addreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4.emailToFriend?topicID=1343.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4.threadControl?topicID=1343.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1343.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1343.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub25.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="polykarbonbbsfrm18">PK-BBS Rules and Regulations!<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm27">Board F.A.Q.s<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm3">News and Updates<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm2">Photoshop and Art questions<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm4">General Manga/Anime Discussion<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm5">Japanese Language Help<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm23">art in progress<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm13">Black and White Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm14">Color Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm19">Member's Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm17">Moderators Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm6">Member Photos<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm30">News, Reviews and Rumours<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm31">Help, Hints and Cheats<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm20">Challenges<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm21">Matches<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm25">Pose Forum<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm26">Writer's Forum<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm32">VG Discussion<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm33">PolyKarbon CCG</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#336699>- </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs>Polykarbon BBS</a><font color=#336699> - </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4>General Manga/Anime Discussion</a> <font color=#336699> - </font><a href="http://www.polykarbon.com">Polykarbon: Manga & Photoshop</a><font color=#336699> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- Begin BOTTOM AD Script -->
