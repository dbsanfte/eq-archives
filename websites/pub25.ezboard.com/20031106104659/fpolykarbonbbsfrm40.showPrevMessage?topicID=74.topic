<br>
the characters (so far anyway)<br>
<br>
Sho- very cold and malicious. He almost appears emotionless. In hand to hand combat, he is unmatched because of who his master was and how much he trains. His weapon of choice is a chinese straight sword. Sho has no problem killing humans if they get in his way. <br>
<br>
Hajime- Sho's brother, is an idiot, womanizing, out going person. His hand to hand combat skillz is lacking but he is brilliant with the sword. He never draws his sword against a human even if it means his life. So instead of using his katana on humans, he uses a bokken. A bokken is a sword shaped hard piece of wood that can shatter bones. Also Hajime is a very religious man.<br>
<br>
The idea I have behind the 2 characters are that they need each other. They are exact opposites but like the ying and yang, they need to be together to acheive balance. Hajime is good at killing demons, Sho keeps the concentration of the pair and is good at fighting humans. <br>
<br>
their history<br>
<br>
well they are brothers whose parents died while they were young. Their village was burning and being attacked by demons. Luckily a well a demon hunter came and saved the 2 boys. Sho swore revenge against all demons but the demon hunter did not let him go until they both underwent training. That way he wouldn't feel to guilty letting the boy go to die. After 7 years of training, Hajime and Sho both hated demons but accepted the death of their parents. But the incident left Sho emotionless and cold. Hajime however disguises his pain with silliness and laughter.<br>
<br>
They are now both demon hunters trying to rid humans of the demons. <br>
<br>
<br>
this is some of the story I have so far...<br>
<br>
Sho and Hajime are walking to a village dragging a carcus of a demon. This is how demon hunters make money, they kill a demon that's in the area and bring it to the closests town and get paid for it from the tax dollars of the people. <br>
anyway <br>
they get to the village, get paid, and rent a room. They wake up in the middle of the night and the town is on fire and demons are attacking. Sho begins to have flash backs. They and the guards there kill all the demons. Next day Hajime and Sho start to leave the village but see a girl all alone sitting on a rock with her arms folded rocking back and forth. She has a blank stare on her face. Hajime says that he was told that all of her family were killed the night before by the demons. Hajime remembers when Sho had a look like that when their village was attacked.So Hajime invites the girl to come with them. She doesn't say anything and just starts to walk with them. Sho has a disgusted look on his face and says &quot;why do we need this girl with us? It's  just another mouth to feed and just a hassle. What if some demons come to attack us?&quot; Hajime gives a cold stare to sho and the 3 start on the road...<br>
<br>
ok I'm not much of a writer but this is what I have so far.

<br>
Are the demons just human-hating monsters that kill becuase it's their nature or do they have a degree of intelligence? Do they have other Motives?<br>
<br>
Sounds like a good start though. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jael@polykarbonbbs>Jael</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(7/19/03 10:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm40.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=68.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> demons</span><hr size=1> well there are different kinds of demons ranging from the low level demons that feed on humans just to live.

<br>
I don't understand the whol ying- yang idea. Your main characters are people when you come right down to it, unless they too turn out to be demons themselves. How does one balance the other?<br>
<br>
Also, you can relate to many characters from anime for inspiration. Trigun's Vash the Stampede and his brother Knives have almost the same concept of killing and not killing. Knives kills both because he wants to recreate the world, killing the weak. Vash on the otherhand, hates killing but he's a hypocrite for having all those guns on him, yet he tries his hardest not to kill anyone, good or bad. Lord Seshomaru and Inuyasha from Inuyasha share a more related relationship with your killing demons idea. <br>
<br>
 I'd like to hear more about your story it sounds appealing and interesting. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ermac@polykarbonbbs>Ermac</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(7/23/03 1:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm40.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=68.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> reply</span><hr size=1> Sorry I just realized the ying yang, balance theme. Since they are on the road together it makes more sense that they are always in conflict with each other. Trying to convince the other brother why its important to leave behind or take someone that's in danger with them. <br>
Now that's a great idea, let us know when of if you need help with demons or something with the main character.<br>
<br>
I'm taking a wild guess here, your story setting takes place in the medieval time period. Since Sho and Hajime arem most likely japanese names does it take place in a fuedal japan era or not? <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm40.showPrevMessage?topicID=68.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm40.showNextMessage?topicID=68.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm40.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=68.topic&index=4><img src=http://www.polykarbon.com/bbsimage/addreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm40.emailToFriend?topicID=68.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm40.threadControl?topicID=68.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm40.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=68.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm40.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=68.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub25.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="polykarbonbbsfrm18">PK-BBS Rules and Regulations!<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm27">Board F.A.Q.s<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm3">News and Updates<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm2">Photoshop and Art questions<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm4">General Manga/Anime Discussion<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm5">Japanese Language Help<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm23">art in progress<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm13">Black and White Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm14">Color Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm19">Member's Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm17">Moderators Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm6">Member Photos<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm31">Help, Hints and Cheats<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm20">Challenges<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm21">Matches<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm26">Writer's Forum<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm32">VG Discussion<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm35">Member Created Tutorials<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm39">What is Fight Club?<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm40">Story Ideas</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#336699>- </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs>Polykarbon BBS</a><font color=#336699> - </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm40>Story Ideas</a> <font color=#336699> - </font><a href="http://www.polykarbon.com">Polykarbon: Manga & Photoshop</a><font color=#336699> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.246h<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
