<br>
<br>
The night was dark and the cluttered alley was illuminated only by a faulty lamppost.  Two running shadows could be seen, both heading toward the nearby park.  Only their light footsteps could be heard.<br>
<br>
The two figures had made it to the park.  It was empty and soundless–everything stationary and calm.  With the air cold, and ground freshly wet, the two shadowed beings stood, facing each other, their breaths making visible fog.  Once the smaller figure stepped forward, the lights turned on, revealing the two on a basketball court.  One, a small and slim girl with long golden hair in a braid, and a young man, with paler blond hair and a muscular build.  The girl dusted her red, fingerless gloves off and smirked, saying, “Ready to do this?”  The boy nodded.<br>
<br>
Within moments, the two were captured in battle.  The girl was fast and meticulous, poking in with her long legs and swift kicks.  On the other hand, the boy was a bit slower, dodging the girl’s attacks and trying to find the right time to strike.  Breaking from her flurry, the girl moved back, doing a single back flip but still holding her ground.  The boy smiled and rushed forward, his hands charged with a faint, light-blue energy.  <br>
<br>
Smiling, the blonde girl rushed forward as well, hoping to parry his attack.  When the two moving bodies were close enough to each other, the boy began to thrust his hand forward, ready to release the ball of energy.  As he was about to release, he stopped, seeing that the girl rushing at him was gone, for she was up in the air.  Seemingly floating, the girl flashed another one of her smirks and rushed down, her right foot covered in a flashing blue energy.         <br>
<br>
A groan.  The boy was knocked back by the girl’s attack, which had left a rather large hole in the ground.  Getting up, the boy took back his stance.  “Come on, Holly,” he said, calling for her. “You could do better...”.  The girl smiled and did another back flip, then saying, “Of course.  You only got a taste of me, Ashton.”  The girl ran forward charge again                 <br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
“Holly White and Ashton Masters,” said the man in the white lab coat, studying the screen of the two kids fighting.  After a few papers printed out of the printer, he took them and exited the white room, heading to the room at the end of the hall.  As he moved, the lights began getting dimmer and soon it was in complete darkness.  Pushing the steel door open, the scientist warily walked towards the desk.  “What do you have for me today?” asked a gruff voice in the shadows.  <br>
<br>
The scientist carefully set the papers on the desk, and backed off.  The stack of papers moved into the shadows and all that there was were just the sounds of the papers rustling against each other.  “Very good,” the voice said.  “Excellent potentials for the tournament.  Send out recruiters for them as soon as possible and get me an update on the other five recruiters jobs,” he stated.  “Leave.”  The scientist fumbled with the door, but finally got out.  <br>
The shadows were soon devoured by a soft light, and the source of the strong voice got up, his features revealed.  He had a chiseled face and body.  He seemed young, his faced unscarred and beautiful with a head of slick, dark hair combed back and piercing violet eyes.  Wearing a rather expensive suit with a simple black tie, he appeared to be rather sophisticated.  He began to walk around the room, then stopping, to pin up the printed papers.  The papers had portraits of both Holly and Ashton, and various bits of information at the side.  The whole wall had many papers like that–various picture of fighters both young and old and their information.<br>
<br>
“Holly...” he murmured, reading her statistics.  “Sixteen years old. Uses the fallen assassin arts of the Shadowloo...Hmm, this is interesting–daughter of Cammy White, former Shadowloo assassin and currently retired English Secret Service agent.  Father unknown.”  He moved on to Ashton’s paper.<br>
<br>
He traced his hand around Ashton’s face and started to read.  “Ashton Masters, nineteen year old user of a self-taught form of a Shotokan and Muay Thai hybrid art.  Son of...Ken Masters.  Huh...” The man smiled and went back to his seats, surveying the set of fighters before him.  <br>
<br>
“Soon...”<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
The year is 2013, and the world, apart from more advanced technology, is not much difference from the world a decade ago.  The appeal of fighting had grown undoubtedly, and teens from as young as 10 have been getting into the art.  However, though fighting was popular, tournaments have not been held for ages–legal ones that is.<br>
<br>
Small tournaments they are, held in a small island not too far from the mainland with small prizes like cash and more materialistic items like cars.  There were many contestants, but only a handful of champions–all young ones who had potential to become the greatest.  Those potentials, some descendants of past great fighters, some totally emerging from nowhere.  No matter who they are, it sparked quite a bit of  interest in one person.  He is a powerful multi-billionaire who worked in the industry of providing war machines for other countries outside the U.S. and Japan.  His name was Reiji Tenaka.<br>
<br>
In secret, he plans  with his small group of scientists to find the finest fighters for a great tournament that would be held in an remote island.  There, those chosen fighters will fight each other until one prevails, but what will happen to the champion is unknown–only Mr. Tenaka knows what will happen to him or her.  <br>
<br>
The rumors of the new tournament has caught the attention of both new fighters and old, and even the legends (the ones alive at least) of the past can’t keep themselves from coming.  Their names can be heard around the world in faint whispers.<br>
<br>
Ryu...Cammy...Iori...Chun-li...Mai...Guile...Athena...Kyo...Rock...Terry...Sakura...Alex...Ibuki...Kula...K'...<br>
<br>
So many fighters still brimming with power.<br>
<br>
Those names are just of few of the legends that will make appearances at the tournament.  They won’t be there to fight, however.  They all will come for the same reason: to come together and keep anything and anyone from abusing the power of a champion–for the sake of the free world. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=midnightblue@polykarbonbbs>Midnight Blue</A> at: 5/21/03 10:44:44 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=midnightblue@polykarbonbbs>Midnight Blue</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(5/24/03 9:35 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm40.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=39.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Tournament: Neo </span><hr size=1> If the story sucks that bad, ysomeoen could say something... <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm40.showPrevMessage?topicID=39.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm40.showNextMessage?topicID=39.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm40.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=39.topic&index=1><img src=http://www.polykarbon.com/bbsimage/addreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm40.emailToFriend?topicID=39.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm40.threadControl?topicID=39.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm40.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=39.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm40.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=39.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub25.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="polykarbonbbsfrm18">PK-BBS Rules and Regulations!<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm27">Board F.A.Q.s<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm3">News and Updates<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm2">Photoshop and Art questions<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm4">General Manga/Anime Discussion<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm5">Japanese Language Help<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm23">art in progress<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm13">Black and White Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm14">Color Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm19">Member's Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm17">Moderators Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm6">Member Photos<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm31">Help, Hints and Cheats<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm20">Challenges<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm21">Matches<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm26">Writer's Forum<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm32">VG Discussion<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm35">Member Created Tutorials<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm39">What is Fight Club?<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm40">Story Ideas</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#336699>- </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs>Polykarbon BBS</a><font color=#336699> - </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm40>Story Ideas</a> <font color=#336699> - </font><a href="http://www.polykarbon.com">Polykarbon: Manga & Photoshop</a><font color=#336699> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.246g<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
