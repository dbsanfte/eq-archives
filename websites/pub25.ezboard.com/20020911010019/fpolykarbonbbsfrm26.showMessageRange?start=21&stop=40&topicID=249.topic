I specialize in mostly hauntings and apparitions.&quot;<br>
&quot;I too have seen plenty of ghosts in my line of work, but I have to try to ignore the common folktales and search for the scientific answer.&quot;  He sat back down.<br>
&quot;What, Liz--was that your name?  Anyway, what Liz has is a sensativity to supernatural events.  It's quite simple to explain, really...&quot; A large clicking sound started to drawn Win off course.  It was coming from his bag.  Liz and the old man also stared at it.<br>
&quot;Oh my god...&quot;  Win knew what it was.  Reaching inside he pulled out his EMF detector, all three readings set on &quot;1&quot;, the highest possible reading.<br>
Taking a large gulp, Win looked to the ceiling.  What Liz had described of her visions was starting to make sense.  This wasn't a hurricane, it was the start of an invasion.  And the UFO sighting he was sent to find, was REAL. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uwinlabik.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Winlabik</A> at: 7/23/01 7:20:50 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ubeige.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Beige</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pre-Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(7/24/01 8:00:34 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=249.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/67453 WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Polykarbon Roleplaying, Chapter 1</span><hr size=1> &quot;VICK!&quot;<br>
&quot;Nnngh.&quot; They had been on the road for hours now, and Ross still hadn't quit his incessant chattering. It was about time he got some sleep.<br>
&quot;Vick, WAKE UP!&quot;<br>
Vick opened his eyes slowly, and suddenly realized he was still holding the wheel. A burst of adrenalin ran through his veins, and he slammed his foot on the brake pedal. &quot;Whoa...&quot;<br>
Ross got out of the car and angrily slammed the door. &quot;Get out. I'm driving now.&quot;<br>
Vick grimaced. &quot;I'm fine. Just need more coffee.&quot; He reached for the cup, but it was empty. &quot;@#%$.&quot;<br>
&quot;Just fine? JUST FINE? Get out of the car and LOOK!&quot;<br>
Ross pointed at the edge of the bridge. They were only a few inches from falling off and careening fifty-five feet into the raging river.<br>
&quot;Whoa.&quot; Vick scratched his head. &quot;I didn't know we were on a bridge.&quot;<br>
Ross opened the driver's side door and was about to get into the car when he heard a strange whooshing noise. &quot;What was that?&quot; he growled.<br>
Vick chuckled. &quot;Sure you don't need a little more sleep there, Ross?&quot;<br>
&quot;Shaddap. I heard something.&quot;<br>
A circular shadow passed overhead, and the whooshing sound caused the bridge to shake.<br>
Vick sat up straight. &quot;I heard that.&quot;<br>
The rumbling continued, and the car began to shake toward the edge of the bridge.<br>
&quot;Get out of the car, NOW!&quot; Ross shouted.<br>
Vick scrambled out as the car teetered over the side of the bridge. Ross opened the trunk and pulled out their field packs, then shuffled a couple yards away from the car. Without warning, another circular shadow passed, and the shockwave was more than enough to shove the car right off the bridge.<br>
Vick barely even heard the splash. Now what are we supposed to do? It's miles from the nearest town... Vick stood and thought. Another rumble and whooshing overhead broke his reverie. Where was it coming from? What were the overhead shadows? Why were they still on the bridge that was wobbling more and more?<br>
Ross and Vick ran for the end of the bridge as section after section of causeway creaked, bent, and finally broke off, falling into the torrent below. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ubeige.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Beige</A> at: 7/24/01 9:23:17 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ugothicchaos.showPublicProfile?language=EN>gothic chaos</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(7/24/01 11:39:23 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=249.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Polykarbon Roleplaying, Chapter 1</span><hr size=1> &quot;so this is how it ends,&quot;liz mumbled to herself.

'better lighten the mood,people tend to get a bit dark when discussing the end,'liz mentally told herself.<br>

Lovely. I hear that guy,what was his name?Oh thats right,Anthony something,anyways,i hear him speak and he throws some clothes in my direction.Normally i would refuse to put on such garments as these,'oh no,ick,theres no way i'm wearing THOSE!'but now is not the time to worry about such frivilouse things.But i do as i'm told,i always was the obidient child,and follow him upstairs. I say something,i'm not sure what,but it sounds somewhat like 'what now?' or 'what do we do now?' but for all i know i could be speaking pig latin. Never could get a hold of that launguage. Oh well,doesn't matter anyhow. Any minute now i expect some sort of a musical track to start playing,as if this were not real life but simply a movie. Perhaps 'Moonlight Sonata' would fit,for such a sad tune would work well with such dark situation. Well,at least in my mind it would. Befor i know it,i'm no longer in the basement but now upstairs. I suppose if someone were to look at me at this moment they might say roughly 'the lights are on but nobodys home,'Not completly true i must say,for i am home,i'm just not opening the door. Ah yes,little Lizzy locked away in her room. 'why don't you come outside?its a nice day,' they would say,'no,its going to rain,' i would replay. They would give me a baffled look and walk away.And then,low and behold,it would rain that day! Oh yes,i was right,of course i was.Oh well,that was the past. I look around. Any moment now i expect to wake up,in my warm bed with a cd softly playing in the backround. I always played music during the night,it helped keep nightmares away,as childish as that may sound. I wait for the awakining,but it never comes. Damn.Well,might as well get this thing under way. I look at Anthony expectanly.

Vick grimaced and tugged at his poncho a little. &quot;I'm more interested in finding a hotel. I need to friggin' sleep.&quot;<br>
&quot;So you admit it!&quot; Ross crowed. <br>
&quot;Shaddap.&quot; Another one of the circular shadows passed overhead, and yet another rumble shook the ground. They seemed to be dropping off in frequency, but they shadows were all heading in the same direction.<br>
&quot;Try the cell phone again.&quot; Ross suggested.<br>
Vick sighed. &quot;It's soaked. Won't work. Look, we've been walking for hours. There's bound to be a town or something nearby.&quot;<br>

Win pulled the radio out of his bag, once outside he would have to try to contact control.  He had to warn them.<br>
&quot;Hey Liz, you ok?&quot;  She looked deep in thought, either that or still disgusted by the sweats he gave her.  &quot;Sorry about the smell, I didn't get a chance to wash them after my morning jog...&quot;<br>
Win opened the door, and to no surprise was met with the full blast of the wind.  He had to find a better building, this one was too thick for the radio.  Through the rain he saw the faint flashing lights of a large structure, a radio antenna!<br>
He reached around Liz's shoulders to keep her steady, and also give himself some leverage in the wind.<br>
They came to a large marble building, on the front was a large sign &quot;Waatch, WA Police Department.&quot;<br>
<br>
The inside was desterted, Win's guess was that they must be down in the shelter or out doing their job.  Nontheless, he had to find the room with the CB, he could plug his own radio in there and hopefully get enough juice to reach control.<br>
&quot;Liz, let's split up.  Try to find what looks like a CB radio, call me if you find it.&quot;<br>
He felt bad leaving her alone, but his duties were to his country.  Win looked over as many desks as possible, finally he reached what looked like the Sargent's desk, cluttered on its surface were many reports.<br>
Win picked one up and read it, &quot;Mrs. Sagenti of Waatch reported seeing a circular object pass over her house and make a large rumble.&quot;  Win put it back down and picked up another, &quot;Mr. Robertson of Waatch reported seeing a circular, cigar shaped object pass over his home and leave a supersonic boom.&quot;  Win looked over the other reports, they were ALL UFO sightings! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/usempaisloan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SempaiSloan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(7/25/01 1:36:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=249.topic&index=29>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Polykarbon Roleplaying, Chapter 1</span><hr size=1> The noise was unnerving. Deuce wasn't used to sitting still like this. He wanted a hallway, or a ship deck, or something... something to pace along. He had to move.<br>
<br>
He was going to come unglued.<br>
<br>
The air was alive with electricity... like he was constantly about to be hit by lightening. He wanted to grab something and squeeze the life out of it.<br>
<br>
He had to move.<br>
<br>
Argyle man was starting to stare and make approving looks at him. God how he wanted to shove that guy underwater until he turned blue!<br>

He had to leave. Get out, some way... or he would end up killing everyone in that room!<br>

Except maybe swimsuit girl.<br>
<br>
Maybe.<br>

That hippie shmuck was tossing her some clothing, and waving a cell phone around. Wait. Not a cell phone. It looked like a toy, or something. What the hell were they up to? Did she know him? Deuce didn't think so.<br>
<br>
They're leaving!<br>
<br>
No way!<br>
<br>
Not without Deuce, they weren't!<br>
<br>
He gave them a headstart, then lifted out of his chair. He wound back up the stairs softly, catlike. He heard a rush of wind, and some mist flowed down the stairs and washed his face. <br>
<br>
&quot;Just got dry, too.&quot;<br>
<br>
Deuce beat tracks up the remaining stairs, and caught the door with his toe. When he stepped out, the wind took part of his breath away.<br>
<br>
He scanned what little he could see through the rain.<br>
<br>
The two had split up! What the hell were they up to? <br>
<br>
And more importantly, who to follow?<br>
<br>
The hippie had some kind of objective... maybe to find a transistor radio or something. But the girl...<br>
<br>
Deuce made his decision, pulled his collar up again, and dove into the rain. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ubeige.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Beige</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pre-Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(7/25/01 3:37:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=249.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/67453 WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Polykarbon Roleplaying, Chapter 1</span><hr size=1> Vick and Ross had been on the road for uncountable hours now.

&quot;Where the fu..&quot; Ross sneezed. It was fairly certain they had both caught cold, but Vick's frown continued to grow, and he never once coughed, wheezed, sneezed, or done any of the various nasal actions Ross had.<br>
<br>
((Ok, that was kind of weirdly worded... anyway.))<br>
<br>
&quot;Where've all the cars and trucks gone?&quot; Ross continued. The only sign he could see that cars had ever driven on the road was a smattering of auto liquid stains and the usual litter.<br>
Vick remained silent. He remained focused on the sign he had saw earlier - Waatch, 3 miles.<br>
&quot;Hey, I think I see an offramp up ahead.&quot; Ross said. He could almost make out a McDonald's sign in the distance, and saw a phone booth nearby. &quot;Let's stop and try to phone the field office.&quot;<br>
&quot;All right,&quot; Vick replied, &quot;but first we should get to somewhere warm. And dry.&quot;<br>
Ross didn't argue there. They walked down the offramp and spotted a police station nearby. &quot;Ah, that ought to do the trick.&quot;<br>

Removing their coats, they ambled on in and looked around. &quot;Where is everybody?&quot;<br>
Vick looked distracted. &quot;There's someone here. I can smell coffee being brewed.&quot; He ran off to find it.<br>
His partner shook his head, and walked after him. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uwinlabik.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Winlabik</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(7/25/01 5:19:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=249.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Polykarbon Roleplaying, Chapter 1</span><hr size=1> Win heard the voice of Liz over the noise of the rustling papers.  He traced the source and found her in the hallway, both feet on their tip-toes.  She pointed towards a door and he walked in.  There, up against the wall, was the CB Radio they were looking for.<br>
Win gave Liz a cheezy grin, &quot;That's it!&quot;  he pulled out his radio and unplugged his small antenna.  Making sure the two wires were the same size, he plugged his radio into the Police Station's system.<br>
&quot;Control, nine-seven-zero-alpha, do you read?&quot; Win let the button go and listened.  Only static...  Liz gave him a strange smile and rolled her eyes.<br>

<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  &quot;This is control, what are you doing out in the storm Win?&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  Liz gave Winlabik a strange glance.<br>
&quot;It's my codename,&quot; he quickly explained.  &quot;Control, give me a confo on frisbees near Waatch.&quot;<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  &quot;Roger, there are multiple reps of frisbees.  EMF off the charts, advised that you watch the sky if possible, gain evidence.&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
Win grimmiced.  He hated collecting evidence of UFOs, especially in the midst of a hurricane.<br>
&quot;Roger, Control.  Nine-seven-zero-alpha out.&quot;  Win put down his microphone and disconnected the radio.  Liz stared at him like she thought it was all for nothing.  &quot;They confirmed that UFOs are being sighted all along the Waatch area, and want me to try and get photos.&quot;<br>
Winlabik put his radio into his coat pocket, but noticed two men standing in the doorway of the room.  He was just about to ask them who they were when something loud and fast passed overhead, it left behind a sonic boom that shook the whole building.<br>
All four of them dove for cover under various furniture.  Under the desk Winlabik could only dread if these &quot;visitors&quot; ever went offensive. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uwinlabik.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Winlabik</A> at: 7/25/01 5:19:35 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/usempaisloan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SempaiSloan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(7/26/01 7:12:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=249.topic&index=34>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Polykarbon Roleplaying, Chapter 1</span><hr size=1> The police station looked like a scaled-down version of every other police station Deuce had visited. Only darker.<br>
<br>
The wind was howling over the roof, and those odd thunderclaps were more incessant.<br>
<br>
But Deuce could still hear every step these people made. His eyes were wide open, his ears pricked, his fingers tingling with electricity. <br>
<br>
The girl found her way into a dark room, and groped around for a bit. Deuce stowed himself in the hallway, keeping an eye on the corners. The hippie was making plenty of noise, so he relaxed a little...<br>
<br>
Until the girl called out for him.<br>
<br>
Deuce sucked in a breath, and tucked into an open doorway before the hippie crossed the hall. Deuce found himself in a small corner office with wide windows taped in large duct tape &quot;X&quot;'s, ready for the worst the storm would give it.<br>
<br>
In the clouds beyond the window, Deuce saw a motion. At first he thought it was a trick of lightening, but then it decended a little and broke through the clouds. Dark, circular... moving really damned fast!<br>
<br>
As it zipped by overhead, it rattled the glass in the windows. That was a familiar sound... a sound from his childhood growing up not far from the Naval base in San Diego.<br>
<br>
What the hell was the military doing sending pilots into the middle of a hurricane?<br>
<br>
A new sound from the hallway caught Deuce's attention. The rickety aluminum door at reception opened with a gust of weather, and two new voices began murmuring.<br>
<br>
Deuce's hand went to his Browning instinctively.  Getting crowded in here!<br>
<br>
He peeled his ears and held his breath. He could hear the hippie droning on into a radio, and was greeted by the static squawk of another voice over the air.<br>
<br>
It was largely jargon... sounded like James Bond wannabees. Maybe a junior Mission Impossible Fan Club.<br>
<br>
But then the hippie said something that made Deuce's eyebrows lift.<br>
<br>
&quot;UFO.&quot;<br>
<br>
Fantastic. A lunatic.<br>
<br>
The newcomers were wandering down the hallway, and the hippie's voice ended upbruptly.<br>
<br>
Deuce relaxed his grip on his piece, and leaned back against the sheetrock, his ear gulping in what it could hear...<br>
<br>

<br>
A tingling rush filtered through Deuce's trunk... that half-resigned half panic of getting caught. On a typical job, that meant he was dead, or he'd have to kill someone. But not today.<br>
<br>
She was just too curious. And she sounded scared.<br>
<br>
Deuce pulled his hand out of his coat, and let it rest in clear sight near his thigh. He inched out from the shadows behind the door, and stepped into the hallway. He tried to keep his gameface on, but it failed him when her eyes met his. She was piercing.<br>
<br>
He took a breath, and forced the best grin he could muster. &quot;Feel better, now?&quot;<br>
<br>
She just stood there watching him, her eyes fluttering back and forth between his.<br>
<br>
&quot;You've got sharp ears. I didn't think I gave myself away.&quot;<br>
<br>
A conversation continued in the room beyond her, and Deuce dropped his voice.<br>
<br>
&quot;You seem to think you know me. I don't think you do. Even if you did, what would that change? Not this storm! If you were a cop, you'd have arrested me. If you were a Fed, you wouldn't be alone. If you belonged to Velario...&quot; He chuckled. &quot;...you would have just shot me.&quot;<br>
<br>
Her shoulders were relaxing a little.<br>
<br>
&quot;If you're going to be afraid of anything out here, it's not me.&quot; Deuce looked back at the windows of the office. &quot;But what's up there? @#%$. With that many friendlies tearing ass up the coast... who knows what's going on in Alaska?

You too, huh?&quot; He turned a shoulder to her, and stole a glance out the windows again. Another rumble shook beneath his feet.<br>
<br>
The very fact the Deuce was alive was a miracle. He'd found himself at the business end of too many maniac's barrels to make any more assumptions about anything. That's how he survived... by never allowing prejudice to cloud his options.<br>
<br>
But this was going a little further than he was willing to go.<br>
<br>
However, there were two people, now, who were convinced that those... things... hurling through the sky were unearthly. One MUFON hipster, and this... extraordinary woman. And there was something about her perception.<br>
<br>
&quot;So, I guess this means you're a psychic, or something?&quot; He shook his head. &quot;I don't suppose it matters.&quot;<br>
<br>
Deuce leaned against the wall. Twelve years growing up in San Diego. He'd learned what military aircraft sounded like. But... he had to admit, that was a long time ago. And those craft were flying through winds that would beat the hell out of a Tomcat.<br>
<br>
He released a heavy sigh. &quot;Well, if those really ARE UFO's, then I'm going to need a bigger gun.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showMessageRange?topicID=249.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showMessageRange?topicID=249.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showMessageRange?topicID=249.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showMessageRange?topicID=249.topic&start=81&stop=92>5</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showPrevMessage?topicID=249.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showNextMessage?topicID=249.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=249.topic&index=40><img src=http://www.polykarbon.com/bbsimage/addreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.emailToFriend?topicID=249.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.threadControl?topicID=249.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=249.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=249.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub25.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="polykarbonbbsfrm18">PK-BBS Rules and Regulations!<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm27">Board F.A.Q.s<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm3">News and Updates<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm2">Photoshop and Art questions<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm4">General Manga/Anime Discussion<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm5">Japanese Language Help<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm23">art in progress<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm13">Black and White Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm14">Color Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm19">Member's Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm17">Moderators Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm6">Member Photos<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm31">Help, Hints and Cheats<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm20">Challenges<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm21">Matches<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm26">Writer's Forum<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm32">VG Discussion<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm33">PolyKarbon CCG<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm35">Member Created Tutorials<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm36">Best Tutorials</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#336699>- </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs>Polykarbon BBS</a><font color=#336699> - </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26>Writer's Forum</a> <font color=#336699> - </font><a href="http://www.polykarbon.com">Polykarbon: Manga & Photoshop</a><font color=#336699> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM ARTS AD SCRIPT -->
