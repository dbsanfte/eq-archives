Anywase, how many people know what it's like to be really good in this game??? You can see some of the best matches ever at <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://media.shoryuken.com/mvc2/shgl_mvc2_0525/">media.shoryuken.com/mvc2/shgl_mvc2_0525/</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> When i first starting playing when it first came out in the arcades was very basic. I hardly ever used assists, i didn't understand the air combos or linking supers. My main team was gulie, gambit and Ice man. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
After years of playing some of the best i'm style of play is really advanced. In causal play i'll pick low tier teams but in a tourney out comes Cable, Magneto and Sentinal. I can do Iron Man's infinite and I'm working on Magneto's.<br>
<br>
Anyone else play this game at high levels of skill? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=alucard1515>alucard1515</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator <img src=http://contest.polykarbon.com/badge1.gif></span><br> <font color=#336699>(4/9/03 4:41:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=643.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.undeadart.com/forum/alucard.gif width=100 height=94></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Marvel vs Capcom II...it's still fun after all this time</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>In causal play i'll pick low tier teams but in a tourney out comes Cable, Magneto and Sentinal.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Ha, Magneto and Sentinal are hardly what I'd call high tier characters. Magneto is so toned down, since he used to be a boss character, and Sentinal is too limited in his moves. But hey, I don't always use the best characters on my team either, I'll get them mainly for their assists.<br>
<br>
My best team is Cable, Captain Commando, and Iceman. I start off with Cable, getting Captain Commando to clear the air if someone tries to jump in, or Iceman to keep them busy on the ground as I come in. I used to have Juggernaut in that position, but I suck with him when I actually have to fight with him, and while Iceman isn't exactly great, I can use him. Cable doesn't even need an explanation, he has to be the most well rounded character in the game, and definitely has the best projectile attack. He has two anti air attacks, a grab, and a dash attack.<br>
<br>
I use other characters sometimes, but I don't really have any teams worked out that play to each others strengths. I also use Hayato, Venom, Gambit, Psyclocke, and Spider-Man a lot, though I've started trying out Blackheart, Colossus, Rogue, and Ken. <br>
<br>
Only problem is that it's sometimes a pain to play with my friends. After a while I got really good with Cable, Iceman, and Captain Commando, so they always bitch when I use any of them (especially Cable). It's aggrivating. I block their attacks, wait for them to open up and attack with his Viper Beam, (I will come in closer depending on the character I'm fighting, and how they're playing them) then they complain that I always keep away. Hello, isn't the point of the game NOT to get the crap kicked out of you while you beat your opponent? They complain about the exact opposite if I use someone like Hayato who has to fight close all the time. What really gets me is when I use Iceman and they complain that I keep using the same move... well, maybe if he had more than two (I do NOT count that stupid ice fist he makes), I would do something else. Anyway, if everything is so predictable, that just means they suck, because it works. I win almost every time I use characters I'm familiar with, I have to switch around a lot just so I don't always win.<br>
<br>
But I have no idea of my actual skill level because my two friends are the only ones I've ever played that don't completely suck, and the computer is pathetic.<br>

 The most top tier chars in the game is Cable, Sentinal, Magneto, Storm and Cap commando. Check out <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://shoryuken.com/forums/showthread.php?s=&threadid=24656">shoryuken.com/forums/show...adid=24656</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> or just d/l one vid from the link i posted earlier, to see why Mag and Sent top tier mainly jose_combofiend_3of6 or 5of6. Good Sentinal players are more feared than good Cables. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=madpower1>Madpower1</A> at: 4/9/03 7:24:21 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=genchi>Genchi</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(4/9/03 9:34:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=643.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://gallery.passion4art.com/members/kazuochitori/purpleAngel.jpg height=118 width=130></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Marvel vs Capcom II...it's still fun after all this time</span><hr size=1> I used to be pretty good.

Then a couple weeks later when i tried to go back and play Alpha 3 I was completely disoriented. Mostly I used Magneto, Psylocke and Captain Commando for serious play, but my favorites were Hayato, Guile and Akuma. <br>
<br>
I haven't played any Fighting Games in over a year, which is kinda sad because they're my favorite kind of games. I suppose I should bust out the DC one of these days. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END--><br>

I never really had a &quot;team&quot;, I just liked switching around what characters I used, and seeing what happened.<br>
<br>
While the point is to not get the crap kicked out of you, I never liked playing against people that cheese.  To me it seems pretty pointless when all you do is same thing over and over.  Like this time when I was in the arcade and I saw some kid using assists to keep his opponent pinned to the other side of the screen (the only character I actually remember was sentinal, but he used all three in his combo).  Because of when the hits arrived, either you spent all your time blocking until you were worn away, or if you got hit, you were never able to recover....that doesn't seem like fun to me.  You might as well just play once, and record yourself doing it, cause every game after that is gonna look exactly the same.  <br>
<br>
To me, someone with skillz is the kind of person that can do all sorts of different stuff, and still kick your ass six ways from Sunday (I've seen some of those people actually break out of those invinco-combos).  That's just my take though. <p><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Bad spellers of the world, untie!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=madpower1>Madpower1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(4/17/03 10:14:55 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=643.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/arialraver/Ezboard.txt  width=100 hight=75></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Marvel vs Capcom II...it's still fun after all this time</span><hr size=1> I know what you're saying. Overwhelming people with attacks is a big part of winning when playing in big tourneys. Some people's who game is chipping. Ex. When someone picks spiral and keeps using sentinel's ground assist. They'll keep throwing swords at you and as soon as they run out they'll call sentinel and as soon as he's assist finish hitting then they throw more swords. It's probably the most abused trap style in the game, but it is escapable. <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://media.shoryuken.com/mvc2/advanced_tactics/mvc2-advanced.wmv">media.shoryuken.com/mvc2/...vanced.wmv</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kazuochitori>KazuoChitori</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(4/17/03 11:35:47 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=643.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://gallery.passion4art.com/members/kazuochitori/BloodLain.gif height=97 width=130></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Marvel vs Capcom II...it's still fun after all this time</span><hr size=1> Spiral is awesome.
