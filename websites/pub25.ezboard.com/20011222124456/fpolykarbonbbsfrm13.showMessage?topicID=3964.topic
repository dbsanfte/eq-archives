However, the positioning of the gun is unrealisitic.  I spent a lot of time on the gun however, and I think that is perhaps the best gun drawing I have done in a very long time.<br>
<br>
The girl originally was planned to be naked, in fact, I forgot to change the bottom to reflect the clothing.  I was going to have her in the buff, crawling, but I thought about what kind of image that would be, a girl on her hands and knees, buck naked, and with a huge freaking sniper rifle.  So...I changed it, and voila.<br>

the bottom end looks weird.  i cant quite put my finger on it, but something about how her butt is shaped is bothering me...<br>

i cant see how the gun stays on her.  there's no strap or anything.  guess it's all fine and dandy, though, considering how it came to be on her.  <br>

I think her arm would be fully extended or close to it when she had the rifle tucked in to her shoulder and ready to fire, that would hurt a bit and make the rifle hard to control. But that is just visually the stock looks to long from the pistol grip, I didn't actually measure it.<br>
The barrel looks a bit short and skinny also. Typically a big sniper rifle will be of atleast a .300 caliber or 7.62mm typically the real big puppies are .50 cal, that is a big rifle. Also the barrel is usually pretty thick to equalize heat better (keeps the barrel from deforming when the rifle is fired a few times very quicky) Yours looks more like a 5.56mm assault rifle barrel where accuracy at rediculous ranges aren't as big of a deal.. On barrel length, it can only be as long as one cartrige length in front of the clip, so on yours it would run from about the end of the first vent nearest the scope to the end of the gun.<br>
I like the drawing, the pose and your weapon are very good. I just wanted to point out some things you might want to consider when draw firearms in the future to add some more realism, or extra beefiness. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uevigilant.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Evigilant</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(11/28/01 10:09:10 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://kuiki.net/evi/Misc/eddie.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Girl with big sniper rifle</span><hr size=1> wow great point about the gun.

Good picture though. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=hellion>hellion</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(11/29/01 9:25:40 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Girl with big sniper rifle</span><hr size=1> Ok, a pistol is typically a backup weapon incase you get jumped (as in someone sneaks up close to you), or you run out of ammo. The run out of ammo thing can be because you are a bad shot, OR there were more targets than anticipated. Also, pistols are better weapons for firing while moving than a sniper rifle, most people can fire and aim them faster also. I'd say add the pistol. If a sniper is smart they will carry a pistol, just incase. Also, if someone were to think a sniper is a bad shot because they carry a pistol, said person is in for a scary surprise.<br>
On the 2 magazines. The primary clip should be the largest, Also I know of only a few guns that have 2 different magazines and the second magazine is a grenade launcher. These few weapons are also pretty big looking. I assumed that the clip in front was the only magazine. The reason I said the stock was too long was because of the proportions of it, to the sniper's arm. I was more concerned with ease of control and the saftey of the weapon based damage that could be caused during recoil. I looked at the pic and it does appear to have 2 clips, or that front one is a laser sight or accessory storage. Your stock is just slightly longer than the one in the picture of the actual weapon. The rear magazine takes up more of the length of the stock than yours does. But your pic isn't loading so I am just going off of memory.<br>
Argh another long one, sorry bout that. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=hellion>hellion</A> at: 11/29/01 9:29:11 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=terminalspiritdisease>Terminal Spirit Disease</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(11/30/01 6:31:49 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Girl with big sniper rifle</span><hr size=1> Aight--I'z be seeing where you be coming from.

SWAT snipers sometimes do something similar to the military team but they are firing at a lot closer targets so there is no spotter but instead a guy defending the sniper. The PD in my town does it a tad differently but that is because we only have a part time SWAT team. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm13.showMessage?topicID=3967.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm13.showMessage?topicID=3989.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm13.emailToFriend?topicID=3964.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm13.threadControl?topicID=3964.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm13.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3964.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm13.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3964.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub25.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="polykarbonbbsfrm18">PK-BBS Rules and Regulations!<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm3">News and Updates<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm2">Photoshop and Art questions<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm4">General Manga/Anime Discussion<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm5">Japanese Language Help<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm23">art in progress<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm13">Black and White Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm14">Color Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm19">Member's Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm17">Moderators Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm6">Member Photos<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm22">How to use Fight Club<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm20">Challenges<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm21">Matches<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm25">Pose Forum<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm26">Writer's Forum<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm27">Board F.A.Q.s<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm29">Christmas Contest</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#336699>- </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs>Polykarbon BBS</a><font color=#336699> - </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm13>Black and White Art</a> <font color=#336699> - </font><a href="http://www.polykarbon.com">Polykarbon: Manga & Photoshop</a><font color=#336699> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.4 b7<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
