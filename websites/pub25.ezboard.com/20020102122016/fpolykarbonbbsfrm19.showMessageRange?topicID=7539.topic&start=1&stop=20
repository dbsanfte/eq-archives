Lesse, the other day in Starcraft, well, it was a bloody mess to say the least.<br>
It was a 7vs1comp stomp (funnn), and when the comp was beat (easy), someone hadn't clicked allied victory or somethin so the game wouldn't end! &gt;_&lt;<br>
So, we all teamed up on this guy, and pummelled his ass to kingdum kum (sp?).<br>
Then, that didn't work, so, they all ganged up on me (who had the smallest forces), and slaughtered me in seconds...<br>
Worst multi experience ever... &gt;_&lt;<br>

It's between 3 candidates<br>
<br>
1)Back in the day when I had a 32 K modem....(it sucks!)<br>
I was introduced to TFC...and the lag was soo bad.  It took 5 full minutes to join a game.  One day the lag was particularly bad...but I joined a game and had 8,000 ping (now with a cable modem It is rare to get over 150.  I lagged everyone so bad that they all yelled at me and made me leave.<br>
<br>
2)There was that one time when I joined a game and saw porno sprays everywhere.  HELLO?!  Girls play this game too!  I told em to stop and then the host typed decalfrequency 0 into console (making people able to spray their sprapains a.k.a. decals at lightening speed)...I got so mad...all I did during that whole game was blow up the images on the walls with my rocket launcher!<br>
<br>
3)Ugh...I started training myself awhile back.  I turned off the crosshairs to my gun (the little dot that shows where you are aiming)...to get better.  I sucked...but after awhile I got really good at aiming without them.  Then, I turned the dot things back on...and was unstoppable!  I loved it.  But there's a bad side at being a godlike sniper...I got kicked 5 times that day from different servers...because they accused me of cheating &quot;no one can get that many headshots&quot;...&quot;kick her!&quot;...someone actually said &quot;Miss Wiggle...where'd you get it?&quot;, ~Get what?~ ...&quot;you know!&quot;...he kept on asking for 5 minutes...I had no clue what he was talking about.  He finally said I was using a cheat to get headshots.  I didnt even know that cheats existed.  It took me 2 years just to figure out you can jump extra high by pressing space then crouch!  ***they are just jealous!***<br>
<br>
anyway...one of those 3...I just couldnt choose! <p><center> -No, Mom!  I don't need college.  I'm going to follow my dream, and become a clown!-<center>

yes...the original quake on the N64...with the two player Deathmatch on big levels...<br>
Yeah...that sucked<br>
An interesting thing to try...<br>
If you have Perfect dark...Play against a team of DarkSims...8 on 1<br>
put only the farsight on as a weapon...make sure whatever level you pick has wide open areas...they have terrible accuracy with slow guns...and when you spawn stay where you are...you'll have a group of them in front of you shooting at you...<br>
this sounds bad but they usually walk in front of each other and kill each other and totally miss you...lowering the score...they also tend to bunch up in certain places on the map...making it easy to pick off about 3 or 4 in one shot...I kicked ass...it sounds strange but it worked...<br>
As well Darksims cheat...I had one dissapear right in front of me...that sucked too...<br>
