not know much about Spawn dood, if you ever paid attention you would know that Todd quit pencils on issue 18 and sent the duties over to Greg Capullo, then Greg sent them over to Angel just recently, get your facts straight. The whole spawn story is exactly that, a story. Which movie do you go to and come home more impressed by, Collateral Damage or Lord of the rings, (all action or neccessary action with a good story)<br>
<br>
not to mention Mike Turner, anyone who can draw while going through Kemo Therapy deserves credits. <p><br>

I said when it was in his hands it was boring.  AND on top of that full of plot holes.  Whatever did happen to his power counter??????<br>
<br>
  AND i see movies that have both action and a good story, quite frankly spawn didnt.<br>
<br>
  Sam and twitch were dumb, and it got lost in its self.  Too much effort to do too many things.  Thats how it got the plot holes.  Not to mention converting a 12 issue story into a 1 zillion issue epic.<br>
  <br>
  AND, if u want to know what spawn books sold the most......it was the VIOLATOR special, and u know what those books were....ACTION.<br>
<br>
  IN ADDITION, u CANT compare a movie, which can prolly be drawn out in about 4 issues of comic.  To a SERIES OF 18 BOOKS PLUS SPECIALS THAT HAD NO ACTION except for an occasional chain whip or or spawn hurting himself.  Would lord of the rings be popular if the entire set was about Froto whining about how he was from hobbit city and picking his damn feet????  NO <br>
<br>
  How many issues of spawn ( done by todd, which i clearly stated i was talking about) ended in him picking up guns and bullets and charging up.....just to hav it fall off into crap vill......i count 4, and one more when he was taking on overtkill.....worse draw action panels in the world.<br>
<br>
  Sorry if i seem upset but i dont appreciate someone saying that i said something i didnt.  I said Todd's books were boring, and i guarantee u i have forgotten more then you will EVER know about image gen 1 books......Mr.Masters<br>
 <br>
 Yes the spawn story is just that....a story...but even feking beauty and the beast has a punch or two in it.  Stories have rising ACTION, CLIMAX and FALLING ACTION....  Ya know what they call a story without action?....i dont think they have a term for it, except for crap<br>

It takes a comic book like 20 issues to discuss what happens in 1 chapter of a book, so you only got to the end of the first chapter and threw down the book. He gets into a lot of action later in the series and his counter dissapears cuz he finds a way to replenish it, merely by decaying himself. It has a truly immensive story and you just hung around for the prologue. <p><br>

<br>
Todds stuff was DULL NOT THE BOOK.  Todd's parts had no action.  I KNOW other artist put action in the book.  However as far as what he did it was boring.  There have not been ANY other titles where there have been 20 issues before there was a semi important battle to the story.<br>
  Battle chasers had 2 chapters in half the issues and like 4 times the action.....<br>
  It takes 20 books to tell a story....and Todd admitted that he goofed on the counter, its why i sited that, that thing about replenishing it..BS that was made up to keep a series that was supposed to be 12 issues runnin into its zillions.<br>
  Why do u think the sulution was so simple..so they could write it off.<br>
<br>
  AND the action wasnt limited cause of the counter, he battled the mercs and stuff (from the earlier issues) with guns, he didnt even understand his crappy powers when todd had the book.  And when i say used guns i mean used as color to add to the panel, cause he barely shot them.<br>
  Im not asking for mindless violence, im asking for something that have all the proper elements of a good story.<br>
<br>
  Remember when he first came back and could only become the white guy? That was gonna be another story point that was supposed to reflect on society....Todd decided that was dumb and quick fixed that too. <p>On a long enough timeline,the survival rate for everyone drops to zero</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ufithy1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fithy1</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.boomspeed.com/the1stdragon/tg2.gif" BORDER=0> at: 6/10/02 11:42:31 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/urocketpig.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rocketpig</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(6/10/02 11:44:49 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10231.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.rocketpig.net/images/Click-Icon.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Grrrrr</span><hr size=1> I have to agree with Filthy on this one... I have the first 75 issues of Spawn and Todd ended up just boring me out of purchasing the book anymore.<br>
<br>
It seems as if Todd would start a story or plot line, later decide it was dumb, and then would just make it disappear.  He did it with the counter, the &quot;white guy&quot; transformation problem, that Ape character, and a few other things.<br>
<br>
Then later on, the book just digressed into Spawn sitting on a throne of worms and bitching about his life nonstop.<br>
<br>
It may be different now, but there was a period of about 25 issues where virtually nothing happened. <p>No one has ever accused me of having an opinion.  Don't be the first.<BR>

He was busy with writing and the business aspect, and that's why he passed the pencilling on to Capullo.<br>
<br>
I admit the book does kind of jump around sometimes. It takes on one problem, then forgets it within a few issues and doesn't come up again until many issues later, but I still enjoy the comic. They've gotten better about continuing the story now, and it's changed drastically now. Wanda, Terry, etc haven't even been mentioned since issue 100. That was supposed to be a change of direction for the series, and he hasn't done quite so much brooding. But that never bothered me anyway... I mean if I came back to life as a super deformed demon who was damned to hell and was greeted by my wife marrying my best friend and having a kid, it might take me a while to get over it too. I know he admitted he forgot the counter in the comic before, but he also said that some of his powers don't drain the bar, so he's not always forgetting, sometimes he doesn't need to show it because nothing changed. Besides, since issue 100 when he killed Malebolgia, the counter is gone completely.<br>
<br>
About the Dreamwave books, I have to agree with you. I don't mean to put them down because they CAN do good artwork (like their covers and promo work like you said), but the pages inside of the books are sloppy and are not done to the best of their abilities. I was going to start collecting warlands when it first came out and when I opened the book I couldn't believe that the same artist did the pages as the cover.  <p><table width=100% border=0>

It'd definitly be better than some of the stuff out there now and it'll give the people actually interested some experience and a good portfolio to place in front of companies at cons.<br>

Gil-galad was an Elven-king.
           Of him the harpers sadly sing:
           the last whose realm was fair and free
           between the Mountains and the Sea.

           His sword was long, his lance was keen,
           his shining helm afar was seen;
           the countless stars of heaven's field
           were mirrored in his silver shield.

           But long ago he rode away,
           and where he dwelleth none can say;
           for into darkness fell his star
           in Mordor where the shadows are.</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ualisama.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ali Sama</A> at: 6/10/02 12:52:03 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=evangelion>evangelion</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(6/10/02 1:04:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10231.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.angelfire.com/comics/codywyers/images/gift/wslgelion.txt WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sunglasses.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: &lt;SLAPS AHPATHY 5&gt;</span><hr size=1> since this is so freaking off topic....doesnt this belong in comic discussion?<br>
<br>
anyway..back to the &quot;He's saying to screw what people tell you about nit-picky things. as long as your people look like people and it's your style, go with it.<br>
&quot; statment<br>
<br>
<br>
i think this to be true...i hate this attitude about how every person has to be 7 heads hight...<br>
im sorry pat but i think your tutorials give people the wrong idea...that might be the average...but people vary in hieght...<br>
and im not meaning to imply that you dont believe that either...some people are less than 7 heads hight in reality, and are often drawn as such...and it looks good...dragonballZ's vegeta for example....(granted he changes hieght every episode)<br>
<br>
and how....everyone thinks that arms must be a certain length and such...<br>
that cold guy came out with a statment a while back something along the lines of artists always base their exagerations off of real proportions....thats the biggest load of crap....<br>
if your going to exagerate, why mess with real proportions anyway?<br>
just do what you will...<br>
and have fun....<br>
i dont get you realisim folks...you want real....take a picture<br>
<br>
if it someone thinks it looks bad...they will tell you they disagree with the way you drew it...but if you like it...who cares?  thank them for their opinion...if someone gives you a critique, you dont have to take it....a long forgotten rule on this board....im tired of people getting mad at others for not accepting their critique...<br>
<br>
<br>
im just tired....<br>
work sucks <p><center>

Be careful, I might like it. :P<br>
<br>
But what is this Dreamwave you speak of? I stopped buying comics a few years ago. Found myself being influenced too much by other people and wanting to change plots and such on a whim.<br>
<br>
URL for a homepage? Any artist or writer names that you can rattle off for folk to look up and laugh at or 'ohh' and 'ahh' in awe? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ualucard1515.showPublicProfile?language=EN>alucard1515</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator <img src=http://contest.polykarbon.com/badge1.gif></span><br> <font color=#336699>(6/10/02 1:24:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10231.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.undeadart.com/forum/alucard.gif width=100 height=94></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sunglasses.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: LOL</span><hr size=1> I agree with the exaggeration thing to an extent. There's bending rules, then there's breaking them. And the seven heads thing and rules of proportion are simply guidelines. Those are IDEAL proportions. That isn't to say that all characters should follow those proportions, but it's a good rule of thumb. Anything too far away from those guidelines will look grossly innacurate though.<br>
<br>
Dreamwave is basically a group that does Japanese styled artwork. Pat Lee is one, but I can't remember the names of the others. Darkminds, Warlands, uh... those are the only two comics of theirs I can think of right now. <p><table width=100% border=0>
