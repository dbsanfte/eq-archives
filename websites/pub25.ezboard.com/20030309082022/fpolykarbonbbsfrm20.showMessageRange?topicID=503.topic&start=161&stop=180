Well, they're up (2 of them anyway).  Not something to be really proud of, though.  I tried, but no matter all the erasing and redrawing, it still looks pretty poor.  I don't particularly like putting up shoddy material, and this has to be the shoddiest of shoddy.  Frankly, I got so sick and tired of it that I just rushed until the end.  ::shakes head disgustingly::<br>
<br>
Matter of fact, I'm looking up tutorials on hair and hands right now.  I'll make sure my stuff looks quality on my next turn.  <br>

I've already rambled about how bad my first 2 pages were...and with that said, Page 4 is even worse-<br>
<br>
-Confusing panel design<br>
-Incredibly rushed character artwork<br>
-Absolutely <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   zero</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> backgrounds<br>
-Messy lettering and bubbling (even worse than the other pages)<br>
<br>
...with all that said, I can't possibly allow myself to release such a bad page; I've already had to wrestle myself to put those first 2 online.  I'm sorry, but I'm gonna go back to the drawing board and completely redo and overhaul this page.  <br>
<br>
Yes, you're going to have to wait a little bit longer. &quot;<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   &quot;  ::ducks and dodges food and other various objects::  I'll make sure to be more timely this time, as I now have valuable experience from creating the last 2 pages.  Once again, I apologize, especially after seeing how I've been stringing ya'll around for the past week now.  I deeply apologize for that.  I refuse to let a fight with such great potential just die because of my relentless procrastinating.<br>
<br>
*-edit-*  Psyc, if you wanna go ahead and start on page 4 (which would be perfectly fine by me, and is in fact, an encouraged decision), reply here or e-mail me at <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://ShadiKel@aol.com">ShadiKel@aol.com</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> (or both) and I'll send you the Page 4 plot I had in mind.  <br>

I assure you (like I did on the matches forum), don't worry to much about it.  As long as you get the job done you'll have done well.  Piss poor (artistic level) or pro quality good, as long as you've goten it done, you've done well.<br>
<br>
This is merly a practice, so if you've done something and learned from it, well YEAH! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
And seeing that you've already proclaimed that you've learned a lot, well, okay!  Go ahead and bring me my turn, let me give this a go at it.  I've all ready done a few comic panel lay outs, let's see if I can't make some use out of what I've learned from doing 'em! <p>-- A man could live forever, but he only get's to die once.  -- Psycho Soldier

And two notes as far as story go. Uno, ya handled Kiyone and Ori great. I could see her thinking of Aiysa there as the grim reaper. The begging thing was great (although, Kiyone might be a tad more prone to hit the grim reaper <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>

What?  Those pages were @$$-ugly, and the page 4 was so bad that I woudn't even have felt comfortable enough to put it up.  I'm so disgusted with myself right now, you don't even know.  Matter of fact, I'm gonna go practice soon.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Especially</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> on backgrounds.  There's no reason for you to be mad, you have so much potential that can be utilized through daily practice, practice, and more practice.

<br>
Enough with the self-decapitating.  I'm glad you thought I handled Kiyone and Ori good (if rather clumsily).  I really like those chars and their personalities and plan to have them doing major comic relief stuff in the future. <br>

I'm oooooooooooout<br>

That's what the next pages are for <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Don't worry to much about it.  What got me the most was the time you took -_-  One of my good freinds who I'm suppose to be in a match with has taken easily five months and don nothing.  The boy is way to lazy -_-<br>
<br>
So again, I repeat don't worry about it, you're only going to get better byt doing this over and over.  First it looks crapy, then it looks kinda good, then etc. etc.<br>
<br>
Same goes for you Kai. Oh wait YOU KNOW WHAT!  El critqo time.  I'm goona gives guys some areas to look at.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Andrew - Your over all composition is weak.  But this could mostly be due to being a novice.  Things I'd suggest doing...<br>
<br>
Make sure you're using guides lines and make sure you have at least a limited grasp of the human anatomy.  If you want some links to sites that'll help you with this I'll give 'em to you.<br>
<br>
Honestly your work isn't that bad, it just need practice.  Also as far as back grounds do, FORGET ABOUT IT!  one thing at a time <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<br>
Kai - Your anatomy is pretty sound, some of the better anatomy that I've seen on this board.  Where I've seen most fualt is in the construction of your faces (namely from different angles).<br>
<br>
But you do seem to have a strong grasp of the structure of the face, so it's probably you have a lack of drawing a head in 3D.  I.E. seeing it in 3-Dimensions and knowing what all of its' dimensions from different angles.<br>
<br>
Probably best thing to do for this is look at the people around you.  Get 'em to hold still for a moment while you draw their head from what ever angle you're looking at.  Take note of brow lines, jaw line, their lines of symetry and how they're curving around the head, eye line, ear line, hair line, etc. etc.<br>
<br>
That doesn't work?  Get your mirror, camera anything out that'll allow you to look at a head from an extended period of time with out it moving.<br>
<br>
The same can go for hands, just look at what you see and draw it.<br>
<br>
Do both the head and the hand at least 10 times from different angles with different emotions/posistions.<br>
<br>
and as far as back grounds go, FORGET ABOUT IT!  one thing at a time <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I hope some of what I've typed helps -_- <p>-- A man could live forever, but he only get's to die once.  -- Psycho Soldier

Guidlines is what you use to help keep your picture looking neat and symetricle (amongst other things)  As you get better you'll be able to see all the guide lines in your head, but if you're still a little new at drawing, it's probably best to start off using 'em.<br>
<br>
And yes by composistion I mean how all the elements of drawings come together. <p>-- A man could live forever, but he only get's to die once.  -- Psycho Soldier

Oh, I see which post you're referring to.  No, that's a completely different fight, that I dought will ever go any where -_-<br>

As far as the Android fight goes... DD had some he wanted to do, but then he kind just dissapered.  I still have my pages for my turn that I never posted...<br>

Instead of a comic fight, an ANIMATED fight. BWAHAHAHA!!!<br>
But It'll probably be awhile before I have the means to bear down on it. And it'll be hard finding a partner/opponent to do it with...<br>

I have no damn clue why either... I went into my system's folder and found the damn thing, ran it through a diagnostic and checked a few settings, it all came out clean.  <br>

Went back to a few different programs and none were reading the scanner, said something about check the cable, make sure it's plugged in, well it's plugged in, grrr.<br>

Went to my windows, TWAIN folder thing, and as far as my knowledge goes it all looked well, so I don't know what the damn problem is.  If you two have any suggestions I'd be glad to hear it.<br>
