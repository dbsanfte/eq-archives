To tell the truth I dont see a future for Earth, not just humans. I feel if we get pused enough, and mad enough, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Everything</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> will die, because of our anger.<br>

About killing someone i dont think its necassary all the time. There should be an alternative to it, death is a big step. Wheather its guns, swords, sticks, your hands, it doesn't matter. I wont feel better that i did it, i'll feel worse. I would only feel a little better if it was for a good cause. Like its the last choice i have. Like if im trying to get out of a country of oppression and they are forcing me into a corner, and (this might sound crazy) aliens are attacking the world, or dragons, and my kids (i dont have any yet) or familly is just dieing slowly by not doing anything about it. <br>
<br>
Killing is something shouldn't be considered if you have a conflic, you &quot;should&quot; be able to talk things out, but now things are so tense people are quick to pick up guns and get a decleration of war. <p>"Beauty is skin deep, but ugly is to the bone"</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/unecroskel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Necroskel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(8/2/02 9:45:18 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10796.topic&index=42>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.freewebsitehosting.net/websites/Necroskel/jetli.jpg width=85 height=100></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: State of the world</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> It takes longer and you end up tired and covered in blood.

One of the reasons why European Medieval warfare was brought to an end was because of the invention of guns. Knights as a warrior weren't needed anymore. It took years to train a knight. How long does it take to teach someone to fire a gun?<br>

You seem to have some misconceptions about war.<br>
<br>
The point of war is to win at as little cost to yourself as possible, and in real life this invariably involves showering the enemy with projectiles from a safe spot, being hidden, attacking civilians to halt industry, etc. Again, it's always been this way. The people who used to march onto an open field in columns stopped fighting that way because they were getting mauled by the guys shooting from the bushes or firing arrows over a hill.<br>
<br>
Also, you guys still don't give riflemen nearly enough credit. Proper use of a gun requires skill. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/urocketpig.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rocketpig</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(8/2/02 1:58:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10796.topic&index=51>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.rocketpig.net/images/Click-Icon.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: State of the world</span><hr size=1> The only people who think war is honorable and beautiful are the people who have never fought in one. <p>The surest sign of intelligent life in the universe is that none<BR>of it has tried contacting us.<BR>

It's because no one wants to die, or at least get wounded and live the rest of their life without a leg or something.  I believe that guns are cheesy and would probably join the army if we went back to swords and such, because it is more personal and so the senseless killing doesn't happen, so casualties would be lower.  And you won't accident'y kill a civilian, or at least it's not as likely.  Plus you actually have a better chance for survival, you can see your enemy coming, you can see the striking part of his weapon, if you die it's because he was better than you not because he had a better gun.  You can't see some guy way off hiding, and you can't see the bullet.  Then bombs are even more cheesy.    <br>

Well, that's pretty obvious but very oversimplified.<br>

The reason weaponry improves in war is because you want LESS of your troops to die and MORE of the enemies to die or be taken out of action.

Why is medieval warfare so romanticized on message boards like this?  If anything, that was some of the bloodiest, ugliest, and most horrible warfare ever.  No medical attention, blunt objects that were made to crush bones, constant pillaging and senseless murder, etc.<br>

All of this because i apparently &quot;think im good&quot; and should stop living my life because i have no point to my existance because I dont like to Drink and I am against drugs and smoking... <br>

I've fought off a freaking brigade of them only to have all 8 charge at me at once and beat the @#%$ outa me... If you think im lieing try coming here and see for yourself, As soon as school starts that's when I'll be getting harassed untill i fight and than ganged on untill my buds jump in even though i tell them not to... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
