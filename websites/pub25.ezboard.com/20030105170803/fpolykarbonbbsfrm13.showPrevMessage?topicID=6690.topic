face.jpg - I know i missin a line under the eye, i forgot it, but that entire eye is all messed up..blah, that three-fourths views really got me on this one, lol.<br>
<br>
charge.jpg - legs are messed up, they just don't look right. Stomach is messed up IMO, but don't know how to fix so it's crunched like...I would just think more lines?<br>
<br>
durakken.jpg - the face is all messed up and the hair looks unatural..the pose is lame and the blade looks kinda odd...<br>
<br>
So what ya'll think? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=puhfyn>Puhfyn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(12/2/02 2:37:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6697.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: 3 new sketches</span><hr size=1> not bad, but your lines are scratchy and messy.

Well done.<br>
<br>
#2 (charge) needs some work.  <br>
a) It looks like he's standing, looking down, but not in motion.  He should be lifting one of his legs, and pushing at the ground with the other.  <br>
b) As an earlier poster remarked, the pants need fewer folds, not more... also note that once you've changed the legs s one's lifted, and the other is rearward, the lifted leg will have a &gt; &lt; -type fold around the knee...flattened over the knee and thigh, but &gt; &lt; on either side of the knee.  The calf area will be foreshortened and baggy-looking from the front.<br>
<br>
On the REARward leg, the pants will just look baggy, because they're essentially just hanging down from his leg, unless yonder puppy is able to run SO FAST that wind resistance can lift his pantsleg.<br>
<br>
Oh... and his rear panstleg will look a bit thinner than the foward pantsleg, since 1) it's further away and 2) it's getting stretched lengthwise muuuch more than the bent leg is.<br>
<br>
c) The cape has billowy folds on the TOP-REAR, but is curiously FLAT where it hits its lowest point immediately behind his shoulders.  That lowest point should be a bit more up-n-downy (izzat a word ? ;-).<br>
<br>
Also, consider the cape to be like a physical reminder of where he's just been.  As he bounces along in his running, SURE the wind resistance is gonna pull the cape out behind him, but also, his shoulders are gonna make it follow a bouncing pattern as the shoulders are bounced by his legs in motion.<br>
<br>
You've got the back end of the cape far above his head, which is only likely if 1) he's standing over the same steam-grate that got Marilyn Monroe in trouble (inserted for laugh value.  Please don't hit me ;-) or 2) he's just jumped down from somewhere (in which case both his knees would be bent).  <br>
So, to get maximum realism, the cape's rearward edge should fall a bit lower than the shoulders.  Imagine that the cape is like curtains.  Only a tornado force wind could get them to fly out level to the curtainrod, and it's highly unlikely that the curtain could get blown higher than the curtainrod.<br>
<br>
# 3  Yeah... the stomach needs at least one more horizontal bar in view, roughly where the bellybutton would be.   If you have a few bucks, buy a weightlifter magazine, or scan the internet for pictures of Bruce Lee, who had little enough bodyfat that the &quot;bricking&quot; in the stomach-muscles showed.  Nota bene:  Stomach-muscles don't necessarily show folds that go straight across.  Instead, the left- and right- side horizontl lines don't QUITE line up.<br>
<br>
More importantly for the sake of making drawing #3 realistic is the SWORD.  Consider that a sword is a mighty heavy object.  would his hand and arm REALLY look so relaxed ?  Would he REALLY hold it at that angle, effortlessly ?<br>
To see what I mean, try holding the lightest chair in your house by the bottom of one of its legs.  Don't cheat... use only one hand.  Now, look at your arm, hand, and shoulder.  Your hand will have a whiteknuckle, pulse-pounding grip on the chairleg, your swordarm shoulder will drop below the other one, and your arm will wish desperately that you'd either hold the sword perfectly upright, or perfectly DOWN, to take all that ANGLULAR FORCE off it.<br>
<br>
Consider also the handle.  Your sword is what we'd call a hand-and-a-half sword, meaning that it's meant to be weilded by one hand, sometimes two, with the hands slightly overlapping.  Below the handgrip, you've got a nearly massless pointy part that looks cool, but god forbid the swordfighter's hands should slip down there.  There's nothing to stop his hands from getting cut up on the bottom part (called the &quot;pommel&quot;).<br>
<br>
A pommel should be flat, like a nailhead (so it can be pushed, rahter than always slashing), and either practically nonexistent so hands can wrap around it, or heavily weighted so the sword balances nearer to the hand, rather than being topheavy.  Counterbalance makes it alot easier to wield the thang.  Dunno 'bout Japanese swords, but European fencing swords are usually weighted so they balance about 2 inches in front of the handgrip.<br>
<br>
Above the handgrip, you've got a LITTLE flare, so the opponent's blade won't ALWAYS slide down onto his hands, but the flare looks flat, not like a full guard (which should look more like a flat saucer or umbrella).<br>
Also, consider that that flare is also what keeps his hands from sliding forward onto the blade, when he's pushing the lade forward.  Is there enough flare/guard there to really stop his hand from sliding forward ?<br>
<br>
So, yah, the sword looks slick and nasty, like the fender of a '76 corvette, but it's likely to leave this guy ONLY able to slash (not push), and the pointy bits above and below the handgrip are likely to cause him to cut himself AND  get cut up by his opponent's blade as it slides down HIS blade.<br>
<br>
Nota Bene:  One of my favorite tricks in fencing is to do exactly that, to the schmucks who use a French grip and guard.  (Mine's italian*).  I slide my blade down his, then twitch my blade so it jumps around his tiny guard &quot;bell&quot;, and WALA, I can deliver a nasty sting to his hand.  From then on unless he's ambidextrous or on painkillers, he's just moments from being carrion for the crows.<br>
<br>
*French blades have a tiny, tiny bell for guarding the hand, and a really long pommel and handgrip so they counterbalance the forward part of the sword nicely.  This makes them easy to twirl.<br>
Italian blades have a much wider bell, and a crossbar and two loops to further protect the hands AND give the fingers something to push and pul against beside that center shaft.  So, while Frenchies are trying to twirl the blades like straws, and rubbing bruised knuckles, the Italians are collecting trophies. *wink*<br>
On the down-side, Italian handgrips aren't very well balanced (their pommels are short), and the Italian pommles tend to dig into the wrist, causing a permanent bruise on the inner, flat portion of the wrist. It's a small sacrifice for keeping your fingers. :-) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=psoj>psoj</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(12/3/02 7:44:24 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6697.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> re:</span><hr size=1> Puhfyn: <br>

Thanks, I tried to get them clearer and all but they won't come straight...the pen i used to do them was runnin low on ink and i wanted inked within the hour so had no choice....But i'm not that good with getting straight lines, gotta work on that...i tried to use darken and then blur...but sadly i'm still new with photoshop and it sucked...as for the folds I'm still new at those as well...<br>
<br>

<br>
#2 - by charge i meant as in powering up, that is why he is like that, rather than running but still the kneed need to be bent in the quicker sketch i did of the same pose i had em, but i planned to cut off the legs in this one so didn't care much about it....<br>
<br>
#3 - Dang...you went really in depth with the sword thing thanks for that lil history lol...Actually that's not one of my better sword it is there for just to go with the pic...as for his arm being relaxed I hold my sword very relaxed and in that position, it's not that heavy..<br>
<br>
Thanks for the crits guys...<br>
