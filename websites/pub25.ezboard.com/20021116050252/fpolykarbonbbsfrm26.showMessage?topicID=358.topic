Aggregatism<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp At the moment you are able to see but one colour, which one you chose is<br>
irrelevant.  You quickly become bored with this mundane colour and so you explore. <br>
You notice other colours, each one beautiful in it's own way.  Over time you begin to<br>
wonder if there is more to the colours than what can be seen from this perspective and so<br>
you step back to view the big picture.  This same principal can be applied to the origin of<br>
man.  There are three main theories:  Evolutionism, Creationism and Interventionism. <br>
Each theory has some evidence but nothing that can really point the finger to who's right<br>
and who's wrong.  This can't be possible unless instead of one being right they all are and<br>
they all play a certain part in how we became us.  That is the principle behind<br>
Aggregatism.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lets start with the beginning.  In the beginning there was the “big bang” which<br>
created the universe and an aethereal being known as &quot;God&quot;.  He created an aethereal<br>
planet called “Eden” made of basically the same stuff as him and then created Adam and<br>
Eve the first aethereal beings that were in the same form as him.  Those beings<br>
reproduced and created a race of aethereal beings.  These beings were at the time the<br>
only thing God had created and so when they asked him for a planet made from the<br>
material elements of the universe as sort of an experiment.  He granted their request. <br>
God created a planet in much the same way documented in Genesis in the bible. <br>
However the bible is not meant to be taken literally, it took many thousands of years to<br>
create rather than the week time period suggested by the bible.  This still is a rather<br>
impressive time to create a planet and most of it's creatures from scratch. There are a few<br>
things that were left out of the bible though.  He did experiment with taking an existing<br>
planet and creating life on it to save time but that failed (We've come to this planet as<br>
Mars, this would explain traces of life there).  When he did create the Earth he created it<br>
in the same orbit but 180 degrees away from Eden.  When he was satisfied with Earth he<br>
turned control over to his descendants.  This started out disastrous, many species lost<br>
their lives due to some careless management but overall everything went well.  The<br>
beings decided to try something never been done before, create a material version of their<br>
aethereal-selves.  They enlisted the help of God but their comprehension of his<br>
instructions was limited in spite of their advanced nature.  They ended up creating a<br>
hybrid between material and aethereal.  The result was the primate.  They decided to<br>
create also a creature to look after their creation, something that could embody the full<br>
aethereal spirit.  This is how the moose came to be.  They were strong and intimidating<br>
but not frightening, just enough to command respect but not generate hatred.  Over time<br>
the beings learned more about how to create creatures and helped along their primate<br>
creations by evolving them and making small changes to aid their survival.  They were<br>
the only creature to have this privilege all of the others had to evolve themselves.  This<br>
explains why Darwin's theory works with most animals but has holes when applied to<br>
humans and their ancestors.  These moose were highly spiritual and some had to be<br>
sacrificed to help the primitive creatures.  Many times through history the aethereal<br>
beings have appeared to us as &quot;angels&quot; or walked among us has highly enlightened<br>
humans.  These people offered guidance and a glimpse to our past.  As with any story<br>
over time it gets distorted and things become jumbled, some things are added others are<br>
left out.  That is why the bible is so confusing sometimes.  Another problem was that<br>
these guides talked figuratively using metaphors to bring God to a level we can<br>
understand, many took this literally as some still do with the bible.  Yet another problem<br>
with religion is that those who recorded the information interpreted it in their own way,<br>
causing the separation of different faiths.  Much later in development we came along,<br>
humans or homo sapiens.  We worked in harmony with the guides for a long time.  We<br>
learned from them and they helped us build great temples.  We eventually outgrew the<br>
guides though, as we found new ways to make more and more magnificent structures and<br>
other useful things.  As we began to depend on them less they appeared less.  When they<br>
did appear they were met with large amounts of scepticism, nobody believed anymore.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This is the aggregatism theory and as with many others it does have some holes,<br>
for example This is theory encompasses all three of the major theories in an aggregate to<br>
mix together and become one big theory.  That does seem rather unbelievable but so does<br>
the notion that we just appeared here on the planet in our current form or that we<br>
happened to come about through random inbreeding of monkeys.  Just to explain how<br>
this theory relates to the other three I will point out some examples of each.  For<br>
creationism there are many examples, like god creating the aethereal beings and the<br>
planet with most of it’s creatures as well as the beings creating us.  As for evolution<br>
everything evolves by itself except us and we evolve through intervention.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Did we just appear here due to some divine whim.  Did we evolve from apes and<br>
we just happen to be the fittest of our ancestors at the moment.  Have we been watched<br>
and tended to like pets of a larger being.  Or is it a bizarre combination of the above. <br>
These are all theories, as of now none is right or wrong.  In combining them all for a big<br>
picture perspective though we may see things more clearly.<br>

That is a neat way of looking at the whole creation mystery. There is really no point in arguing the validity, since it seems to just be for fun. As a christian I can tell you its pure heresy, but its just funny to wack with the teacher.<br>
<br>
What grade are you in? What class was this for? I cant imagine any teacher at my school even giving an assignment like that, much less taking it seriously. <p><BR>

We had a cool teacher and we spent most of the course doing presesntations and debates...no real writing stuff...<br>
the assignment was to pick ONE of the three theorys and outline the theory and who are the big names in it (eg. darwin) why you support it ect. That was the actual assignment...I thought it was really boring so I decided to make up my own...which was an easy way to get around doing research and trying to remember peoples names...<br>
the three theorys were crationism (we were made by a higher being as we are with no evolution)...interventionism (we evolved with help from a higher being)...evolutionism (we evolved by random inbreeding)...<br>

if you get a teacher that does most of the work verbally then it's a lot less writing (I hate writing)...and also a lot less homework...but maybe you hate talking and debating things and arguing with people...then a teacher that makes you write lots of essays would be good...
