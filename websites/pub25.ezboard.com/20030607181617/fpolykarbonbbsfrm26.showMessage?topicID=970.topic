I've also written a few more parts to it since the last time I posted this story. I've changed a few parts around and tried to correct every possible error. I'd like someone to crit my narrative and to correct me on any errors, both major and minor.<br>

Oh yeah; contains graphic language (especially in the last part of chapter 2. It'll be censored, though) and violence (though I don't get very descriptive).<br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Chapter I: Life Lost Forever</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Thrown to the ground, the young man fell violently against the dirt and gravel alley. As he paced himself trying to stand again, his attackers struck him down once more. “Stay down!” They yelled as they beat him to the ground. Short of breath, he now lay prostrate, barely able to take in breath. “Thought you could run away from us, did you? We’ll hunt down all of our clients until we get our money,” said one of the young man’s attackers. “Yeah,” added another. “You don’t mess with the yakuza and get away with it! Even if you run all the way from Kyoto to Tokyo!” <br>
        The young man, Hiru, now picked himself up and sat straight, leaning up against the wall of the open alley. “Well, it isn’t my fault that you guys are so damn persistent,” said Hiru. “After all, it was only a few hundred yen-” he continued, barely able to finish his sentence before being kicked in the face. “That kind of attitdue’ll get you killed. We’ll give you just one more day to get our money. After that,” he said, motioning his thumb across his throat, “You’re dead along with your little brother.” Hiru was taken back, shocked that they would lay a finger on his innocent younger brother. <br>
        “You leave Kojiro out of this!” He demanded. “Sorry kid,” said the leader of the small gang of yakuza thugs, “But that’s your own problem.”  Walking to Hiru, he knelt down, grabbing Hiru's bloody cheek. “Just give us our money and you’ll walk away alive.” <br>
        “In just one day?!” Hiru angrily questioned him. Backing away, the yakuza thug cocked his head back and smirked. “Like I said. It’s your own problem,” he repeated himself, gathering his posse and fleeing as he turned his back and deserted Hiru.<br>
        Hiru now frustrated and depressed, slams his fist against the wall. “God damnit!” He yelled at full volume, knowing well that he could never get enough money in time. As if losing all hope, Hiru let himself fall and gently dropped to the dirt ground. He stared into the orange sky, and watched the sun bury itself under the horizon. From behind, Kojiro approached. “Are you okay? You can sure take a beating.”<br>
<br>
        Dusk quickly turned to dark, and it became night. It was probably around August or October, because all of the leaves were falling from the trees and there was a slight chill running through the wind. The year was 1872, also known as the fifth year of the Meiji era. Japan had just gone through some major changes and was previously involved in a vicious civil war where many men and women died. This war was known as the Bakumatsu.<br>
        Hiru and Kojiro walked the streets looking for a place to sleep—somewhere out of the wind. They do this every night, since they really don’t have a home to go to. You see, these two boys were orphaned at a young age after their mother died. Their father had died in the war when they were only one and two years old, so all they had to rely on anymore was each other. Hiru was walking beside his brother and glanced over at Kojiro for a few seconds. He had a look on his face that had <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I’m sorry</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> written all over it. Kojiro noticed this. “What’s wrong?” He asked. Hiru sighed and moaned, wishing he didn’t have to say those words. “Nothing,” he replied. After a few moments, however, Hiru continued. “I was the one who got us into all of this mess. I’m real sorry, Kojiro.”<br>
        “I know you’re sorry, but it’ll be all right. Won’t it?” Hiru shrugged and rubbed the back of his head. “This time, I’m not so sure.”<br>
        Suddenly, thrown through a wood and rice paper door, a yakuza thug flew into the street. As he hit the ground, Hiru quickly noticed the danger at hand and grabbed his brother by the arm. The both of them ducked into an alley undetected. “B-Boss! Please, no!” The thug desperately panicked. Through the large tear in the door stepped a tall man draped in a khaki trench coat. The yakuza thug scrambled backwardly as Sozoku, his pursuer, inched closer. “I’ve been wasting my time with you. You’re not worth keeping alive,” Sozoku said. Throwing the side of his coat open, he revealed a Japanese sword strapped to his belt. “What are you doing, Sozoku? You know my brother is your boss! He’ll kill you for this!” Sozoku ignored him and leisurely drew his sword. “I don’t care who your brother is. You’re getting in the way!”<br>
        “Wait! Think about what you’re about to-” Before he could finish, Sozoku immediately ran him through. He stood hunched over the body with his sword lunged through the man’s chest, waiting for his victim to breathe his last breath. After the man fell limp, Sozoku pulled the blade out of the body and casually wiped the blood off of his sword. He faced his crew inside the building, turning his back towards the corpse. “Clean him up and stuff him somewhere.” After sheathing his sword, Sozoku noticed Hiru and Kojiro peering from the alley corner. He made no effort to dispatch of the two children, and took little notice of them. Perhaps he’ll kill them later. The group carried the body out of the secluded street and headed towards a dumpster to throw it away like it was common trash, but it was then that they heard a whistle being blown. It sounded like a sharp steam whistle, but it wasn’t. “The cops!” Yelled one of the men. Dropping the body in the middle of the street, they scattered around like rats and fled the scene. Sozoku was casually walking away until Hiru finally spoke out to him. “Hey!” Sozoku stopped and turned his head halfway around. “Someday, when we meet again. I’ll kill you,” he said. Sozoku quickly fled the scene, leaving Hiru and Kojiro panicked, trying to find a way to escape as well or else they might be held responsible for the murder. “Hiru! What now?”<br>
        “Hell if I know, bro’!” Coming around the corner were the policemen. They were dressed in the cliché blue coats and round hats that were quite common during this time. “Wait right there! We heard some noise, so what’s going on here?” They then noticed the corpse lumped over in the middle of the street, with blood still pouring out from the wound. Hiru didn’t know what to do, and tried the best he could to explain, which wasn’t very good at all. “Aw crap, it wasn’t us! The guys who did it just took off!”<br>
        “That’s pretty hard to believe, kid.” Muttered another policeman, reaching for the metal baton at his side. “Hear us out! I swear we didn’t do it!” After a few moments of silence, Hiru grabbed Kojiro’s hand and took off running. “C’mon!” Slowly, the grip of his brother’s hand started to slip, until… “Hiru!”<br>
        As soon as he began to run, the voice that called out to him forced him to stop dead in his tracks. Hiru turned his head, knowing very well what he was going to see. The policemen had caught Kojiro, and they already began to cuff him in wooden shackles. “That’s right,” said one of the policemen. “Don’t take off without your friend.” Hiru wanted to fight. He balled his fists, but soon came to senses and gave himself up.<br>
<br>
        It was a long journey back to the police station, being dragged all the way. Upon entering, Hiru and Kojiro noticed the other criminals being thrown around. It was their turn. They were dragged into a back room and thrown in a cell with wooden bars. Upon being introduced to their dungeon, they noticed the loneliness of their quarters. It seemed as though all of the other cells were empty and silent, though there were a few other criminals in there as well. “This is just great. Things went from bad to worse,” Hiru muttered. He folded his arms behind his head and let himself down on the dirt floor, allowing his brother to rest in the bed. “At least we won’t be cold. We’ve got a decent place to sleep for the night,” he continued, trying to be optimistic. “Hiru, what do you think they’ll do with us?”<br>
        “Hell if I know. Either let us rot in here forever or end up choppin’ our heads off.” Kojiro expected that answer; after all, it <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>was</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> coming from Hiru. Fairly comfortable with their prison, Hiru and Kojiro expected a quiet and peaceful night ahead of them. But the next morning would not be so serene.<br>
        As they began to settle in their cell, a figure loomed from the darkness in the cell across from them. This figure was a man who was sitting up straight in his cot with his back pressed against the wall and his eyes closed. He had long, silky white hair that draped over his shoulders, with parted bangs that reached past his cheeks. His amber eyes slowly opened, and his stare shifted toward Hiru. After a few moments, however, he closed his eyes again and turned his head aside, attempting to let himself sleep. The lights in the jailhouse went out, and all became dark. Daybreak was stealthily on its way.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Chapter II: Against a River of Anguish</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Rounded up like cattle, a small lot of the jailhouse prisoners were taken outside to relatively open area with one fence made of wood and flora enclosing part of the plot. In the center of the area stood a man with a naked blade—obviously an executioner, and off to the side of him was the warden who was safeguarded by a few security guards. <br>
        Shackled with wooden cuffs, the prisoners were lined up against the building. There were about seven of them in total, including Kojiro and Hiru. Kojiro looked at his brother after letting his eyes wander around the place, trying to figure out what was going on. “Hey, Hiru, what’s happening?” Hiru ignored his brother for a second, slightly annoyed by his innocent ignorance. He sighed, and told his brother what was about to unfold in a rather abrupt manner. “Looks like our heads are ‘bout to be chopped off.” Kojiro was taken back for a second, and a bead of sweat ran down his face. For a moment, he thought his brother was joking around, but soon realized that he was being serious. “Why?” Kojiro asked. “We didn’t do anything wrong, so why are they doing this?” He pleaded Hiru for an answer, but his brother simply shrugged, not knowing the reason himself. <br>
        From behind Hiru and Kojiro came a low, calming voice. “It’s simple,” the voice said. As they looked back, they saw the man of silky white hair who stayed in the cell across from them last night, though they didn’t even notice him the night before. He continued. “They’re going to clean this place out.” <br>
        “What do you mean?”<br>
        “These men usually take orders from the Koutsu, which is a part of the government that regulates this police station. The Koutsu, as of now, are away somewhere for the entire week, which allows these fools to do whatever they want. Just so you know, they’ve been wanting to clean this place out for a long time now. That’s the gung-ho government of today. Not much different from the Tokugawa if you ask me.” Hiru was wondering how and why this man knew as much as he did, but Kojiro took no notice of it and was shaking in uncontrollable fear. “That’s horrible! We didn’t even do anything!” He exclaimed. “Whatever,” The white haired stranger muttered. “I don’t care, and neither do they.” Kojiro was in a panic, sweating heavily and panting franticly. “Hiru, did you hear him. They’re gonna kill us.” Hiru sneered off to the side, not wanting to face the facts: that he <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>was</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> going to die. <br>
        The first man was taken up to the executioner. They forced him to kneel down and turn his back toward his slayer. The executioner gripped his weapon and raised it over his shoulder—all the way behind his back until finally, he struck. One swift slash was all that was needed to sever the head, and so the first inmate was dead. Hiru began counting in his head, picking out which number he would be. The stranger with white hair was standing beside him, acting calm and showing no fear or panic at all. “What’s up with you? Aren’t you just a little bit afraid?” Hiru asked. “Of course not.” The man fixed his attention to Hiru. “You aren’t either. What’s you’re name?”<br>
        “My name? It’s Hagara Hiru, but why the heck would you want to know?” The white haired stranger stared at Hiru for a few seconds, looking him over and studying him for some bizarre reason. He noticed his ice blue eyes and messy black hair. “Nothing,” he replied. “No reason.” Hiru turned his nose up for a second, but then sharply leaned right up to the man’s face, which caught him by surprise as he almost fell down because of it. “What about you?” Hiru asked. “Do you have a name?” The stranger simply smirked and let a quiet chuckle escape from his lips. “Jinshira will do.”<br>
        Unaware that time was running short, it came time for the next execution. “Number four!” Shouted the warden. Hiru was shocked when he heard his number. “You, kid with the pointy hair!” He was paralyzed with fear, but managed to muster enough courage to stagger up to the executioner. As Hiru knelt down, time seemed to stop for a moment. Kojiro’s nerves were broken, and he was trembling, barely able to hold in his tears. His brother was about to be killed, and in front of his very eyes. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>This is all happening too fast</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, he thought, and tried to convince himself that it wasn’t.<br>
        Slowly, the executioner raised his sword. By this time, Hiru was on edge and almost dying from the suspense. It was tearing at him like a tiger, and all he wanted right now was for this whole ordeal to be over with quickly. “Oh damnit!” He exclaimed, clamping his eyes shut, “Just get on with it!” Finally, the steel came down, and then came the sound of blood splatter. Hiru’s eyes slowly opened to find that he was unharmed! He was still kneeling down and now stunned by what had just unfolded. Standing next to him was the man who called himself Jinshira, who had run up to the scene and used his wooden shackles to block the strike of the executioner’s blade. The sword had cut through the cuffs, and slashed his face diagonally crosswise his original scar, which ran across the brow of his nose. “You won’t touch this boy,” he muttered. Promptly acting without hesitation, Jinshira quickly disarmed the executioner. He took the sword up as his own and struck him down in one powerful slash. The upper half of the executioner’s body split apart evenly as Jinshira routed him. His slash was nothing less than perfect, and it was apparent how powerful this man really was. Passing his fingers across his new wound, Jinshira felt a stinging pain that forced his head to jerk back. This was a pain he had felt many times before, but this time it seemed just a little worse. “Yeah. It’s almost just like before.”<br>
        The warden was enraged. He could not have ever imagined that anyone would try something so radical as this. “Stop right there! What do you think you are doing number seven?” Jinshira snapped back almost immediately after the warden finished speaking. “The name is Hokuten Jinshira! You’ll do well to remember it.” The tension between the warden and Jinshira gradually built up, both of them staring each other down for the longest while. Blowing a whistle, the warden called for backup, and out from the building came a group of policemen armed with swords. Jinshira snickered in disgust. “Morons, do you want to get killed? Lay down your arms!” There was a brief moment of suspense, but ignoring Jinshira’s warning, the warden ordered the attack. “Seize him! Tear him to shreds for all I care!” At that moment, the armed police charged after Jinshira and attacked. Slash after slash was perfectly deflected and returned by the scarred swordsman, until all were defeated. Jinshira was standing near the mound of bodies when he flashed the warden an ominous glare. This glare, the warden thought, was purely evil; you could see the wickedness and hate in his eyes. “The one named Hiru is coming with me,” Jinshira said. “Do whatever the hell you want with the other.” Hiru quickly jerked his head up in shock of what Jinshira said—upset that the man who just saved his life would say something so cold. “No way! I’m not going anywhere without Koji-” Before he could finish, Hiru was struck in the stomach by Jinshira. As Hiru fainted, Jinshira picked him up and threw him over his shoulder. “I’m sorry.” The warden was not about to let Jinshira get away, however. “Stop right there! Someone get him!” But before anyone could make a move, Jinshira had already fled the scene leaving behind a trail of dust. As the smoke settled, everyone stood helpless with eyes wide open. They were both gone.<br>
<br>
…<br>
<br>
Night had come again, and the warehouse was dim with little light. Sozoku stood in front of a desk, draped in his oversized trench coat. “What do you mean by problems?” He asked. Behind the wooden desk was Horigoshi Bunzo, the leader of the downtown Tokyo yakuza syndicate, and also the brother of the man who Sozoku had killed last night. “What do you think I mean?” Bunzo asked almost rhetorically. Sozoku sneered off to the side, utterly disgusted with his boss. “Pfft! It’s because I killed that guy, isn’t it?”<br>
        “Of course it’s because of that! Did you think that you would get away with killing my brother?” Bunzo roared. After standing silent for what seemed to be the longest while, Sozoku finally spoke. “So what now, are you going to kill me?”<br>
        “That’s the plan,” Bunzo said snapping his fingers. At that time, Bunzo’s two cohorts came forward from behind him, both reaching for their sheathed swords. Sozoku raised his hand, and as he did, the apprehensive assassins pushed out their blades with their thumbs, preparing to strike him down. Sozoku, with his hand raised, passed it through his slicked down, short black hair, taunting the men. “Pfft.” Ultimately annoyed by Sozoku’s arrogant attitude, the men dashed after him, fully drawing their swords. Sozoku slowly leaned back and tugged on his coat. Before the assassins reached Sozoku, he slung his jacket in their faces. Startled and blinded, the assassins struggled to free themselves, however, as they managed to do so, Sozoku had already begun his assault. He was gliding in-between the two men, and slashed the one on the right first. He then turned a full 360 degrees and impaled the other from behind. Kicking the man off of his blade, he casually turned towards Bunzo, who was in an extreme panic at this time. Sozoku knelt down and picked up his bloodstained coat, shaking it off as he stood up. Bunzo then quickly pulled out a revolver from his desk and aimed it straight at Sozoku’s head. <br>
        “Don’t try anything!” He yelled as he pulled the trigger. The gun went off, and after the loud crash, there was a long silence. Sozoku’s face bled from the cut that the bullet made as it slashed his cheek. Bunzo cocked his weapon and aimed it at Sozoku once more. “Next time, I’ll hit you between the eyes!” He shouted. “Doesn’t seem as though you’re a good shot.”<br>
        “You’re as good as dead!” A second shot was fired. Sozoku stood unharmed, but Bunzo was dead with Sozoku’s sword stuck in his chest. Sozoku casually dug into his jacket and pulled out a pack of cigarettes. He lit one, and took a long drag. “A horrible shot.” Leaving his sword behind, Sozoku left the warehouse.<br>
<br>
…<br>
<br>
Outside in the night sky, rain was pouring down hard on the streets. Hiru was still unconscious, and propped up against a wall next to an alley, while Jinshira was crouched over a puddle of water cleaning off his bloody face. “This new wound isn’t going to leave, either,” he said to himself, rubbing his face clean. For a few more moments, he stared into the puddle of water, thinking deeply back on the day he received his first scar. Hiru moaned and shifted, slightly opening his eyes as he came to. “So, you finally woke up.” Jinshira said, turning his head to Hiru. “You really like to sleep, don’t you?” Hiru quickly jerked to full consciousness and sat up straight. “You!” He shouted out to Jinshira, who casually turned his head around and shook out his hair. He passed his hand through his tresses and then pulled the lot of it back, tying his hair in a high ponytail. “You seem angry,” he commented afterwards. Hiru quickly stood up and lifted his fist up to his face as if he was threatening Jinshira. “Where’s Kojiro?!” Jinshira stood up from his slouch over the puddle of water, remaining silent. Hiru then collapsed and fell to his hands and knees, angrily punching the muddy ground. “What the hell is wrong with you? Why did you just leave him there!” Jinshira moaned under his breath and then began to walk away, but was stopped by Hiru and his continued insults. “@#%$ you!” Hiru bawled out at Jinshira. “Why the hell did you save me? You should have let me die there!” Jinshira paused, remaining silent for a quite long time. “You are still ignorant, Hiru.” He turned himself around and stepped over to Hiru, placing his hand on his shoulder. “I’m sorry,” he said. “I truly have nothing personal against you.” Jinshira then gripped his fist tight and punched Hiru in the stomach once more. Hiru began to fall unconscious again as Jinshira spoke to him. “But you must prepare yourself to kill me. Some day, I will come for you.”<br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Chapter III: A New Life</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
The morning sunlight beamed through the window of an unfamiliar house. It stretched across the room towards a futon where a young man was lying down in. As the sunlight shined across his face, the young man slowly woke up and tossed himself around in bed a bit before opening his eyes. Pulling the sheets off of his face, the young man revealed himself to be none other than Hiru. He sat up straight and held his head, sort of rubbing his forehead as well, trying to wake himself up. It was then he realized that he was not waking up in an alley or street corner as he had expected to, and became extremely curious as to where he was, since the last thing he remembered was his confrontation with Jinshira. He didn’t want to get out of bed, however, since it had been almost four or five years since he had slept in one. Hiru managed to step away from the bed and walked towards the window. He slid the window open and peered outside, finding himself in a place that felt somewhat familiar to him. For a few moments then on, he tried to pull out of his head why this place seemed so familiar, but to no avail. He gave up and walked across the room towards the door, sliding it open and looking down the hallway. “Hello?” He shouted down the corridor. It was just then that someone walked out into the hallway—an elderly woman who was carrying a basket of laundry. “Oh!” She exclaimed as she noticed Hiru. Running up to him, she put down her load of laundry and placed her hand on Hiru’s forehead. “Are you feeling okay?” She asked. Hiru backed off for a moment and placed his own hand on his forehead for some reason. The elderly woman lightly bowed at Hiru and apologized to him. “I’m sorry, this must be very awkward for you.” She rose from her light bow and greeted him. “Let my introduce myself. My name is Ichijo.” Hiru was still feeling out of place and looked to the side as he replied to the old lady. “I’m Hagara Hiru.” Ichijo knelt down and picked up the basket of laundry that she put down a moment ago. “Well, it’s certainly nice to finally known your name. You’ve been asleep for two days straight, now.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Where am I?” Hiru asked, still wondering about why this placed seemed so familiar to him, and now a bit more curious as to how he ended up wherever he was. Ichijo staggered a bit, having trouble holding up her heavy basket of laundry. Hiru quickly rushed to her aid and helped so that she would not drop it or hurt herself. “Oh, thank you. What a nice boy you are.” Hiru turned his nose up at Ichijo, a little steamed about being called a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>boy</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. “I’m not a little boy! I’m fifteen years old!” Ichijo took up the basket of laundry and apologized to Hiru once again. “I’m sorry,” she said, smiling. “Why don’t you join my husband and I for breakfast? You must be incredibly hungry.” Ichijo smiled again and turned around, walking down the hall as Hiru watched her from the door. Before turning the corner, she paused for a moment and turned her head around towards Hiru. “Oh, that’s true. I almost forgot you asked about where you were,” she began, “You’re at our house in Kyoto, so please make yourself home.” Ichijo smiled at Hiru once more and then turned back around, continuing down the hall until turning the corner and walking out of sight. “In Kyoto,&quot; Hiru muttered to himself. &quot;I’m In Kyoto?” He had a hard time sinking this information in, as the name of the city obviously meant something special to him; be it good or not.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The table was just prepared for breakfast—decorated with rice balls and miso soup. Ichijo sat herself down after just setting the table, and her husband Kenja, having already said his grace, was well into eating his food by now. Ichijo poured her husband’s drink, and then her own. She needn’t give thanks for the meal since it was she who prepared it. After gulping down half of his glass of tea and setting it down, Kenja let loose an immense sigh. “Say, Ichijo, didn’t you tell me that young boy woke up? Where is he? Isn’t he going to come eat?” Ichijo turned her head to look over at Hiru’s spot on the table that she prepared for him, wondering if he was going to get out of his room and come to breakfast. “I don’t know.” Kenja reached over with his chopsticks to Hiru’s plate, but Ichijo batted his hand away with her own pair. “He must be getting hungry, though.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp From around the corner of the hallway and into the breakfast room came Hiru. He was a little surprised when he saw all of the food that was on his plate, and hurried over to his seat and gave thanks. “Itadakimasu!” He shouted out before shoving food into his mouth. Ichijo then leaned over the table and poured Hiru’s drink. “I knew you had to have been hungry—just look at you.” Hiru took up the tall glass of tea and washed down his food, calming down for a moment after realizing that he was making an animal out of himself. “I’m sorry. It’s just that I haven’t had a good meal in a long time.” Ichijo smiled and nodded her head. “Don’t even dare apologize. Go ahead and fill yourself up.”<br>
<br>
Edit: I just noticed a pretty bad error and corrected it.<br>
Edit2: Some parts should flow much better. I fixed some more faults in my narrative.<br>
Edit3: Yet more errors corrected. This should be the last of them... Sorry.<br>
Edit4: Yeah another. This time it was a tiny error in which I changed a -ing to -ed and fixed the subject-verb agreement.<br>
Edit5: Another edit... Get that... Actually, I just added some more stuff... Not much, just about two paragraphs. and a few extra stuff squeezed in wherever. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kagebu>Kagebu</A> at: 5/27/03 2:00:43 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=trunks853>Trunks853</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.lelola.com/db/trunksgal/trunks11.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(4/13/03 5:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=970.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> hey</span><hr size=1> hey man ive been interested in Datenshi for a while but still have seen no sign of its realease on yur site im always checkin though so can you tell me when i can see it or if you changed your site address<br>

I'm pretty caught up in school and in my writing Datenshi, so I doubt I can help you out very much on your project, but I'll see what I can do if you email me at sausage_mcmuffin@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
Thanks for staying interested in Datenshi for so long, and for appreciating my work. I'll be working on it alot over the summer, and I'll post everything up here for crits so everyone who visits this board will be the first ones to read it before I get it published and printed.<br>
<br>
I'd also like for people to give their opinions on how you think each character came off and your opinions on them, because I want my characters to seem as realistic as possible. I tried to make them have defined personalities, and am trying to see if I did a good job with them so much that people could easily identify their personalities. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kagebu>Kagebu</A> at: 4/13/03 5:45:09 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=emmapeel1601>emmapeel1601</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.geocities.com/garaigh/emma2.txt" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(4/13/03 8:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=970.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/garaigh/buddy2.txt height=127 width=107></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: hey</span><hr size=1> hmmm. interesting. <br>
your writing style is a bit inconsistent, but that something that is fixed only with practice. <br>
<br>
just a few things in the story that i'm not sure fit historically. <br>
1. trench coats. don't think these were around in the 1870s, particularly not in Japan. <br>
2. Japanese policemen don't use wooden batons. they use(d) little metal batons. and they didn't wear blue uniforms and funny hats. <br>
3. why would Sozuko leave his sword behind? that's an extremely un-Japanese thing to do. <br>
<br>
anyway, it's an interesting story. just needs some more polishing. <br>

Since we're dealing with the Yakuza, I don't see how it wouldn't be impossible for someone to get their hands on a trench coat.<br>
<br>
I guess that I'll change the wooden tonfa to a metal one. I'm not so sure what they wore at this point, so I went with what I have read and watched from Rurouni Kenshin <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
This novel was inspired from that manga, anyways.<br>
<br>
Sozoku is leaving the yakuza at this point, so it's pretty much a slap in the face to them by making it clearly evident who killed Bunzo. He's also a fairly reckless person, if you had not picked up on that (I thought his personality was the most clearly defined... Maybe I need to work on that.) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=emmapeel1601>emmapeel1601</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.geocities.com/garaigh/emma2.txt" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(4/14/03 3:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=970.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/garaigh/buddy2.txt height=127 width=107></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: hey</span><hr size=1> ah. i think the confusion comes from the word &quot;trench coat&quot; which i associate with the style worn in the 30s and 40s. i think what you actually are referring to is a cowboy &quot;duster.&quot; that would make a lot more sense. <br>
<br>
as far as the policemen are concerned, i just think you should check out some more historical sources. even though Japan did open up in some ways during the Mejei era they were not eager to embrace Western culture. but i could be wrong about the uniforms. <br>

Heck, Watsuki got away with it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
I didn't intend for Sozoku to be wearing a trail duster.<br>
<br>
Anyways, I went and checked to make sure that policemen wore those round hats and western jackets, and sure enough... I was right ^_^ <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.miburo.com/info/9500.jpg">www.miburo.com/info/9500.jpg</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
I found a picture of the actual squad that Saitou Hajime belonged to when he guised himself under the name of Fujita Goro. They're all wearing the forementioned hats and jackets.<br>
<br>
Also, I fixed some narrative errors I had, including some punctuation that was uncalled for (I used a semicolon where a comma was supposed to go at... Stupid me, ne?) It should read better at some parts now.<br>
<br>
Edit: Sorry for bumping this over and over again, but I went over the story and came up with more errors that I corrected.

<br>
I also would like more crits on the characters and my narrative and storyline (I understand my narrative in inconsistent at times and choppy... but anything other than that. Do I give enough info, too much, or not enough. Too much indirect characterization? nah.)<br>
<br>
Thanks for putting up with the length of the story, all those who've read it.<br>
<br>
Edit:<br>
Oh yeah, I also started writing the spinoff novel to Datenshi entitled Howl of a Wolf (Hoeru no Ookami) which centers around the Shinsengumi and Sozoku (who is a former member of the Shinsengumi, and is the most in-depth and most interesting character... At least I think so. He's my favorite.)<br>
At anyone's request, I'll post it on this board, but keep in mind it's not that much (about 550 words or so) <p><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.datenshidojo.cjb.net" target="top">Datenshi Online</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kagebu>Kagebu</A> at: 5/27/03 2:13:52 pm<br></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showPrevMessage?topicID=970.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showNextMessage?topicID=970.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=970.topic&index=8><img src=http://www.polykarbon.com/bbsimage/addreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.emailToFriend?topicID=970.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.threadControl?topicID=970.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=970.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=970.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub25.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="polykarbonbbsfrm18">PK-BBS Rules and Regulations!<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm27">Board F.A.Q.s<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm3">News and Updates<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm2">Photoshop and Art questions<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm4">General Manga/Anime Discussion<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm5">Japanese Language Help<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm23">art in progress<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm13">Black and White Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm14">Color Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm19">Member's Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm17">Moderators Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm6">Member Photos<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm31">Help, Hints and Cheats<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm20">Challenges<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm21">Matches<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm26">Writer's Forum<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm32">VG Discussion<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm35">Member Created Tutorials<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm39">What is Fight Club?<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm40">Story Ideas</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#336699>- </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs>Polykarbon BBS</a><font color=#336699> - </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26>Writer's Forum</a> <font color=#336699> - </font><a href="http://www.polykarbon.com">Polykarbon: Manga & Photoshop</a><font color=#336699> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
