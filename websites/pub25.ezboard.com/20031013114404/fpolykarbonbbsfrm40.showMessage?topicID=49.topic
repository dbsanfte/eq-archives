<br>
any feedback you may be able to offer at this point is welcome. (the first paragraph is kind of to set the tone, give you a general idea of the background. the following paragraphs lay out the culture a little more.)<br>
<br>
BTW, please don't think that Eden is supposed to be Earth 'cause it isn't. this story has nothing to do with &quot;our&quot; universe or reality. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

____________________________________________________<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The ancient texts teach us that the cold hell-fire they call space was not always our home. Once, when we were young and pure, we lived in paradise. But Mankind sinned and we were driven out, to wander amoung the stars for all eternity. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This is the tale of Mankind after Eden. <br>
<br>
THE WORLD(S)<br>
Mankind lives aboard a single, giant ship called The Ark. There are other planets, some of them less inhabitable than others. Some are peopled, some are not. <br>
<br>
Humans have settled on a few worlds but only in small numbers and they are called Braheyder, or traitors for having abandoned their people to live with strangers. <br>
<br>
<br>
GOVERNMENT/RELIGION<br>
Mankind is ruled by the Council of Nine which draws its members from the different sectors of the societal structure. Below the Council are the various Guilds who supervise the order of all things. <br>
<br>
The Council is based on a religion, Aidmheil (which means Faith), that has been gleaned from the oral histories. All of the council members are Caileadair, religious leaders who guide the Guilds and control the masses. <br>
<br>
There is a second religion, one that is discouraged by the Council of Nine but allowed to remain so long as its followers adhere to the rulings of the Aidmheil. This second religion worships the Mother and Child (Mathair i Leanabhan), a mystical pair who supposedly look after their followers, protecting them from harm and granting them good fortune. <br>
<br>
LANGUAGES<br>
Mankind has slowly distilled one language that is a piecemeal of several others. The different classes also have very different accents and slang, some of them using more of the original languages than others. <br>
<br>
There is also a universal language amoung the spacing peoples known as Common. It has an odd syntax and uses no contractions. <br>
<br>
CAILEADAIR<br>
The Caileadair are born in a very specific and ceremonial fashion. They have special powers conferred on them through the crystal which has fused with their bodies. The crystal would normally kill a person but if introduced while a person is still in an embryonic state doesn’t produce the deadly reaction. <br>
<br>
The Caileadair are created by selecting the most promising women (those who already display “gifts”) who are then impregnated and fed a mixture of powdered crystal and blood from the current Caileadair. The blood slows the mother’s reaction to the crystal allowing her to carry the child to term, while the crystal fuses with the embryo. <br>
<br>
In almost every case the children born are male (a fact which is attributed divine significance). On very, very rare occasions a female child has been born. These are not considered Caileadair but called Fadeyr instead. <br>
<br>
FADEYR<br>
There have only been three Fadeyr born in the past five hundred years. They are considered to be heretics by the Caileadair since they invariably end up as followers of Mathair i Leanabhan. <br>
<br>
Fadeyr are stronger than Caileadair and therefore much feared by the Council. Fadeyr also tend to be much loved by the people. <br>
<br>
THE HORDE<br>
Considered by many to be mythical, The Horde is what supposedly drove Mankind out of Eden. There are corresponding legends amoung the other spacing peoples that indicate that The Horde might be real. However, since The Horde hasn’t been seen in centuries many believe that it has been destroyed or never existed in the first place. <br>

I'm not that great at making stories, but i can appreciate a good one when i see it. It sounds like you've had this story brewing in your head for some time...<br>

 what are these crystals that are fused to the women and why do they give the people power.\?<br>

 who is the main character?<br>

 how does the storyline go. like do the humans get back home or what? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=emmapeel1601>emmapeel1601</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.geocities.com/garaigh/emma2.txt" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(6/15/03 8:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm40.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=49.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/garaigh/buddy2.txt height=127 width=107></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: dude thats cool</span><hr size=1> well, i still don't have a really solid storyline in place yet. but i have the beginning laid out. the general idea is that the main character (a young woman called Naiom) loses her faith and goes on a journey to try and recover it. <br>
<br>
the first few chapters will look something like this as far as plot is concerned.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The engineers get very sick. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Naiom does what she can but she can’t save them. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Evidence comes to light that perhaps the engineers were poisoned. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Naiom confronts the Caileadair. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp They throw the blame back on her, taunting her for her inability to save her people. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Naiom becomes convinced that she is not fit to lead her people and that she must leave for a while.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The Caileadair make arrangements to ensure that Naiom never comes back. <br>
<br>
that's about as far as i've gotten. i think there will be a homeworld discovered but i'm not certain yet. <br>
it's kind of a big idea and it's taking me a while to wrap my mind around it. <br>
<br>
the crystal is kind of a magic thing, though the people don't think of it in those terms. basically it gives the people it bonds with very special powers. the actual how of the bonding is not particularly important right now. the characters accept it as natural and that's all we really need to know. <br>
<br>
anyway, i'm posting a brief segment of the actual story over in the writers forum if you feel like checking them out. <br>
