Although the last fame on page 8 expresses the force of the punch, I'm not sure if it's all that credible....since the executor is turning when he's getting punched, it's unlikey that the puncer will be able to get in bewteen his legs as he gets punched...also I feel there should more of a twisting motion in the guy getting punched....<br>
<br>
again on page 8...I realize the importance of the panning in to the scene, but I would have preferred a close up of the the actual action of the head slicing....right now the effect is rather distant....hard to feel outrage at the action that way.  <p><a href=http://darkreaver.freeservers.com> <img src="http://liquid2k.com/darkreaver/images/bannner2.jpg" BORDER=0> </a>

I think the problems are in the panel layout.  Here's my breakdown of the pages:<br>
<br>
Page 5:<br>
<br>
-The panels containing the close-up's of the character's eyes seem like they're floating in the middle of the page.  Because they're so small, they don't give the depth or scope of the character's face.  Try adjoining the two panels, making it one divided box, and attaching it to the side of the left-most panel.<br>
-To give a better idea of the surroundings, try adding a silhouette of the character in the middle of the field.  I think you should also give more room to the drawing of the fields.<br>
-Last panel: something doesn't look right about it.  It may have to do with his expression.  One idea for expand on is that he's sweaty, tired and probably bored, and he's just looking around and taking a break, when lo! and behold, he sees the column of smoke.  <br>
<br>
Page 6:<br>
<br>
-First panel:  It looks too bland.  Try adding the character's silhouette staring up at the column of smoke.  Make the landscape look more like a wheat field than a block of white space.  Every panel has to convey a crucial part of the story.<br>
-2nd panel:  Good expression.  However, since he's looking upwards in the previous page, I think he should be looking in the same direction here.<br>
-the two smaller panels could be larger.  Otherwise, this is good.<br>
<br>
Page 7:<br>
<br>
-1st panel:  What would look really good is if you put the character himself into the panel, showing him running frantically towards the distant village.  Speed lines would work very nicely here.<br>
-2nd and 3rd panels are good, but try to give the impression that the main character is looking on at the atrocities, like an over-the-shoulder camera angle.<br>
-One thing you could try in order to convey the &quot;hero's&quot; emotions at this time is, make the three panels shorter, and try to squeeze in a CCU of the hero's eyes, perhaps in anger or rage.<br>
<br>
Page 8:<br>
-Very nice action shot.  Unfortunately, it takes up almost the entire page, leaving little room for the punch itself.<br>
-2nd panel:  The poses look awkward; they don't look like the result of a right cross.  The *pok* sound looks like the bad guy's sound when he's landing.  *pok* also isn't a very powerful sound for a punch...try &quot;crunch&quot;, &quot;wham&quot;, or something less traditional.<br>
<br>
I think page 8 can be redone.  The rising action and climax (for the page itself) don't work very well.  You want the punch to be climactic, like the main part of the page.  What I would do is perhaps for a small-ish upper panel, showing the &quot;executioner&quot; glancing to the side from his handiwork, and then the &quot;hero&quot; appears out of nowhere.  For the &quot;punch&quot; panel, use the one you have showing him about to punch the bad guy, except draw the scene so that the punch connects, and the bad guy's face thrown to the side from the sheer force of it.<br>
<br>
By no means am I an experienced comic book artist myself, so take my advice however you want.  Hope it helps! <p>--Mad, adj: Affected with a high degree of intellectual independence.

Anyway yeah that one horizon line with the smoke I had no idea what it was O.o  maybe some more detail on that. <br>
<br>
Maybe if you draw the last part of that punch coming at us instead of the uptake to the punch it'd be better, the last part just looks a little downbeat considering it is the climax ^^<br>

<br>
Ryo Ohki: Hopefully the smoke will look like smoke once I do it in double size with a brush, and not half size with a pencil. I'll try to make the small panels a bit larger. I'll also see if I can figure out a way of making the characters shock seem a bit more natural.... hmmm.... I'll have to think about this one.... well....thanks anyhow...<br>
<br>
Darkreaver66: Thanks for the kind words. The twisting of the bad guys body is a very good point. I'll draw it in there, somehow, someway.<br>
I don't think I'll do a close-up of the beheading, though. I want it distant, sort of to illustrate the good-guys inability to do anything about it. I'll try to find some way of centering the readers eye on it. Anyhow, if it is violent close-ups you want, then you'll get plenty of that later in the story.<br>
<br>
Artist Dave: Thanks very much for the kind words and for taking the time to break down every single panel. The art is going to get much, much better before the comic is finished(These drawings are still what I consider to be layouts).<br>
ok... now...<br>
Page5:<br>
- Yup, I'll have to do something with the eye close-ups.<br>
-  I will not, however, need more shots of the field. Remember this is page 5..... guess what I've used the previous 4 pages for?????? (OK, it's not all fields, but pretty much).<br>
- Yup, the last panel will have to go. I'll try to get a better angle on it and put more care into his expression.<br>
Page6:<br>
- The first panel is a build up to the next page. The reason it's a totally straight line for the wheat field is that I forgot to draw it in on paper(I'm working on bluelines from the original thumbnail layouts), and just quickly  added the line in photoshop. Hopefully the picture will be more interesting once it's finished, with nice things like the sun shining through the smoke(That's not gonna be easy to draw), and the long shadows. Don't think there will be no silhuette, but maybe there will be some &quot;shock&quot;-lines around the fire.<br>
- No, he shouldn't be looking upwards. First he looks up at the smoke in the sky, then he looks down to the fire. Simple as that.<br>
- Yes, the small panels will be larger.<br>
Page7:<br>
There will be no &quot;over-the-shoulder&quot; camera. I like the idea of presenting this scene from a first-person view, and I'm gonna stick to it. But, yes, there will be speed-lines. Quite alot of them, I think.<br>
I will see if there is room for some shots of the good-guys eyes, but I seriously doubt it's enough space for it(Although it would make a nice parallel too some of the earlier pages). <br>
Page8:<br>
I don't think the &quot;climax&quot; should always have the largest space. This is also a question of the readers eye-movement. Hopefully it will work better when you have to turn the page(Not just look at the screen), since the natural position the readers eyes sees first when he\she turns a page is the middle section of the second page(This happens almost always). If the punch itself was placed there, it would ruin the climax somewhat(Since the climax would be seen first).<br>
Hopefully, by letting the build-up panel be seen first, the reader will more carefully examine the running sequence(To find out why he's so mad), and the punch will not loose it's power.<br>
That's the general idea, at least.<br>
However, I will see if I can make it work better, somehow...<br>
(But I really like the page, so I'm not sure)<br>
POK! may not be the best sound effect, no....<br>
But, anyhow.... thanks alot for all the comments, it was really helpfull.<br>
<br>
Sistaninja:Is there a scene like this in Fist of the north star? Hmmm.... haven't seen that in many years....<br>
The smoke will be clearer.<br>
I'll see what I can do with the last page, although it isn't really the climax of the story(The next page will be somewhat downbeat.... at least for the hero)...<br>
Thanks for taking the time.<br>
<br>
Well, alot of great comments... alot to think about..... thanks.<br>
