SHADE<br>
<br>
*Gostmaster*<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As Shade pulled himself across the frozen wasteland he thought back to the previous night. The last member of his group had perished in his sleep, frozen to death in this blasted cold. He was the last one left alive of that group of fifty that had come to these death lands only a month ago. They had all died from the freezing wind, sleet and snow. That kind of weather was the norm for these death lands. The others had been killed by those damn attacks by those cursed undead spear throwers. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp They could barely be seen. Most of their bodies were just bone, not a complete skeleton. Their skulls, arms, ribs and legs were the only physical parts left The rest was just not there. The arms were spaced apart and that never changed. Their joints were not attached, and they had no spine, It was magic holding them together. They hid in the snow with only their sun bleached white skulls showing. Then when some of the living would pass by they burst out of the snow with spears ready. 'Ahh yes!' He mused, 'their spears.' Made from black oak and tipped with arsenic. If you are penetrated by one you had to immediately tear it out before your blood devolved those tips letting the poison into your body. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He thought back to those fifteen men he had seen who had not been lucky enough to get them out in time. He had seen them rip off their limbs with their bare hands trying to escape from that pain. The lucky ones died early. The others they usually had to kill just to release them from that pain. Hot tears of anger and pure hatred for the undead rolled down his face as he thought of them. They had fought long and hard with him. They were the only ones left from the village. Now he was the only one. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Shade lifted a hand to wipe the tears away only to find them frozen to his face. He scanned the horizon until his eyes set on a small lump of in the distance. With a small grunt he lifted his sword and trudged on, oblivious to the freezing cold arctic winds that circled him, blowing snow that almost cut out his vision. He walked on, oblivious to all this, for he had something else keeping him going. A hidden flame that was burning bright, warming him, for the only thing that kept Shade going was that burning desire for revenge. Revenge against Gostmaster. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp That treacherous creature of evil had killed Shade's entire town in his quest for world domination. He has now all but completed his goal. All except the lands east of the Krackaiden mountains was under his control. The going was tough for those left alive. The undead horde was seemingly unlimited, the living defenders were running short on men. Whenever an outpost was over run not only did the defenders lose that much land and that many people, the undead gained an equal number. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Gostmaster was not always such a creature of evil. He had once been a Knight of the Guard. A title saved for the strongest of warriors. Not all knights as the title may suggest. A large portion was, but not all. Some were berzerkers, others were archers, a small but resourceful group  were the Furfoot, ambush experts, but the smallest, most feared sect was the Darzen.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The Darzen were a strange race. They never seemed to be all there at all times. They were mentally there, but not physically. They could move like shadows, could hide in the light of the noonday sun only appearing when their attack was to be made. They seldom talked and it was even rarer for what they said to be anything more then one or two words. Their responses were usually &quot;Of course,&quot; &quot;Never,&quot; &quot;Dead,&quot; or &quot;They will die.&quot; The Darzen lived, breathed, and dreamed war, if they dreamed at all. Those were the ones who trained Gostmaster.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Gostmaster started out as a simple berzerker. When he put on his war paint and picked up his sword he was a sight to behold. At six feet eight inches he towered over most of his companions. His long black hair covered most of his face, you could only see his eyes peering out most of the time. His eyes, it could be argued were his most frightening feature. They were black as night, and the pupils had a strange reddish tint that was almost hypnotizing. Woe be to the enemy who was transfixed by that gaze. Death was all it brought. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As Gostmaster's fame grew his look grew more fearsome. After slaying the dragon Skarzblakarodereyanog, or the Brown Death as the townspeople called it, almost single-handedly, he fashioned a cloak out of the scales. A magnificent clock adorned with the teeth of the dragon and a clasp that was beautifully crafted out of one of the claws. No-one knows for sure who could make such a wonderful clasp, but people suspected that it was Darzen craftsmanship. After the Minotaur wars, where he slew the leader, Skorzbag, he fashioned  a helmet mounted with Skorzbag's horns. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp His largest accomplishment, before joining the Knights of the Guard, was the Ork assault at Stone Creek. He was with a force comprising of five hundred berzerkers, one hundred archers and twenty-five Furfoot against a what was supposed to be force of seven hundred Orks, most of them recruits. It was supposed to be an easy training mission. They could not have been more wrong. The actual force that they faced was no less then three thousand Orks. Not recruit's ether, three thousand hardened warriors lead by their warlord. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Their warlord was the rightly feared Gorefang. After some mistakes made by the general, caused by his thought that there was only seven hundred, and his grossly mistaken beliefs that one, Orks are stupid. And two, a berzerker was more then a match for three Orks, he was led into a tough spot. He, along with two hundred berzerkers, thirty archers, and five furfoots were supposed to lead the Ork hordes into the thin, deep gorge from which Stone Creek gets its name. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The remaining force was to come as soon as they heard the first explosion and attack from behind while the general lead the charge from the front. The archers would fire two rounds over their heads and the furfoot would send one karican, a mix of powders wrapped in an oil soaked cloth, lit and fired from a sling that explodes seven seconds later, before the armies would meet, unfortunately it didn't work like that. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The Ork general thought there might be a trap so he only sent about six hundred warriors after them into the gorge. The general thought this was better then expected because he didn't know about the twenty-four hundred odd warriors that had been sent to come into the other end of the gorge as a pincer movement, similar to what the general was trying to do. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The human army shot the arrows into the Ork hordes as the howling mobs closed in on them. That is when the second problem arose. One of the furfoot was a young fighter, in his first battle. When the others threw their karicans he waited a split second too long. Seeing what they were doing an Ork threw his axe catching the furfoot right in the head, almost cleaving it in half. He dropped like a stone, so did his lit karican. It exploded right on top of him setting off all of his unlit karicans, this in turn set off his companions' karicans effectively wiping out the furfoot and archer units as well as twenty-three berzerkers. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Then as they tried to regroup and attack the enemy force, now thinned down to about four hundred fifty they were hit from behind by the rest of the Ork force. They were slaughtered down to the last man. The entire force was butchered in under five minuets. They managed to take down over three hundred Orks with them. It was at about this time that the rest of the force, lead by Daniel the second in command, entered the gorge. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The front runners saw what happened and quickly ran back to the rest of the force to report their findings. Daniel decided to stay back with twenty hand-picked men to hold off the force that was moving this way to give the other's time to escape. The remaining force fled into the canyons. They got about a kilometer away before Gostmaster stepped forwards. He rallied the troops to him and laid out his ambush plan. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The furfoot, stuffed their karicans into eight burlap sacks that were then liberally dosed with lamp oil. They were placed along the narrow canyon walls in a zig-zag pattern. This went along the canyon, which was so thin it forced them to march in ranks of four, for about four hundred meters. One furfoot, the eldest, most experienced one was give the one remaining karican to set it off when the Orks were walking across it. the remaining furfoot climbed the canyon walls, aiding the archers, where they took up position hidden along the length of the trapped canyon. The remaining two hundred fifty berzerkers would stand fast, looking like  another group of rear guards. This was the group Gostmaster was to be a part of. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp His plan worked beautifully, if it can be called that. The Orks were charging down the canyon, tightly packed closing in fast. As the furfoot threw the karican you could almost make out the blood still flecked on their face. The karican landed right on one of the sack charges, setting it off instantly. The explosion tore threw the ranks sending an explosion rippling through the landscape, knocking back most of the berzerkers and a wall of fire rushing back along the canyon. Fifteen hundred of the Orks were incinerated in that explosion sending blood and body parts raining down on the archers above. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Some may have hesitated in this situation but not the Orks, they figured that what ever killed their companions was used up now and they were safe. They still out numbered the human force too. They kept charging over the bones and bodies of their companions. The archers, taken aback by this assault hesitated and thus could only fire about three arrows apiece before the two forces clashed. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The canyon widened up at this point allowing the Orks to encircle the berzerkers but due to the renewed vigor, and the disheartedness of the Orks, the battle went in the humans favor. It still might have gone in the Orks favor, but Gostmaster was in their like a scythe cutting down wheat as he made his way through the Ork forces. Of all the force only Grotfang managed to escape. After this victory, due only to the quick thinking of Gostmaster, he was approached by the king. This was when he was asked to join the Knight of the Guard.<br>
<br>
*The Darzen*<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Gostmaster was accepted into their ranks with a large amount of fanfare. With victory after victory he rose through the ranks. By the end of his second year he had reached the rank of second in command, behind only      현i- Ythert鴻, the Darzen general. He lead many great campaigns against the Ork horde, drastically thinning out their numbers. Their numbers which once ranged in the millions were now reduced to about fifteen thousand, scattered through out the lands. Battles fought under his leadership had expanded the lands under the control of the Teraidian Empire threefold.  The minotaurs, which had once been a large threat, attacking miners and trade caravans crossing the Krackaiden mountain range had been forced to leave and go to the much more dangerous Salamanderinian mountains, where the first dragons had been found. They were hard to find too. They kept to themselves, stopped feasting on livestock. Not knowing how many there were, and not wanting to start a war with the Dragons, the Empire was happy to leave them alone. The Empire, not having any wars to fight, left the army to train. This was the mistake that lead to the downfall of the Empire. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The Darzen were becoming increasingly restless. Their love of war would not allow them to be peaceful for long. They had to do something to quench their thirst for blood. They started holding late night rituals. People thought that this was strange, but they had long ago learned that questioning the Darzen never got a response. One night the period of peace seemed to be over. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Peasants started disappearing from towns in their sleep. Men, women, and children were all taken. The army was sent out but they couldn't find any evidence of what was causing it. They organized town watchmen, which seemed to cut down the kidnappings. While all this was going on in the outlying towns, in the capital strange things were happening too. 현i- Ythert鴻 and Gostmaster were often seen talking in low earnest voices along with a group of Darzen. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The people found this unusual because, the Darzen never talked with anyone. Gostmaster started attending their late night gatherings and being trained specifically by them. He was the first and only non Darzen creature ever to be trained by the Darzen. Through the training sessions he learned to control the energy around him He learned to harness it into a powerful blast that burnt though ranks of troops, leaving only charred corpses and the smell of sulfur in its wake. Until this point only the higher level Darzen could do this. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp When Gostmaster wasn't practicing ways to expand his inner power and harness it he was learning the arts of assassination. It wasn't just skill with the sword though, he was a master of that. He was learning how to hide when there was almost no cover, he was learning how to move completely silently, and he was learning the use of every weapon known to man. They also taught him in the use of poisons, potions and explosives. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp While all this was going on the kidnappings had started up again, at a rate and fury surpassing the last group of kidnappings easily. One hunting party said that in the woods they saw a light. As they grew near they heard screaming and chanting coming from a clearing. They ran over but upon reaching it they found it deserted. This kind of thing went on for a month without any change. On day, as King Tellerian was having lunch 현i- Ythert鴻 came up to him. &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;What?&quot; He asked, upset to be disturbed. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;My people wish to have the Yitaran,&quot; he said in a bleak monotone voice. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;What do you mean you want the Yitaran?&quot; He asked looking surprised, &quot;We already have the Yitaran and anyway it's just swamp  and scrub that's a hundred and fifty miles away&quot; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;We, the Darzen, want it,&quot; said 현i- Ythert鴻 in that same emotionless voice, &quot;to live in&quot; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Why would you want to live there,&quot; joked King Tellerian, &quot;beds to comfortable here, Oh whoops, I forgot, you don't sleep. HAHAHAHAHA,&quot; he laughed uproariously at his own joke, the visiting nobles politely laughed along with him. &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 현i- Ythert鴻 in kept looking at him with the same emotionless, almost bored look. King Tellerian grew angry and his good mood seemed to dissolve.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Fine. Take it. Go. Now.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp With that, The entire Darzen garrison left with Gostmaster. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The kidnappings kept up and grave robbing started up. Month after month of this went on with no contact from the Darzen or anyone who lived in the Yitaran.  <br>
Life went on in the kingdom, it was a good time. The Golden age of the Teraidian Empire. Roads were built, as were courts of law, schools and libraries. There was little to no raiding by other races and the long felt angst between the elves and the human was rapidly disappearing. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This is not to say that it was a perfect age. There were still droughts, disease, death and all the while the kidnappings kept up as did the silence from the Yitaran. Messengers were sent but they all came back with the same story. The would walk for about a mile with no sign of anybody or any signs of civilization, then a fog would role in. It was such a thick fog that in it one could see nothing. When it lifted it seemed no matter where they walked or for how long they would always end up in the same place, the pit of the dead, fifteen miles away from the Yitaran. It went on like this for ten years at least, the Darzen were almost forgotten at that point. Then came an event to jolt their memory.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
*The Darkness Comes*<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Screaming over the lands came a tide of evil. A horde of undead warriors, the mere spectacle of them drained the fight out of most defenders and those who were slaughtered were added to the ranks. Their numbers which were originally around fifteen thousand had swollen to thirty thousand by the time they reached any opposition. The  armies of the empire joined up with a few militias from the surrounding area. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp They organized a stand at Cera Lamaralii, a fort, built on a hill. It was an old fort, many trenches, High walls of stone, and a large feasting hall made of wood and brick standing in the center. The first deep earthen trench had a wall on it as well, albeit not as tall, and made out of wood, it was still a defense. It was a good place to have a stand, and the best chance that they had of survival. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp They waited there, sharpening their weapons, and closing the gates as the last refugees made it through. They put their archers and furfoots on the ramparts that lay around the top of the stone walls From there the Archers  could rain down arrows on any enemies who passed the first wall. The Furfoot could throw karicans at any who made it to the fourth, and final trench. The northern berzerkers and the southern armored soldiers waited In the main keep. Waiting as the undead marched in. Hearing there footsteps from five miles away and feeling the ground vibrate. One young solider from the West named Kennith yelled up to the archers <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;How many can you see?&quot; <br>
One archer, a grizzled scared veteran by the name of Kin'iar glanced down and replied <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;They are more then the sand on the beach, or the needles in a pine forest. It seems as if everyone who has ever died has been brought back too fight us.&quot; <br>
Upon seeing how demoralizing this was on the troops a berzerker shouted out <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Aye there may be a million of them, but you forget, only twenty men side by side can pass through that door at a time. And we can kill twenty can't we Laddies. In fact, if I couldn't kill twenty of the bastards myself I would give up my sword and become a farmer.&quot;<br>
 &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The rest of the men began to join in the boasting and they were all laughing and shouting until a Furfoot voice rang from above them. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Eh, I don't mean ta  interrupt ya boys, But dey is just at tha gate and dey ain't stopin ta blab about how many a you dey gonna can kill, dere goin ta prove it to ya, Naw hows about ya all shapin up, an thinken of a way dat ya can keep dem from gettin ahold of ya bodies if dey slaughters us all.&quot; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As the archers began to fire shaft after shaft into the ever moving tide of the undead heading towards the walls of Cera Lamaralii a Furfoot came up with the solution. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;If dey only gots pieces of da bodies,&quot; he said, &quot;den dere army won't be able ta do much now will dey&quot; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp So all the spare karicans were scattered on the ground and covered with lamp oil. The fort was practically an unlit bomb at that point. One of the Furfoot suddenly let out a laugh as he placed his. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;What's so funny about this?&quot; Growled a solider working next to him. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Its jus da last time dis was used was when I served unda Gostmasta at the Battle for Stone Creek. He invented dis attack ya naw.&quot; The Furfoot replied. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I wish he was with us now&quot; said Kennith as he put his final charge. An archer, overhearing this conversation yelled down <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Unfortunately your wish has come true&quot; as he grabbed a new quiver of arrows. The men all looked up, scarcely believing the news, <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;He's here, you mean Gostmaster is HERE!!&quot; Kennith managed to gasp out, then a puzzled look settled on his face, &quot;Why did you say unfortunately, where is he?&quot; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;He's right out here in front, leading the charge. And you Furfoot should get up here, they're almost in range&quot; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp All the Furfoot ran up to the top of the wall, all minus one who waited in the barracks with one karican in his hand to throw the second that the last man fell to the undead. This way, not only would they stop the undead from raising them to fight alongside them, it would also take out a large portion of the undead with them. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A few of the soldiers and berzerkers were still in a state of shock after learning that Gostmaster. The Gostmaster of the songs and legends. The Gostmaster that they all looked up to was leading the enemy at them. They snapped out of it quite quickly though. For the Hordes had just passed the last wall. There is something about the sound of explosions, the smell of burning, rotting flesh, the screams of men as black oak spears stabbed through them and the ale being passed around to the fighters that puts thoughts of anything but the upcoming slaughter out of the minds of the men. It is has a way of gripping the mind. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The undead hordes hit the wall with such force that it caused the mortar in the walls to crack and crumble. The archers were fast using up their arrows in the seething swarm of corpses that surrounded the fort. They didn't even have to aim they just fired anywhere in their range and they were bound to hit something. The Furfoot's karicans were blowing craters in the land and drenching the walls and themselves in the blood of the fallen. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Through all the screams and explosions one noise could be heard. It was the sound of axe biting into wood. For the undead were chopping down the doors. The men in the fort began to form up. The tactic decided on was that half the berzerkers would be waiting by the doors to hack anything that came through to pieces. Behind them the soldiers would make a shield wall and behind that would be the rest of the berzerkers. The berzerkers would stand directly behind the shield wall, chopping over them while the soldiers kept there shields up and there spears pointing forwards. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As the first sword broke through the thick doors the men inside began to sing The Death song of the Defenders. The song is not a very commonly used song in battle but an appropriate one. It is about a group of men, making there last stand and trying to do as much damage as possible. For the defenders had realized that they had no chance of living, they just wanted to do as much damage as possible and at least slow the advancement of the undead. The battle did not last long after this. The door shattered and the Zombies, Ghasts, Skeletons and Wights charged in quickly overtaking the berzerkers and hitting the shield wall in less then two minutes. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The shear weight of the attackers broke the shield wall almost upon impact and the men were slaughtered the archers and Furfoot on the wall had been silenced by black oak spears since around the time that the gate fell. The defenders, were no more. One of the undead generals, a promising Wight by the name of Heru'nero-thou walked around surveying the carnage, he was about to call in the necromancers when he glanced down and saw by his foot an unlit karican. He looked at it puzzled and looked down again and saw another one. He looked around and saw it was all he could see on the ground that was not covered in the dead. He looked up and saw, standing in the doorway of the feasting hall one lone Furfoot holding a lit karican in his hand. As what was about to happen dawned on him he had just enough time to shout out &quot;RETRE..&quot; Before the explosion drowned him out. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Thirty miles away the townsfolk saw the column of flame rise and new that the defenders must have fallen. All over the country, people began to flee. The signal fire that the fort made, most likely saved a large number of lives. For the people who were not living on main roads had no idea what was going on to the East or of the constant stream of refugees heading towards the safety of the West beyond the Krackaiden mountains. The explosions were heard all over the land in a fifty mile radius and the burning could be seen at night by anyone in a two days march of the fort. People did not head to the roads, they just headed East and told anyone they came in contact with that something was coming and to get out of its path. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The undead hordes were slowed and decimated by that one attack and it did slow their advancement down, but not for long. No-one tried to stop them after that. All that was on their minds was to get to the Krackaiden mountains. There were only two passes through it and they could be better defended then just about any fort could hope to be. There was only three races that did not join the undead or flee to the Krackaiden mountains. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp These were the Orks, they disappeared to caves and the planes of the South. The Wood Elves, they refused to leave their sacred forests. The stories of trained wolf packs, giant wyrms, giant eagles, living trees, forest dragons and of course the legendary skills with a bow were enough to keep even the undead from setting one foot near their woods. The last race was the Northern Berzerkers, the ones enlisted in the army of the Teraidian Empire of course went with the army. Some who weren't left to join and some to safety, but a large percentage stayed to defend their homelands. The undead's immunity to cold allowed them to attack the lands of Norticana. Everyone who stayed behind was dead. Everyone, except Shade.<br>
<br>
*Journey to Safety*<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  The last territory outside the shelter of the Krackaiden to fall was Norticana, Shades homeland. He was a berzerker by nature but always disdained the Berzerker practice of wearing little to no armor to gain more speed. He wore a chain mail shirt, A large bearskin cloak and a metal cap mounted with the Tusks of a dead Minotaur Chief whose tribe had strayed to far north and had attempted to take control of Shades village. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp His village was gone now, wiped out by the hordes of undead and burnt to the ground, only five weeks ago. They had all fought to defend it, women, children, men all the surviving men from the other towns. For Shades village was the last to fall. They all knew that if they lost there, there would be nowhere to run. But it did still fall. Shade and his band of fifty had stood in the middles of the town, circling the statue of Hyrool Kanyuk, the hero who tamed the East and drove the dragons back to the Salamanderinian mountains, and according to legend, lifted the world from the plague of the werewolves. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp They made there last stand at the base of this statue and they fought back. The undead were piled waist deep around them and they still kept on coming, it was then that Shade realized that they all would die and ordered the retreat. They took a secret passage hidden in the statue and walked for three days, hearing the undead march above them, searching for them. They left the tunnels at an area known as the dead lands. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As the name suggests. It was called this because nothing did, or could  live there. It was bitterly cold and it snowed all the time. The wind, not only bit down into you. It also stirred up clouds of snow impairing your vision, though, luckily for them, it also hid there tracks so the undead couldn't follow. The undead, after coming to the conclusion that capture of them would not only be near impossible, but pointless and time consuming. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The main part of the horde headed back to the South, to get ready for their assault on the Krackaiden mountains. They left two hundred of the skeleton spear throwers, whom the legends referred to as the Hruloon, to deal with them. Gostmaster figured that the combination of them and the cold would surly kill them of. This would have been true, but Gostmaster never reckoned on Shade. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Shade stopped walking and looked up as his foot touched dirt. He had made it, he had reached the end of       the death lands, He had entered the wastelands, another week of marching and he should reach the first pass through the Krackaidens. As he breasted the top of a hill he surveyed the land. There was a small corpse of trees where he could make camp about a mile to the South. Looking closely to the Southwest he was able to make out a smudge on the landscape. Shade smiled, for he had just gotten his first look at his destination. As he walked down the hill towards the trees he stopped to gather some berries growing on a bush. As he munched on them his thoughts turned to the weather, happy to be able to think of something besides just survival. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Its already November,&quot; he thought, &quot;I should hurry so I can make it to the mountains before the snow begins to fall down here. For the snowfalls are usually about thirty to forty feet in the passes. No one could pass through them, not even the undead. I would like to have a house to stay in. Empty caves are getting harder and harder to find these days.&quot; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He entered the trees and found a suitable place to make camp, He got a fire going and took a pouch out from under his cloak. He took out of it forty-nine locks of hair held together by a warrior ring. A warrior ring is a band of Iron made from your enemy's weapon. All of Shades warriors had many of these rings. Shade knelt before the fire and through in the locks of hair one by one. As he through in each one he recited the name of the warrior whom it had belonged to and uttered the phrase <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I have transferred your life force into these locks of hair. Because I could not burn your body I burn this and hope you make it safely to the other world. When you get there save a seat for me in the great feasting hall and save seats for your companions.&quot; <br>
After this somber rite was over with Shade fell asleep. For the first time in five weeks, feeling happy, and hopeful of the future. In the morning, he rose, gathered his pack together, had a small breakfast of roots and berries and left heading south. The sky began to cloud over as the day progressed and by mid afternoon the first drops of rain began to fall. Shade quickened his pace and drew his cloak tight around him. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He had been through enough storms to know that the one brewing was not one to be stuck out in. He kept scanning the horizon looking for a place to shelter in. As dusk grew near the storm started intensifying to the point where he could barely make out two steps in front of him. The wind howled and the rain was falling almost vertically in sheets. If the cold didn't kill him first Shade knew he would surely drown. The frozen ground could not hold much water and the flatlands he was traveling through began to flood within half an hour. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As the water reached knee deep Shade could almost make out something up ahead. It was a  hill, and on top of the hill was a house. Shade began to run through the water for the last few miles. By the time he reached the cliff the water was waist deep and frightfully cold. His entire lower half was going numb and he had trouble traversing the slippery rocky terrain of the cliff face. The water was running down the cliff almost making a waterfall for him to climb. But Climb he must for he knew he knew the lightning was drawing near and one strike near him could spell his death. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp After what seemed like hours Shade finally managed to pull himself to the top. He crawled to the door of the house and started banging with all his might. Just as he thought no one would hear him and he had climbed all that distance for nothing the door creaked open. A shaft of light hit him in the face and he looked up to see a young man looking down at him. Shade smiled and with a gurgle collapsed at the young mans feet.<br>
<br>
*Trent*<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp When Shade awoke the next morning the first thing he realized was that he was in a bed. He was not lying on the ground with his cloak on him and his sword in his hand. He was in an actual bed, with a mattress and sheets. The next thing that hit him was he was in someone's house, and from the smell of things the were cooking up bacon and eggs for breakfast. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Shade did not remember any of the events from last night and was surprised to see his armor was scrubbed and polished and hanging on the door, next to it was his cloak and lying on the chair was his sword, polished with a new edge put on it. Shade got up, took the chain mail off the hook and put it on. He left the cloak and the sword where they were and went in to meet his host. There was a young man standing there looking to be around his early twenties, late teens. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He had light brown hair with almost copper streaks running through them. He had brown eyes with the oddest flecks of yellow in them, giving them an almost pale amber look at times. He had a medium looking build but something about him made Shade think that there might be something more to him then what met the eyes. He was wearing loose fitting off-white cloth pants that ended around his mid shins and a bright red jerkin tied with a sky blue cord around his waist. He was standing in front of fireplace holding a pan on which three eggs and five slices of bacon were frying. As Shade walked in he gestured with his free hand at a table and said in a cheerful voice <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Have a seat my friend. I have already eaten, I was hoping you would be getting up soon&quot;<br>
Shade walked over to the table and sat. Within a minute or two the stranger had brought over the pan, scraped the contents onto a plate sitting in front of Shade and poured them both a glass of warmed mead. The stranger sat down and had a sip, he cleared his throat and in the same cheerful voice said to Shade, <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Hello, my name is Trent, and you would be?&quot; <br>
Shade, slightly surprised by his host generosity hesitated for a second. He then took a bit of eggs and washed them down with a swig of mead. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Hello, I'm Shade, I come from the North and&quot; Shade started, but then Trent cut him off <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Yes I know all about that, I had been told by my friends that a Berzerker, the last surviving Berzerker, from the North would be coming by. Now Eat up and we will talk more after you eat.&quot;<br>
 Trent began to get up when Shade put out a hand and said &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I am afraid I can not stop to talk for you see...&quot; Trent cut him off again, <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Yes, we have to get across the Krackaidens before the snow falls, this I know. I meant we would talk while we walk. Now if you have nothing left to add I must finish cleaning and prepare to leave&quot; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Trent walked out of the small kitchen leaving Shade in a bit of a daze. He wasn't sure if he liked this Trent character but he knew that two often traveled better then one. And these were good eggs. He decided to give it no more thought and began to eat again. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp After he finished he went back into his room, pulled on his cloak and strapped his sheath, stuck his sword in and walked out to find his new companion. Trent was there waiting, now instead of the white pants he was wearing brown ones of similar length and style. The Red jerkin had been replaced by a dark green one and the blue cord with a thin black leather belt. Hanging on the belt were a flask, a small pouch, a small sack and a simple brown leather sheath holding in it a strong looking sword with intricate symbols and patterns carved up and down the handle, on his back was a bow and a quiver of arrows, flight with raven feathers. Trent pulled on a simple brown, homespun cloak and together, they set off west, towards the mountains. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The going was good for the first few days. The weather was decent, a bit cold, low winds and no precipitation. Trent always found a good place to camp and the food he brought with him was serving them nicely. For if there was one thing Trent knew, it was how to cook. By the fifth day Trent and Shade could both tell that something was wrong. They were one day away from the mountains and walking through a slightly wooded area. Even at this time of the year there should be some sort of animal noise. But there was none. Not even a single eagle call. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Shade and Trent, after a hasty discussion decided it would be better to just run as fast as they could towards the pass and try to make it there today, without stopping to sleep because something told them that they would not do well to wait. They quickly packed up camp, covered the fire and shouldered their belongings, just as they were about to break into a quick march they heard a crashing sound. Shade grabbed Trent and jumped to the side with him just as a black oak spear slammed into the tree they were just standing next to. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Shade looked up from where the spear had come and saw a Hruloon Standing with another spear ready, behind him were five Zombies with axes in hand looking right back at him. As the Hruloon took out another spear, Shade tensed up, waiting for the time to jump, he placed his hand around the handle of his sword, ready to draw it out at a moments notice. As the Hruloons hand went back to throw the spear an arrow smashed through his skull, shattering it and the rest of the bones clattered to the ground. Shade turned to see Trent standing there with bow in hand. Shade nodded is thanks and yanked out his sword. He was about to charge right into the remaining Zombies who had started to shamble towards him when Trent reached out to hold him back. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Why do you stop me!&quot; shouted Shade, &quot;There is only five of them!&quot; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Yes,&quot; said Trent, &quot;only five, but look out there&quot;<br>
As he pointed Shade looked and saw at least fifty shapes moving towards them through the trees. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;We can't beat all them. The best idea would be to run.&quot; As if to agree with him, five Hruloon spears clattered around them just as Trent finished talking. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I agree, RUN!&quot; shouted Shade six more Hruloon spears flew down at them. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp They ran as fast as they could, dodging trees and roots. All the while hearing the undead following closely on there trail. As the woods began to thin out the saw there was a plain, then a hill, then they would be at the pass. After they left the shelter of the trees they put in a last final spurt, knowing that this was the most dangerous and last part of the journey. They just had to make it up the hill, they HAD to make it. They had gone to far to die here. The final burst of speed saved them. They reached the top of the hill and saw a fort with around two hundred of the Teraidian Army in it only five hundred meters ahead. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Being this close to their goal gave them the courage to take time to turn around and see what was chasing them. It was then that they wished they hadn't. They could see at least one thousand Zombies walking out of the trees, in ranks one hundred long and ten deep. After they came out there was another one after them. There was around seven hundred Hruloon, interspersed amongst the ranks and a group of around five hundred Wights and even seventy of the dreaded Ghast shock troops. More were coming out from the trees when a creature rode out on what looked to be a scaled horse. The rider had a standard, it was bright red and ragged, fluttering in the breeze with four skulls mounted on top, with long hair that also fluttered in the breeze. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Shade and Trent didn't stop to see what was going to happen next, but ran right to the fort. When inside they quickly told the for commander what they had seen. All the color drained out of his face as they mentioned the mounted creature. The fort commander, an up and coming man named Tammic, had a quick conference with his sergeants. He came back to Trent and Shade and asked them, &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Are you fit to run?&quot; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;If we have to run, we can try.&quot; replied Trent quickly.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tammic thought about this for a second  &quot;hmmm, I suppose you can ride with me, you look as you have traveled far to be here. Wait, I will go and get the horses&quot; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Hey, who was that mounted guy?&quot; Shade shouted out as Tammic turned to leave. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tammic stopped, his shoulders dropped and he said without even looking back. &quot;That was Fallon. He is Gostmaster's fiercest general.  We have reason to believe he is half Darzen.&quot; With that, he walked away.<br>
<br>
*The Bridge*<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Almost as soon as they had left the fort they heard a horn sounding from the plains below. They all started running as fast as they could away. Only stopping to pick up fallen comrades. They ran and they ran, feeling the heat on there backs as the fort was put to the torch. They could hear the sounds of their enemies' boots slamming down on the earth. They could hear their unearthly battle cries. They could smell the scent of rotting flesh following them, growing stronger. They could feel the spears whiz by them. They could hear the screams of those whom the spears had found their mark. They could see the spears find their mark too. They could taste the fear and the sweat from the army of the Empire. They could smell, feel, hear, see and taste all this, and they kept running. The adrenaline pumped through their veins and the lucky one, like Trent and Shade, held onto the horses they were riding for dear life. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp To Trent the flight to the Krackaidens was a new and exciting experience. A story to tell the grandchildren. To Shade it was just more running. Shade was growing tired of all the running. The feeling of spears slamming down where you were just standing and the sound of your enemies pursuing you was becoming common place, and this angered Shade. For he was not brought up as a runner. He was raised as a fighter. Though he knew that fighting was useless right now, and he would die instantly, it still hurt him to run. He made up his mind on this retreat, that this would be the last one. Once he reached the Krackaidens, the running would be over. He would never retreat again. As the Kavard pass, the first pass through the Krackaiden mountains, drew near Shade rode up to Tammic. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Do you think they will stop following us once we reach the pass?&quot; Shade asked. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Of course not, They were coming here. We were just in their way.&quot; Tammic replied. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Just as I thought,&quot; grimaced Shade, &quot;then how are we going to get away from them?&quot; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;There is a bridge up ahead,&quot; explained Tammic, &quot;We have about thirty archers there to lay covering fire, and we had the Furfoot load that bridge up with explosives. As soon as we cross it, BOOM! Thing's rubble. That should hold them for a while.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I want to be one of the rearguards&quot; Shade quickly said. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Are you serious!&quot; Asked Tammic dubiously, &quot;You do realize we won't wait for you before blowing the bridge if necessary, and you have a huge chance of dying?&quot; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I know all this and more,&quot; Shade aid in a tone that dissuaded further argument, &quot;I promised myself that once I reached the mountains the running will be over. If that means my death then so be it!&quot; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;It is your choice&quot; Tammic put in sadly, &quot;But I would hate to lose you.&quot; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;You won't then, I will take care of him,&quot; said Trent. Both Tammic and Shade jumped, nether of them had noticed Trent come over. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;You can't go! It's suicide!&quot; yelled Shade. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I am going to stay, and there is nothing you could say or do to stop me. I have been sworn to stay at your side forever. I will not break my oath.&quot; stated Trent. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Sworn? By whom?&quot; Asked Shade. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;There is no time for that now. We have a bridge to guard&quot; responded Trent. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As they finished talking, the bridge came into sight. Shade gasped as he got his first sight of the bridge. He was expecting a bridge, maybe twenty, thirty feet long, made out of wood, or possibly stone. He was not expecting this.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The bridge was a masterpiece. It went over a huge deep gorge, at the bottom of which rushed a wide river. The Crodanan, which was also the name of the pass they were traversing, was named after the famous Vampire slayer of the past. The Crodanan was a good four kilometers wide at most parts and stretched from the Drandian sea of the North, to the Grinidian Sea of the South, running the entire length of the Krackaiden. The river, usually a fast and treacherous body of water was roaring with an unstoppable force, due to the recent heavy rainfall. It was swollen to over four times it's size and the waves were so huge that the spray would sometimes hit the ones crossing it. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The Bridge over it was even more breathtaking. It stretched the full four kilometers across and was easily fifty meters wide. The blocks  that made it up were perfectly shaped and none jutted out even the slightest. Along the sides of the bridge ran the Furfoots explosives, bundles of sticks, bottles, and sacks with small amounts of powder running out. They were placed about three meters apart and the second that the undead reached halfway across the bridge a Furfoot would blow the thing. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp No mater how many of the rear guards were still fighting. Shade and Trent, accompanied by five berzerkers and thirty archers took their places on the side of the pass to allow the rest of the men to start crossing. As the last one stepped onto the bridge The archers took their places blocking the exit. They were to hold the bridge until it was clear, then they were too run across and make it the entire way before the undead reached the halfway point across, for when they reached that the bridge was to be detonated leaving all those who  hadn't crossed stuck there. It was a risky plan and had a high chance of failure and an even higher chance of death but it was the only plan they had. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As the slow moving ox carts, full of food, treasure, and the last remaining refugees pondered their way across the first dust cloud was spotted. It was moving closer and with a cloud that big the defenders knew the approaching column of troops must be colossal. When the first undead came into sight the ox carts weren't even halfway across. That and the maddened rush of living corpses, walking nightmares, rotting putrid bodies that were only held together by magic, made Shade know in his heart that he was done for. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp After that long hard journey and all his work, his life was going to end saving some food and gold. It wasn't as they needed to keep it out of the hands of the enemy, they had no use for it. It was just because his side had it now and they didn't want to give it up. That was what Shade was going to die for. To stop a bureaucrat who had abandoned the area as soon as reports of an invasion from losing face. That was enough reason for thirty archers, three soldiers, himself and Trent to die. Knowing this made Shades blood boil. The only thing on his mind now was to kill enough to have a song written about him and to get back to the king to gather an army for revenge on the ones that killed his family. His thoughts switched quickly back to the events at hand as a spear slammed into the stone of the bridge, less then a foot away from him. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The spears began clattering down as the defenders dived for cover. All but two archers were lucky enough to get out of the way. The remaining archers quickly got up and whipped an arrow out of their quivers and started rapidly firing arrows into the approaching horde. It was slowing them, but barely. Hindering their movement slightly by the fact an arrow would thud into their chest, knocking them back a few steps. Or on the off chance they would kill one, the shambling zombies would trip over the body of their fallen comrade, causing a bit more confusion. But that's all it really was, a small confusion. A tiny annoyance. They weren't supposed to stop the undead. They were just supposed to slow them down slightly when they had to take time to cut down the defenders.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Trent realizing the small difference the group was making, started to gather the remnants of the spears and  make a small pile out of them. He then put tinder to flint and managed to make a small flame. The old, dry, dead wood caught quickly and a roaring blaze was soon created. The archers began ripping strips off their tunics and wrapping the tips of their arrows in them. The arrows were then liberally dosed in the rum some of the archers were carrying. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp While all this was going on the berzerkers and Shade, later joined by Trent had charged into the enemy sword swinging. They hacked at them until their arms were numb and weary and their eyes burned with sweat. Once the archers were ready with the fire arrows the leader, Ne'yuk-tan, Called for the Berzerkers to retreat. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The two that were fighting along Trent and Shade managed to fall back, but the three others were surrounded by undead. Back to back two of them fought, taking down as many as they could. There were two score Zombies pilled around their feet. The third Berzerker was already down, the back of his head hacked off by a Wights deadly broadsword. He was laying face down on the road about ten feet away from his two companions, buried in a pile of twenty-three Zombies and five Wights, all downed by the Berzerkers deadly skills with his six foot longsword. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Shade, Trent and the two Berzerkers had made their way back to the bridge as the death howls of the surrounded Berzerkers reached them. By the time Shade looked back they had already disappeared under the tide of undead. The howl was immediately followed by the twang of twenty-eight bows and the roar of the flaming missiles flying into the approaching enemy at tremendous speeds. They flaming arrows hit, interspersing amongst the front two ranks of undead. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The undead's clothing caught, as did the dry grass they were walking on. For as luck would have it. The large storm from last night had not reached within that path, so the grass was still dry as a bone, causing the fire to race across it. Each archer managed two pull two more shots off before they two took off for the other side of the bridge. A few more Hruloons threw their spears, taking down a few more archers, before they were to busy dealing with the fire to think about anything else. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Approximately eighty percent of the Undead moved back, retreating from the deadly flame that was quickly growing into a huge brush fire. They went back away from the bridge, away from the defenders, away from the living army, away from the mountains. Back into their country,  the dead country. The country that dominated most of the known world. Where all was thought to be dead. Or would be very soon. The remaining twenty percent of this army, or around two and a half thousand  Zombies and three hundred Wights charged up the bridge. Shade and the others were running as fast as they could but were all worried that they might not make it in time.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As the Undead reached the halfway point in the bridge Shades stomach sank. He had another half a kilometer to go and the Furfoot were already lining up at the end of the bridge with karican in hand. Tammic looked up, shuddered and then gave the order to blow the bridge. But the Furfoot did nothing. They stood there, waiting, looking past Shade and his crew, looking at the undead with hatred etched into their normally cheerful faces. Pure unadulterated hatred was all the could describe it. Shade could tell they wanted nothing more then to destroy the undead who had taken away their homeland, but they remained motionless. Waiting for Shade to reach them. When he, Trent, and the rest of the defenders finally reached them one of the Furfoot. Without even looking up said. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Took ya long 'nough, tawt we was goin' ta have ta blow t'up wit ya on it if we wan'ed ta o' nah,&quot; He then jerked his head slightly to his companions, &quot;na le's blow da basta'ds back ta where dey came!&quot; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp With this they threw their karicans at the bridge and the entire living army dove for cover. The undead saw what  was happening and ran at unimaginable speeds, trying to reach the other side before the bridge blew. But their attempt was in vain. The karicans along the side light in perfect succession tearing apart the bridge with a monstrous boom that echoed throughout the canyon. The bridge was completely destroyed, sending chunks of rock all over the mountain in a one kilometer radius, setting of a few avalanches into the river. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It was a stupendous display of fire power and when Shade got up to look around he saw no sign of the undead, and the only sign of the bridge, besides the rock covering the landscape, was two chard towers, where the sides of the bridge used to start. The road leading from the bridge was blackened as well. Rocks were still raining down on them and they knew finally that they were safe. <br>
<br>
*The Trip to Herigen*<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The rest of the trip back to Harigen, the capital of the Teraidian Empire, was uneventful. At full march it took then four days to reach it. They took the Royal Road and all along it they could see the villagers burying their precious goods, fortifying their houses, making sure all the food was safely packed away, making sure the signal fire was ready, and making sure that an escape would be easy and fast. In short, they were preparing for war. If the news of the fall of everywhere outside the mountains hadn't reached them, the constant stream of refugees would have tipped them off that something was wrong. People kept running up to the troops and trying to get some information out of them. But Tammic had already forbid them to tell anything, save that they should prepare. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The Royal Road was long, mainly flat, mainly straight. It was constructed hundreds of years ago, under the guidance of King Har'nktola the Second. It went from both passes through the Krackaidens to the Capital, Harigen. Other roads connected onto it, and branched off of it along the way, but none were near the size, and quality of the Royal Road. On the other side of the Krackaidens, the road leading to the Crodanan pass started out in the old capital of Gerendenan. Lower down, at the Hatnitshut pass the road started out in the Elven/Human trading city of Herun'knuck. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp On the last day of their journey Shade awoke early at the small camp they had set up last night. They were beside a forest on one side, and a stream on the other. They had a fire, still smoldering slightly in the center, all around it were the men, sleeping on the ground, some with a blanket or cloak thrown over them, the others just in their normal clothes. Shade stood up, brushing the dew off himself and stretched as the first rays of sun started to peak through the trees. The first thing he noticed was that Trent, was missing. He decided to go look for him, since he was already awake and felt like the walk would clear his mind. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp After about twenty minutes of walking he started hearing a low chanting coming from the forest. He cautiously entered the trees, not knowing what to expect and going silently so as not to scare whatever it was away. As he grew nearer to the sound he began to be able to make out a light, glowing amongst the trees. Figuring that was probably where the sound was coming from he got down and crawled over, making sure not to be seen. When he got close to the light he saw a rather queer sight. It was Trent, sitting on a stump in the middle of a small clearing. Well he wasn't exactly sitting, he was in fact levitating a few centimeters off the stump. The light was caused by a strange phosphoric fog that was swirling around him as he meditated. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Shade quickly left, not wanting Trent to discover him. Shade returned to the camp to find everyone up and awake, just in time to start breakfast. By the time they had all eaten Trent had made his way back and was shouldering his pack. Shade gave him a quick look but did not say anything to him. The march started up again but Shade could not stop thinking about what he saw. By mid-afternoon Shade was no closer to finding an answer then when he started. The company had opted to skip lunch and keep marching. For, as Tammic pointed out, they were close to Harigen, and there they were promised a feast. As they breasted the final hill all thoughts of what he had seen that morning left Shade. For, looking at the beauty of Harigen, the only sound anyone in the company could muster was a gasp. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It was, for lack of a better word, beauty at its finest. The walls, thirty meters high glistened white. The towers and pallasades jutting out also glowed with the same brilliance. The city was a full ten kilometers across and held almost a million people. From their vantage point on the hill, and with the cloudless blue sky, they could see completely across. Buildings covered the landscape, with gorgeous temples interspersed all over the city. There were roads, all completely straight, all the same width crossing everywhere. There were open areas every few blocks where local farmers and merchants would hawk their wears. Every building had the same white, shining, brilliance that the walls had. Every building except the Palace. The Palace stood out, located in the middle of a small park, in the center of the city stood out from everything. It was huge for one, and two, the walls were painted with gold. They shone with a brightness that rivaled the sun, yet it did not hurt their eyes to look at it. It had conical towers, palisades, flying buttresses and even a dream tower sticking out from the center. If the city by itself was beautiful, the palace, was perfection.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Elven make,&quot; said Trent, breaking the silence.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp :What?&quot; asked Tammic.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;The city, the palace, everything, it was made by Elves in 4272 TE for our help in defeating the great darkness that was covering the world,&quot; responded Trent<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Oh.&quot; was all Tammic could reply.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As they walked down the final stretch of the Royal Road no one talked. All they could do was look around at the city in awe. For none of them had ever been to the Capital before. As they reached to main doors a guard came out. After a few minutes of him and Tammic conversing in low tones they were aloud in. Tammic called back to his followers,<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Ok men, we are to head up to the place, we will be given accommodations there and tonight we will be having a feast with the king to talk about what happened, I don't think I have to remind you that that means you have to take a bath, you all stink. Secondly, best behavior, do not start, or join in any fights, and no, I repeat NO women in your rooms tonight. We are trying to make a good impression with the king you know.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp There was a few laughs at thins, a bit of grumbling, but most were still to spell bound to do anything but continue up the road into the palace. When they reached the outer wall surrounding the palace they were met by another group of guards. Tammic dismissed them much quicker then the first group. He just flashed a parchment at them and they opened the large iron gates. Up they marched, along the pass, Trent taking time to take in everything. The gardens blooming with late winter flowers, the crystal clear ice blue sky, the occasional cry of a hunting eagle, the perfect beauty of the palace was almost to much for Trent to bear.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Trent noticed he was falling behind and ran to catch up. He just rejoined the end of the column of troops as the last one entered the front door, just seconds from the door slamming and locking him out. Once they entered they were taken up to the guest rooms where they were told to shave and shower for they would be called in about two hours for the feast. Trent and Shade were put in the same room. Shade started cleaning up without even a word to Trent. Trent was slightly taken aback by this but chose to ignore it. After a short time a knock came on their door. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;What do yah want,&quot; growled Shade, &quot;It can't have been two hours already&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;The king wants to see you both in his chambers,&quot; was the reply, &quot;I'll just wait out here and take you there when your ready, though I suggest a little speed on your part, the king doesn't like to be kept waiting&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Neither do I,&quot; said Shade as he threw open the door, &quot;so lets go&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp With that he and Trent followed the messenger down a long, twisting series of corridors until they finally reached a large ornately decorated door.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;There it is,&quot; said the messenger gesturing at the door, &quot;you can just go in, I'll be on my way&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp With that the messenger scurried off leaving Shade and Trent feeling rather uncomfortable.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Should we knock?&quot; asked Trent.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;No,&quot; replied Shade, &quot;He said we can just go in and that's what I'm going to do&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp With that Shade opened the door and stepped in, immediately followed by Trent. Three men were sitting around a table, Tammic looked up and smiled. The king gave a small wave without looking up to show that he was aware of their presence. The other man, a young, but by the look of the scares on his face and hands, as well as the quality of his weapons and the strength in his eyes, experienced warrior. He took Shade and Trent's hands in turn, shaking them profusely. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Hello good sirs, I have heard much about you, my name is Kennith. Please have a seat.&quot;<br>
<br>
*The Meeting*<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Shade sat down at the table but Trent stayed standing looking shocked.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Kennith?&quot; he asked, &quot;How can this be? I heard everyone died at Cera Lamaralii.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Ah,&quot; laughed Kennith, &quot;It appears one person did know of me.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I heard from the refugees all about the battle, or at least all they knew, I got the list of all that fought there, and they also said everyone died. Was this not true?&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Almost True,&quot; responded Kennith, &quot;Everyone died except me.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;How did you survive?&quot; asked Shade, eyeing Kennith suspiciously.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;That I was just about to tell when you came in, so sit down, and I'll tell you.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Trent sat down across from Shade. Kennith cleared his throat and looked around.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I've already heard your story,&quot; he said, gesturing to Shade, Trent and Tammic, &quot;So I already know some parts of what happened, I'll be using that to fill in the blanks in my story, I hope your comfortable because this should take the hour&quot; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He then sat down in a large, red velvet armchair, had a sip of mead, cleared his throat again, and started.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 'The first thing I will explain is how I survived the battle at Cera Lamralii. I trust all of you have heard the story so I will not go into great detail of the battle, sufficient to say it was my first battle and I was an archer up on the wall. It was just as the last few berzerkers were brought down my the tide of those cursed undead spawn that my saving miracle happened. I was firing arrows down into the courtyard at that point, trying to help out the berzerkers to no avail. just as the last one fell a spear hit me in the chest, for unnoticed to me some Hruloon had made their way into the compound. This must have been a captain or something because the force of that hit knocked me right over the wall. I was lucky at that point because the spear did not enter me, it simply hit my armor, denting it and sent me over the wall. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp When I hit the ground my luck stayed with my for I hit it at such an angle that it rolled me down into a ditch, right near a cave. The fall only broke my arm and the spear only broke a few ribs so, knowing what was about to happen, I was glad to be able to crawl in When the fort blew I was spared from the blast. But that left a whole new problem. I was injured, alone, and stranded out in the middle of nowhere with undead all around. I doubted anymore had survived, I later confirmed that. I also, again correctly, assumed that all the undead in the immediate vicinity were dead, and all that weren't would be on their way pretty soon to find out what was going on. I stayed hidden as a result and lo and behold I was correct again. On the third day I heard many undead feet thundering above me. They seemed to be constantly marching forward at a good pace, and still it took them at least eight hours to cross. I believe that was the full army.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp On the fifth day, when I felt slightly safer and more healthy I finally emerged from the cave. I knew any food around here had almost definitely been trampled by the hundreds of thousands of feet I heard walking above me. I am not sure what direction I started going in. But after about a month of lacking, my arm in a sling made from the shirt of a fallen man, feed on roots, berries, leaves and anything left abandoned in houses I found myself in Kilanar-Hathelzorian. The land of the Plain Elves. I met up with a small group of them there who were going off to attack the undead. When I first saw them I wondered what good they were going to do against such a large horde. I figured they were going to just try and take down as many as they could with them as I had attempted to do. Not feeling like I had a lot left to live for, I joined them. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp But when we reached the undead I realized they had something different in store for them. At this time I should point out that the undead were no longer in one group. They had split up into smaller raiding parties. Some were only a hundred strong, while others were like the group that attacked you on the bridge. The group we reached first was one of the smaller groups. It was only eighty Zombies, ten Ghasts and twenty Hruloon. We met with them at the start of the Scrublands. I was about to draw my newly acquired sword and charge down into them but the leader of the elves stopped me. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He was a tall man, long brown hair, striking features, slightly built, but as strong as an ox. He told half of us to lie flat and for the other half to loop around to the hill on the opposite side. Once those elves were in position our group stood on one knee and fired our arrows into the backs of the undead. We then hit the ground and crawled to a new hiding place. While this was going on the other half stood on one knee and fired from the other side. They then found a new place of safety while we fired in. We continued this, causing mass confusion amongst the undead until we were out of arrows. We then drew our swords and charged down the hill. The clash was short and sweet, for us at least. we had butchered every undead warrior, without suffering a single casualty. We then gathered our arrows from the bodies of the undead. Thus began our stretch of guerrilla attacks, lasting from that day on until the day I entered the Hatnitshut pass to go see the king.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I learned a lot during that time. A lot about warfare, a lot about the history of our world, a lot about our enemy and also, how to defeat them. I think if I combined my knowledge with that of the rest of the council we could make a fool proof plan for attacking them. The elves taught me about the power centers of the empire, where they are, which are the most powerful and how to control them. They told me about how this has happened before too. Every fourteen hundred years this happens. The rise of a new evil, lead by a monster. Most every time a champion has arisen to defeat it. This has happened the last five times. The times before that were different though. Evil stalked this land, it still does, but to a much less extent.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The plagues brought onto this land with the coming of evil is a large list. Vampires, Minotaurs, Dragons, Trolls, Giants, Ogres, just a small portion of the list. Every time it has been undead, and a huge army of one of these, made by the evil and spread over the land. Imagine, looking from your castle and seeing an army of those coming at you. The Dragons ruled this world for almost six thousand years until the Giants over through them. Of all the groups that have ruled this world we have last longer then any. Some say that it is a sign that we are the true rulers. Others warn it means our time may be up. The new evil has yet to be released on this land. Or at least it has yet to be realized. We must make sure everyone keeps a strong look-out for any new evil. For it is that that we have to worry about defeating. Alone the undead can not stand, but with this new evil they may triumph.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp With this the bell rang to call everyone to dinner. The men got up and walked down to the feasting hall. The meal was delicious, one of the best Shade had ever had, but he didn't notice, he was to busy thinking about what had been said this afternoon. The king looked very troubled by the news, as did Tammic. Only Trent seemed unaffected, he and Kennith were laughing away at the other end of the table. Eating, drinking and having a grand old time. Noticing Trent's strange behavior made Shade think back to what he had seen before in the woods. Shade could not begin to understand what had happened. The swirling fog, the levitation, it all seemed impossible to Shade. Another thing that bothered him was that Trent was up that early. It occurred to him that in all the time he knew Trent he had never once seen him sleep. With all this going on in his head, Shade didn't even notice the feast was over until Tammic shook his shoulder <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Wake up my friend. We are being called to the council. Lets go&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Shade rose and he and Tammic made there way to the side door in which the king had just entered. The room was not all that different from the first room Shade had been in. It was a large room, mainly being taken up by a huge table. There was a large fireplace on one wall, a bookcase covering another, the other two were decorated by wall hangings showing some of the history of the Teraidian Empire, their victories and their hero's. Shade did notice that there was a large gap though, just when it reached modern times. As if something had been there but was now taken down. It took a second for him to clue in that Gostmaster's accomplishments had probably gone there. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Sitting at the table were Trent, Kennith, King Tellerian and Tammic had just taken his seat. There were a few other humans that Shade did not know. As well as them there was four others, a large Berzerker, a giant of a man, almost nine feet tall, built like an ox, long flaming red hair sticking out wildly, his body covered in tattoos and scars. In contrast, sitting beside him was an Elf, a thin man, long blonde hair falling down his back, he was tall, lithe and swift looking, probably a prince. Next was a Furfoot, he didn't look much different then most, except his face darker, his eyes colder and, judging by the dagger at his side, not just used for artillery. After the Furfoot was a Dwarf. A large, surly looking, foul smelling, strong, loud, fine specimen of a dwarf. Shade could tell just by looking at him that the Dwarf was a warrior born and a warrior bred, one you would love to have on your right in a shield wall. These were obviously the ambassadors from all the races that the Teraidian Empire had allied with. Judging by they leaders they had there, the army was nothing to sneeze at. Shade took a seat between Tammic and the Dwarf.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp After Shade sat Tammic rose. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I know not many of you know each other, so if I may do an introduction. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This, he said, motioning towards the Dwarf, is Jarlin ap. Hewgarth ap. Arkrin ap. Kernos. The Dwarven ambassador, Ruler of Karack-Kalain, Lord of a million Jewels...&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Shade noted that Tammic used Jarlin's full name rank and title. Even going as far as to repeat his lineage back to his great grandsire. Shade had heard of Jarlin, and the legends told of his ancestors. Jarlin was said to be one of the greatest warriors, and one of the richest dwarves. The million jewels are said not only to be in his personal collection, but also to very in size from the size of a robins egg to the size of a table. Jarlin was definitely one to have on your side.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tammic was just finishing extrolling Jarlin's virtues and getting into why Jarlin was there and what news and troops he brought as Shade started listening again.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;He comes to us from the northern-most end of the Salamanderinian mountains with news. Jarlin Left with his army of Dwarves to join with us the day, nay the second he heard of the uprising. He came with over seven thousand Warriors and tells us there will be more coming from the Krackaiden mountains after the alliance is confirmed, and more still when we reach the Salamanderinian mountains.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;If we reach the Salamanderinian you mean,&quot; mumbled Trent<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tammic shot him a murderous glare.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Is there something you wanted to add Trent?&quot; he growled.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Nope not a thing,&quot; grinned Trent, &quot;Now hows about telling us who the rest of these beaming faces belong to.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tammic cleared his throat, glaring at Trent one more time..<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;As I was saying. Jarlin says we will have more troops WHEN we reach the Salamanderinian, and we should have some news when we reach the Hatnitshut pass.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This,&quot; he said, motioning at Shade, &quot;Is Shade. I apologize I do not know more about him then the fact he is the last surviving Berzerker who stayed up in Norticana and he is a true warrior, he proved that at the Crodanan Bridge. He will be speaking later on about what has happened with him.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tammic motioned to the left of Shade, at the Furfoot.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;This is Grunsfoot Halerdapin. Furfoot ambassador from the Krackaidens. He and his Furfoot scouts have been watching Undead maneuvers around the mountains. Apparently the raiding party defeated by the group lead by Shade, Trent and myself was a first wave assault, sent to take and hold the bridge. The rest of the undead army was only a day or two behind. If it had not been for Shade, Trent and Tammic we would probably be defending the city as we speak. This is good for two reasons. One, it meant that that was a truly momentous defeat for the undead, and victory for us. Two it means that all the undead have to make the trip down to the bottom of the Krackaidens to cross, not just a small group of them, so they probably won't reach it before the snow closes it off.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Grunsfoot has brought with him two thousand Furfoot explosive experts and five hundred scouts. He says that there are a thousand more scouts scattered across the mountains and that there is just as many as he brought waiting for us at Keralminin.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Trent looked around the table sighed and sunk into his seat. he whispered to Shade<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Something tells me all these introductions are going to last longer then the actual meeting.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I know, I would much rather be practicing and training the troops for the upcoming battle, this seems rather useless,&quot; whispered Shade back.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Kennith leaned over smiled and whispered,<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Yes, it's boring, but at least we know we have troops and we can start making plans, I think no matter what Tammic is telling us there will be fighting before the winter comes.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp With this they caught Tammic's eye as he finished a drink, Tammic glared and then started to talk again, this time gesturing at Trent.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;This is Trent, he is a human, who apparently lived outside the Krackaidens before joining up with my forces. He has not told me anything about himself so I will have to call on him to give a proper introduction.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Trent was surprised by this news. He quickly chugged the rest of his mead and stood, he looked around the table and cleared his throat as Tammic had done. Kennith let out a small laugh.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Hi everyone, I'm Trent. As Tammic said I lived outside the Krackaidens, about a four day march to the west of the Crodanan pass. Um I've journeyed all over the place, I know this country pretty well. Er I don't have any troops with me, but I  can probably get a few people in each town. Anything else?&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He looked around the table, no one said anything so he shrugged and sat down. He emptied another glass of mead and looked over at Kennith.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Well that was awkward,&quot; he whispered, &quot;I hope for your sake that he knows a few things about you.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Well he knows all that I feel like sharing,&quot; Kennith whispered back, &quot;But knowing my luck and his new found dislike of me, I should think he'll ask me to tell my whole life story in song form or something to the like.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Trent and Kennith both laugh, Shade and Jarlin, overhearing the conversation joined in the laughter. Tammic ignored them and kept on with the introductions.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;This is Korlif,&quot; he said, gesturing at the Berzerker, &quot;He left Norticana when reports of the undead invasion trickled in to help us in defense. He has fought many battles against groups of undead and was indispensable in getting our men to this side of the Krackaiden. He brings with him over eight thousand Berzerkers. This does not count the Berzerkers in the Teraidian Army or the Knights of the Guard, this is only the group that personally swear allegiance to him. The rest of the Berzerkers who swear allegiance to King Tellerian will be handed over to Korlif as a sign of good faith and to better co-ordinate their attacks.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This got a nod from the king. Trent leaned over to Shade and whispered<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Hey, I wonder what they'll trade you for?&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I don't know what i'll go for, all I know is that it'll be more then you&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tammic had finished with Korlif at this point and was now moving on to the Elf, sitting straight and proud in his chair next to the King. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;This is Lerlin Yt'Nor, Elven ambassador from the Asidern Forest. He has an incredible skill with the bow and has volunteered to train our archers.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Trent was quickly growing bored with all the formalities accompanying these meetings, he mad a mental note to be off fighting or at a tavern when the next one happened, and as he glanced over at Shade and Kennith he guessed he would not be hard pressed to find company. Trent motioned over one of the serving girls and got a few more glasses of mead and a few pork chops floating in a mushroom sauce, he thanked her and began to eat. He half clued in when Tammic announced the troops brought by Lerlin.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Lerlin has brought us three thousand Elves proficient with the bow and the sword. He tells us that we will get more reinforcements when we reach Asidern. He brought the three thousand as instructors for our archers and left the rest as a homeland guard.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  Trent's curiosity was then piqued when Tammic moved to one of the Humans that neither Shade nor Trent could identify.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;This is Vidare Gol,&quot; Tammic started. It then hit Trent who these three unidentifiable men were. He tapped Shade on the shoulder to get his attention. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;These are the Regents of the Land outside the Krackaiden. That guy,&quot; he said gesturing towards Vidare, &quot;was mine.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Regents?&quot; asked Shade, &quot;What's a regent?&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;They're Governors of a certain area of the land. The Regent's are voted in by the people but the candidates are picked by the king. For you see, The Teraidian Empire, as you know, was quite large, it could not all be efficiently controlled by the king alone so it was divided into four parts. The land to the West of the Krackaidens, to the East of the Bay of Klitharen and to the North of the Asidern Forest is one area, ruled by Vidare Gol. The land to the West of the Bay of Klitharen, the East of the Salamanderinian   Mountains and to the North of the Yitaran is the second, ruled by Garon Hery. The third is the area below the first two and above the Scrublands, it is ruled by Fensen Trilinday. The fourth area is the land to the East of the Krackaidens, it is ruled by none other then King Tellerian.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp At this time Tammic was just finishing up the introduction of Vidare with the troops that he brought.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;He has brought with him no less then twelve thousand men, three thousand archers and the troops brought with Shade, Trent and myself.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Trent completely lost interest at this point, now that he already knew who the others were. He started to day dream and drink some more mead, his head was swimming at this point and found it a much more pleasant feeling then the boredom he was experiencing before. He didn't pay attention again until Tammic introduced Kennith.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Kennith stood up almost immediately afterwards, clearing his throat he addressed the assembly. &quot;What I have learned of the undead is this. They are as a whole slow, stupid, and can be quite easily defeated. There are some exceptions though. These exceptions, become generals and whatever they say will be done. You take out the generals and the undead will then just pick a target and do whatever they can to kill it, ignoring anyone attacking them. When they are in this state  they can be defeated, with large losses on our side, but they will be defeated. So one way to try and win is to take out the generals then engage the whole of the undead force. Taking them out, but in the process crippling ourselves. The other way, is we send a team to take out 현i- Ythert鴻 and Gostmaster.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The rest of the assembly broke in to yelling. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Ya, an' well dis is goin' on ya 'spect de undead ta jus' si' back an' le' us kill dere masta'?&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;And then what!&quot; Bellowed Jarlin, &quot;Do the undead just realize they were being bad and leave us alone? If anyone killed me you can be damn sure the rest of the dwarves would hunt down the bastard. Kill him and nail parts of him to the mountain as a warning to others&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp With that a knife embedded itself into the back of Jarlin's chair.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Too bad I missed,&quot; said a female voice, I would have liked to travel to every mountain.&quot;<br>
<br>
*Jade*<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Everyone immediately looked to the doorway. Shade's mouth, as long as almost everyone in the council room dropped open. Standing, framed in the doorway was the most beautiful woman Shade had ever laid eyes on. She was tall, almost six feet. She had dark red chestnut hair that was done up in a braid that went all the way down her back. She had bright, piercing, green eyes. A shapely, strong, toned body. She was dressed in a form fitting, dark green jerkin over a brown leather shirt. tight black soft leather pants, dark brown leather boots and a dark brown cloak. No one in the room had said anything yet, or even made the slightest noise. She walked into the room, over to Jarlin, took the knife from his chair and sat down in Trent's lap.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Hi honey, miss me?&quot; she asked as she kissed him.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Everyone turned to look at Trent. Trent grinned sheepishly at then and gave them a small shrug.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Hi, it's been a while,&quot; was all he could get out.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The king rose, anger etched in his face.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Who is this!&quot; he bellowed, &quot;How did she get in here?&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Trent started to talk but the woman put her finger on Trent's lips and said,<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Don't worry sweety, I'll handle this one,&quot; standing, she walked over to the king, took his hand and shook it, &quot;My name is Jade. I would appreciate if you used that when referring to me instead of 'this'.&quot; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp With that she turned and walked away after a few steps she turned around, and, as an afterthought said,<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Oh, and I got in by walking through the front door&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp With that she drew a chair up next to Trent and plunked herself down in it.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp An awkward silence followed, no one was quite sure of what to do. The king was standing, with his hand still up, opening and closing his mouth, like he was trying to think of something to say but his brain wasn't functioning. Or, to be more precise, like a fish in a tank, opening and closing its mouth not doing a thing. Trent was slumping low into his chair, giving happy looks to Jade, while looking around giving apologetic looks to everyone else as his face turned a dark shade of crimson. The rest were looking back and forth, unsure of what to do next. Kennith broke the silence by standing and asking,<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Can I continue, or are there going to be anymore interruptions?&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp With that the king stopped trying to think of a response to Jade. He sat down heavily into his chair and waved unenthusiastically to Kennith.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Yes, whatever, get on with it,&quot; was the best thing he could muster.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Kennith cleared his throat, he gave a last look around the room, as if to see if their was anyone else ready to jump out of the shadows throwing knives. After assuring himself that there was not he started talking again.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Correct me if I'm wrong but I believe the last thing I said before I was interrupted was that The other way to defeat the undead is we send a team to take out 현i- Ythert鴻 and Gostmaster.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He looked around the hall for conformation, there were a few nods of recognition and a few mumbles of agreement. Satisfied with this Kennith went back to talking.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Now the concern was raised, 'What will happen after?'&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Again he looked around the hall. Jarlin nodded.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;When we kill those two, the undead army will die. The magic holding them together will fail and there bodies will become inanimate corpses again. Then all we have to worry about is the new evil. But as history has taught us we will never be rid of the new evil. Every time this happens the new evil stays. It can be thinned down to a small annoyance. The problem is, every time this happens the evils join up with the new evil. So unless we can find the original source, they will grow stronger every fourteen hundred years . We may beat them now, but eventually we will fall.<br>
