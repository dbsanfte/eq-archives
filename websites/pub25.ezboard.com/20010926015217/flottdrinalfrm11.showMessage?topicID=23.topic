<br>
This weekend was one of all sorts of fun.  Dying, questing, finding out even the best video cards aren't that good, dying again.<br>
<br>
The weekend started out quite well.  Until I decided to run through the DreadLands to get from FV to FM.  Well, technically it should be faster.  Until you factor in the corpse recovery time that is.  Further strategy on this zone will follow.<br>
<br>
The questing part was a blast, as I really enjoy being able to use my Ranger abilities to help others.  That is why I love being a ranger, even in my fictional form (where I portray  real life human on this strange place called Earth) I have always enjoyed being in the woods, learning to track things from my grandfather and knowing what color patterns, signs, and markings left by animals not only distinquish every creature from other types, but also tell you alot about their capabilities.  <br>
<br>
So, this was a blast for me and as a result I met a new Iksar friend.  Well, ok, tis an old friend who for some odd reason likes the look of dry scaly lizard skin enough to cast a hideous spell upon herself.  Everyone, I would like to introduce Golddiggr the Enchantress, who being of sufficient seasoning and adventuring can now cast ILLUSION:IKKIE.<br>
<br>
The quest went off flawlessly, and made me want to quest even more.  Alas, no other mid-levels in the guild seem to have wanted to respond to my post, so I guess that is it for now.  So, I decided to take out my own Iksar brother in arms and do some of his ewbie quests.  Is it just me or are the quests in the Kunark newbie areas sooooo much more thought out than those of the old lands.  Incremental quests are much more fun than one quest that by the time you can complete it you have all but outlevelled its worth.<br>
<br>
Well, the day after doing that quest I decided to go adventuring with Caziel to the Mines in Frontier Mountain (took the long way around this time, avoiding the Dreadlands).  Well, in one fell swoop I nearly got our whole party slaughtered.  Fortunately, I was the only one that died, but that was enoguh to derail our questing and cause a severe waste of time for one of our clerics.  More on strategy below.<br>
<br>
ISSUES of NOTE -- Either Drachnid Recluses are invisible or the new GeForce MX cards have issues.  Thats right, they do not show up on screen until they are sufficiently beating yor brains in.  After dieing to these I went back to get my corpse.  I was being very careful to track these things this time, staying well clear.  Once I got my corpse a friendly caster told me he had the same problem.  So, we did a test run.  He buffed me up completely then had me track a recluse.  I did just that, knowing it had to be within seeing distance due to the fact a Drovalg was within easy casting distance and was listed as being further away in my Track menu.  So, I edged toward the recluse another step or two, and blammo.  All the sudden I was staring right at it while it was rooting my tushie.  Fortunately, the caster did not lie about helping me in our experiment and sufficiently toasted the thing to death.  (Even so I was down to one bubb of health even with his shaman power).  <br>
<br>
I then tried this logged on to my old PC (350 MHz with a TNT 2 Ultra Card) and seemed to be able to see the spiders on it a little sooner, but not enough to stay out of aggro range.  This was most likely due to the limited power of the card and not a glitch like I believe is in the GeForce one.  Of course, maybe I just got the clip plane angle right on the last one, but I doubt it.  Any info on this would be appreciated, as it seems the spiders in FV are nearly as bad.<br>
<br>
STRATEGY - As for my screwup, CAMO is not the same as SUP CAMO, but even that doesn't matter when you forget to cast either before exploring.  When our group to the shortcut to the back of the Mines I stood a little too close to a wall that come to find out had a baddie on the other side.  I was not CAMO'ed and it tore into me big time and brought a couple of friends.  Most of you high level folks have probably been there/done that so this tip aint fer you.  I am only stating it hoping that some other super-noob like myself will learn from it.  <br>
<br>
I also think I am going to take the time to explore dungeons slowly rather than taking the shortcuts around must fo the dungeon.  This is sort of like the Dino DNA thing in Jurassic Park.  I did not have the experience or background on a dungeon (the one above) and even had I lived I would have been afraid to move a single step because there was no zone I could get to from where we jumped down to without alerting every MoB in the zone.  Far better to explore slowly from entrance to bottom (or top) as the dungeons are designed this way.  Don't get cocky in other words.  Take your time and master things slowly.<br>
<br>
COMEDY MOMENT - Trying to help a newbie Iksar who wasn't going to make it to the guards by killing the MoB's trailing it.  Only to have the guards kill the MoB's first.  Then going over and targetting a guard to hail him, not realizing auto-attack was still on and getting killed before I know what is happening.  Sigh.<br>

So here are a couple ideas what might fix your prob...try increase clip plane, make sure all patches are downloaded, and go through your graphic options and make sure they all look ok. Other than that I have no idea...well maybe new vid card drivers? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/umugaluk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mugaluk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 89<br> <font color=#ff7f00>(8/22/01 8:37:50 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Weekend Journal - A new Iksar in town</span><hr size=1> O yeah and make sure directx is up to date. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/utalastheranger.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Talas the Ranger</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>LoTT Member</span><br>  Posts: 239<br> <font color=#ff7f00>(8/22/01 10:24:32 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Weekend Journal - A new Iksar in town</span><hr size=1> Yeah Mug, thats what I was saying.  My older slower, less awesome video card has no problem with the spiders showing up well in advance of them being in aggro range.  It's the new GeForce card that seems to be having issues. I changed all the settings to match and still I can see them on my old card in a drastically underpowered machine long before they eer show up on my GeForce card in my newer PC.  <br>
<br>
I have given up on trying to figure it out.  Let's just say when I run thru spider land I always do it with my older PC being the lead character and my newer PC doing the auto-follow thing.  If I do it the other way around it just aint pretty.<br>

<br>
P.S - Don't have any problem with any other creature in the game like I do the spideys ... tis why I was wondering if the spiders in DL had there own version of Camo or Invis maybe.  Just a thought, but remember, since I am a newb, my mind tends to think strange thoughts that others have long ago figured out. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/utomerrilin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tomerrilin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Council of Lords</span><br>  Posts: 176<br> <font color=#ff7f00>(8/23/01 2:45:17 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Weekend Journal - A new Iksar in town</span><hr size=1> Talas,<br>

I'm running a Geforce2 MX/MX400 and I had problems at first, but it turns out it was the onboard Crystal Audio sound board that was the source.  I disabled it and installed a SB Live! and all my problems disappeared.  Don't know if that helps, but worth a thought.<br>
