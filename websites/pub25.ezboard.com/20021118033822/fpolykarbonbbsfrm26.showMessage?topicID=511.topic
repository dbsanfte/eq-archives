JERRY SPRINGER AND FINAL FANTASY 8<br>
<br>
Segment: when final fantasy becomes final reality: 2!<br>
<br>
The camera panned around the joyous hooting and hollering crowd before it finally settled on the host of the show, Jerry Springer. &quot;Welcome! Today my guests are here to confront and confess to their lovers for the second time. Now meet Shiva.&quot; the camera shot over to the tall and beautiful graces of the icy-blue Guardian. <br>
&quot;Now, Shiva says that she has something to confess to her husband-Shiva, what's going on?&quot; Shiva was looked around the crowd then back at jerry. &quot;My husband is not the same demon that I married lately...&quot; she stopped as the crowd 'awed' at her words. She wasn't used to talking, let alone being in front of an audience.  &quot;...Because of that...my eyes have wandered to another.&quot; the crowd immediately began to boo, knowing that her fancy words could not mask her cheating ways, but her intensely cold stare silenced them immediately. &quot;How did it happen?&quot; Jerry said intriguingly. Shiva fidgeted in her seat. &quot;I was at a guardian gathering party, and we began to talk, have a few drinks...the rest is history.&quot; the crowd Booed once more, but not for long due to her intimidating glances about the studio inhabitants.<br>
 Jerry quickly filled the silence. &quot;Well, He's been watching backstage, here is your husband, Ifrit!&quot; the lumbering red and brown mass known as Ifrit came charging onto the stage causing Shiva to automatically jump from her seat and levitate with a crystallized aura around her. &quot;How could you!? We have been through so much!&quot; Ifrit growled. &quot;No, how could YOU!? For months, you have been colder than ME in this marriage!&quot; Shiva shot back. Ifrit roared that shook the walls of the show in reply. &quot;Who is this guardian, woman!? I shall tear him to shreds!!&quot; He screamed. <br>
Jerry Springer shouted among the chaos and fear of the crowd. &quot;Let’s bring him out, then! Here is Carbuncle!&quot; the greenish, red-jeweled Cabbit-like Guardian spirit hopped out onto the stage with a cute jingle of unseen bells. Shiva immediately picked him up and kissed him, making Ifrit Infuriated. He gave another hellish roar with rage before charging at them both. The security team kept their distance. Not even Steve, everyone's favorite bald-headed Security guard, was going to attempt at holding back the Fiery Beast. Shiva’s invisible protection wall ended his attack with an abrupt and electrifying thud. Ifrit recovered quickly and took a few steps back. &quot;Carbuncle! You where my friend, how could you betray me!?&quot; the hell giant said, less outraged than before. Carbuncle gave a few small squeaks in Shiva's arms that sent Ifrit into another Rage. &quot;What!? You’ll pay for those words you green little freak!!&quot; he roared. <br>
Shiva concealed Carbuncle even more in her arms. &quot;Don’t you dare touch him, you demonic Satan minion-wannabe!&quot; she shouted at him. &quot;Your one to talk, Polar Bitch!&quot; Ifrit shot back. The crowd immediately went into a frenzy chanting 'Ifrit' in the trademark jerry Springer melody. &quot;What does he have that I don’t, Shiva!? He doesn't have any arms for Yevon's sake!&quot;<br>
&quot;He doesn't need arms for what he can do to Me.,” she said in a seductive tone, sending the crowd into another uproar along with the outraged Ifrit. &quot;If lust is all you wanted, did I not show you enough passion”!? Shiva gave him a sly and cruel look. She was no longer shy with the crowd. Right now they didn’t even exist. &quot;You couldn't even light a candle, let alone make a flame for my fire.&quot; Carbuncle Squeaked in agreement. <br>
That did it. The Raging Ifrit was at the breaking point. His fiery red fur glowed with an unnatural light as a lava induced fireball arose from the ground below him, rising the demon beast into the air. Jerry looked at the Guardian knowing what was to come with an anxiety struck face. &quot;Oh no, not again.&quot; he whimpered as he dived behind the stage for cover. Ifrit spiked the giant molted lava clod at Shiva. With surprised eyes she threw Carbuncle to the side with a quick squeak of protest as the fireball engulfed the Ice Shard. The smoke slowly cleared, and the audience stood in smoldering silence. Shiva arose from her bracing impact stance, and shook the soot from her hair and body to reveal the iceiest cold stare to date directed at Ifrit. &quot;You shouldn't have done that...&quot; she seethed. Summoning up her blue magic in each hand, she drew back to release her Diamond Dust attack as Jerry ran up to Shiva. &quot;Wait! Wait! Shiva, please&quot; Jerry pleaded. A part of his hair was still on fire from Ifrit's attack, but he didn’t seem to notice. &quot;We have to go to commercial now.&quot; Shiva lifted a brow at the host, then the glowing orbs in her hands dissolved. &quot;Oh thank you, thank you!&quot; Jerry said happily. <br>
After the commercial, some of the crew where still putting out the flames on the backdrop of the stage with fire extinguishers, and jerry's hair had received emergency attention. He looked at the camera then down at his little blue cards he kept in his hand. <br>
“Well, if your just tuning in, you’ve missed a lot. Our previous guests are backstage, talking with some of our marriage professionals. And just in time, too. As you can see, our set has been dealt the most damage it has ever been subjected to here on the show.” He said with a timid chuckle. “So, let’s bring out our next guest. Her name is-“ Jerry was interrupted by a muffled, but hair raising howl from backstage. Suddenly, the entire backdrop of the stage exploded. Almost all cameras where knocked offline, except for one that had gone crooked, from the blast. From what could be seen, pandemonium reigned on the crowd as well as debris from the wall. Shiva and carbuncle glided swiftly across the floor, as Ifrit charged after them. His fur smoldering from the intensity of the blast he had delivered to destroy his unfaithful wife. “GET BACK HERE!!” he bellowed, as Shiva and carbuncle disappeared like an icey ghost through the opposite wall. Ifrit easily blasted through it with another powerful summoning of lava. <br>
<br>
The camera picked up the sirens of arriving fire trucks and police cars, until it finally malfunctioned and fizzed off.  <p><A HREF="http://smoothimages.homestead.com"><IMG SRC="http://smoothimages.homestead.com/files/Animation2.gif"BORDER=0></A> </p>
