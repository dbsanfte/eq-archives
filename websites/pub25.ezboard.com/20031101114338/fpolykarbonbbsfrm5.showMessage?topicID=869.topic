the character itself<br>
...<br>
then i remembered the way i remembered my abc's when i was a kid...through rhyme baby...<br>

<br>
anyway, i just want to check. are you talking about kana (hiragana/katakana?) or kanji? (the more complex characters)?  I just asked because there's slightly different strategies for studying each, IMO.  For instance:<br>
<br>
&gt; hmm...but ya the look of the characters..personally i dont care about stroke order...<br>
&gt; if they dont respect my leetzor skills on jap characters its their own fault :P<br>
<br>
in kana, stroke order isn't of utmost importance.  It still is something you should learn (as an example, my current electronic dictionary lets me input kanji/kana directly, but i always have a hard time writing &quot;he&quot; on it, because i learned the stroke order the wrong way and the dictionary doesn't like it) but the world won't end if you don't write them in exactly the correct order.<br>
<br>
However, in the case of kanji, l33t h4x0r skills not withstanding, if you don't learn the correct stroke order for the characters, you will run into severe problems very quickly.  Kanji dictionaries require that you know the stroke order/ radicals/ stroke count for a given character, and if you don't know how to write kanji correctly, you will find it very difficult to use a kanji dictionary successfully.  This problem is only exmplified if you want to use an electronic dictionary somtime in the future.  <br>
<br>
you had mentioned wanting to improve &quot;the look&quot; of your characters.  While personally the mysterious ways in which japanese people can manage to make every kanji, no matter how complex look beautiful and elegant while mine, no matter how much i labor over it, still comes out looking muddled and smudgy, still eludes me, if you learn the correct stroke order for each character, they will look 10x better and more &quot;japanese&quot;.  hee hee.. in case you can't tell, i'm really harping on stroke order here <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   (my teachers would be proud).<br>
<br>
&gt;Gaijin: Can this be taken offensive? Should it be?<br>
<br>
Gaijin (literally &quot;foreign person&quot;) can be considered slightly derisive, it kind of depends on how it's intended/expressed.  However, it's also the de facto term for foreigners, so you'll hear it used innocuosly (spelling?) as well.  Some foreigners prefer the term &quot;gaikokujin&quot; (&quot;foreign country person&quot;) as more polite.  Really, it's up to you, and how offended you choose to be when you hear the term.  Sometimes the term &quot;gaijin&quot; is nuanced to refer to white western foreigners while &quot;gaikokujin&quot; is used to refer to other types of foreigners.<br>
<br>
&gt; Conjugation: Ive always had problems with this, and i thought i under stood this, but i guess i never<br>
&gt; HOW TO FIND THE ROOT VERB! EG : kaimashita sure its a verb, but its conjugated. <br>
&gt; Now make it informal and non conjugated and tell me how you did it  <br>
<br>
Kaimashita:<br>
かいました<br>
買いました  (in this case i just arbitrarily picked the verb &quot;to buy&quot; for kaimashita.  there is another one, &quot;to raise&quot; (as in &quot;raise a cow&quot;))<br>
<br>
as you know from the thread down below talking about conjugation (you did read that one, right? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) the last character of &quot;u&quot; verbs conjugate from the &quot;u&quot; sound to the &quot;i&quot; sound of that row (and add &quot;~masu/mashita&quot; etc.).  (read the previous thread if that is confusing) what that means is:<br>
く　to:  き<br>
ぶ to: び<br>
つ to:　ち<br>
<br>
and finally:<br>
う to:　い<br>
<br>
so you look at the word &quot;kaimashita&quot; and you notice <br>
these parts: ka - i - mashita<br>
what you can tell from this is:<br>
&quot;mashita&quot; (past tense)<br>
&quot;i&quot; it must be an &quot;u&quot; verb<br>
<br>
&quot;ka&quot; (the rest of the verb, we can ignore this part for now)<br>
<br>
so you probably say &quot;but maimai! you must be crazy from eating too much tonkatsu again! how can i know that &quot;i&quot; is the conjugated version of &quot;u&quot; rather than just part of the verb itself..!?&quot;<br>
<br>
Well, basically you have to &quot;get a feel for it&quot;.  Which is not what you want to hear, I'm sure, so fear not young grasshopper.  You can usually &quot;cheat&quot; a little bit bit- you know that &quot;mashita/masu&quot; and &quot;masen/masendeshita&quot; are the formal (positive and negative, respectively) endings for a verb.  So what you can do is look at the character immediately preceding those endings to get a sense of what's going on in a verb.  In the case of &quot;kaimashita&quot; you would get<br>
ka - i -mashita (like above).<br>
<br>
so you can kind of garner that &quot;i&quot; must come from &quot;u&quot; and that the dictionary form must then be:<br>
kau<br>
買う/かう<br>
<br>
I know this seems confusing so to reinforce the point:<br>
いきます<br>
<br>
break down. First remove the &quot;masu&quot; portion and you get:<br>
iki + masu<br>
<br>
then look at the character immediately preceding ~masu and you see:<br>
ki<br>
which can lead you to think that this must be <br>
&quot;ku&quot; to: &quot;ki&quot; so you would get the verb<br>
&quot;iku&quot; (&quot;to go&quot;). <br>
<br>
But this example is tricky, because there is also a &quot;ru&quot; verb &quot;ikiru&quot; (&quot;to live&quot;) and that would conjugate the same way as &quot;ikimasu&quot;  (for &quot;ru&quot; verbs, you drop the &quot;ru&quot; and add ~masu).<br>
<br>
so how do you know which one it is..!!?<br>
いく to: 　いきます<br>
or<br>
いきる to:　いきます<br>
well, if it was just hiragana, then you'd have to rely on the context clues just like you do in english (how do you know if the book you're reading is referring to &quot;bass&quot; the fish or &quot;bass&quot; as in &quot;my stereo's got some kickin' bass!&quot;??)  But this is japanese, and finally we see a good reason for having kanji around!<br>
行く &quot;to go&quot; becomes: 行きます<br>
生きる &quot;to live&quot; becomes: 生きます<br>
<br>
as you can see, the two kanji are different, as thus you can tell which way you should conjugate your verb, as the &quot;u&quot; verb &quot;iku&quot; or as the &quot;ru&quot; verb &quot;ikiru&quot;.<br>
<br>
that example was tricky, so we'll try and easier one:<br>
たべません <br>
break it apart and you get:<br>
tabe + masu<br>
<br>
looking at the character immediately proceeding the ~masen and you see &quot;be&quot;, which is *not* an &quot;i&quot; row sound.  so you can somewhat safely assume that this is a &quot;ru&quot; verb.  so you reverse the conjugation of a &quot;ru&quot; verb by dropping the &quot;~masen&quot; and adding &quot;ru&quot;:<br>
tabe + masen    to:  tabe + ru:<br>
taberu: &quot;to eat&quot;<br>
<br>
another easy one:<br>
みました<br>
you get:<br>
mi + mashita<br>
<br>
there is only one character preceding the ~mashita, and while it *is* an &quot;i&quot; row sound, this must be a &quot;ru&quot; verb, because no verbs (to my knowledge) consist of just one character (does that make sense? so &quot;mu&quot; cannot be a verb that conjugates to &quot;mimashita&quot;- you need at least two characters). so you can deduce:<br>
mi + mashita  to:  mi + ru <br>
miru: &quot;to see&quot;<br>
<br>
finally:<br>
えらびません<br>
<br>
again, break apart and get:<br>
erabi + masen<br>
<br>
&quot;bi&quot; is an &quot;i&quot; row sound, so you can figure somewhat safely that it is the &quot;u&quot; verb conjugation of &quot;bu&quot;.  (&quot;bu&quot; to &quot;bi&quot; + masu)<br>
so you get<br>
erabi + masen  to:   &quot;erabu&quot;<br>
erabu: &quot;to choose&quot;<br>
<br>
there is no exact way to know that there is no &quot;ru&quot; verb such as &quot;erabiru&quot; that would conjugate the same way, other than to just have a &quot;feeling that it sounds wrong&quot;.  As you learn more japanese, that sense will come to you.  Sometimes you will make mistakes when trying to figure out the correct dictionary form (i still sometimes do) but that's just life.  As your knowledge of kanji expand you will find that ultimately that is the most helpful way of knowing what the correct dictionary form of a conjugated verb is, as you can just look up the kanji and you will find the correct dictionary form verb.  All the more reason to study your stroke order!!!<br>
<br>
anyway, this is not the &quot;official&quot; way to figure out what the dictionary form is, it's just the way i seem to remember learning how to go about it.<br>
my goodness! i seem to have written a short novel here! so this looks like a good place to stop.  Hope that helps!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
