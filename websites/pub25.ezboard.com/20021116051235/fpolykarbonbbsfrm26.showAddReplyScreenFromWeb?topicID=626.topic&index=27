&quot;No,&quot; Decker answered.  Matrix sat on a nearby bench.<br>
<br>
&quot;The chosen few, are three transformed superhumans, that are almost in control of the whole galaxy.  There is one from each speices. These &quot;beast&quot; were undergoing the same transformation i was.  They were part of the same organization as i was.  Only the transformation  went bazurk.  Each person wa given two much power, more than the gaurds, and operators of the facility.  They overtook the place.  Then were informed of the Solar-Plant.&quot; <br>
The two looked at him in confusion.<br>
&quot;The Solar Plant, is the planet, in which every thing in the galaxy is controled.  Weather patterns, gravity levels, all of it.<br>
&quot;What,&quot; Decker exclaimed, &quot;how come i was never informed&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Because if anyone knew about it's exsistence, then the galaxy could be in danger.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Then how do you know of it?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;well I am part of the team that defends this planet.&quot; Matrix said.  Anyway back to the chosen.  Their birth happend 200 years ago.  Then my team searched and destroyed them, at least we thought.  The remained weak, but now they are strong with life, and are willing to take back the galaxy.&quot;<br>
<br>
Decker looked puzzeled, &quot; So what does all this mean?&quot;<br>
<br>
Matrix looked up and smiled, &quot;It means, hold on, cus it's gonna be a hell of a ride.&quot;<br>

Every RPG I've done with you, you've wanted to be called Alec or Micheal. Mind telling me why?<br>
<br>
Zak moved slowly down the street, looking in all directions at the ruins and destruction. The Terran Embassy was just down the street from his position. His squad had fanned out amongst the ruins, and were covering the area. The occasional brief burst of suppressed fire whispered through the ruins, and Zak nodded with pride.<br>
The Terran Embassy was one of the few mostly untouched buildings in the ruins of the city, and for a moment Zak wondered why. Then he saw movement in the shadows, and drew his blades.<br>
What stepped out was a figure from the past, tall and powerful. Zak dropped his weapons as he collapsed to his knees, clutching at his head. The madness had arisen again, and he felt as though a hand had reached into his head, crushing his mind in a grasp of steel.<br>
'So, mighty warrior. You have returned to us' spoke the figure, the voice of death. 'I often thought that you might have died honourably on the field of battle. But when my scouts reported a man with whirling blades of power and speed, I knew that you were on this ball of dust.'<br>
'D'Archon...' Zak murmured as he rose from the ground. 'What you did to me cannot go unpunished. I have grown stronger, much stronger. If you fight me now, this will not be as our old days. I will crush you.' The utter conviction with which he spoke stopped D'Archon's advance for a moment, but the black being simply laughed and strode forwards again.<br>
Zak threw up his hand, and D'Archon was flung backwards into the wall of the embassy by a burst of sheer power. Zak calmly stooped to retrieve his weapons, and D'Archon drew his greatsword of purest shadow. With a psychic roar that resounded down the street, loud enough to shake the entire ship and cause Zorbus to collapse in seizures, the two warriors charged, blades flickering, each probing weaknesses in the other's defence. <p>'It's better to light a candle than curse the darkness, and better than both to remain unseen.'- NeoAngel. .................

<br>
Zak staggered back, a dull ache in his hip where D'Archon's shadow-forged blade had slipped between his whirling steel, through the impenetrable wall of both his blades and his psionic field. He changed style, fighting purely defensively, and this saved his life as D'Archon's blade swept in high, dipping low on the backswing, deflecting Zak's defending twin blades but coming to a halt inches away from his neck as it encountered a strengthened energy field. Zak charged straight in with both weapons, but was beaten back by a series of telekinetic assualts he just barely managed to deflect.<br>
'It's no good' he muttered. 'There's only two weapons on this planet that could get through that bastards defence, and he's holding one of them'. Opening a psionic link to Zorbus, he screamed inside his mind. 'Zorbus! There is a long case in my quarters, at the back of the closet! Levitate it to my position now!' <p>'It's better to light a candle than curse the darkness, and better than both to remain unseen.'- NeoAngel. .................

Deciding that it is not a good time to interfere when two forces are colliding in such a manner, he decides to head back to the ship he saw them emerge from.<br>
<br>
As he turns around and heads back, he removes his handgun from its holster.  Cautiously he moves in the direction of the ship, stopping occasionally to check the surruonding area.  As he approaches the limits of the capital he heels like he is being watched, his suspitions are confirmed as an alarm alerts him to the people following him, not wasting any time Alec dives for cover.  Looking around the corner he notices a five blacc-clad individuals.  Staying out of sight Alec prepares himself for the worst. <br>
<br>
Suddenly the blacc-clad individuals turns around, breathing a sigh of releif Alec continues his journey back to the ship occasionally looking over his shoulder to check that he has lost the tail completely.  As he approaches the ship Alec holsters his weapon and removes his helmet revealing his battle-scarred face, ascending the ramp he hesitates for a moment but the continues, as he steps inside the ship he says &quot;excuse me I've come to offer my services, who's in charge here&quot;. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=neoangel>NeoAngel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(6/20/02 10:51:39 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=626.topic&index=36>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Re:Angel+ByTheGun RPG</span><hr size=1> Zak pressed the attack, driving D'Archon backwards into the wall of the Terran Embassy. But D'Archon's shadowblade weaved an impenetrable wall of darkness around him, backed by his considerable psionic shielding.<br>
'So, mighty warrior' he spoke as his blade whirled a complete circle around him, leaving his hand, cleaving through the steel wall behind him and just missing Zak before returning to his gauntleted fist. 'You still possess the blade of our master? The twin to the blade in my fist? You were a fool to leave it behind, and a fool not to disguise your sending just now. I sensed it, and intercepted it. Your martian freak friend will not be able to aid you!'<br>
'If there's one thing I learned in the fighting pits you condemned me to after our masters death' Zak retorted, 'It's that the light in the blade is the light in the heart!'<br>
His twinned blades once more crackled with energy. His torn jacket revealed a metallic implant in his spine as he spun around, a syringe embedded under his skin. As his blades crossed in the air, it hissed and injected a fluid of his own devising into his spinal cord. As his eyes began to glow with a harsh red light, his muscles bulged as the physical enhancer took affect. He grew to match D'Archons height and bulk, and his motions became more fluid.<br>
'The neural interface enhancer! They destroyed the test samples!' D'Archon gasped through his mask. 'How did you procure one?'<br>
'That's an easy one. I was one of the test samples. They removed my long-term memory, and put me in the fighting pits. But I survived. All my memory is encrypted in the hilts of these blades!' Zak cried as his swords pierced D'Archon's body, one through his throat, one effortlessly batting aside his great sword and plunging into his left eye. Zak released the hilts and collapsed to the ground, his body returning to normal as he began to spasm and blood trickled out of his nose and mouth. <p>'It's better to light a candle than curse the darkness, and better than both to remain unseen.'- NeoAngel. .................

<br>
Not missing a beat, Matrix replied, &quot;You are far to young and inexperienced to know the diffrence,&quot;<br>

&quot;And you don't know me well enough to make that judgement!&quot;Caron shouted rising from her seat.<br>

&quot;In all actuality, your facade is fairly see through, and quite easy to judge,&quot;Matrix replied calmly.<br>
<br>
Taking this as a direct insult Caron began to hurl insults in Matrix's diretion, him parriying each with a calmly stated reply.<br>
<br>
After the exchange of heated words for calm remarks ahd gone on for some time, Decker, sensing impeanding physical conflict leaned over to Kale, asking quietly &quot;Shouldn't you stop her?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I had direct instructions from Miss Reine not to interfere if such a situation should arise,&quot;<br>
<br>
Finding Kale useless Decker made to stop the conflict but was beaten by the voice that came in through over the intercom.<br>

Decker was out the room as quickly as possible, closely followed by Caron and Matrix, while Kale followed behind respectivly. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=neoangel>NeoAngel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(6/27/02 10:11:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=626.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Re:Angel+ByTheGun RPG</span><hr size=1> Zak lifted himself off the ground, then collapsed into the pool of blood around his body.

--People, Commander Bo Decker is back.<br>
<br>
<br>
Zorbus' retrieval party arrived at Zak's possition on light feet.  Stepping forward, the martian carefully knelt by the bloody warrior's side.  <br>
&quot;I'll have to begin healing him here, set up a parameter guard, and stay...&quot; <br>
He was interupted by a loud crunching sound.  Turning, the group watched as peices of D'Archon's head crunched back into place, his flesh wounds slowly regenerating.<br>
A sudden explosion of energy sent the entire group flying back.  Zorbus landed hard, squinting to find his assailant.  <br>
With the clouds of dust, the ringing inside Zak's ears slowly faded.  As it did so, a familiar laughter could be heard.  His brother stepped into his sight, stained red by the blood in Zak's eyes.<br>
&quot;Hahaha, did you ever wonder where I went for all those years?  No...you wouldn't, but then...you also thought I killed our master just for the fun of it, right?  No my brother, no...I was made an offer I couldn't refuse.  You see there was a company interested in skills like mine, but they need me to take a human life before taking me on.  You see, they take normal people...such as I was...and give them great power.  Power enough to guard a world called the Solar planet.  However, they decided to try something new on me, me and one each from the other races. <br>
He glanced around to find the rescue team regrouping.  &quot;They gave us power...too much power for them to control.  So we left, and now we have a plan...It'll be interesting to see you and your pathetic friends try and stop us.&quot;<br>
With that, D'Archon levetated slowly off the ground, and flew off towards his awaiting transport.<br>
<br>
OOC: by the way...his transport was the one with the assasins and the large object, so it waited long enough to pick him up <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

With Zobus's help, Zak and his men return to the ship.  <br>
Apon their arrival, Decker moves the ship into the planet's orbit to protect the crew from further assault.<br>
Now, Decker calls all of his officers and Matrix to the War room to discuss their next move.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
OOC:  There ya go, time to get things moving anywho.  <br>
<br>
By the way, in case you missed it...the assasins made off with some treasure at the embassy, D'Archon was leading them.  D'Archon told his brother Zak that he was one of 3 advanced warriors.  Unknown to Zak and Zorbus, Matrix has just told Decker and Reine about the same chosen...who intend to capture the world which controls all life in the universe. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ukyojiogami.showPublicProfile?language=EN>kyoji Ogami</A> at: 9/25/02 3:23:21 pm<br></i></td></tr></table><br><font color=#336699>- </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs>Polykarbon BBS</a><font color=#336699> - </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26>Writer's Forum</a> <font color=#336699> - </font><a href="http://www.polykarbon.com">Polykarbon: Manga & Photoshop</a><font color=#336699> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM ARTS AD SCRIPT -->
