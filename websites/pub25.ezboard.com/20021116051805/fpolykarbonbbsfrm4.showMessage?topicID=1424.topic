I am not a fan of DBZ, it's one of those things I watch if it happens to be on when I have time to kill.  <br>
<br>
I think it takes way too long for anything to occur.  Here's how just about every episode proceeds (in my mind): they flex, insult each other, throw a few punches etc., have some thoughts about how easy or tough the fight is, throw a few more punches, flex a little bit more, and then the narrator says, &quot;Next time on Dragon Ball Z!..blah blah blah.  The episodes basiclly proceed like this or this in some rearanged order.  And occasionally someone gets some random new super power.<br>
<br>
Also, the animation is not that great, everything looks grainy, like they didn't have time to clean up their lines or something, I know the series started in the early nineties or something like that, but if you look at say Macross (Robotech) the animation in that is much better and that was done in the early eighties.<br>
<br>
Now I realize that what is shown in america (the U.S.) is the clean, nice version (as is true with pretty much all anime<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  that comes to america, especially on tv), but there is no way that any extra footage can possibly make the story any better.  If anything it would drag on longer.  Also, I can't imagine that the footage not shown is of any better quality, so it wouldn't help against my arguements.  And, it's popular with much of america anyway, dispite what isn't shown.<br>
<br>
I think that the reason it became so popular, was more in it's timing than anything.  When it came to the U.S.  there really wasn't much else out there in the way of anime.  Anime wasn't as mainstream as it is today.  I think DBZ was just lucky, and that it wouldn't be nearly so popular if it had traveled over seas at a different time.<br>
<br>
So those are my thoughts and opinions. I just wanna' hear yours, both pro DBZ and anti....and of course why. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/usuperrats.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Super Rats</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(2/27/02 1:34:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1424.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.happysoda.com/images/eboardavbp.jpg height=130 width=130></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Does DBZ deserve it's popularity?</span><hr size=1> Not again!!!!!!!<br>

Summary:<br>
<br>
Some love it.<br>
<br>
Some hate it.<br>
<br>
Yes, DBZ benefitted from right time/right place.<br>
<br>
If it wasn't good enough for people to like, it wouldn't be popular.<br>
<br>
There are better shows than DBZ.<br>
<br>
Any number of shows could have been as successful.<br>
<br>
DBZ has a lot of episodes.  This is appealing to US programming managers who don't want to have to look and promote a new show if they don't have to.  Plus shows that can run for a while without repeats helps advertising directors to show advertisers that a popular show can run for years, and keep business stable, because the audience will be with the show for a while.  <br>

Besides, how many times do you think &quot;who's the hottest anime chick?&quot;, &quot;what are some good animes?&quot;, or &quot;what's your favorite anime/anime character?&quot; have been bounced around? <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ujapanesenationalist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Japanese Nationalist</A> at: 2/27/02 5:08:35 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ualucard1515.showPublicProfile?language=EN>alucard1515</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator <img src=http://contest.polykarbon.com/badge1.gif></span><br> <font color=#336699>(2/27/02 6:57:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1424.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.undeadart.com/forum/alucard.gif width=100 height=94></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Does DBZ deserve it's popularity?</span><hr size=1> Well, I'm glad to see someone who can at least word their argument fairly.<br>
<br>
Personally, I like the show.<br>
<br>
Of course it isn't the best anime around, yet it's still one of my favorites. I don't think the story is necessarily poor, but the way in which it's told is completely different from anything else. Most shows, anime or otherwise, are episodic. Everything begins and ends within one episode (usually), and raps up nicely. DBZ is more like a saga. The story begins, but doesn't end until much later. <br>
<br>
Now I agree that they drag the anime out quite a bit, long uneccessary pauses, etc, but most of this is filler added to the anime. The show follows very closely to the manga (almost panel to panel, word for word), but some things don't translate well to a live show, such as pauses. These would take a single panel in a comic and you would still understand that the event may take longer, but in an anime you have to show the entire duration of the action. Not to mention countless flashbacks, a few scenes here and there(or extended), and even completely new episodes are added to the series that were not in the original. I still like the show despite this, but it's definitely a flaw.<br>
<br>
I disagree about the animation being poor. Yes, there are anime with better animation, but keeping in mind that the series was made from the 80's through the 90's and the number of episodes involved, you have to realize that it won't be up to the standards as newer movies or even shorter series. I think most people really mean the style when they refer to the animation, rather than the animation itself. I don't know about the actual framerate, and they do use some cycling animation (such as the quick fighting), but it seems to flow pretty smoothly to me, or it gives me that impression at least.<br>
<br>
About the editing, it's not so much cut scenes (at least not anymore), but alterations that are the problem. They don't really cut as much as they did in the beginning, and the censoring is a little more relaxed now. What they haven't stopped doing, however, is rewriting and adding dialogue, changing music, etc. So it's a very different show in it's original form. I'm not saying everyone who dislikes it now would fall in love with it if they saw the original version, but it is very different.<br>
<br>
But does it deserve it's popularity? Sure. There are plenty of shows I don't like, but that doesn't mean they don't deserve their popularity. If it has a fan base, people that truly enjoy the show, then why shouldn't it be popular? <p><table width=100% border=0>

Only the american version has long dull thinking standing there doin nothing moments, because they cut out 5 min from every show. Meaning there is 5 min less and has to be filled. When you think about it, life is long... you cant put yer whole life in 25 episodes... DBZ is about Goku's and Gohan's life so it has to be long. DBZ has to compared to life not other anime! It's a struggle to servive and become stronger, even when you think your the strongest someone proves you wrong. It's a battle for life with some comedy.

That has NOTHING to do with what I'm talking about.  I'm not afraid of a series with a lot of episodes. I definately think a series should quite while it's ahead, allowing you to leave the table, not full, but satisfied, or maybe even a little hungry.  What I mean by that analogy is that I often wish that many of the series' I like, had more episodes!  What I'm saying is that in my opinion the STORY proceeds too slowly.  I have missed something like 10 episodes (estimation, not a hyperboly) and was able to pick up exactly what had occured.<br>

I don't really care for it. Why? well that's the hard part isn't it... I'll try and explain but a couple of disclaimers: one I haven't seen all of it, I've seen up to the point where Gohan is kicking the crap out of Cell (and even that I've only seen sporadically); two, I've only seen the NA release with the exception of a fansub movie or two. <br>
<br>
I guess the main reason it doesn't appeal to me is because it only seems to be about fighting. Yes there are lulls where plot is developed but it feels more like that was put there only to get to the next fight. <br>
<br>
The fights themselves are well done, when they actually get to the fighting <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   But after the first couple of major fights (Vegeta-Freeza sp?) it started to feel repetitive. Much like one of those old side scrolling action games, you fight the minor baddies then you fight the boss, then you get to the next tougher boss, then the next and so on. Now it's not like a lot of series <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  aren't</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> like this, it just feels magnified because to me the plot behind it feels so weak.<br>
<br>
One other quibble, does anyone on the good side actually die? Now by this I mean, do they die and they are never heard from again. Because to me it seems like in the DBZ world, death really isn't that much of a handicap. Sure they die, but they can still keep in touch with the outside world. So, in the entire series does anyone besides the badguys die <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  completely</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, gone without a trace? <p><br>One for the money,<br>Two for the show,<br>Three to get ready,<br>And GO CAT, GO!</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uazoth30k.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Azoth30k</A> at: 3/1/02 1:29:13 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ujapanesenationalist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Japanese Nationalist</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(3/1/02 8:42:55 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1424.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cry.gif" align=absmiddle>  So sorry</span><hr size=1> I wasn't really mad, nor did I feel insulted.

<br>
And as far as I recall, no one good dies forever on the series.<br>
<br>
I see what you're saying about the series being drawn out, and I agree. It could certainly be condensed some, but not to the point where it would be episodic. A lot of things happen in the show, they just tend to happen over an extended period of time, sometimes too long, so it does seem like there's not much to the show. You could easily cut out a lot of the &quot;stare downs&quot; or the flashbacks to the episode right before it, and other things like that. Again, most of the filler is only in the anime, some of it was used to extend it, some of it is just due to the translation from manga to anime, like when things have to be shown for their entire duration. Seriously, if you read the manga it moves MUCH quicker. I guess because you can read it at your own pace. A lot of panels, sometimes pages, go one without word balloons (but this happens in many other mangas as well), usually when they're fighting, so it flows much faster than the anime.<br>
<br>
One problem is that most people that hate it watch maybe one or two episodes and then base their entire opinion around that. It's nearly impossible to have an informed opinion about this show without watching several episodes in sequence. I'm not saying you would or wouldn't like it if you watched some more to find out, but there is no way someone can make any informed statement about the show having only seen a few episodes. <p><table width=100% border=0>

But then I've only seen one issue. And I think the word sporadic was the wrong on to use, I watched it regularly when it first aired up here and I saw all the episodes up to and including the defeat of Freeza. It was only after that point that my interest started to dwindle. I actually really liked the show when it first came on the air (and Piccolo re-growing his arm at the beginning of the series still ranks as one of my favorite scenes) but after a couple of months it did start to drag. And that was with daily airings. <br>
<br>
I must admit though that I'm going to try and find some more of the mangas, if they do have a quicker pace than the show they should be a fun read... <p><br>One for the money,<br>Two for the show,<br>Three to get ready,<br>And GO CAT, GO!</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=evangelion>evangelion</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(3/1/02 9:24:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1424.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cry.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: So sorry</span><hr size=1> i like the part were on now...on CN<br>
