Plus I am a big lyrics guy, I won't like a song, if it has dumb lyrics, and Radiohead makes some of the best points, and has some of the most interesting messages in their lyrics that I've ever heard.<br>
<br>
Nine Inch Nails - Trent Reznor has always been one of my favorites (by always, I mean since 1992) I like the emotion he puts into his songs, it's perfect mood music, and he has done a lot to industrial music in general (such as adding things like cello's and piano's as well as bringing it out into the public). Another thing I like, with his cd's is how well they are put together, most of the songs flow so well into each other you don't notice when the song is changing, also how he uses pure-music songs (ones without lyrics) to set mood for the cd, instead of just filler's like so many other bands do.<br>
Also his Music video's (the ones on Closure) are basically the best ones I've ever seen.<br>
<br>
Skinny Puppy - When they started out they were doing a lot of new, interesting stuff. The originality of them really appeals to me, and the anti-cruelty-to-animals bit appeals to me a lot.<br>
<br>
12 Rounds - I LOVE Claudia's voice, and I find the music very involving.<br>
<br>
That's all I can think of right now. <p><p>

You mean pop music?<br>
<br>
...Anyway, this might be a little off topic, but personally, my favorite music is Rap (in case u couldn't figure it out by the sig).  The great things about great rap albums is not only great music, but also great lyrics.  The greatest lyricists have their words tell storys and/or bring food for thought.  It's like reading a good book, or even sitting through a play or masterpiece theater.<br>
<br>
Here's an example- The song &quot;One Day It'll All Make Sense&quot; by Common.  This song is a little depressing, but it's easy to figure out and made me think with all the metaphors involved:<br>
&quot;-Must have really thought I was God to take the life of my son<br>
-I could have sacrificed goin out<br>
-To think my homies who did it I used to joke about, from now on<br>
-I'ma use self control instead of birth control<br>
-Cause $315 ain't worth your soul<br>
-$315 ain't worth your soul<br>
-$315 ain't worth it&quot;<br>
   In case u didn't know, the song is about abortion.  This song may be a downer, but it does shed some light on a sensitive subject noone talks about (see?  not everyone talks about ice and bently's)<br>
<br>
If the artists is any good, even their worst performances might have u thinking about what they trying to get through to u.  Most rappers (like Jay-Z, Ghost, and Em) always have some sort of subliminal message in the lyrics to all their songs.  You can only catch them if u pay attention, and that's one of the great things about my favorate genre (nevermind the cultural influence). <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>"I got worldwide family all over the earth/ And I worry 'bout 'em all for whatever it's worth/ From the birth to the hearse, the streets, the guns burst/ Words I disperse are here to free minds/ And if mine are needy I need to feed mine" -Rakaa (aka Iriscience) of Dilated Peoples     www.dilatedpeoples.com

In Hip-Hop I like the message, the flowing of the music, plus the music's excellent (in the Hip-Hop I listen to, anyway). Right now I'm falling in love with Jurassic Five.<br>

In RnB I love the melodies, the atmosphere, the energy... Lauryn Hill and D'Angelo are my fav RnB artists.<br>

If you're listening to people like Wu-Tang, Dr. Dre, or Ludacris, of course you'd better expect to keep this away from the parents.  This type, believe or not is more popular, the ice&amp;bently type.  I listen to this but not as much as the next type...<br>
<br>
What many call, the consious type.  It's not particularly cuss-free, but these type of artists [the Commons, Blackstars, Roots, De La Souls, and Tribe Called Quests] put alot more thought into their lyrics/music.  These artists tend to be more creative also (roots play with instruments along with turntables).  This is what I listen to most... <p>"I got worldwide family all over the earth/ And I worry 'bout 'em all for whatever it's worth/ From the birth to the hearse, the streets, the guns burst/ Words I disperse are here to free minds/ And if mine are needy I need to feed mine" -Rakaa (aka Iriscience) of Dilated Peoples     www.dilatedpeoples.com

(House, Garage, UK Garage, drum and bass/jungle, trance, etc.) <br>
Its main appeal is to make you dance. Some people try to insert other meanings/messages into it but that rarely works.<br>
<br>
Drum and bass is my favorite music bar none. 9/10 of DnB tracks are instrumental (like most dance) which is a good thing when you bear in mind its purpose. At a rave the instrumentals are played and MCs freestyle to the beat at an amazing rate. When you listen to an instrumental alone it provokes thought, which in turn gives it meaning. <br>
'cos of the rate of the music (160-180 bpm) and the amount of different drums snares and whatever playing, plus the MCs, the amount of colliding sounds creates a koan like effect on your mind where you can't think about what you're hearing. You just have to let it hit you and enjoy it. <br>
<br>
Although listening to it at home is harsh unless you're in the mood for it.<br>

Well, i dont think anyone would deserve any prizes for guessing what my favourite genre of music is.. But i guess its kind of hard to explain why i love rock music so much... I dont think i can do it for the entire genre as a whole, but i can try to (probably very badly) explain what i love so much about a few of my favourite bands. <br>
<br>
Korn - yeah i know this is probably the most hated band in the world right now, but i dont give a @#%$ what anyone says -they're always gonna be my fave band of all time. I love how much effort they put into each one of their songs, and what perfectionists they are. And i guess it seems kind of stupid, but i can really relate to most of their music, since a lot of the stuff their songs are about i've been going through lately, and its always great to see that i'm not alone, and that someone who was going through the same crap when he was my age, can still grow up to be someone to be looked up to (well, at least by me).<br>
<br>
Orgy - i just love everything about their music - the unqiality (is that a word?), the style, and the lyrics. (take a loot at the song in my profile to see what i mean). I think its awesome how theres something cool and unique about every one of their songs.<br>
<br>
Marilyn Manson - ah.. my idol <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Heh, i think i've explained to many times why i love his music so much, but if you <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> really</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> need to know, ask me - otherwise, i dont want to type out a page of stuff (since i cant really make it any shorter than that), if everyone already knows it/doesnt care ^^<br>
<br>
Limp Bizkit - Hah! Yeah! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Limp Bizkit.. meanigful lyrics that i can relate too ? Hell no! But its just so.. fun <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Heh, plus its kinda cool being the only person alive who doesnt hate fred durst.<br>
<br>
Nine inch nails - Come on.. how can you <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> not</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> love them? Theyre just so.. awesome <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Spineshank - I guess its kinda hard to explain.. i pretty much like them for the same reason as orgy, theres something cool and unique about every one of their songs...<br>
<br>
Ok i could go and an on about slipknot, system of a down, garbage, powerman5000, mudvayne, deadsy, etc, etc... But i think you all get the idea ^_^                           <p><font color="black"><font size=1><font size=3><center> _________ <br><br>

i like incubus and 311, because of their lyrics<br>
i really like incubus' talent<br>
they have an awesome dj, great vocalist who can do more than just sing, and write awesome songs (not to mention sound better live than they do on the cd... not many bands sound better live than incubus except green day) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uq2001.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Q2001</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(12/13/01 4:23:55 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.liquid2k.com/q555/head.jpg height=170 width=100></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: What do you like about your favourite type of music?</span><hr size=1> Well i dont know -=why=-, but it seems every other person even on this board cant stand them, right, sakuma? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><font color="black"><font size=1><font size=3><center> _________ <br><br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Ambient</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> music like Enya/Deep Forest/Enigma really relaxes me and some of it is inspiring stuff.  Good for when I'm drawing/animating.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Dance</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> is probably my fave though.  It lifts me up and gets me all hyped up.  Great to dance to (hence the name) on a night out and is amazing when I'm boxing as it helps me push my body further than what I would normally do.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> I guess people like different music for different reasons and the reason I like it is because it's almost like an external energy source that keeps me going and lifts my mood.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <p><a href="http://www.angelfire.com/super/cvo/"><img src="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/danandchris/sd.jpg" width="300" height="128"></a>

<br>
But I like jazz because it sooths my stress, lets me relax.. and its not as &quot;loud&quot;, if you will, lol, as some music ( I won't name names).<br>
<br>
I like older jazz as well as the new styles, but something about the old stuff justs adds to it.<br>
