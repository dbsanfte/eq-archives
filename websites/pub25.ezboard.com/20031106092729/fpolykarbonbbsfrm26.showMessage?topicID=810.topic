Although it held a single bed and chair, indentical to her own, the aura was different with him. She felt safest lounging in his room, in his company. In his room she often forgot about the dreams that plagued her at night. And, unlike anywhere else, she felt like she belonged when she was with him. But this trip wasn't about belonging, it was about escaping. Katula was on a mission and was determined to walk away. She strode over to him with a slight smile.<br>
<br>
He grinned, &quot;My angel, you've come.&quot; His eyes tried in vain to cath hers.<br>
<br>
&quot;But I haven't come to stay. I've decided to leave,&quot; Katula said kneeling beside him. She brushed back a short strand of his golden hair. &quot;I can't stay here any longer.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Are you having those dreams again?&quot; He grabbed her hand and gave it a gentle squeeze. &quot;You told me they stopped.&quot;<br>
<br>
She rested a cheek against his smooth hand letting her raven hair tickle it, &quot;They've been getting worse.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I won't let anyone hurt you.&quot;<br>
<br>
She pulled her hand away and stood. &quot;Lorraco, you can't baby me forever.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't want to baby you, I love you. That's all. I give you everything I can.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't want to talk anymore,&quot; Katula turned away from him. &quot;I just want to leave.&quot;<br>
<br>
When Katula had told Loracco about her dreams he had assured her that they didn't mean anything. He had promised to take care of her, he convinced her to stay.<br>
<br>
&quot;He said he would kill you,&quot; Katula clutched onto Lorraco's robe. &quot;I watched him rip your heart out. I have to leave.&quot; She stared into his amber eyes. &quot;I need to leave, for you.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;They were only dreams, that's all.&quot; He stroked her hair, &quot;I promised that I would protect you forever and I mean it. I can't die because, if I do, I can't protect you anymore.&quot;<br>
<br>
That was all it took to convince Katula to stay.<br>
<br>
She began to pace around the room, she couldn't stay this time. Her jaw still ached from the stranger in her dream clutching it. Katula stopped with her back to him.<br>
<br>
&quot;I can't stay here.&quot;<br>
<br>
Lorraco stood, touching her shoulder, &quot;Where would you go?&quot;<br>
<br>
Katula shrugged his hand off her shoulder as if it were an insect. &quot;It doesn't matter.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Would you go to your father?&quot;<br>
<br>
She spun around, &quot;He doesn't want me. I don't even think he could give me the answers I want.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Couldn't you just stay here with us?&quot; Lorraco wrapped an arm around her shoulders. &quot;Can't you stay here with me?&quot;<br>
<br>
She buried her face in his chest. &quot;I'm not the daughter you want Lorraco, I was just your replacement.&quot; *I don't even know what I am to you anymore*<br>
<br>
Lorraco cringed, &quot;I may have lost a daughter, but this isn't about that. You are my child.&quot; He paused for a moment, &quot;Will you at least sleep on it?&quot; Lorraco wrapped her into another embrace. <br>
<br>
&quot;I can't anymore. I'm notlike the others, I'm not like you.&quot; *I want to know why*, she thought.<br>
<br>
&quot;We can answer that for you,&quot; Lorraco pulled her closer.<br>
<br>
She pulled away. &quot;That's what I mean. YOu can read my mind,&quot; she began pacing again. &quot;You can feed on only blood, you're never going to age.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You can see the sun, we're all different.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm different. I've grown older all these years adn you haven't changed one bit! You still have a young face, your golden hair, your perfect body. There isn't even a scar to mar your face. Look at me Lorraco! YOu found me when I was only an infant and now I look old enough to be your lover. I can't even read minds like you. Don't you see I don't belong here?&quot; <br>
<br>

<br>
I love writing dialogue, but it's better to crop it down and most clichés come out in writing dialogue (because we often talk in clichés). <br>
<br>
I prefer a more descriptive tone in situations and let the description do the emotions. There's no real sense of space in the description, is it a large room, a small one, where are people kneeling, in front of anything? Think of the picture in your head and then write it down. <br>
<br>
A good exercise is to pick out an art book (Renaissance painters are the best) and then flick through it and then describe the scene in the picture. It allows you to concentrate on the details and create an atmosphere that is tangible and it doesn't take long and you get a good education in art as well. <br>
<br>
Also the fragments of description that you give the characters are too spaced out - it's like a jigsaw puzzle better to get it out in one and then go back to the  &quot;She stared into his amber eyes&quot; touches. <br>
<br>
But your character dynamic is good, I like the way it pans out.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showPrevMessage?topicID=810.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showNextMessage?topicID=810.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=810.topic&index=3><img src=http://www.polykarbon.com/bbsimage/addreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.emailToFriend?topicID=810.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.threadControl?topicID=810.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=810.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=810.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub25.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="polykarbonbbsfrm18">PK-BBS Rules and Regulations!<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm27">Board F.A.Q.s<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm3">News and Updates<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm2">Photoshop and Art questions<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm4">General Manga/Anime Discussion<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm5">Japanese Language Help<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm23">art in progress<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm13">Black and White Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm14">Color Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm19">Member's Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm17">Moderators Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm6">Member Photos<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm31">Help, Hints and Cheats<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm20">Challenges<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm21">Matches<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm26">Writer's Forum<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm32">VG Discussion<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm35">Member Created Tutorials<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm39">What is Fight Club?<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm40">Story Ideas</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#336699>- </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs>Polykarbon BBS</a><font color=#336699> - </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26>Writer's Forum</a> <font color=#336699> - </font><a href="http://www.polykarbon.com">Polykarbon: Manga & Photoshop</a><font color=#336699> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.246h<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
