Hell Freezes Over:  A Planetary Tale <br>
<br>
by Chip Skelton<br>
<br>
<br>
This story takes place a few months before 'Planetary' number 1.<br>
<br>
<br>
PAGE 1<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 1:  A vast desert flatland.  A weathered diner sits in the middle of nowhere.   The same diner as seen in&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp issue 1 of the ongoing series.<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 2:  Interior of the diner.  The waitress leans on the counter.  She has fallen asleep with her head resting in&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp her hands.  A lone, white-clad figure (Elijah Snow) sits at a table in the front of the diner.<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 3:  Elijah Snow is by himself at a table by the front window.  A cup of coffee rests in his cupped hands. His&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp head is down, and his face, with eyes closed, bares no expression.  A fly buzzes around him.<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 4:  Snow halfheartedly attempts to wave the fly away, the only indication that he is even awake.<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 5:  Repeat of PANEL 4, minus the attempted fly shooing.  A sudden, deep shadow falls over the inside of the diner.<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 6:  From his view in front of the large picture window, Mr. Snow sees the cause of the unexpected darkness.  A giant spacecraft, only the smallest portion visible from his vantage point, blots out the sky.<br>
<br>
<br>
PAGE 2<br>
<br>
     <br>
PANEL 1:  The vast spaceship still fills  most of the sky as Snow turns his attention back to his cup of coffee. The fly continues to buzz around him.<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 2:  (Inset of panel 3)  The bell over the entrance to the diner rings.<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 3:  The ugliest, weirdest alien walks in from the hot desert air.<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 4:  The odd creature looks about.  Elijah is again waving away the fly.  Awakened by the bell, the waitress barely looks up.<br>
<br>
WAITRESS:   YEAH, YEAH.  I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 5:  A shot from Snow's perspective.  The alien takes a seat  6 or so tables away from him, as the fly buzzes ceaselessly about the white-suited, white-haired ex-hero.  The waitress approaches her new client.  The alien is speaking to the approaching waitress, but we cannot hear what it is saying.<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 6:  Oblivious to her surroundings, the waitress nonchalantly, almost mechanically, takes her new customer's order.  The alien notices Snow.<br>
<br>
WAITRESS:  NO.  NO, WE DON'T HAVE ANY BLIG-I-BLAT-WHATEVER.  HOW 'BOUT COFFEE?<br>
<br>
<br>
PAGE 3<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 1: The waitress heads back to the counter to fill out the new order.  As the pest continues to plague him, Snow notices the alien is approaching  Snow, while still not lifting his head, is obviously displeased with this new development.<br>
<br>
SNOW:  ...@#%$...<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 2:  The alien stands in front of Elijah. Snow still does not look up.<br>
<br>
ALIEN:  SITTING WITH YOU I MIGHT?<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 3:  Snow looks up at his visitor with a look that conveys the farthest extreme from welcome.<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 4:  The creature scoots into the seat opposite Snow, obviously completely oblivious to the meaning behind Snow's expression.  The alien looks far too awkward and large to fit in the diner couch.   <br>
<br>
ALIEN:  MUCH GRACIOUSNESS ARE YOU.  AM THANKING YOU GREATLY.<br>
<br>
ALIEN:  ARE MUCH TROUBLED.  MINDS AM HEAVY.  HUMAN ARE YOU LOOKING, TO  HEAR WEIGHT.  HELP.<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 5:  Elijah Snow  responds with ample sarcasm.  The alien remains blind to Snow's rudeness. <br>
<br>
SNOW:  OH YEAH, I'M YOUR OWN PRIVATE DOCTOR-FREAKIN'-LAURA.<br>
<br>
ALIEN:  TOO AM FREAKIN' BOB AM ME IS.<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 6:  A look of sardonic disbelief shapes Mister Snow's face.  He has momentarily forgotten the pesky fly.  The waitress approaches in the background.<br>
<br>
SNOW:  ...sure.<br>
<br>
<br>
PAGE 4<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 1:  The waitress absently slides a pot of coffee and cup in front of Snow's company.<br>
<br>
WAITRESS:  HOW 'BOUT YOU?<br>
<br>
WAITRESS:  YOU WANT ANY MORE COFFEE?<br>
<br>
SNOW:  NO, THANK YOU.  I'M STILL WAITING FOR THIS BATCH TO DISSOLVE THE CUP.<br>
<br>
WAITRESS:  MUST BE A BAD MIX.  THE LAST BATCH ATE THROUGH THE POT BEFORE I COULD POUR IT.<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 2:  Snow looks up a Bob, as the waitress leaves.<br>
<br>
SNOW:  BIT OF FREE ADVICE... BOB...  THAT DOG-PISS SWILL WILL BURN A HOLE IN YOUR CUTE LITTLE TUMMY.<br>
<br>
BOB:  APPRECIATION IS HAVING FROM ME, FREAKIN' LAURA.  DIGESTIVE TRACK NO PERIL HAVING.  ACID AM HAD ARE TASTING IN GREATER TOXICITY THAN CURRENT 'SWILL'.<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 3:  Elijah Snow smiles despite himself.  Apparently, he has found something to like about Bob.<br>
<br>
SNOW:  WHAT'S EATING YOU, BOB?<br>
<br>
BOB:  AM TOO BAD SOLAR PERIODS HAVING.  MANY FRUSTRATED THINKING ARE BOB.  CAREER POORLY GOING.<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 4:  Through the on-going insect assault Mr. Snow appears to be warming up to Bob.<br>
<br>
SNOW:  JOB WOES, HUHN, BOB?  WHATCHA DO?<br>
<br>
BOB:  AM INVADING EARTH.  REMOVING HUMAN IMPEDIMENT INFESTATION AM NO LUCK HAVING.<br>
  <br>
<br>
PANEL 5:  A look of incredulity once again shapes Snow's face.  Again, the pesky fly is forgotten.<br>
<br>
SNOW:  ...okay.<br>
<br>
<br>
PAGE 5<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 1:  The conversation continues.  Whatever Snow  appreciated about Bob has shifted to wry amusement.<br>
<br>
BOB:  BOB ARE I TO MATE COMMUNICATING: 'AM WILL TO HOME RETURNING SOON.  INFESTATION ARE ENDING BY ONE SOLAR CYCLE'.<br>
<br>
SNOW:  NOT GOING SO WELL?  WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 2:  Snow makes another lame attempt to wave off the fly. <br>
<br>
BOB:  AM DOUBLE SEVEN CYCLES HERE STRANDED.  ATTEMPTING ERADICATION ARE MANY FAILING.  SUPER PESTS ARE AM SOURCE OF SELF FRUSTRATION.  SUPER PEST INTERFERENCE CONTINUAL.<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 3:  Snow has lost all notice of the once annoying fly.  He looks confused.<br>
<br>
SNOW:  SUPER PESTS?<br>
<br>
BOB:  SUPER PESTS.<br>
<br>
SNOW:  NO. NO...UH, WHAT ARE SUPER PESTS?  ROACHES? POODLES? WHAT?<br>
 <br>
<br>
PANEL 4: Bob tries to clarify Snow's confusion.<br>
<br>
BOB:  HUMAN AM THEM.  FLYING.  BREAKING SHIP.  BREAKING SOLDIERS IS THEY.<br>
<br>
SNOW:  OHHH...  THE SUPERHUMANS ARE GUMMING UP THE WORKS, HUHN?<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 5:  Bob visibly sags under the weight of his troubles.<br>
<br>
BOB:  AM BOB  UNLEADER?  NO PLANET MASTER AM I.  SIMPLE PESTS FOILING GREAT BOB.  BOB-MOM STATE ALWAYS BOB BE NEVER AS GREAT TED.<br>
<br>
SNOW:  WAIT, LET ME GUESS.  GREAT TED IS YOUR BROTHER?<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 6:  Bob corrects Snow.<br>
<br>
BOB:  SISTER.  SHE ARE PLANETMASTER OF THREE CAMPAIGNS.  BOB-MOM LOVING MORE HER ALWAYS.<br>
<br>
<br>
PAGE 6<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 1:  Snow takes another useless swipe at the fly:  Bob listens intently.<br>
<br>
SNOW:  AW C'MON 'GREAT BOB', DON'T  LET 'EM BRING YOU DOWN.  WHAT DO THEY KNOW ANYWAYS, HUH?  I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOUR SISTER, BUT I BET SHE HAS ALWAYS BEEN A BIG ASS-KISSER.<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 2: Bob becomes a little more animated.<br>
<br>
BOB:  YES, FREAKIN' LAURA.  TED AM MANY KISSING ASS.<br>
<br>
SNOW:  I FEEL FOR YOU, HAVING TO LIVE UNDER YOUR WITCHIN' SISTER'S SHADOW.<br>
<br>
BOB:  MUCH ROUGHNESS HAS BEEN.<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 3:  Snow is ignoring the pesky fly.  Bob is invigorated by Snow's apparent excitement.<br>
<br>
SNOW:  HOW LONG ARE YOU GOING TO PUT UP WITH TED'S CRAP?  YOU HAVE TO SHOW THEM. <br>
<br>
BOB:  FREAKIN' LAURA RIGHT.  TED ARE TOO BIG.  BOB-MOM WRONG.<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 4:  Mister Snow stands dramatically.  He points out the window toward the impossibly massive ship.  Bob stands excitedly, too<br>
<br>
<br>
SNOW:  YOU HAVE TO GET BACK ON YOUR SHIP, WORK UP A NEW MASTER PLAN, AND BECOME THE PLANETMASTER WE BOTH KNOW YOU ARE!<br>
<br>
BOB:  AFFIRMATIVE, DOCTOR FREAKIN' LAURA!  BOB ARE PLANET-MASTER.<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 5:  Bob storms out of the diner.<br>
<br>
BOB:  BOB SHOW BOB-MOM!<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 6:  Snow sits down quietly.  The fly continues its assault..  Through the diner window before Snow, Bob can be seen walking towards the horizon.<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 7 (inset):  Repeat of part of panel 6 with Bob in it, only Bob beams away. <br>
<br>
<br>
PAGE 7<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 1:  Snow appears to contemplate his cup of steaming coffee.  The giant spaceship is pulling away into the sky.<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 2:  The cup of coffee freezes in Elijah's hands.<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 3:  Snow looks out toward the retreating ship.  The fly freezes solid in mid flight as a field of &quot;distortion&quot; wraps around it.<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 4:  The same odd &quot;distortion&quot; heads out away from the diner, up toward the flying ship.  The flash frozen fly bounces off the table.<br>
<br>
<br>
PANEL 5:  The ship explodes.<br>
<br>
PANEL 6:  As debris showers down in the background, Elijah flicks the fly off the table.<br>
<br>
SNOW:  HOW 'BOUT ANOTHER CUP OF THIS HORRENDOUS GOO.  THIS ONE'S ALREADY COLD.<br>
<br>
<br>
