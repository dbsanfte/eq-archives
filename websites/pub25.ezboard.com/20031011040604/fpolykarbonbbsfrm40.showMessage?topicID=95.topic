<br>
Soft trickling of dripping water was the only sound that night.  The ice was melting in the quiet town of Brenom.  Three days had past since that stranger past through, and no one has been the same.  I know this because I sit near the cold window all day, watching people go about their boring business. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   I’m a bard of sorts,  keeper of tales, musician, a traveler perhaps.  Though my travels have ceased ever since I came upon Brenom.  There was something that kept me here.  Maybe the soft, friendly music mixed with strong ale, or maybe, the wholesome good hearted people always willing to help you out, or just talk.  I don’t know what it is about this town, but I love it.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As I was saying though, trickling of water from the melting ice sickles was all I could hear that night.  Save my heavy breathing and light footsteps on the damp cobblestone road.  I was headed to the pub, like every night.  On my way I heard a faint sound,  a sound that one might figure was the wind.  Yet this sound continued.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I followed the sound, growing nearer to the source.  It reminded me of a weak fire being  sprinkled with water.  Down a dark alley I turned, I continued through the mud and ice until the sound could be heard right above me.  I felt strange standing there,  my finger tips grew numb as I tried to figure out where the sound was coming.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I stared up into the stare lit sky, looking through my frosty breath at the full-moon.  I felt inclined to reach towards it, and I would off, but a patrolling guard had came down the alley and began questioning me.  After explaining myself as “headed for the pub” , he pointed me in the direction and I left.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Turning the dark corner and taking to the cobblestone road, I heard the same guard scream.  A blood-filled scream it was, and I dashed back to him, but he was not there.  Fearing something I had no grasp on,  I returned quickly to my room in the inn, and locked my door.  I was scared yes, for I of all people in this town should understand the ways of evil and magic.  Sound and death were being manipulated here, and I had no idea how.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The next morning, I awoke with my head on my desk.  Wiping my sleeve across the frosty window, I looked out into the street.  A single horse, clad in death-black armor, carrying a rider in full-plate mail and a black cloak, moved slowly down the road.  I watched as he passed, and I regret doing so.  For as he passed my window,  from under his dark hood, he caught my gaze with two eyes that made my very will to live nearly disappear.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I felt exhausted when I looked away.  And when I gathered the courage and strength to look again, he was gone.  I sat there the rest of the day and then next two, barely eating, barely sleeping.  All I did was watch the ice melt and thought about those cold eyes.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>

What do you guys think?  Should I keep writing? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=emmapeel1601>emmapeel1601</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.geocities.com/garaigh/emma2.txt" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(8/20/03 1:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm40.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=95.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/garaigh/buddy2.txt height=127 width=107></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Trying to form a begging of a story</span><hr size=1> kind of hard to say. you haven't told us what you plan to do with the story and it's kind of hard to tell what's really going on with just this little. i mean, obviously something evil killed someone in the town. other than that everything is vague. <br>
<br>
i think you need to work on the style a bit. it looks kind of like you're trying a sort of associative writing style (first person narration lends itself to that) but i don't really feel like i'm inside your narrator's head. <br>
<br>
why does he sit at the window all day? he says he's a bard (sort of) but why doesn't he spend his days in the tavern collecting and telling tales? and (in my opinion) he needs a better explanation of why he stays in the town. maybe he was just tired of traveling and the people seemed to be pleasent. or it reminded him of the town he was born in. <br>
<br>
the trick with first person narration is that the reader really needs to be inside the character telling the story. although you don't have to reveal every detail you can't skip over things nearly as much as you can with a story told in third person. <br>
<br>
basically, if you're interested in whatever story you're telling you should always keep going. writing anything is always great practice even if you end up later scrapping the idea or starting over. <br>
<br>
anyway, just my two cents. <br>
