<br>
As some of you may have noticed, I have had a levelling surge of late.  I am currently sitting at the 47th level.  Now I am at a point that I am uncertain of what I want to do.  I have been able to get a taste of the higher level game, seen some pretty amazing equipment drop, and even received some of it myself.  Honestly, like others have I'm sure, I know not how much longer I wish to devote to this game.  There are however things I wish to do in the game before I eventually leave.  Things such as planes raid, dragon raids and along those lines.  Having been on a raid to the giant city of Kael Drakkal, I have now gotten a taste of that as well.  A raid is a pretty interesting experience, a far cry from the normal hunting that goes on.  Several groups of players all uniting to take down monsters one group alone probably could not.<br>
<br>
So I am coming to a point, much like Oake was when he came out of retirement, in that I may seek to join a guild capable of doing those things.  I have a couple of friends in Coven Nex, and that is a likely option for me.  I haven't decided if I want to switch yet, but if I do I will always be a Councillor at heart.  You all are not the most powerful, but definitely the greatest I believe I can ever come in contact with in the game.  The friendships I've made in this guild have been unbelievable, and the change in guilds would be primarily in the tag, not at all in the heart.<br>
<br>
Of course my other characters would stay, but Lora has a unique opportunity to see things I've wanted to since I started playing this game a year ago as a half-elf ranger who finally found his way out of Kelethin (I truly feel sorry for any true newbies that start out there), then immediately got killed by an orc pawn while I was still in trying to figure out of the characters around me were PCs or NPCs.  No matter what happens, I will always be around to help you out, and of course have my many other characters who are always honored to fight by your capable sides.  Enchanters are very redundant in groups, and I am confident in Cirroc's abilities to the fullest.  I'll also be more familiar with places we might want to hunt (especially if it's Lower Guk), so that's always a plus.<br>
<br>
Well, I'm not sure what else to say, except that first and foremost you all are my EQ family.  The closeness we all share is something very special and I doubt that could be duplicated in any other guild.  Just remember, it's not good-bye, it's just a change in tag..../w all council will always be my guild hotkey, so expect frequent tells even if I do switch.  Take care all, and see you soon in Norrath.<br>

<br>
P.P.S. It's been recommended that I wait until at least 50th level to try to join Coven, so we'll see what happens.  And if I do try, my membership is not guaranteed by any stretch.  Would have to join them on a couple of raids to see how I play and if I fit in. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bthecounciloftwilight.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=loralana>Loralana</A> at: 4/21/01 6:10:47 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ugaladhriel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Galadhriel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 31<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/21/01 10:08:53 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My levelling of late</span><hr size=1> Dearest Loralana,<br>
Of course you need to be with a guild that you can go on planes and dragon raids with! I still remember when you tried to enter one of the planes in your youth and bounced off the entrance <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  .<br>
As I watched your amazing progress these past several days, I knew that you would soon have to seek out a larger guild to venture to those new and exciting places.  Hopefully, you will take a break occasionally and bring out your siblings to play with the rest of us and show us around.<br>
I will always remember our first times together hunting those beetles and griffawns in South Karana and then later GrimFeather, Griffenes, Griffons, and Hill Giants.  Kiting Cyclops and Hill Giants in Rathe Mountains with you were a blast, too!  Maybe some day your love of dungeons will rub off on me a little.  <br>
As always, teleports and SoW are just a /tell away for you anytime you need them...<br>

You know I wish you nothing but the best, safe journeys, healthy leveling, and phat loot no matter what guild you're in.  It makes sense to be in another guild for plane raids and such at higher levels.  And of course you know we love you dearly, and that when you change guilds, we won't feel any harsh feelings at all.  We understand completely, and urge you to never hold back.  Keep on leveling and soaring!  You're an inspriration to us all!!  I too remember the days of yore when I first met you.  Geez, a lifetime ago.  Yet we've all come a long way.  I still consider you the most awesome find the Council can come across.  <br>
<br>
Be safe and always true,<br>

<br>
Well, as it sits now, I'm in my 51st level and have been kind of &quot;trying out&quot; with Coven Nex.  I've now been on 2 raids in Kael Drakkel with them, and it's actually been quite fun!  This evening we even took a couple of shots at Derakor the Vindicator, a supposedly level 70 giant with about 250,000 hps.  Other problem is he has 2 guards that are tightly linked to him which aren't any joke to take down either.  But anyway, we failed, but wow! what an experience.  I'm gonna go with them tomorrow also while we take another crack at it, trying out different strategies was real fun, even though I died several times.  I got almost full rezzes each time and came out ahead a couple of blue bubbles in the experience bar.<br>
<br>
I guess I'm a recruit with them now, and will have to be guilded for any raids, so that'll mean a lot of me removing myself from the Council (wahhh!).  So far the feedback I've received has been great, and even though they're an &quot;uber-guild&quot; they have been very friendly and hospitable towards me.  This looks like it could be a great experience, and my only regret would be that I couldn't bring you all along.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I really wish we could've started doing a lot of these things together first, but I'll be sure to pass on anything I learn to my family here in the Council. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Anyways, before this gets to be another Lora novel, I'll say good night, and that I can't wait to be guilded with the Council again.  I'm guildless at the moment!  Ack!  hehe  Ta-ta for now.<br>

Wow, I've heard about that giant!  It can take hours to kill him?!  Wow!  I'm so intrigued!  Please don't stop telling us about your adventures.  Such knowledge will entice and excite us to level up more and more!  And of course when you need back in the guild, please let one us know.  You're always welcome with open arms. Despite the namecalling, you know we got nothing but love and concern for you.  But if you start dying a lot because of this new guild, then they're nothing but DOLTS, MAROONS, and FOOLS!!  <br>

I'm a little confused on when I'd officially be let in, but I don't think much longer.  I've gotten several compliments, and it seems as though everyone in CN likes me.  My app on their website has gotten positive comments from 7 of the members of CN (probably 1/5th of the people who normally raid), and I've had lots of tells hoping that I'll be able to stay and saying I'm doing a great job.  I'm getting more and more excited as the days pass and I feel more comfortable around them.<br>
<br>
Well, the other night was quite the new adventure.  I went to my first plane!  Unfortunately it had to be the Plane of Growth, Tunare's Plane.  Being a follower of Tunare myself, I was reluctant to go, but was really intrigued (wonders if Oake will read this and shake his head).  At first I was sticking back, just doing some buffing and everything and was getting along without faction hits...wonderful.  But as the night grew on, faction hits were unavoidable, and quickly went from amiable to KOS (about 4 or 5 hits).  But wow, what an experience!  It was great fun (in an evil kind of way), easily one of the best times I've had so far.  I even received an enchanter spell that dropped, Gift of Thought, level 55.  I was handed it by the leader of the guild, so I wasn't about to decline it, so that's a good sign.  I haven't asked for any loot since I'm not a full member, but he gave it to me since I was the only enchanter there at the time.  Same for the previous night in Kael, I got the quest component for the Beguiler's Leggings in Thurgadin.  But wow, it was an amazing experience going through PoG and I really don't mind losing the faction that much.  I do wish I could've gone through there while not KOS, but Kin is only 11 levels away from being able to go. heh  We took down some humungous treant (I'll have to get the screenshot developed, ie converted from BMP) that had something like 250000-300000 hps, according to logs that Hoss had taken previously.  It also would quad-hit for 700 a round (much like Derakor the Vindicator, but the treant was much less magic resistant, so it was able to be slowed).  My first really successful epic battle.  It took quite a few minutes to take down, but I got to happily nuke away every once in a while, and my nukes were barely resisted.  I probably did 3-4k of damage myself, but I wasn't keeping track.  It also dropped the best loot of the night, a cleric breastplate, 50ac 15wis, bunch of stamina and mana, several resists and a spell effect: Mark of Karn (adds a healing damage shield to the target, cast it on a mob, and every time someone hits it they get healed a certain amount).  I was happy that it went to my cleric friend Amberel.<br>
<br>
Anyways, this is getting long, hope you've enjoyed the tale of adventure. hehe  I wish you all could be there for these kinds of things, my thoughts are with you always.<br>
<br>
