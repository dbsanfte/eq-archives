I don't appreciate responding to someone who ignores me. I explained WHY there aren't many comics targetted to females. Notice I said many, whereas you say none, because there ARE some comics targetted towards females.<br>
<br>
In Japan, comics are accepted by a larger audience, and is not a dying industry as it is in this country. Here, we view comics as just for kids right? And there's also the view that they are intended only for boys. It may not be true, but companies play to their biggest market. If there was a larger audience for female comics, I guarantee you that they would make comics for females. But they are not going to risk making a comic that will most likely fail due to poor sales. <br>
<br>
Please keep your responses in the same thread you address an issue with instead of starting a new topic stating the exact same thing making it seem as though you ignored everyone kind enough to respond to you in the first place.</font><P><embed src="http://www.undeadart.com/temp/flashsig.swf"  width="180" height="60">

Well, you get the idea. I think there is the audience out there, but the half-arsed attempts the companies put out just is kinda sad. Look what they did to Card Captor Sakura and Escaflowne, on TV. Cut out all the stuff that might appeal to girls and then moan about girls not tuning in. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy. *shrugs*<br>

And I never said it was a good thing, but it's the truth. Go around, ask 1000 guys, and 1000 girls if they think they'd be interested in reading comics and who do you think is going to say yes more? We are not Japan. I know, that's hard to believe right. Unfortunately we think comics are kids stuff, and the majority think they're nothing more than superhero books. And superhero's have always been more appealing to boys. <br>
<br>
Look, I'm sorry that you don't like that, but shunning American comics just because we aren't Japan really isn't fair. Japan is a completely different environment. Since they don't have the stigma against comics that we have here, they have a larger audience, so they are able to target to girls. <br>
<br>
And STOP twisting what's being said. There ARE girls comics, have none of you listened to either me or DN say that? Okay, you've never heard of them. You know why? They don't sell well. Hey, there's your answer, the girls comics that do come out have poor sales, at least compared to more mainstream, which are considered boys titles.<br>
<br>
We do have an increasingly popularity of comics that are not superhero based, and could possibly appeal to females at least more so than before. True, they're not targetted to girls specifically, but they aren't about guys in tights running around beating each other up. You just have to look for them, but the majority of females will overlook them just because they don't consider comics a valid form of entertainment.<br>
<br>
Listen, I'd love it if comics weren't looked down upon so much in our society. It'd improve things for all of us. The market would be larger, they'd be more popular, so the industry wouldn't be dying right now. I like variety as much as the next person, so I'd have more titles to choose from. I don't always want to read a comic that's action oriented, I enjoy a good story as much as the next person. But despite this, you have to realize why they do it. <br>
<br>
I'm not defending them necessarily, but with all the comics failing, they're frightened to take risks. I'm sure if you look into the independent comic scene more, you'll find more that are suited to your tastes, as they're not run by corporations only concerned with money.</font><P><embed src="http://www.undeadart.com/temp/flashsig.swf"  width="180" height="60">

The comic shop I go to has a wide selection of manga, and many of it is indeed targetted to females. Maybe you should go to the owner or at least someone who works there and tell them about some titles that you're interested in. You'd be surprised, most comic shops will order things for you if you ask. If they get enough interest they might start ordering it regularly and get some more as well.<br>
<br>
I like how you conveniently neglect parts of the arguments to make yours stronger. First you say there's no girl comics, now you mention two that you don't like. You can't say that they don't have any, and it's obvious why they chose those two. They both have the anime airing on TV at the moment so obviously they'll be more popular. I understand that you're upset that more comics aren't made that you enjoy, but you're being very unrealistic. These people are out to make money, and they go where the money is. Sad, but true.<br>
<br>
&quot;If you asked 1000 girls if the read comics, they'd probably say no because they havn't been exposed to it because no one makes any comics targeted towards them.&quot;<br>
Well then, maybe it is a vicious cycle. Because since they know few females would buy them, then they won't make them. It's up to you to break the cycle if you want things to change.</font><P><embed src="http://www.undeadart.com/temp/flashsig.swf"  width="180" height="60">

Since I felt like you were ignoring my responses, I spent 5 whole grueling minutes on a search engine and found this.  All I typed in was &quot;Women in comics.&quot;  It is a website specifically devoted to promoting women who work in the comic industry.  It has plenty of links to websites that should get you started.<br>
<br>
If you're only trying to find Manga and no American comics, then you'll have better luck at Japanese bookstores even though some American comic shops are starting to offer them more and more.  Sometimes that's hard depending on the area you live in, but that's your best bet if you really don't want to order stuff online.<br>

I wasn't *disagreeing* so much as reiterating in a different way, something that *I've* found to be the case. I'm a huge comic book fan and even I get turned off by the rows upon rows of comics with covers consisting of scantily-clad women with huge knockers when I go into the comics store. The place is dark, it's populated by iffy-looking sorts (<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Knights of the Dinner Table</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->-types), and in general very uninviting. Goodness knows what it looks like to the &quot;average&quot; gal. There was an article on SequentialTart.com on the trend in England towards making some of these places look more like Borders (or Waterstone's) than your local techie's basement, but here in the US, those places (comic stores that don't look like dungeons) are few and far between. Then there's the comics. Most of the titles I've seen directed or appealing towards women are indies...and we all know how well *those* advertise. :P I only know about half the ones I do because I read certain newsgroups and semi-obscure magazines. When was the last time something like &quot;A Distant Soil&quot; or &quot;Strangers in Paradise&quot; got column space in <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Entertainment Weekly</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->? *grins* Heck, even Wizard, everyone's favorite toilet paper-substitute, has practically given up on anything that doesn't involve big hooters and that's the most prominent of the comic magazines out there on the racks. -_-;;; <br>
<br>
There was a time when my friends and I would have fun debates about whether X-Men or Batman was better (this was around 1990-1992)...now we all read DC and indie stuff and manga. *sighs*<br>

I like the idea of having comics that are targeted to either gender, where both can enjoy it. But we also have to recognize that some types of comics ARE going to appeal to one gender over the other in many cases. I'm no fan of the whole half naked chick makes a good comic philosophy, I don't read those comics. True, there may be women like that in there sometimes: Red Monika in Battle Chasers (which Mad has said is really a parody of comic women), and Angela in Spawn. They are NOT the main focus of the story however.

This whole concept of manga as some sacred art form not to be desecrated by the likes of inferior American artists is truly SICKENING to me. Yes, I bet you, the unknown artist get it, while someone like Joe Madureira has a devoted fan following. Yes, you are correct, someone who obviously has succeeded doesn't get it. When you have a comic that sells out every month, then you can tell me who gets it and who doesn't.<br>
<br>
Besides, who said that a mixture of the two styles is a BAD thing. Yes, America is evil, they suck, let's abandon everything good that has ever come out of it because Japan has all the answers. While you have quite an extreme view in this respect, I've felt this whole atmosphere on the entire board, and I've endured it quite long enough. Guess what guys: the US has good artists too, even the one's that aren't inspired in any way by anime or manga. A shocking and alien concept on this board for certain. Not that everyone is like that, but there are a lot.<br>
<br>
I have little to no respect for people that view the &quot;Japanese&quot; style as the only valid art form. It makes me very ill, and I don't see how you can truly call yourself an artist by doing so. If you prefer drawing in one style over another, that's one thing, but to INSULT other's because they are carbon copies of Japanese artists is truly close minded.<br>
<br>
I have lost almost all respect for you KeriiTenchi, and it's clear you never had respect for me to begin with.</font><P><embed src="http://www.undeadart.com/temp/flashsig.swf"  width="180" height="60">

Anyway, on a side note, my girlfriend really likes Nightwing.  It's the only comic she reads.  She even got a mail subscription for it.  From what I can tell, I think it has a fairly large female following.  I like the comic too, but the point is that it focuses some more on the non-crime fighting aspects of the character which seem to appeal to women.  For example, there's always some sexual tension between him and Barbara Gordon and stuff.<br>
<br>
I've kinda lost energy on this topic though.  Kerii, you don't seem very open minded about this.  You're pretty much saying that anything &quot;North American&quot; is bad.  Are you saying that &quot;North Americans&quot; are somehow genetically incapable of drawing manga.  I'm just a little confused by your statement.<br>
<br>
And, as Runey asked, what exactly do you define as Japanese style.  We've had this discussion before here, and there's so many variations, that claiming that there's a definite style is a waste of time.  <br>
<br>
I'm willing to bet I could find pictures from Japanese and American artists and you wouldn't be able to tell which they came from.  If it'll prove a point, I just may search around for them, but I don't think it's worth the time since you've already ignored me every other time I've said something.</font><P><P><i><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/udynamiteneon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>DynamiteNeon</A> at: 5/3/01 6:31:46 pm</FONT><br></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#CCCCCC><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=keriitenchi>KeriiTenchi</A></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Karbonite</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#336699>5/4/01</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#336699>6:54:16 am</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif">&nbsp;<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: The difference is....</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Uh...U_U; I guess i'm not the only one being ignored here either. I already told you that I draw my<br>
own manga because I can't find any. I'm talking about manga/comics like Battle Chasers, and SpyBoy<br>
and @#%$ like that.<br>
Oh yeah, someone suggested to me on a different topic that I should read Meridian because it's a <br>
&quot;girly&quot; comic. Well, I bought a Wizard magazine and it was when CrossGen comics was first selling<br>
their stuff. It came with this little pamphlet/magazine thingy in the back where it explained all the <br>
characters and the different worlds and the like. For one thing the main character (who is a female)<br>
is said to be a &quot;girl&quot;. Girl meaning under the age of 14 I suppose, but if you look at how she is <br>
depicted, she's got bigger boobs than me!!!! The term &quot;girl&quot; means a female that has not sexually<br>
matured yet, so those guys could get nailed pretty bad.<br>
Anyway, to whoever suggested it, I would much rather read Scion then Meridian. </font><P><P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#aaaaaa><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uotakulad.showPublicProfile?language=EN>OtakuLad</A></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Canadian</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#336699>5/4/01</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#336699>7:31:57 am</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Community Supporter</FONT><BR><BR><img src=http://www.7hat.com/PKSub/asuka.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif">&nbsp;<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: The difference is....</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Have you finished much of your manga yet, KeriiTenchi?

As far as the whole comic/manga thing goes... Whether you draw in what's perceived as a typical &quot;American&quot; or &quot;Japanese&quot; style, it's the story that counts. If you're interested in sex and violence, in all likelihood, you'll create stories about sex and violence (unless you're getting paid to create otherwise <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) Yes, Sex and Violence will sell, but what really sells is a great story supported by good art. For example, I consider Alan Moore's &quot;Watchmen&quot; to be one of my favorites, and yes, it had some violence. But it was such a cool story and fresh approach at the time. Much like Gaimen's &quot;Sandman&quot; series.<br>
I guess I'm just getting old and I expect more out of comics. I like it when they push the boundries of creativity a bit while weaving a fantastic story. I think one of the biggest problems for this sort of comics these days is the monthly serial publication of NA comics. It's going to hit the presses every month whether it's a good story or not. Eventually the well's going to run dry and inferior comics will be made. Sales will drop and companies will make silly decisions (let's clone Peter Parker!) to &quot;shock&quot; the readers into buying the title again.<br>
<br>
This is why I like mini-series. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
