Impatients began to grow on his face as Elil continued trying to stand.  After a few moments the orc advanced, moving slowly until he was looming over the elf.  &quot;How pathetic!  I must put you out of your misery!&quot;<br>
<br>
Elil searched for some strength, something do delay the orc.  The orc's huge weapon was rising above his head.  He let himself pass out.<br>
<br>
In that very same moment there was a warm feeling on his chest.  The feeling grew until it was an unbearable burning.  Elil woke up just as a huge beam of light burst from his neckless, slamming into Agaolite.  <br>

Elil assured himself that he now was dead, no living soul was to see this.<br>
<br>
The light that danced about the torching flames that was the charring flesh which once belonged to Agaolite was a fantastic savior to Elil.  What ever this light had been, when it struck this sad creature it made it's full wrath known.<br>
<br>
Falling to a defeated posture on his hands and knees, Agaolite gasped for breath.  He was not dead, but that elf might as well be.  This thought burned in the orc's mind.  He was not to be defeated, not like this, not now.<br>
<br>
Agaolite could not make out the elf any longer, perhaps his last eye had been scorched and withered, he could not tell nor cared.  Fury of rage was still in his veins, he'd nearly been bested...<br>
<br>
Standing he took his zambato again, unable to talk from the charring, he spat up blood and other bodily fluids in a distorted cry of pain and insanity.<br>

He rests breathing shallowly.  His hair hangs in front of his face and he is clearly in great distress.  Sweat pours down his brow and his pupils have narrowed down to pinpoints.  His eyes appear to be sunken in and his veins along his neck bulge.<br>
<br>
He quickly begins to gasp for air while his body fidgets.  He clasps his right wrist and almost appears to be trying to pull his arm off.  His body begins to spasm with his right arm, especially his hand, whipping about while his left arm struggles to keep them in control.  His right hand flares with light and quickly his glove is burned in a brilliant bright white light.  Presented to the world is a grotesque scare etched into his hand that burns bright.  With every fluctuation of the scare Sonto’s eyes flare up slightly.<br>
<br>
The runic carving in Sonto’s hand burns but with what is left of his rational mind at the moment he holds back cries of pain fearing to reveal his position.  With one final flash his eyes roll back and he falls to the ground.<br>
<br>
Sonto lies on the ground for a few minutes until finally he picks himself up.  As he stands his eyes roll back into position.  They appear to be glazed over and staring off into nothing.  Slowly Sonto walks into the cave after his prey . . .<br>

He would be more than a match for the blinded orc.<br>
<br>
Inhuman sounds spluttered from the mouth of the beast as it came.  Longsword met Zambato with an ear splitting crash.  The fighting continued until the ground was scorched black and nearbye trees were completely striped of their bark.<br>
<br>
These were no longer mere men, but titans.  The magic of Elil's pendant coursed through his body, and Agaolite was finally granted the power of his master.<br>
<br>
A swing of the zambato caused Elil to leap into the air.  As he came down his foot smashed Agaolite's cheek.  The two stood facing each other, both seeing more than eyes could ever give them.<br>
<br>
Longsword and zambato began to glow from the power of their champions.  Then they charged, Elil moving like the wind over the ground and Agaolite pounding as if he were one with it.  <br>
<br>
The zambato which saught Elil, instead found his longsword and was flung away.  With one powerful strike the full force of the pendant flowed through the sword, into Agaolite.  <br>
<br>
The fight was finally over.  The burning disappeared from his chest as he looked toward his destination.  He would have to find his horse, for it could no longer be tied up. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/unitetimehero.showPublicProfile?language=EN>nitetimehero</A> at: 1/12/02 8:05:14 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=psychosoldier>Psycho Soldier</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(1/12/02 9:17:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=412.topic&index=86>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Polykarbon Roleplaying, Chapter 2</span><hr size=1> As Agaolite lied in his wretched vessel of a growing corpse he could manage nothing, his heart had been pierced by fire.<br>

Well nothing isn't quite the right thing to say, he could manage a strained thought.  Though these final thoughts were scattered and not of much importance.<br>
<br>
Perhaps if he had swung his weapon one way, or chewed the pendant off...<br>
<br>
Bah, it didn't matter.  If Agaolite was lucky he'd be able to come back some day in some way and exact his revenge.<br>

Move, that is the wrong word to use.  It more of disappears behind one tree then reappears behind another. This shadow makes its way near to the corpse making sure not to arise Elil’s attention.<br>
<br>
Once the shadow is sure that he will not be found he reveals himself.  It’s an imp.  It’s short and skinny with long pointy ears.  Its mouth is nearly as wide as its face.  He has narrow deep red eyes with little slits for pupils.  His clothing is somewhat of a cross between a jester and a ranger.  His attire is dark with mixes of blacks and browns save, for the gold jewelry in his ears.<br>
<br>
“Look what those brutes did to my creation.”<br>
<br>
The imp skips to the corpse and uses his entire body to pick up just the hand of morbid body, which is nearly as large as he is.<br>
<br>
“So much work gone to waste.  That monster just had to ruin his other eye, I could have made use of it.  Bah!  Away with the old and in with the new.  The new model should prove much more useful.”<br>
<br>
The Imp looks about for a few seconds and then skips off towards the caves.<br>
<br>
“Knowing the other two they’ll end up the same way.”<br>
<br>
With a grunt the imp disappears into shadows and once again seems to disappear behind one tree and inexplicably appear behind another one.<br>

“You look good.”  Cryrid’s words are sarcastically spoken.  His voice is rough as his body begins to lack more vital tissues.  His body is now a mass of bones with varying amounts of flesh hanging off at key points such as the elbows and the base of the head.  Cryrid is no longer a handsome knight but a zombie or maybe some other dark entity from behind the grave.  It would truly be horrible to think of this creature as part of the living world.<br>

Sonto looks up slowly, he appears to be worn.  His constitute is frail as his right hand slowly rises.  Van Eyck and Cameron struggle to move though an unforeseen force binds their feet keeping them still.<br>
<br>
“You feel that?”  Van Eyck speaks softly trying to keep the words to his traveling companion only.<br>
<br>
“Aye, it’s not normal.  Fortunately the mage’s attention is not on us; we might just be an audience.”<br>
<br>
“You aren’t supposed to be here,” Sonto’s words are weakly spoken.<br>
<br>
“Validus couldn’t trust you.  You raise arms against me?  Your magic isn’t effective against the dead.  My body holds no allegiance to any element.  Validus will hear of you betrayal.”<br>
<br>
“Let go of the girl.”<br>
<br>
“She could be the one Validus is looking for.”<br>
<br>
Sonto walks up slowly to the two.  Open palm out he places his right hand within inches of Cryrid face.<br>
<br>
“I dare you.”<br>
<br>
With a flash the insignia on Sonto’s right hand flashes.  His hand curls into a fist and pushes forward into Cryrid face.  The punch is awkward with only Sonto’s arm moving and the rest of his body still.  Cryrid form is blown away leaving a shaken Caprice.<br>
<br>
“Leave.”<br>
<br>
Caprice stumbles over a large rock hidden in the dark and makes her way to her entranced warriors.<br>
<br>
Cryrid gets up appearing to have being hurt little, though his head does hang to the right slightly.<br>
<br>
“What’s the matter?”<br>
<br>
“I don’t kill women.”<br>
<br>
“But cities of elves?”<br>
<br>
The insignia on Sonto’s hand flares bright lighting the cave’s walls- <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uinfestedmatrix.showPublicProfile?language=EN>infestedmatrix</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(1/25/02 11:00:46 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=412.topic&index=94>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Polykarbon Roleplaying, Chapter 2</span><hr size=1> Timohty was inturrupted by a loud soud only heared through his ears.  Moments passed and he looked up at Elil.  &quot;Cryrid, he has betrayed us.&quot; he spoke. <br>
 Just then Timothy began to glow white.  A flash of light came upon his body.  His armor began to change into thick shiny crome iron.  It appeared all down his body, coming from no where.  In a flash, his sword was replaced by a large object with a long barrel.  His helmet turned chrome pulled over his forhead.  And with another flash of light, large wings appeared out of his back.  Elil stood in amazement of the sight.<br>
&quot;What just happend?&quot;  Elil asked. <br>
&quot;We have no time.  I am an Angel, sent to defend this team of warriors, at all time.  I was not informed about Cryrid.&quot;  Timothy stepped back, Holding the large gun in his hand.  He held down the trigger for a brief three seconds, tearing the cave wall apart.  Cryrid's evil apperance stunned Timothy as he looked at Sonto, and the traitor.<br>
Sonto turned around, to see Timothy's new form.  Cryrid followed, and with a glace of the glowing white body, was stunned with amazement.  Elil stood behind Timothy, still in shock of what happend.  Timothy raised his head, so his blue eyes glared at the two evil beast.<br>
&quot;Hello Boys.&quot; <p>

She blankly stared at the ceiling for some time trying to gather her thoughts. It was plain that she had started at one point then arrived at the other without knowledge of where she had been or what had happened. She tried to remember these events in vain. She gave up, and turned her attention back to the other people. <br>
<br>
She gave a small snort of discust when she saw Cryrid current appearence. &quot;I always knew you were no good! Attacking a defense-less little girl like myself!Not surprised you all evil..&quot;She turned her head slightly, the light given off by Timothy reflected slightly in her wide eyes. She stared for a moment in shock, unsure of what she saw before her. She shook her head and stood up, a bit unsteady on her feet.<br>
<br>
Caprice's eyes fell upon Sonto, a steady light rising from his hand. <br>
&quot;So, its been you,&quot;she whispered. &quot;were you the cause of this all? Why did Validus send you?&quot;<br>

<br>
At the same moment a scream came from Cryrid's lips.  &quot;I trusted you!&quot;  yelled night, his blade buried in Cryrid's back. &quot;I would have given my sword to your cause!&quot;  The blade came back out with a horrible sound.  <br>
<br>
Cryrid turned to face night, only to have Van's staff buried in the back of his head.  <br>
<br>
For a split second Sonto's gazed moved from Caprice to Cryrid.  At that moment Anlore jumped forward and scooped up Caprice, while doing a backflip.  He landed behind Timothy as a blinding flash of light came from Timothy's weapon flying into Sonto.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ugrandxduke.showPublicProfile?language=EN>GrandxDuke</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_greenspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(1/25/02 9:34:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=412.topic&index=97>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Polykarbon Roleplaying, Chapter 2</span><hr size=1> The energy is hot; hot enough to singe the air, though it touches Sonto little.  The force blows him back but the basics of the attack are the same by the rules he knows.  The energy is converted and then easily dissipated into the rock structure behind him, which promptly begins to crack and crumble under the force being diverted into it.<br>
<br>
Finally the light stops and Sonto is released from its oppressive hold.  He staggers and falls onto his knees.  Timothy looks on perplexed.  The attack was a sure shot at least to those evilly aligned.<br>
<br>
The situation having excited him Sonto’s insignia glows bright and with a flash the glow fills his eyes.  With the insignia pulsating his eyes flare and the room is filled with a harsh force that oppresses ones movement.<br>
<br>
With a swing of Sonto’s right hand the weapon in Timothy’s hands is removed and glides neatly in front of him.  His right hand reaches out for it though is rejected.  Timothy takes a step back, that wasn’t supposed to happen.<br>
<br>
“You enter our world you are bound by its rules,” speaks Sonto in a soft voice as the weapon falls to the ground with a thud and looses its glow.  He then raises his right hand open palmed out . . <br>

The force of him is strong but not uncontrolable.  Anolore ran to Nights aid.  Timothy reached under his breast shield and pulled out a vail of blue liquid.  Give him this, Timothy said calmly, throwing the liquid into Anlore's hands.  Timothy glared back at Sonto and Cryrid.  He raised his hand slowly facing Cryrid.  An invisible force scattered out of his hand.  Cryrid flew back hitting his head against the sharp rock.  There was a loud scream from Cryrid.  Timothy bowed his head for a moment with strain.  Seconds later, the large wings began pulling back into his back.  He looked at sonto, with his palms up.  <br>
Night began to heal and anlore had risen ready to attack.  <br>
&quot;Wait,&quot; Timothy said.&quot;Stay back. I will take care of this demon myself.&quot;  Sonto began to chuckle.  <br>
&quot;You are no match for my force, my magic is too strong for you!&quot; Sonto yelled.<br>
&quot;Magic, are you so weak that you must use magic?&quot; Timothy asked.&quot;No weapons, no magic, no force. Let your death be brought to you by my hands.&quot;<br>
&quot;Fine.&quot;Sonto agreed.&quot;No magic.&quot;<br>
&quot;Then...lets do it.&quot; <p>
