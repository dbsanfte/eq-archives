I'm out of high school for good (Had problems, left first day of sophmore year with a 2.0GPA from freshmen year) - to get my GED... Going to college this spring though, but I'd prefer it be in Japan... And I'd LIKE to live there for uh, the rest of my life <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
<br>
I also live in Kansas, so our colleges are pretty small (I'm going to <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.ksu.edu" target="top">KSU</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->), so I doubt they have Sister colleges in Japan.<br>
<br>
Edit: Probably doesn't matter: But I'm going to major in Electronic Engineering, and maybe have a minor in Quantim Physics<br>
<br>
Edit2: Is it possible for me to even get to Japan for free? If not... How much would it cost to get a VISA, a plane ticket there (And a plane ticket back eventually... maybe) - find an appartment (And pay for one, for 3-4 months)? I'd like to live in Tokyo, but I heard appartments are not only expensive - but hard to find... <br>
Also: How hard are non-english teaching jobs to find? <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=deposeni>Deposeni</A> at: 9/7/03 6:05 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kamakurakko>kamakurakko</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/7/03 7:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1220.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Learning and going</span><hr size=1> how about this one?<br>

<br>
Secondly, a smattering of random thoughts on the subject, sorry they won`t be in any sort of cohesive order.<br>
<br>
1. I am afraid to tell you that it is practically impossible to get a work visa without a college degree.  (save for some exceedingly rare and specialized cases).  Period.  So if you want to work in Japan, you`re either gonna have to do it under the table (probably not best if you`re planning on living there for any super extended amount of time) or else get a college degree.<br>
<br>
2. GED is not gonna help you out when it comes to applying to Japanese colleges directly.  Every one I`ve ever heard of (and every one that offers electrical engineering/Quantum physics) requires a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>high school degree </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and nearly always require a GPA higher than 2.0.<br>
<br>
3. Which leaves the following option open - going to uni in the US, then transferring.  Definitely do-able.  Even if you`re going to KSU, you can still apply to a wide host of other university exchange programs.  One thing - I don`t want to be mean, but you`ll definitely need higher than a 2.0 in college if you want to go on any exchange programs.  Usually you need at least a 3.0 and more often than not, a 3.5 (for good schools).  So make sure to keep you grades up.<br>
<br>
4. On a random note, I am assuming you speak fluent Japanese?  Because otherwise, it will be .... errrmm... rough.  I have a certificate in &quot;technical japanese&quot; (the translation of engineering and physics related texts) and I can tell you from personal experience that unless you have an excellent grasp of japanese, it will be nearly impossible for you to take engineering classes in japanese (or any college courses, for that matter) - which is a critical point, since no university in Japan offers degree instruction in the engineering field in english.  You will need to know Japanese as it will all be in Japanese - I would advise that you should be able to pass at least level 2 on the proficiency exam - and preferably level 1.  I had a teacher for my tech. japanese classes who was kind enough to provide glossaries for some of the more difficult words, and even then I spent hours banging my head against the wall!<br>
<br>
5. On the other hand, assuming you speak Japanese (not neccessarily fluently), are truely interested in Japan, are majoring in electrical engineer/quantum physics AND maintain good grades in college..... then I have the answer to all your dreams.<br>
<br>
The United States government maintains a program known as &quot;The National Security Education Program&quot; (NSEP) which provides practically full ride scholarships for students <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>majoring in fields of interest to national security</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> - one of which is most definitely engineering/quantum physics.  The purpose of this scholarship is to send such students abroad to specific countries of interest (of which Japan is one) in order to broaden their horizons/background etc. and to provide a base of highly-educated individuals with experience in foreign countries which can be drawn upon by the US government for any future needs.  If you can get one of these scholarships (and if you meet the above criteria, you are very very likely to) then it is an excellent opportunity which I suggest you take - there is a price, of course - after graduation you owe the US government 1 year of service (which is not at all a bad thing - you may very well find yourself working in Japan, and of course, you`ll be doing something related to your major).  I wanted to apply to this program, but decided to go ahead and graduate instead (hey, I was getting old)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.iie.org/Template.cfm?&amp;Template=/programs/nsep/default.htm" target="top">the direct link</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
<br>
Anyway, as for the rest of your questions.<br>
<br>
a. Free plane ticket to Japan - yes, maybe if you get lucky, go on a  particularly lucrative exchange program, win the Japanese embassy`s speech contest (held once a year, the top prize per district is a free round trip ticket to Japan, inquire at your local consulate), participate in the JET program (more about this later - but you`ll need a college degree to apply).  But a free cross-pacific ticket is exceedingly rare, so don`t hold your breath waiting.  On the plus side, round trip tickets to japan can be had for under 800 US now-a-days, so it`s definitely do-able.<br>
<br>
b. VISA cost - visa`s are not &quot;bought&quot; persay (unless you are entering under the &quot;self-supporting&quot; visa-status, which is a non-issue as you need to be filthy rich to do so) - they are issued at the cruel whim of Japanese immigrations.  Details of the various japanese visas are available on line (too lazy to look up the links now) but the long and short of it - most americans get an automatic 90 day tourist visa upon disembarking in japan - it for all intents and purposes non-renewable (though it can be illegally extended by a quick jaunt to HK/s.korea - but immigrations tends to catch on after you do it more than once) - and you can`t work with it.  Student visas are available if you can find a school which will sponsor you.  I don`t think you can work persay - but you can have small jobs on campus if i`m not mistaken.  Everything else, you essentially need a university degree for.<br>
<br>
c. apartments are mad expensive, especially in tokyo.  But it`s the deposit/key money/realtor`s charge/deposit that will kill you.  In tokyo?  I`d estimate you`ll have to drop close to $3500-$5000 right of the bat, of which you`ll probably see maybe $500 back.   yeah, 500.  When I lived in Tokyo, I lived in a sh-t hole of a gaijin-house, (well, not thaaaat bad, really) but my rent was $800 US or so, for a tiny windowless room with no telephone, no lock on the door, no closet (no nothing!) sharing facilities with 10 other people.  Oh yeah, plus utilities.  Now, I lived fairly close to downtown, so that had something to do with it, but still....  You can probably make do in a so-called &quot;gaijin house&quot; for around $500-600 US per month on the outskirts of tokyo, but the commuting costs will kill you, though at least you don`t have to drop the key money/realtor charge, etc.  if you`re really interested, i wrote a post about living in Japan a few pages back (sorry, you`ll have to search for it yourself!  running out of time here!)  Anyway, if you only want to do it for 3-4 months as you said, I`d say go with the gaijin house option, and plan on at least $2000 for the 4 months.<br>
<br>
d. What kind of non-english teaching jobs specifically are you referring to? Anyway, unless you have a highly specialized skill (i.e scientist/web designer, etc.), can speak japanese fluently and have the above mentioned college degree/work visa, there really aren`t any non-english-teaching jobs out there.  Yeah.  that about sums it up.  Economy is really crappy right now too, which doesn`t help...<br>
<br>
Anyway, another thing to add is that the JET program will get you over to Japan, set you up with a (generally english-teaching related, though there are others available for those fluent in Japanese) job (usually working at an actual school - like a high school, as opposed to a language school), relatively high salary, a three year visa <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>and</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> generally take good care of you.  The catch is that it is somewhat competitive (not too bad) and of course, requires a university degree.  You can find details of it online. <br>
<br>
Finally, I hope this post was somewhat helpful to you.  I hope I didn`t sound too pessimistic - I just want people to know what they`re in for when they come to Japan - you sort of have to be prepared or else you can end up quite disapointed and disillusioned.  Sorry for the ton of spelling errors - I`m sleepy!!  Furthermore, I only addressed your question of working/studying in Japan - if you want to go to Japan on exchange, then the other programs will provide a good means for you to do that and don`t require a uni degree, etc.<br>
<br>
Anyway, hope that helps!<br>
<br>
Ganbatte!!<br>

<br>
Kansas colleges actually DO have alot of sister-colleges in Japan.  A surprisingly high percent of my Japanese friends have studied English in -guess where- Kansas.  I'm guessing that these exchanges can work both ways.<br>
<br>
You're an engineering/physics student, but you want to go to Japan... errr, if you go as an exchange student from your college, preference is naturally going to be given to language/teaching majors.  <br>
<br>
You've expressed a desire to live in Japan as long as possible...possibly forever.  I'd think that the USA would therefore not particularly want to send you to Japan for security-issues-related stuff... basically, they'd be giving you and your skills to Japan, and not expecting you to &quot;bear fruit&quot; in the US.  If you planned to come back and live and work in the US, I'd think your chances would be better.  Also, consider that taking $ from Feds interested in security issues is not good for peace &amp; peace-of-mind.  It could be a slippery slope into being part of Bush's war-&amp;-paranoia machine.<br>
<br>
MaiMai gives the straight poop on living in Tokyo, the biggest/most expensive city where ALL LIFE BEGINS AND ENDS (just kidding) in Japan. Yes, the apartment prices there would scare the living cr#p outta you.  You'd also be pretty lost, unless your Japanese is really hot, or you score a host family or girlfriend who speak English.<br>
<br>
I'd like to ADD, though, that this is just the picture in TOKYO and its suburbs and the other really big cities.  If you go to slightly smaller cities, or are willing to settle for the countryside, prices go way, way down.  Compare MaiMai's experience with mine:  I live 30 minutes from a city of 1 million people, and I pay a mere $500 a month for a huge, clean 4-room apartment.<br>
<br>
Your grades aren't gonna get anyone excited, I'm afraid.<br>
And, prices here are prohibitively high, if you're not gonna be working...and you don't have a college degree yet.<br>
<br>
If I were in your shoes, I'd therefore try to find an informal homestay situation, by taking out an ad in The Japan Times (costs $) or at GetHiroshima.com .  Assuming that you're a native English speaker and don't have wild habits (noisy, grungy, drunkenness, drug-dealing, sex-maniac, or  motorcycle-gang stuff), you might score by finding someone in Japan who'd be DELIGHTED to have you stay with their family for (for example) your summer vacation.  Think about it from their perspective:  They'd have a live-in English speaker... free English conversation practice !  What a deal.  That's how *I* first came to Japan.<br>
<br>
If you're particularly interested in peace-related issues, you can check out the peace-and-international-relations groups around Hiroshima, who have lots of homestays going on.  Those are generally for highschool kids, though, so do this while you're still relatively young.<br>
<br>
Oh...those peace-groups might also be willing to post an index-card-sized bulletin board message for you, at international centers in Japan. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=higakun>higakun</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://komplx.com/higan/Page_2/IMAG000.JPG" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/14/03 8:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1220.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://images.warcry.com/image.php?id=4964 WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: As usual, MaiMai speaks the Truth &amp; I clean up after</span><hr size=1> i am going to japan too. but i suggest taking it slow. from what i heard, dont go without money. i will not even get the ticket until i save up 7-10k dollars. i want time to soak up the language and not worry about the rent. i may stay on campus at the university of chiba or apply for a gaijin house. pretty low rent if you are willing to share a room with 4-6 others. a japanese style room mind you. i dont mind. i slept in a closet 4 ft by 10 ft for two years. but thats just me.  i know its expensive to go there if you plan on getting stuff you like. but for me i like sushi, rice, musabi, udon, and the occasional pork bun. then again thats just me. So once again. from someone that has heard of what needs to be done. take it slow. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sethness>SethNess</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.fureai-ch.ne.jp/~seth/clearhappy.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/15/03 4:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1220.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Bring Lotsa Money</span><hr size=1> Higakun's planning a long stay, with study at a University, I take it.<br>
Yes, it's a good idea, then, to bring major money.  7 to 10k is a reasonable sum, especially if you're not planning to work right away.  The majority of that money will go for initial apartment costs, and possibly an initial phone connection (which can cost up to $700 for the initial installation).<br>
<br>
THe fellow who started the thread might be satisfied with a considerably shorter homestay, I thought, so I suggested an informal homestay.<br>
Since he's without a degree, and without deep pockets, and his college career doesn't seem like a path that leads to Japan, I'm grasping at alternatives that Hikagun needn't consider. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm5.showPrevMessage?topicID=1220.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm5.showNextMessage?topicID=1220.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1220.topic&index=9><img src=http://www.polykarbon.com/bbsimage/addreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm5.emailToFriend?topicID=1220.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm5.threadControl?topicID=1220.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm5.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1220.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm5.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1220.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub25.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="polykarbonbbsfrm18">PK-BBS Rules and Regulations!<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm27">Board F.A.Q.s<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm3">News and Updates<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm2">Photoshop and Art questions<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm4">General Manga/Anime Discussion<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm5">Japanese Language Help<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm23">art in progress<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm13">Black and White Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm14">Color Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm19">Member's Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm17">Moderators Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm6">Member Photos<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm31">Help, Hints and Cheats<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm20">Challenges<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm21">Matches<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm26">Writer's Forum<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm32">VG Discussion<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm35">Member Created Tutorials<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm39">What is Fight Club?<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm40">Story Ideas</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#336699>- </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs>Polykarbon BBS</a><font color=#336699> - </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm5>Japanese Language Help</a> <font color=#336699> - </font><a href="http://www.polykarbon.com">Polykarbon: Manga & Photoshop</a><font color=#336699> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.246g<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
