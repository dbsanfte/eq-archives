<br>
The years past and nothing really happened the earth population has only a number of about 5 million real size unknown and there are small cities all around the world none of them number over 50,000 the human learnt not to stay in a big number because then the scerficals would come back again and kill them off......<br>
<br>
The night sky had come up just as if it was a blanket covering the world and the rain started to fall as if the gods in the heavens had been crying for the human race a lone human sits in the corner of a crumbled building covered in vines and moss , will anything  happen to him and his sister for they had left there past behind to walk the earth as if wondering to find a home...... &quot;Tokyuma&quot; a voice came from a far wall in front of the boy.  As he raises his head he sees his sister runing in the rain towards him &quot;whewww hey look what i found&quot; she spoke out of breath. she held out her hand it had some potatoes she had found growing just a 1/2 mile away. ^^ &quot; we eat tonight &quot; she said in a happy voice . &quot;huh ??, something wrong tokyuma &quot; she said as she sat down .  &quot;Heh ^^ nah not at all ill go get some fire wood you get the stuff ready ok asuna &quot; tokyuma said as he waked over to the dry area of land to look for somethign to burn, as asuna was preparing the potatoes the best she could.  AH HA here some stuff we could use to make a fire; tokyuma said to himself as he picked up some old magizines and books, then walked off back to his sister. Hey asuna... where did she go, tokyuma looked around to see if he could see his  sister, tokyuma thre the books and magizines to the ground as he ploped down , I'll just wait here for her to come back. after 5 minutes tokyuma picked up the old books he brought for the fire... &quot;advanced mathimatics?? whats that&quot;.   HELP TOKYUMA he heard his sister call from a distance as he sprung to his feet and ran towards the cry throwing the books to the ground.  As he rounded the corner from where he heard his sister yelled tokyuma triped over a piece of a copper pipe on the ground &quot;Ahhhh @#%$&quot; tokyuma yelled as he was flung to the ground like a rag doll, as he wipped the dirt from his face he heard a noise behind him.  Jumping to his feet he turned around and was tackled to the ground.  Boo!!, asuna yelled in his ear.  Damn it asuna, what the hell where you doin!!, tokyuma screamed in a angry tone. asunas eyes started it get teary.  I..

Tokyuma got up outta his covers and headed to a puddle of water, &quot;ahhh that feels good &quot; tokyuma said as he splash the water on his face.  tokyuma started walking back to the camp that they had set up and picked up the books he had brought for fire wood , he opened it up and started to read the first few pages &quot; tokyuma??&quot; tokyuma jumped up and turned around &quot;whoa sorry you scared me there asuna&quot; tokyuma said as he sat down.  &quot;ummm im sorry about yesterday tokyuma i was just having fun&quot; asuna apologized. &quot; heh nevermind that lets eat and pack up, gotta get moving' tokyuma said as he put the books in his pack and threw the magazines in a pile for the fire, tokyuma took a lighter outta his pack &quot; we got make sure we save this it running low and we dont no when the next town is &quot; he said as he lit up a corner of the magizine.  Asuna grabbed the pot threw in some herbs and the potatoes they had found the other day , and held it above the small fire tokyuma had made and stirred it around with a stick and let it simmer for 5 minute &quot; Its ready &quot; asuna said as she took the <br>
