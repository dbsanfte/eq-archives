It just seems like a realy uncomfortable position to be in (But then again, I'm a guy and I would never sit like that in the first place.)<br>
<br>
If you really LIKE the way she is.  You'll have to beef up her calf.  Another thing you could do is have her use her left hand to grab her left ankle making it appear that she is holding in that position.<br>
<br>
That's all I got right now.<br>

<br>
Basic proportions are all in place, but the way you've drawn some of the body parts is wrong.<br>
<br>
Her left arm is the first problem.  Take a look at the upper half of the arm.  You'll notice that the line that connects with the shoulder curves outward away from the body, as it should.  The second line that connects with the armpit is the problem, see how it curves outwards as well?  It should curve in towards the body, not away from it.  Take a look at the right arm you drew there to see what I mean.  The right arm is a perfect example of how to draw the arm correctly.<br>
<br>
Something seems a little off about her right leg, but I can't point it out.  <br>
<br>
I'll help you out on the foreshortening of the lower left leg.  Take a look a it very closely.  If you study it you'll notice that it is too pointy and thin.  The lines should curve more toward her body and not be so &quot;high&quot; up as they currently are.<br>
<br>
Her left thigh is WAY WAY to thick.  Even though this is not a type of anime style and is more western influenced, her thigh is just too large.<br>
<br>
You have a MAJOR flaw in the left thigh.  Take a look at how it connects to her hip.  Her leg connects straight on with the hip.  This is not humanly possible, and even in anime and other style types, it still is not possible.  The only way for her left leg to be that way is if she had a fractured femur (the upper leg bone), and I doubt you want her to have a broken leg and be smiling at the same time.  <br>
<br>
Try to change the way her left leg connects with the hip, and correct it's angle so that it is natural.  <br>
<br>
You should not completely change the way the drawing is just to get around the problem.  Like when kempokatt said &quot;Yeah, the foreshortening seems a bit odd on her left leg....My thoughts would be to take that leg and bring it around the front and put it under her other leg...&quot;.  I would completely advise againt this.  This would lead to running away and pushing the problem aside.  You must confront the problem you are currently having and work it out as you will come across stances of this sort again and you will want to have had this problem solved.<br>
<br>
I think I was a little more than thorough, sorry.  Just trying to teach you some stuff so you can overcome your problem.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

But the hair.......oh no.....not the hair.....</span><hr size=1> The arm looks better, but you may want to soften the curve of the line furthest away from the body on the upper arm so that it doesn't bulge out so much.  The correction you made to the other part is perfect.<br>
<br>
Her left leg is a MAJOR step forward, but there are still some problems.  You still have that joint problem with the left thigh and hip.<br>
<br>
To clarify what I mean is this:<br>
<br>
Her left hip and joint are connecting at a direct 90 degree angle, and this is not possible without doing the splits or a special stance.  Also, the hip joint does not allow the left thigh to turn upwards that far and twist in the manner it is twisting.  Her left thigh cannot be turned torwards the viewer as it is.  The hip joint just does not allow movement of the thigh that far.  You must redraw the entire left leg into a completely different position.  I'd suggest crossing the left leg under the right one while leaving the right leg just as it is now.<br>
<br>
Other than that your drawing is perfect, proportion-wise.<br>
<br>
Dump the new hairstyle, trust me, it just does NOT fit into your style at all.  It destroys the drawing and pulls too much attention away from the face and body.  <br>
<br>
The way you had the hair before, as just a short cut close to the head, was very cute and gave the girl a care-free, free-spirited attitude.  It also made the image more relaxed and gave it a &quot;wild&quot; (I mean &quot;wild&quot; in a good way! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) feel.  Leave the hair exactly as it was, trust me.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
As for that pattern you added to her shirt collar, dump that too.  It &quot;organizes&quot; the picture too much.  What I'm trying to say is that that design disrupts the flow of emotion that the image conveys.  Also, it draws too much attention away from the other areas of the body.  You'd be better to leave that collar a solid, pattern-less color.<br>
<br>
This character, to me anyways, gives off an aura of being care-free and free spirited.  She looks like she loves life and lives to have fun.  She seems to be the type of character who is fearless, loves adventure, and who can't resist a chance of danger.  She is someone that lives on the edge and for the moment, not for the future.  She'd sooner make a split second decision on how she feels at the moment instead of taking a long while to think things over.  She is spontaneous!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Yep, I can pick all of that up from just this image, or at least that is what this image &quot;says&quot; to me.<br>
<br>
If that is the &quot;feel&quot; that you were trying to give this drawing, then the last thing you want to do is add ANYTHING (in the way of clothing, jewelry, etc.) at all.<br>
<br>
I know the urge to &quot;tinker&quot; and add all sorts of stuff to an image after it is mostly completed is OVERWHELMING, but you must resist it, or you end up &quot;confusing&quot; the main idea of your image.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
It's your choice what to do with your drawing, just think very carefully when you change anything at all.  You should remember, what the image means to YOU is not important, it is what the image makes OTHERS feel that you should put first.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I hope I didn't sound to bossy, and there I go doing a REALLY long and thorough post again, but as long as any of this helps then it was worth the time spent typing it up.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    Good luck and good drawing!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
