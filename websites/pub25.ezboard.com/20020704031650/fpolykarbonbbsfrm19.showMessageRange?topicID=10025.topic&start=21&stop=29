<br>
 And yes, what is going on now, this is everyones problem. It was good for us to get into the world wars because that is what they were WORLD wars, they threatened us. But there is no excuse for many of the other things iraq, cuba, israel. But if everything is everynations problem now why is the US the first and usually only one to go &quot;smack someones hand&quot; for it. I am not talkiign about you guys but there are way too many people out there who think that because we are america we are always doing the right thing. Not to support it but what was wrong with communism. The USSR was doing the same thign we and Great Britain and all the other countries were doing. THey were building an empire. But their empire was wrong. Why, because they weren't democratic? There wer other nations that were having their own civil wars just like us but it harmed our interests so we jumped in and said no you can't. WE put the Taliban in control of Afganistan. I guess I can;t really blame the US fully many other countries are as corrupt as we are but all of the blame is now being placed elsewhere. People are forggettign that the past has caused all of this and we are doing it all again.  <p>In the world of TRUE and FALSE testing...it took the invention of the moron to spawn the "UNDECIDED" answer.

remember a few years back when people wanted Texas to be it's own country? i think that happened to Quabec (sp) too. so much for that...<br>
<br>
<br>
for all the ties that we may or may not have with Sudam. remember this: we f*cked him over once and he is an extreamly vengful man. he <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> will</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> get us back. so we'll have to fight him sooner or later.<br>
<br>
on the show i was originaly takling about. it told how his Son-and-laws left the country and told the US were all his chemical weapons stuff was. so we went over there and shut them down. well, soon after that Sudam said that he &quot;forgave them, and that they could return and be safe&quot;. as soon as they got back into Iraq his people took his daughters and others made son-in-laws &quot;disapeared&quot;.<br>
<br>
... he will get us back. unless we stop him. <p><center><b><font size=5>

In this day in age, at any sign of conflict, we feel that, as a world power, we have to act to prevent any type of global conflict.<br>
<br>
On everything else you said, I sorta agree. It's a matter of opinion, really.  I see what's wrong with communism, but I don't really know why we did something about it... I guess the only reason was to prevent the spread of communism into other nations, especially our eastern European allies, who were economically weak and vulnerable to communism at the time. And about us being the first to butt-in, I dunno, but we're a world power, and it's our responsibility.<br>
<br>
We somewhat created Israel, and again, it's pretty much our responsibility, as well as a vital checkpoint in the middle east. We need it, so we help it.<br>
<br>
Cuba... I haven't been keeping up on. I remember hearing something about it recently, but I don't remember, so I won't make any statements.<br>
<br>
I already explained what we were doing in Iraq. I'm not going to repeat myself. <p><hr color=#000000> <i>"Everyone has a different opinion on what is good music. It's just unfortunate that the only person who's opinion is totally correct is me."</i><br>-X 51 K, <i>K.T.F.O.T.</i></i></br>

In the 80's, Iraq was at war with Iran.  Iran was a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> huge</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> enemy of ours, and since Iraq was also somewhat of a belligerent, but less of an enemy, we thought to ourselves &quot;the enemy of my enemy is my friend.&quot; Therefore, we beefed up (and I mean really beefed up) their military, making it one of the most powerful in the world.  Although we did inflict heavy losses on them during the Gulf War, they maintained most the technology and training that we gave them. <p><hr color=#000000> <i>"Everyone has a different opinion on what is good music.

We have given our technology to a lot of people. In my opinion that was stupid. If you have something that will help you you shouldn't tell them. Just like when we atacked Afganistan.. we broadcasted it ALL on national television and wondered why we couldn;t find Bin Laden...WE TOLD HIM WE WERE COMING. We do some stupid @#%$ but we are trying to take the role of a friend. Anyone watch Gundam Wing.

With U.S. and world aid, in a few decades Japan emerged as a economic power. I look what's parked on my driveway, my Honda Civic-made in Japan, the laptop which I'm typing right now-made in Japan, hell everything electronical is made in Japan now. Anyways, I'm not saying Afgansistans going to end up like that but, it sure as hell is better now then it was a few years ago. True, we helped put the Taliban in power when the USSR tried to invade them, and didn't regulate them after we pulled out, but that was a mistake made in the past. A mistake which possibly could have contributed to 6000 people be killed. All we can do now is try to make that wrong into a right, in the present.<br>

well that's my 2 cents.<br>
