I'd like to find a good artist to draw this up for me, I think it would make a killer comic and frankly I'd just like to see my story come alive. I really think this has what it take to be great... But I guess that will be left up to you after you read it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  There is a prologue before this that I'm not adding so some of it might not make since, if you want I'll add the prologue later. Sorry for the length.<br>
<br>
<br>
*Chapter 1: The Beginning*<br>
The bus finaly pulled up to the tree engulfed drive way of Tommy, Kelly, Logan and Amanda's house and all four got off the bus in order from youngest to oldest, because of the way they sat and because Tommy followed the deep rooted rule, &quot;Ladies first.&quot;, excluding Logan of course. They stepped from the bus, crossed the street and started down the long, shaded dusty driveway. They all stopped walking when Kelly blurted out.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&quot;Guy's can we not mention this whole episode to mom?&quot; She pleaded.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&quot;Sis, we should really tell mom,&quot; Logan advised. &quot;If she finds out from someone else, we're dead.&quot; Kelly thought for a moment. Nancy had always been protective of Kelly, that's one of the reasons she took Martial Arts, so when Tommy wasn't around she could take care of herself.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&quot;If mom finds out she'll never let me go anywhere without her and she'll crack down hard on me seeing Ryan.&quot; Kelly continued pleading like she was begging for her life, in a way she was begging for her social life.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&quot;If you want I'll be there when you tell her, to help explain everything. I did see everything, anyway I've been looking for a reason to pop David all year and couldn't find one.&quot; Tommy chipped in. Being there with her when she explained it would help, for some reason Nancy had always had an uncompromised belief that he'd have a handle on any situation and could handle almost any problem. Tommy thought back to when he first started studing martial arts and his first sparring match. He'd been beaten misserobly. That afternoon he begged his mom to take him out of the classes and she almost agreed, untill Nancy threatened that if he gave up so soon she'd skin him. Tommy realized he had two choices, practice and get better or , he'd never really liked thinking about the alternative. Kelly slumpped, she knew she was beat and they all resumed the walk under the canopy of trees that stretched from the drive way's begining to it's end. Nancy and Tommy's mom owned twelve square acre's side-by-side. The only area clear of tree's was the small acre where the house set. Nancy and Tommy's mom thought it best they live together rather than in two seperate houses and be at eachothers all the time. <br>
<br>
The kids finaly reached the house and they all yelled a collective &quot;Hi!&quot; as the walked through the door and a collective &quot;Bye!&quot; as they scattered toward there seperate rooms. Tommy dashed up the stairs and threw his backpack into it's usual place next to his bed. He flung open the door of his closet and took from there neat piles one of his martial arts outfits, he had nine, just in case. He stripped off his outer clothes and literaly jumped into the loose sparring pants. He slipped on each shoe as quick as possible and through on the outfits jacket instantly hooking the buttons as he'd done a million times more than he could remember. He bolted down the stairs, out the door, across the yard and the drive way to reach a three foot dirt mound that had beed trampled into a rock hard sparring ring. Logan and Amanda had taken the liberty of drawing the lines marking the &quot;out of bounds&quot;, the line deviding the ring in two and the circle in the rings center. Tommy easily made the three foot hop onto the rings surface. He strolled to the rings center and started stretching and then performed three flawless back handsprings into a backflip. He continued stretching as Kelly was coming into the ring. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Tommy had never really seen Kelly from a guy's point of view, or a cousins for that matter, it was more of a brotherly role. Tommy took a moment to actually look at her. Her red hair was pulled back into a ponytail. Her firey-red hair and temper had earned her the well deserved nickname &quot;Fire Demon&quot; among there fellow students at the dojo. Tommy knew the first place she'd gone when they walked inside, to the bathroom to remove her make-up. Even with out it Tommy could see why she was envied by many of the girls and swooned over by most of the guy's at school. One thing Tommy had noticed before were her eye's. In the ring he'd learned to read people's eye's, a persons eye's can tell you if there agresive or if they'd rather let the opponent make the first move. Kelly's bright blue eye's regestered both. Kelly was the only girl Tommy had known that enjoyed the thrill of a good sparring match as much as any guy. She was dressed in a traditional Kung-fu jacket, pants and the thin, super flexible shoes. Her outfit was black with white trim. The jacket was held loosly closed by a row of frog buttons from the collar to about her bellybutton, but the jacket extended to just past her hips. Tommy's outfit was also traditional but alittle different. Tommy had had them special made to be reversable, while his outfit now was white with black trim so he could easily be seen during single compatition he could turn the jacket and pants inside out and they would be black and white trimmed, to match Kelly's in dou-matches. The only way to really tell there outfits apart when both were black was that Tommy's left jacket flap extended to the area where his chest and his right shoulder came together before buttoning. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Kelly ceased her stretches and took her position in the center of the ring, across from Tommy. Tommy placed his right fist into his left palm and lowered his head, Kelly did the same. The traditional Kung-fu bow. They both assumed there stances and the wait began. Tommy and Kelly shared a common stubborn streak, the only diffrence was that Tommy had realized his and Kelly refused to beleive it no matter how many times she was told. they stared eachother down for well over a minute. The problem with Kelly is she's very impatiant but she isn't stupid, she'd wait for him to accidently give her a split second opening. How was she going to notice the diffrence between purpose and accident. Tommy quickly glanced to my left, down where Logan and Amanda were sitting on an old bench watching. Kelly took the opening and launched a high kick aimed for his head. he shot  up both arms and caught the kick across the forearms.Tommy instantly shot his left foot at Kelly's supporting ankle. She hopped and spun out of the way, they both jerked back into their stances. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&quot;What's the matter,&quot; Kelly moched. &quot;Don't tell me that two day's of being sixteen have slowed you down that much.&quot; Kelly liked to moch her opponents in the ring, it was a distraction, Tommy'd learned to ignore it long ago. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&quot;Not a chance, little girl.&quot; Tommy shot back. That got under Kelly's skin, if there was anything worse than calling her &quot;little girl&quot; Tommy hadn't found it. She dashed forward. Tommy dropped back on his right arm bringing both feet into a double kick that was naglected as they were reflected off her gaurding arm. Kelly used her left foot to go for Tommy's right hand, the one keeping him aloft. With lightning quick reflexes he shifted his weight and kicked both feet into the air to carry him. His left hand smacked dirt and his right came up just a milisecond before Kelly would have kicked it out of place. Tommy landed on one knee, his left hand up to guard and his right tucked tightly behind his back at the thought of what might have happened if Kelly had connected with her full force. They were staring at each other, ready to go again when loud, taunting clapping broke both there concentration. Kelly whipped around. Logan and Amanda jumped up off the bench with surprise and were now standing. Tommy rose to his feet and assumed his position by Kelly's side. A pact they'd made years earlier. There in solid black and becoming increasingly non-visible with the setting sun stood David. Mocking them as usual. He was in the wrong place at a very wrong time.<br>
