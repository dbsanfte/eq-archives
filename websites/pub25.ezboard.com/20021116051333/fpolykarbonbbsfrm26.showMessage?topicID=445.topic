Prologue.   <br>
<br>
Something bad was happening.<br>
   He could feel it inside himself, squirming and writhing, all energy expended on the act of freedom. It gnawed at his brain, as it’s grotesque movements sent his stomach churning, the bile already starting to rise in his throat.<br>
   If he didn’t reach the lab before the epsilon hour- or if the Pilgrims caught him first, he would be the start of the new wave of life. A life verging on the heavenly, yet monstrous in it’s full figure- a life of freedom riddled with bullet-holes of terror and violence. A life, that, if not stopped, would mean the end. <br>
   The thing inside was doing something to him- something almost completely unstoppable. Something done since the dawn of time itself.<br>
   He was evolving.<br>
<br>
<br>
1.<br>
<br>
Han-Ye Building, 11.52pm, Nakatomi<br>
<br>
   As his dark black loafers clipped at the polished marble below his feet, Gage began to tremble. He was walking towards possibly the last few minutes of his life, and he knew it. <br>
   Pissing off UNEC had not been the greatest career move of all time- even though in this particular instance it hadn’t been his fault. Sure, he’d made some wrong moves- perhaps taken some wrong turns- but he knew that it probably couldn’t have been avoided. The gravity of the situation would have to come crashing down on him sometime, knocking all the breath from his lungs in one vicious gesture.<br>
     As he approached the large oak doors he started to slow his twitching, brisk walk. His fingers, nestled in his coat pockets, clenched and stretched, in an attempt to break free from the oncoming confrontation, to break loose from their master and scurry away from the doors that lead to it.<br>
   But the fingers stayed attached- and Gage kept walking, gritting his teeth. He wiped away the thin trail of sweat that slid down the side of his face- another part of him trying to escape from the fray.<br>
   He stopped just in front of the doors. His heart pounded in his chest, his lungs screamed for oxygen even though he was already breathing deeply through his flaring nostrils and clenched teeth. He closed his eyes hard for a second, bringing darkness flashing with faint tendrils of light, and a humming, burning noise in his temples.  <br>
   Raising an arm that felt as though it was made of lead, he knocked at the door.<br>
<br>
   “Who is it?”<br>
   “Taffon, sir.” A pause. The sliding of a desk drawer. The clearing of a throat.<br>
   “Come in.” Gage pushed open the door, a sliver of light expanding into the view of Umbray’s office. Very little didn’t shine or glimmer as he walked through the wooden portal. In fact, everything had the appearance that it was methodically washed, scrubbed and polished every ten minutes- that is, except from Kiefer Umbray’s face. <br>
   “Hello Gage.” Kiefer did not smile. His chubby face was set in the kind of expression where a deep anger boils within, which the wearer has no intent on hiding- merely keeping a straight face purely for the sake of the façade. Or perhaps this was Kiefer’s way of showing Gage how angry he really was.<br>
   “Well Gage… to be perfectly frank I’m surprised you came back. I never took you for a stupid man.” Gage stared out of the gigantic window that was the back of Kiefer’s office. It gave a spectacular view of Nakatomi, but at that point Gage was not quite ready to enjoy the sights. <br>
   They both stood there, Gage, hands behind his back clasped together in a fearful embrace. Kiefer, standing in a casual stance, hands shoved deeply in pockets. Gage saw something twitching in the fabric of one of Kiefer’s trouser legs. He was probably fiddling with something, a piece of change, a ring of keys, a gun shut up Gage…<br>
   “So…” Kiefer began. “I assume you know what you’ve got yourself into.”<br>
   “Yes sir.”<br>
   “And… forgive me but… if you knew…” Kiefer’s face began to twitch, eyes narrowing behind the slim-rimmed spectacles, “what you had done…” he cocked his head, and took the fiddling hand out of the pocket, now empty. He started shaking it in front of himself, gesturing at Gage. “…why the @#%$ did you come back!?”<br>
   Gage flinched inside. Kiefer was right… why had he come back? It wasn’t as if the company was merciful, if anything it was ruthless, so why… “because I needed to talk to you about something” Gage blurted out suddenly.  <br>
   “You needed to… talk to me about something? What exactly is there left to talk about, Gage?”<br>
   “The subje…”<br>
   “You know as well as I do the subject is gone!” Kiefer was shaking now. “And I hope you know why you worthless little @#%$! He’s gone, probably dead or in a hole somewhere dying, or even, God, he could be on the other side of the world!”<br>
   “Sir, I don’t think…”<br>
   “What!? What exactly don’t you think Gage? Actually… no, I don’t want to know. Do you know why? Because you know nothing. You proved that by losing the subject, an action that will have God knows how many repercussions! You may well have killed us all Gage, but…” Kiefer’s face cracked a smile, toothy and leering. He pulled the other hand out the pocket, and pointed the gun at the end of it squarely at Gage’s head. “…I’m going to make sure you die first!” <br>
<br>
The seats were red, plush, sucking great things. For the price, they seemed excellent value. As he sat in the 4th seat on the left, aisle C, he started to run his hands over the smooth wooden armrests, shoving his hand into the plastic cup holders and making a cone to see how far he could push his fingers through. Unfortunately, he pushed too hard and the plastic grid snapped under his billed fingers. There was a quiet tinkle as sticks of snapped plastic dropped onto the smooth oak floor, now coated with old drink, chewing gum, condoms and… well, whatever else you could think of. He smiled. The grin looked playful yet calm, but in the glimmer of the picture’s image, dancing and flashing across his face, what most stuck out were his eyes. Wide, entrancing, static. The iris did not move. His eyelids did not twitch. He sat, grinning, with his eyes and his mouth, one leg folded over the other, one hand loped loosely over the seat next to him, the other, grasping a detonator.<br>
<br>
Gage’s job was not a simple one. Gage was not a simple man. But there was one thing about his job that was piercingly clear: keep your mouth shut. That was partially the reason why he was paid. He was about to break his job description.<br>
 <br>
   It was now or never. Gage decided to make his stand – and he knew he was dead if it didn’t work.<br>
   “You do know what’ll happen if you shoot me.” Kiefer stared at him, his face a knot of rage. “You’ll be @#%$. The subject will be lost. Forever. And soon, someone will be doing exactly the same thing to you as you are doing to me now. And you know it.”                             .    Kiefer’s face twitched.<br>
   “Don’t mess with me, Gage,” he blurted. “You @#%$, you’re just messing with me, waiting for me to @#%$ up. I’m not gonna fall for it, you’re going to pay!”<br>
   “Oh, stop talking like you’re some sort of God. You’ve got higher-uppers, ready to blow you away like a speck of dust.” Gage took a step forward… and his pulse rate took a step up. “What will they think, when they find out that you shot a guide in your office? You might as well be shooting yourself, you idiot. I never though you were that blind.”<br>
   “Stop it!” Kiefer was getting mad now, his face was red, his teeth were gritted and the gun was starting to wobble in his grip.<br>
   “You can see the edge, can’t you?” He was cutting his own throat, he was sure of it.    “You can see the edge, and you know this is the last push. Shoot me, I’ll collapse on you and we’ll both fall. Try it. Go on. I dare you.” A small smile pricked up on the side of Gage’s mouth. <br>
