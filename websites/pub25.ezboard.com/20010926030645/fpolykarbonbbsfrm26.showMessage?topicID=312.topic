<br>
The Sroni were a very peaceful race, and far more advanced than any of their stellar neighbors.  They were able to travel the stars twice as fast as any other race in their part of the galaxy.  This technology would lead them to a damning salvation.  Other than advancing their technology, the Sroni traded rare goods found only on their planet materials to advance their technology and medicine. They were never actively involved in any of the regions wars however; it was not uncommon for both sides of a battle to have a Sroni medical ship behind their front lines.  They would even send scouts to search for survivors among the drifting ships.  Despite all of their technology the Sroni were still in their infancy, less than three generations had passed from when they first flew among the clouds to when they were soaring through the stars.  Then came the day that would change them forever, the day they discovered the Wroth.<br>
<br>
The day they discovered the Wroth was the day they realized the Rengalii had been conquered and enslaved this made the Sroni uneasy because the Rengalii were of great military strength.  Every ship was almost as advanced as the Sroni and every crewmember was very well trained.  The Rengalii had been at war with the Wroth for nearly twenty days before the Sroni knew what was going on.  They learned of this as dozens of ships approached their boarders and asked for whatever protection could be offered.<br>
<br>
The Sroni knew the Wroth would come, they saw it as inevitable.  The question to them was if it would be in the spirit of peace or war.  The Sroni sent two ships to work for peace.  These ships were to travel to the Rengalii home world of Cyron and try to negotiate, if they made contact with a Wroth ship on the way there, they were to stop and request a diplomatic escort.  This is where the tail starts.<br>

You say that a war has just broken out but in the story you mention that the Rengalii have been conquered. You also say that the Sroni have sent a diplomatic mission. This doesn't look like a war yet. Does the Sroni mission get attacked or destroyed? There's very little here to comment on. It sounds interesting but there's no steak, just sizzle. I'll stay away from trying to point out any major grammatical errors (mainly because I suck at grammar) but you do need to work on spelling. There's several places where words are misspelled or the wrong word is written (like their instead of there). <br>

So i can't help but to note a bit of hypocrisy in your first line. Although the fact that no one comments to posts irritates me as well... But I don't hold grudges so I'll make a response on yours. First of all, nice creativity with the name 'Sroni'. You have a good science-fiction style working for you. All in all you have a nice start. Which like many things could be improved upon. First of all you're far to vague in the opening paragraph, you need to drop more specifics. (i.e. planet names, places, etc.) Secondly, the first paragraph caught me a bit awkwardly, it sounds like a dictionary definiton. Its told in passive voice and it doesn't really engage the reader. A few books I've read start off this way as you have done, If I find some titles I'll drop the names and you can compare how varying authors started off. Foundation, I think may be one like this. Secondly, you need to very sentance structure. They are some what bland, if you know what i mean. You should think of some good imagery and pop some similes into the opening. Give the reader some description, but leave some ambiguity. <br>
If you want me to post more or help you out, I'd be willing to, but if I am going to take my time to help you out you should at least take the time to comment on some of my posts.<br>

anyway...what he said is true...it's always good to go nuts and try hard to get your readers attention in the first little bit...then you can slow it down a little...Suspense is what pushes people to read more...you have the start of a sci-fi but it sounds too much like a nursury rhyme...it seems like you're holding back<br>
go crazy...throw in descriptions...go into more description about the situation...They're uneasy??? ...that's not very suspenseful...I get uneasy about midterms...uneasy doesn't describe a massive upset of a powerful society and on top of that an impending attack dirrected at me...that is much more than uneasy<br>

A vignette is a short snippet of an event occuring for a character or characters. There are no past/background descriptions, it's all action/dialogue-based.
