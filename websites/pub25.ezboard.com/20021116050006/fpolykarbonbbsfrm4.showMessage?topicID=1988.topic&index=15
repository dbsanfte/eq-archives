I know it doesn't appeal to..well hopefully not anyone<br>
But a lot of sexually related series do involve people that are minors or really really walking the line by claiming they're 18 but really appearing much younger<br>
there was one in particular that was somewhat based on that...it wasn't promoting it in any fashion but it was very very violent and has some really controversial scenes in it and so it's very hard to get here...or really anywhere<br>
it's not that it doesn't exist...it's not common but it still is true...just like there's some series without lots of flashes and explosions...some with no sexual humour and many that don't follow the massive eyes stereotype...<br>
<br>
there is really something for everyone in anime...and if someone sees one and thinks they've seen it all they are mistaken...it was a while before I could find what my girlfriend liked in anime...she actually likes the cheesy semi-romantic stuff or the fantasy type stuff...she's not a fan of flying robots and sci-fi stuff (DAMN!!!) it's personal taste...it's why coke is better than pepsi and it's why nintendo will always rule the consoles...it's my opinion<br>
<br>
Oh...and if the only anime that kid saw is what he formed his opinion on...he has some severe problems... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/utempted2rule.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tempted2Rule</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(10/17/02 5:39:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1988.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   mmmmU</span><hr size=1> sigh, if only people wern't such idiots...

Another Story <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  also true<br>
I was talking to my grandmother about a show that I watched, Gundam Wing.  She was always a fan of politics and their influence on was... So...  I proceded to relate the story (as best I could) of Gundam Wing to her.  As many know the plot is VERY complicated and she was VERY interested.  However the plot, as I was relating it, was so long that eventually she asked how this could fit into 1 movie (she just assumed it was a movie).  I then told her that that it was an Anime series(I don't think she knew what anime was) she lost some interest when she heard it was a series, but still wanted to see it.  I've bought the series up to the 7th dvd, so I ran and got one for her. HOWEVER, upon seeing it was animated, she IMMEDIATELY lost interest and when I asked she replied that she didn't want to &quot;waste her time&quot; on a cartoon.<br>

They hated it because it was popular.  Of the dumbest reasons to hate something.<br>

Older people do think cartoons are for kids, so think it's evil to have anything remotely mature in them.  I don't agree with it, but I understand where their opinion comes from, as that's how they grew up and don't know any better. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/unsdfrand.showPublicProfile?language=EN>nsdf rand</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(10/18/02 9:41:45 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1988.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.earthlink.net/~merlin05/www/rand2_296x396.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: mmmmU</span><hr size=1> thank god my parents arent like that<br>

but i cant stand the people who will want you to draw something for them and then take all the credit   or show it around school saying how bad it is <br>

only one person i know that i drew a picture for that didnt show it around school saying it sucked   a girl that was in my english class<br>

I will admit that the popularity of anime HAS risen over the past few years and has become another bandwagon that people need to jump on or in front of.<br>
<br>
Now that anime is no longer an &quot;underground&quot; phenomena(using underground cuz I can't think of a better word.) like it was when I started watching it.  For younger people it's the same reason they have to get the 120 dollar shoes or whatever.  Because now its &quot;hip&quot; and &quot;in.&quot;  I don't have a problem with the fact that anime is more popular, that means more for us.  I don't like the people who get into something without really understanding what's BEHIND it.<br>
<br>
And then since it's popular you are going to have groups of people speaking out AGAINST it.  Which ticks off those of us who love Anime... but at the same time since the &quot;grown-up&quot; don't like it, more people have to get it.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uanarchyao2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>AnarchyAo2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pre-Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(10/19/02 5:32:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1988.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   a</span><hr size=1> Yeah, alot of stupid people are out there.
