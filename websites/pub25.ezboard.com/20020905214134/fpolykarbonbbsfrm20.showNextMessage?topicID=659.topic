Some people on this board know me, some dont, but the reason i didnt post is cause i didnt want to toss in all the effort its gonna take before i had the response.<br><br>  What is this all about?<br>  I always thought that movies like aliens and other military movies were good if they did one thing....character development.  Like im sure those who have seen aliens all remember hicks.  Well its stuff like that that put this idea in my head.  <br>  I want to do a war based &quot;fight club&quot; thing.  Im truth it will be a co-op effort.  The characters that are made do not have to look like you but should reflect some aspect of your personality.  This is an intro to the idea, if i were to post everything it would be quite long...so here we go.<br><br> Story:  After a large scale war on earth the planet reached peace under one government.  However the planet was depleted of resources and stuff like that....blah blah blah, Formed colony on another planet....blah blah blah...after a few civilizations are set up the colonies are getting wiped out.<br>As it turns out the artificial invironment set up on the planet is causing mutations in the native life, they have been breeding underground for years and are too big to stay in the inner tunnels of the planet.  They are violent and nasty and &quot;un-cute&quot;.<br>  The three climate control units can be altered with a engineered chemical that will reverse the mutation all most instantly.  However all three must be engaged at once from Olympia 4...a space station....and thats after the chemical has been planted in the climate control units.<br><br>  Characters: <br>  While there are many EDF (earth defense force....i know its corny) marined fighting the mutants.  Our characters will be the team assinged to impliment the &quot;reverse program&quot; at the three climate centers and then activate them at the space station.  The space station is totally automated but this must be done manually.  <br>  <br>  Needed Roles:<br>   Soldiers: need LOTS including myself as captain ( SOOooo arrogant).  Give them some personality, this can be lots of fun if u make it that way.  (some peeps are bound to die <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    )<br>  Science Officer: The brain, cant shoot for sheet, but can out math the fek outta ya.<br>   Weasel Corp person: see the mutants as a profit thing, his evil isnt revealed till the end.<br>   Field Medic: at least one...thank you Choi <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>  Mechanic:  Someone has to fix all the stuff we bust<br>   Add ons: ANYWAY u think u could help the story (cause i suck ass as a writer) do it.  Add in a character that i didnt list, just say how they fit.<br><br>  Wrap up:<br>  Why is this for all??<br>   EVEN IF U CANT DRAW DONT WORRY<br>   Just write what u want the char to look like and ill draw it for you.  U will still be asked to write a portion of the story and add in lil twist and such.  Just input what u can peeps i want to get as many involved as i can on this one.<br>   Any characters not picked up ill take their role.  <br>   If u fancy yourself a writer just write you part out and ill draw it for you, or u can request that another artist do it.  They can feel free to turn you down also <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br><br>   Costumes and world:<br>  <br>  Ill post the military combat suits up as i have those completed.  The suit for any other character u can make up.  Or tell me a suggestion on how i should make it look.  The military suits are open to suggestion also.  Its a Co-op not a me telling everyone how to do this.  <br><br>  Finally:<br>  Hopefully we can get a good mix of people here.  Emotion makes for a good story and good emotion comes from personality.  Sure u can write personality, but why write it when u can actually get it from a person.  <br>  Do it how u want to.  If u want to make your character in love (or lust) with another ones......fine...i dont care.  As a matter of fact lil things like that is what makes a story GREAT.  X-men's lil thing with gambit and rogue was enough to keep me entertained for an entire issue.  But im a libra, we are all in love with the concept of being in love (lust).  <br><br>  If youre in let me know and ill get crackin on this ASAP, once i get a few replies ill pump out the art work hard.<br>                                          P.S.<br><br>  Are u asking can i do this and Bare Knuckles and Brutal and be the gr00viest guy in the world all at the same time???<br>   Hell yeah, i rock like that.<br>  <p>On a long enough timeline,the survival rate for everyone drops to zero</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ufithy1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fithy1</A> at: 6/20/02 5:06:15 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uch0i.showPublicProfile?language=EN>C h 0 i</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(6/20/02 4:18:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=660.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://enweb.ragnarokonline.com/dat/cha_mag_f.gif width=100 length=100></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Something for everyone</span><hr size=1> dude<br>id love to do something like this ..<br>since this is a really great idea ..<br>ill put ALL of my effort into my drawings ..<br>that is if you allow me to be included in it .. =)<br><br>and ill make my character as one of the EDF .. he will be the 'SNIPER' guy who is kinda scared of the whole 'mutants are trying to kill us' idea, but does what he is told all the time. he hates war, and is a good religious person.
