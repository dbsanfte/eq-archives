“Do you believe in destiny?” a child’s voice asked as he stared into the tired, wrinkled, old face of his grandfather. Lifting a heavy hand, worn from age, he tapped gently the child’s head. <br>
“At my age, I’ve seen many people and been many places; I’ve seen a lot of fools gold, but if there’s one thing I believe in it’s destiny.” The man said trying to muster a powerful force behind his voice in order to evoke the genuine belief he had towards destiny.<br>
A flood of memories poured from deep within the caverns of his mind to sparkle once more, for a brief instant, in the glimmer of his eyes. There was Fylor the troubled young priest from the remote village of Norbrook, who rose to become on of the greatest instructors of his time. Then there was Diella, the beautiful daughter of a renowned sword smith, who charmed all with her song and verse, eventually marrying the price of Bridom. Or who could forget the friendly face of Barra the giant who had tamed peoples hearts and helped lead the good king Fallker and his valiant forces of steel hearted knights to victory at the battle of Starring Blade. The memories went on and on. <br>
The small child wondered what world lay behind the deep, green, mysterious, eyes of his grandfather. <br>
“Grandfather, won’t you teach me with the swords today,” came the pleading voice of the youth. His grandfather pretended sternness as he looked down into the child’s eyes, which in time would not be too unlike his own: calm, reflective and at peace with the world. The old man’s heart was dancing with a joviality that he hadn’t known in years. <br>
“Have you attended to your studies, off the battlefield ignorance can be a vicious enemy.”<br>
“Yes, Grandfather,” The child said proudly with all the seriousness he could muster. In truth the youth was as strong hearted as he was intelligent; few others in the village could match up to his abilities.  His greatest talent lay, perhaps, in his natural ability to focus and internalize a situation, all hesitation vanished, all fears suspended and suppressed in lieu of the moment. <br>
The two stepped outside the small stucco and wood house and onto the dusty road. Both had swords in hand, not large heavy swords, that might have been expected of fighters, but light strong swords, which if skillfully manipulated could have the bite of a venomous snake. <br>
The child’s grandfather, aided by years of experience knew just the right amount of push to give the youth; driving him onward to his limits of body and mind, but wary not to shatter them. There was a fine line between force and grace, which if tempered could make the warrior. <br>
<br>
“Avon…Avon, it’s time for dinner,” the pleasant voice of Kammi the boys older sister called from the front of the door. <br>
“Leave him to his practicing, Kammi,” the voice of her grandfather oscillated low, emanating from a chair by the fireplace. It had been several years since the old man had been unable to accompany Avon in his training. But Avon had been practicing with such resolve of mind and body that it almost made up for the lack of a constant teacher. <br>
“He’s so devoted to practicing every day, I wouldn’t be surprised if he joins the kings army,” Kammi said, wiping her hands on her apron. <br>
“Bah,” the old man grunted, “I cant see him restrained by the leash of that crony old king of ours. What’s he still on the throne for anyway, there’s nothing to be done around here anyway.”<br>
“But, Grandfather,” Kammi said reproaching, trying to hide embarrassment, “He’s our liege lord, the great protector-,”<br>
“-such titles have no meaning in times of peace, this land hasn’t seen a battle for at least a decade, it’s amazing any of us can still fight,” he retorted, his voice scratchy and strained with effort.<br>
“Oh, Grandfather, honestly,” Kammi said annoyed. She was about to shut the door all the way when a shadow appeared in front. A cloaked figure stood ominously at the doorway. <br>
<br>
Kammi remained startled for a moment, but as the hood dropped to reveal the face of Lord Halber her face moved to one of surprise and relief. <br>
“You do us honor lord, by gracing our house with your presence,” she said giving a low formal curtsy. <br>
“Oh, Kammi, don’t be so formal with me, it makes me feel stiff and I’m an old friend,” he said slightly caught by her words. “I’ve come to speak with Avon, is he here?” <br>
“He’s, out training…why does everyone always want the boy, can he get some practice once in a while…” the old man in the chair babbled to himself. Lord Halber’s eyes shifted sadly from the old man to the girl. The land would lose a great instructor when that man went, he thought quietly to himself. <br>
“We’ve got trouble brewing, the high priestess informs me that the balance of the land has shifted, and the armies of Vestra have been growing on our northern boarder. I’d be optimistic to say peace will last more than two months.” Halber said uneasily, his face looking more strained that it usually did. <br>
“What has Avon to do with it,” she replied, now caught up in the man’s story.<br>
“As you know, Avon possesses one of the Three Sacred Auras, granted by the goddess Avolien. An army that uses an Aura fighter is almost unbeatable.”<br>
“But, isn’t that dangerous, if they lose balance and go berserk  the land could be at even greater risk.”<br>
“It is a risk we might well have to take, if Vestra is in possession of a Aura fighter which rumor has it, we would be helpless against him. Besides there is always the protector the one who is in possession of the Third Aura, the Kazali, the one capable of bringing balance back to the land.”<br>
“But its true you wont know who possesses the Kazali until close to the end, it could materialize from any of the Aura holders.”<br>
“True, so a risk must be taken,”<br>
“What of Evinella and the Elves at the eastern boarder?” She asked, questioningly.<br>
“They’ve agreed to fight on our side as always, and so have the southern dwarvs as also the alliance of kings has joined. Our forces grow stronger by the day,” Halber said confidently.<br>
<br>
Both of their heads turned as the door opened it was Avon.<br>
<br>
----------------------------------------------------Second Section--------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Avon was a few steps in the doorway before he noticed the turbulent gaze of Lord Halber. Kammi’s gaze stared straight at him, unbent. <br>
“Avon, you look quite well. Tell me, how is training coming?” Halber asked, trying to be cordial. <br>
“Well, very well,” Avon said, his face bright and his heart warm at seeing his old friend. <br>
“It’s good to see you, time has been too long between us. What brings you this way, dear friend?” <br>
“I wish I could say only a visit to relate the songs of time that I have heard. However, there is much discord afoot and nothing seems melodious anymore.” Halber said gravely. The smile that had held thus far evaporated off Avon’s face as he grasped the seriousness of the situation. He sensed an inner tension amongst his sister and Halber. Taking a seat at the table he opened up his mind to the wisdom of his friend Halber.<br>
“You bring bad news, then?” Avon asked beginning on his quest for the answers that were raging through his head. Already he had begun to sense something was shifting in the land by the flux of the Aura around him.<br>
“I’ve just come back from visiting the high priestess on the Southern Isle of Nor. The balance in the realm has been disrupted. I fear peace will soon be disrupted.” <br>
Halber replied. His hand clenched tightly around the brass cup with meade that Kmami had given him. A vain on his right thumb throbbed as he did so. Time was taking a toll on Halber. Avon could feel that his friend had lost some of that sparkling resilience he’d once commanded in youth. <br>
“The forces have been disrupted how?” Avon questioned, probing deeper. <br>
“The imbalance has clouded the High-Priestess vision to a degree. Although she was unable to pinpoint the exact source, she did say it originated somewhere in the land of Moor.” Halber racked his memory trying to extract once more the exact words that had been spoken to him at the meeting with the High-Priestess.<br>
“Then it’s not Vestra’s army!” Avon slapped a hand down on the table subconsciously and was surprised by the own force at which he hit the tired wooden table. <br>
“So even if there is war between us that will not restore the balance, what a great cost that will be and how little we will gain.”<br>
“Exactly,” Halber’s voice resonated around the room. “But that is what worries me the most. I think we’re going to lose many a good man before we even cross swords with the real enemy. More so, our two forces could be so weak by the time the real war is at hand that we’d be crushed like ants before the strong gauntlet of evil.”<br>
“Well put, I see this is going to tax both sides greatly, perhaps we could come to a compromise with Vestra,”<br>
“The man’s too egotistical,” Halber said growing frustrated, knowing that the idea was good and along the lines of what he himself had been thinking, but the outcome was surely futile. “He’ll never listen to reason. Men of his type are only concerned with power and conquest and little else,”<br>
“Perhaps, though, that is his weakness. We play the game of give and take with him. Winning here, losing there, in a seemingly chaotic manner, in this way we would lose little before the final battle. When the true battle comes, we propose a temporary alliance to destroy the common enemy then resume the quarrel when it is defeated. However, by that time both sides will be so taxed that everyone will want peace. Vestra is not evil, just ambitious.” Avon sat back with his arms crossed quite satisfied with his proposed plan of action. <br>
“Remind me to give you some high ranking position in my army when all this is over,” Halber said only in half jest. In truth, the youth was brilliant as a tactician, if only he was a few years older and free from some of the emotions of youth, he’d surely be unbeatable. <br>
“I can relay a message to the High-King with in a day informing him of our plans. Meanwhile, I’ve sent scouts into Moor to try and lock down the source of the disruption.”<br>
Lord Halber leveled a gaze on Avon, who stiffened a bit, he found it almost difficult to meet the battle hardened stare of Halber.<br>
“Are you familiar with the Temple of Seven Lakes?” Halber asked, unmoving.<br>
“Seven Lakes? Isn’t that where the Sacred Triangle that will unite the Aura’s is held?”<br>
“I see you’ve attended to your history lessons.”<br>
“You’ll need an Elf to guide you, possibly a ranger. I’d think your aura would lead you there on its own, but we’ve not got time to lose. It will essential to unite the Three Sacred Aura’s against this common foe, what ever it turns out to be.”<br>
“Agreed, I’ll leave at once.” Avon said resolved already moving for his sword.<br>
“I’ve got a fresh horse for you waiting at the village stall take it, it is one of my best.”<br>
“I thank you kindly dear friend,”<br>
At that Avon said his goodbyes to his sister and his grandfather and grandmother, then stepped out the door with Lord Halber. The two conversed briefly for a moment then were off in opposite directions. Halber to the High-King and Avon to the North in search of the Temple of the Seven Lakes. <br>
