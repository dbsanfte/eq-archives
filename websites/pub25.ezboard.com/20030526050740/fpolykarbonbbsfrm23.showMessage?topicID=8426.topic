<br>
Story Line<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The Dai-Kai, tropical humanoid beings, they range in height from 6ft to 7ft6in. They can weight from 200-300 lbs. Their skin can range from Light green to Dark green. Their eye color, and flap color can range in many different colors. They are lean, and muscular. They have tremendous physical endurance, and can lift things 3 times their weight. Their characteristics include Flaps, which are on their head. They can range from many different colors and are used to attract the opposite sex. The brighter the colors, the better chance of getting a mate. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp They have elfish ears, and their nose is hardly visible. They have blotches of light green and dark green and in-between mixed together in a camouflage style. Their skin is smooth, and steam line. They are excellent swimmers, and are immune and very resistant to most diseases in the jungle areas of the world. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp They are very good Warriors and Archers. Their ability to cast magic is low but not impossible. Their armors are lighter and more efficient than human or elven armors. And their weapons are mostly double-sided, or large weapons. Even though their armor is more efficient and can maneuver better, it does not cover all areas of their body and some areas are vulnerable. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp They live in small tribes, or villages but do not live in big city areas. Unlike the humans, as humans live in cities, and large towns. Humans are not as immune to diseases as the Dai-Kai but have a higher ability to cast magic, and make magical weapons. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Humans are weaker, though they come in numbers, and can multiply their population fast, unlike the Dai-kai having a slower birth rate. And have better ingenuity in being able to construct siege weapons, and such things. Both races have their Pros, and Cons. <br>
<br>
The elven, paler, shorter, skinnier than the humans, live in forested areas instead of open areas, the elven are excellent magic casters, but are poor warriors and fighter, though excellent at stealth, and rogues, and wizards, and archers. They are not the best armor, and weapon crafters but their ability to enchant weapons and armor and such items is a key to their success in battle. Even though their armor is weaker than human or Dai-kai armor is magically enhances making it very strong. <br>
<br>
The stand 4ft-5’6’’ tall, they have red eyes, and their hair is pale browns, blacks, reds, and blondes. They are thin, and lean. Their Strength and muscle is little compared to the Dai-kai or human. Though elven can live to be 800 years old. Humans can only live to be 100 if their lucky, and Dai-kai can only live up to 580years old at the most. All three races have their pros, and cons, and each have a unique trait, and have their strengths. <br>
<br>
<br>
The humans enslave Dai-kai to work, and make their towns and cities, and work in the quarries, and work the canals, aqueducts, and <br>
Other such things. Many enslaved Dai-kais had rebelled but failed. And even if they did escape they do not know the area in which they are. For many eons the Dai-Kai, and humans have fought for supremacy, the Dai-kai are mainly peaceful, and only fight when threatened, and are very suspicious of strangers of other tribes and races. <br>
<br>
The humans once tried to enslave elves but their magic ability and archery were too strong for the humans to conquer. And they fierce numbers of humans overwhelmed the Dai-kai, and conquered many of their tiny tribes, though the humans lost many men in the wars of supremacy. The Dai-kai start to form a government and start to connect their tribes together, and unite and prepare to save their enslaved brothers, and revenge for what they have done.<br>
<br>
After many eons the Humans had become the Supreme Race, then Elves, then Dai-kai. Many of their brethren enslaved and rarely ever seen except for the deepest reaches of the jungles, where they have been pushed back.  They are rebuilding, and making a new empire and rise up against the humans and free their enslaved brethren. All of the Dai-kai that were free grouped up and helped build a new powerful nation. Terre Sainte was the name of the young empire, though there were still tribes that did not know of the new empire, or refused not to come. Zyric’s tribe was one of them, and one day while he was out hunting, a group of Slave traders came upon his tribe and enslaved his tribe, the fiercely fought back, the small group of the humans would have been easy for the Dai-kai to fight back even a larger group, but this time they came with a new weapon. A new technology…they called it a gun. And the humans easily killed the ones who fought back and enslaved the women and children of the tribe, and the males who were too old to fight back. <br>
<br>
When Zyric came back he found his fellow tribe mates that were strong enough to fight back dead, with a hole in their head, and no slash marks. He found the rest of his tribe gone. He knew it had to be the humans.He was alone and scared. He went to his house, and Got on his Armor and Grabbed his Double axe and set off to the Human city of Lunsa. <br>

Regardless, this sort of stuff should go into the right forum. Thats like me posing pictures of myself naked here instead of at edate.com, simply because this site gets more hits. And that doesn't make sense now does it?<br>
