<br>
well flare, what about the people who took hundreds of civilians hostage in the first place?  I think it is a foolish knee-jerk reaction to automatically label the Russian special forces as barbarians just because their rescue operation went badly.  If you do any research, you will find countless infamous incidents in which counter-terrorist operations went badly (the failed Iran rescue mission, Waco seige, etc.).  This is hardly a new phenomenon, and without bringing in arguments of causality, I would venture that it is correct to put the blame for these hostage deaths not on the special forces but rather on the terrorists themselves.<br>
<br>
This idea, at least within America, has great precedent and is in fact codified in our legal system (i.e. should someone die during the commision of a crime you initiated, you are still responsible for their death regardless of whether or not you intended to hurt anyone).  Why are you calling the special forces barbarians?  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>they</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> didn't take anyone hostage without provokation (leaving out the issue of chechnya for the moment- it is my position that terrorism is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>never</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> a viable option) and they certainly didn't start executing people without warning (all things that the terrorists, on the other hand, did).<br>
<br>
While there are many different ways of thinking about complex issues like terrorism, and it would be foolish for anyone of us here on this board to purport to give a definitive answer (my International Relations professor once said: &quot;Never trust a person who starts a sentence with &quot;All we have to do is...&quot; or &quot;Group X&quot; is just a bunch of &lt;derogatory adjective of your choice&gt;&quot;&quot;), it would be prudent to consider this:<br>
<br>
The purpose of terrorism is precisely this - to instill terror in the general civilian populace.  They do this through targeting those who are helpless and by causing civil uncertainty and unrest in general, which undermines confidence in the policies of soverign actors (governments).  Terrorism is only effective so long as governments continue to be cowed by these acts of terror and accede to the terrorists' demands.  <br>
<br>
Why do governments do this?  Why <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>do</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> terrorists strike at civilian targets?  Because it is highly effective at creating people who share your mentality, the unsubstantiated idea that somehow acceding to terrorists demands will &quot;make all the suffering stop&quot;.  In doing so, you miss the forest for the trees - if you think that giving terrorists what they want will make everyone happy, I would respectfully suggest that you have a long of serious rethinking to do.  <br>
<br>
The reality of it is, if governments act decisively to take away the payoff of terrorism (i.e. refusing to give in to their demands, taking rapid countermeasures and ending hostage situations without allowing terrorists to derive any benefit from them) then terrorism will hopefully decline, as individuals who are considering such <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>barbaric</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> action may begin to consider that all that awaits them is an inglorious death with no payoff.<br>
<br>
Of course in so doing, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>there will be deaths</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  But this is the cost of standing up to those who would do such dastardly things to begin with.  And it means that populations of soverign states, especially the &quot;soft children of democracy&quot; will have to mature, and realize that there will be a great deal of suffering they must endure before terrorism can be eliminated, and <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>furthermore, this suffering is neither unique nor unusual in the world</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  <br>
<br>
As much as I dissaprove of the terrorist actions, we should realize that Chechnya is not a very pleasant place to live at the current moment, nor is the vast majority of africa or the middle east or south-east asia or eastern europe or even large portions of south america.  War and strife is continously ongoing and things like this are commonplace in all these areas.  There is no black and white, nor easy good and evil labels to be placed.

im mad at the terrorist who started this horrible thing but i do no tthink using a illigal gaz to save the hostages work<br>
and to make it ten times worse the russion goverment refuse to tell the doctors what gaz they used so they can sace the ones who are in critical condition from this<br>
<br>
also do you really think using a poison gaz was the best solution to this <br>

i do not think that was the best way out<br>
also those who have seen the news resenntly would  have learned a ne thing to consider in this<br>

that the teorrirst were about to give up and release their hostages insted the russian goverment who new this ignored it and sent them to use the gaz without even considering what they could do with more talk instead of actions<br>

also another question to you people<br>
if f eks some of your famali members were in that theater and some of them had health problems wpuld you then have this oppinoin that gaz would be best<br>
im not saying it was a bad suluion but instead of using a gaz that was hard to detect and would knock em out slpwl without em knowing it they use a gaz that can kill and then they refuse to tell what gaz they used and this could further damage for life or kill people who are now in critical condition<br>
<br>
they went  to action to fast <br>
and what gets me mad is the fact that<br>

a) they used a gaz that kills<br>
<br>
b) they refuse to tell what so that the people in crit can easier be saved<br>
<br>
thats what gets me mad the most about this<br>

<br>
That they were &quot;considering&quot; giving up is hardly an established fact, and I think that the credibility of those who would take 800 innocent people hostage and execute several of them is quite suspect.  You also neglect to consider that by this point <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>the terrorists had already started killing people</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  Who is to say that terrorists (especially ones possessing fundamentalist beliefs as these did) wouldn't kill all 800 hostages outright?  If the Russian government had not acted when they did, and the terrorists decided to blow up the entire building and killed everyone inside of it, no doubt everyone would have said &quot;Why did you waste so much time talking when decisive action is what was called for? You could have prevented all those senseless deaths!&quot;<br>
<br>
&gt; also i understand they migth have ignored the talks and blown emselfes up<br>
&gt;but wel never now will we<br>
<br>
I would hardly think that is a good idea to wait for the terrorists to kill all 800 hostages and then go &quot;oops! i guess we should have acted sooner! at least we know now!&quot;.  I really think that people should cut the Russian government some slack - this truely was a no-win situation.<br>
<br>
&gt;im not saying it was a bad suluion but instead of using a gaz that was hard to detect and would knock em<br>
&gt;out slpwl without em knowing it they use a gaz that can kill <br>
<br>
Sadly, flare, real life is not like a game of Counterstrike.  It's very easy for all of us to sit back safe and sound in our chairs typing in front of our computer and say &quot;oh, they should have used such-and-such, or they should have done such-and-such&quot;  I highly doubt that the Russian government intentionally used a lethal gas - a &quot;poisonous gas&quot; as you put it.  They may have, but I think that a more likely scenario is that they used a non-lethal gas which unfortunately for whatever reason, resulted in an unusually large number of casualties.  They probably had no way to know that this would happen.  <br>
<br>
A popular theory circulating currently is that they used a heavier-than-air agent to ensure that the gas would be effective even if released through the air vents, and that the ensuing casualties were an unfortunate result of the hostages breathing in much large doses than anticipated when they fell to the floor.  How can anyone predict this?  In the real world, bad things like this happen and <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>they're nobody's fault</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  In addition, one should keep in mind that the Russian army/special forces don't have nearly the same budget/resources as we do in our country.  Theirs is an economy that has been teetering on the brink of insolvency for the past decade and the situation is so bad that soldiers go without pay or food, nuclear submarines slowly rust away for want of repairs, the space program has to sell flights to the backstreet boys to survive, and so forth.  It is unfair to hold them to the same standards as we would their Western counterparts (not that western forces could have done better neccessarily!)<br>
<br>
You do have a very valid point when you indicate that the Russian government remains mum on what kind of gas they used.  I too am curious as to why this is.  However, despite this omission, I still think that the actions of the russian special forces are far from &quot;barbaric&quot; and certainly deserving of respect, if not for their actions, for their handling of what was a horrible, no-win situation.  700 out of 800 hostages rescued seems quite good to be me, especially given the alternative...<br>

I just get pissed when I read things like this sometimes. <br>
I am upset that the Russians haven't told anyone what gas was used and also that they haven't helped the doctors as well. I can see why if it was some sort of &quot;top secret&quot; gas of theirs, but considering what happened to the vicitims, they should've done more to help. I heard on the news that those that died from the gas were older folks or those with medical conditions. They took in a dose of gas, collapsed and laid on the floor and breathed in more gas, pushing them over their &quot;limit&quot; they should've been exposed to.<br>
As far as the tactics go, the Russians were on the ball. They did what they could and accomplished their mission. <br>
I have a Russian friend who told me many a story of the Chetchian (spelling...) problems they had there before he moved here. Not fun stuff....<br>
New keyboard? What? Are all the consinants and vowels located in different spots now? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

All bodies have different tolerances. What might kill one person quite possibly wouldn't even phase another. Just like one person can have a beer or two and be totally stoned, while others guzzle and you wouldn't know it. To be certain that they knocked out the terrorists, who quite likely had a lot more stamina than the elderly did, they would have needed to use a pretty high dosage.<br>
<br>
As for giving out the antidote, I heard it mentioned that this could have been a nerve gas, and no one admits to that. Using any form of gas is in the gray of international law, and admitting to using a semi-legal gas might hurt them in world affairs more than holding back.<br>
<br>
Also, if your interested in learning about less than lethal gases and such, Future War by John B. Alexander is a great book. He goes through all different forms of less than lethal/unorthodox weaponry. It's a great read. <p>&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br>
