Your new guy will have as many EXP as the previous one, but you have to kill one Armada ship for each level you had previously gained. The only down side is all the credits you previously had will be lost, and the ultra techs will be gone. But, if you do some trading with a friend beforehand you can keep the UltraTech as well.::Armada::Dreamcast::admin

Go to the Bait and tackle shop and kill the creatures that attack you then go out side and do the full axe combo on the monster in the green t-shirt right outside the tackle shop door. This will kill him. You will then attract the attention of a monster wearing a white t-shirt this monster leaps at you but gives you $250 kill him away from the water and go in to the tackle shop and repeat. If you have about 20 small hassys you can get about $20000(no typo) in about 20 minutes. This is easier if you can lay down the full axe combo on the green guy because if he is still alive he and the leaper will team up on you. If things are getting ugly then switch to Doggs and Blast them with your rail gun. This takes a bit of practice but the rewards are great.::Blue Stinger::Dreamcast ::admin
