This dungeon intimidated me thru level 15.  I finally went back at level 31...  so here are my impressions from this past weekend.::::Entry into a large open room.  Picture two loops around a center room (think those van-allen belt images you always see of the earth, but not with as many loops).::::Go through the open doorway and go left or right. One direction takes you in a short loop and back to the main room (1 floor up though). The other loop takes you up and around and slants down into a large square room w/ 2 zombies.  Then up the other end to  the far end of the loop.::::There is a chest at this point which apparently used to spawn good loot, but is pretty average (no magic items, but had a taichi when I opened it).  Ends with a cross of rooms w/ liches (1 per room) and an opening back to the main entry room.::::Rated: Small dungeon, 10 rooms total.  Lich/Zombie tag teams make it unsafe for solo @ lvl 12.  Probably ok for group at Lvl 8+, or a tag along lvl 5.::
