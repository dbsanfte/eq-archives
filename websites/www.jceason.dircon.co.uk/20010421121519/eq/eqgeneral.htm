<B>These are the websites that I commonly use to find things, along with a brief note on the kind of information you'll find there.  Addresses are listed long hand as well as linked, so you can see them on printed copy.<P>
PWI - means the pages print with the index column so you can get lots of extra pages at the bottom of the content section.  Use your print preview option in the browser to check and specify the pages you want.<P>

<TR><TD><A HREF="http://everquest.station.sony.com/">EverQuest Portal</A></TD><TD>http://everquest.station.sony.com/</TD><TD>Official EverQuest Site - tends to have generalised info but not much detail.  Producers' letters.</TD></TR>

<FONT COLOR="#FFCC33">Utility programs</FONT><P>
There are all kinds of extra unofficial programs appearing that you can download to use with EverQuest.  The two commonest are server monitors and log analysers.  These are the ones that I'm currently using:<P>
<Table border=1>
<TR><TD><A HREF="http://www.hydracomp.com/eq">Evermon<BR>(Evertools)</A></TD><TD>http://www.hydracomp.com/eq</TD><TD>Nice program that let's you see the state of the individual servers - very handy when you're waiting for the servers to come back up after a patch or just wondering why you suddenly got dropped and can't get back in!  Now also incorporates other applications such as a chat server and log analyser (see below).</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><A HREF="http://www.gralin.com/EQCharInfo">EQCharInfo</A></TD><TD>http://www.gralin.com/EQCharInfo</TD><TD>Program that organises your log entries so that you can easily keep track of all the info they contain.  Makes it easy to see what levels your skills have reached, where you got your best prices, how your battles went etc..  To use this you need to run a log file - type "/log on" when you're in game or set LOG=TRUE as a line in your ini file.  Note: this application now comes as part of the Evertools set - see above.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><A HREF="http://www.eqcaster.com">EQCaster</A></TD><TD>http://www.eqcaster.com</TD><TD>This program allows you to see a user friendly version of the contents of the EQ spell file.  Shows you damage values, casting times, durations etc of all your spells, selectable by class.  Now includes a facility to export for spreadsheets.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><A HREF="http://home.tampabay.rr.com/estembler/tristram/eze.htm#Download">EQ Zone explorer</A></TD><TD>http://home.tampabay.rr.com/estembler/tristram/eze.htm</TD><TD>This utility allows you to load up other EQ zones via the tutorial program so that you can explore the map safely.  Does not show the nasties within a zone and not all zones are explorable, but can be very useful.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/colorwizard/color_wizard.asp">EQClient.ini Color Wizard</A></TD><TD>http://eq.castersrealm.com/colorwizard/color_wizard.asp</TD><TD>One of several utilities that have sprung up to help you find colour settings to go into the new client ini file</TD></TR>

I also get a lot of information from Usenet via <A HREF="news://alt.games.everquest">alt.games.everquest</A>.  You need to be a little careful subscribing to this tho - it averages around 900 posts a day at the present time, so make sure you have a news reader that has good filters to take out 
all the whining!<P>
