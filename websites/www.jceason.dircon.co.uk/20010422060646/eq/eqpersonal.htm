These are links to pages of information that I have compiled for my own use.  My first concern here was to produce something that could be used as a nice easy check or comparison list for use when locked into the game.  And because you do get locked into the game (no alt-tab in EQ!) I try to make them easily printable as I have to work from the printed copy!<BR>
For anyone that has access to Excel for Win95 or higher, I will also post a copy of the spreadsheet that I use to compile the information.  If you find this easier to use, feel free to download it.  One bonus to the spreadsheet is that printing is far more configurable than a browser, another is that it contains pages that are essentially character sheet templates.  At the moment it only contains these sheets for the classes that I play, but hopefully I'll evetually get time to do the others too.  If you find the format useful and create a sheet for your own class, feel free to mail it back to me for inclusion in the master spreadsheet.  The one disadvantage to the spreadsheet is that it still contains a lot of gaps as I've only just started to update it from my notes and there are still a lot of things in the game that I haven't found out yet!  Please send contributions to update the posted master if you have them and feel that you'd like to share!<P>
