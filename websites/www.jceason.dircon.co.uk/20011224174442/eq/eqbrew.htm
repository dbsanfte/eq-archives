<B>This skill can be started quite early by any characters hunting in a snake zone.  Hang on to those snake skins people!  Get yourself some bottles and the same number of waters as skins and head for the nearest brew barrel to make your bog juice!  It may not sound very appetising, but it will get your skill up to 21 and it does the job!  At low levels of alcohol tolerance I found that 1 bottle of bog juice was pretty much 1 point of tolerance increase!  It also seems to be the cheapest option as you only need to buy bottles and water.  Bottles are about 6c each and if you have a failed attempt they are not used up, so the water flasks are the expensive component here at just over a silver each.<P>
For foraging characters Kalish is a good way to go too, as it uses foraged vegetables and berries, so cost is the same as bog juice, but I'm not sure at what level this goes trivial.<P>
After this my druid did a batch of heady kiola brewing which can take you up to skill 46.  However, this was a requirement for tailoring cured silk and is not the cheapest way to advance brewing.  Each kiola requires 2 packets of sap and these cost over a gold a piece.  The failure rate is pretty high, but it does work the skill up quite fast.<P>
The cheaper alternative is fish wine.  Go catch some more fish, buy grapes, water and bottles and brew away.  Failures are quite high to start with but when you do succeed you get 3 bottles at a time so eventually it becomes economical and will get you up to a skill level of 62.<P>
Following this I went to 68 on Gypsy wine, 82 on white wine and then 95 on red wine.  The latter two drinks require either foraged fruit or berries so go and hunt out those foraging friends!<P>
Since then I've gained another point making Tumpy Tonics for the Trueshot Longbow quest but this probably isn't an option for anyone other than  a druid or wizard with their gate spells.  The only place to buy the kiola nuts is out in the Ocean of Tears, so unless you have a porting friend willing to fetch and carry for you there'll be a lot of long boat rides involved!  In addition, the nuts do not stack so there is a fairly small limit on how many you can buy and transport back to a brew barrel.  The tonics should go all the way up to around 135 for anyone who has the means and the patience.<P>
Apart from the tonics I need for quests I shall probably practice brewing by continuing with Ol'Tujim's Fierce Brew.  This will also trivial at 135 but all the ingredients can be bought at the brewer's shop.  Vodka will also go to this level but requires foraged veggies and I've run out!<P>
