<B>EverQuest is a large online multi-player FRPG.  Because of the immense size of the game and its world, I'm not even going to attempt to document it all here.  There are many, many web sites out there that cover all topics of the game and most of them do it much better than I can.  However, because there is so much information and so many websites, it can be very difficult to find or remember the best place to go for the best information on a particular topic.<P>
As I'm often being asked for this information by other players and because I have the same problem as everyone else remembering where I've seen a particular piece as I surf, what I am going to do is try and list out what I consider to be the best place to go and look for a particular detail.  In addition I have found that many places don't list things out in the nice easy comparison type charts that I like to use for quick reference, so in these cases I tend to make up my own lists in a spreadsheet.  Where I have such a list for my own use I'll convert it and post it here for everyone else to use if they want it.<P>
The information in my own lists is a compilation of detail that I have found in various other places, along with my own experiences within the game.  As a result, accuracy can vary and is not guaranteed!  If you use it and find an error, or have extra info to add, feel free to <A HREF="mailto:jceason@dircon.co.uk">drop me a note</A> and I'll look into amending or adding as appropriate.<P>
