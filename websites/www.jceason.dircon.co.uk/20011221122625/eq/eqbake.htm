This is a skill you can start very early in Antonica, as soon as you're big enough to beat up on rats and fire beetles.  Rat ears only sell for a few coppers so hang on to them instead.  Fire beetle eyes sell for a nice sum at low levels, but I've always found that in the course of one hunting trip I collect far more eyes than ears.  In this case, when you return to sell check how many ears you have, keep the same number of eyes and sell the rest.  Then head for the nearest oven and make edible goo!  It sounds perfectly revolting, but it's easy, gets you to about skill 26 before going trivial and gives you some relatively cheap food after level 3.  You can cover the same ground by keeping any animal meats you get and making sandwiches (possibly your only option in Faydwyr), but you will have to be able to buy bread to do this so it works out a little more expensive.<P>
Hang on to those bat wings also.  Once you can afford to buy frosting you can make batwing crunchies all the way up to skill level 45.  After that, fish seems to be the cheapest way to go.  By this point you should have enough fishing skill to catch them quite reliably.  For the cost of a jug of sauces you can make fish fillets.  These can have quite a high failure rate at first, but when you do succeed on them you get 2 at a time and they sell back to the vendors for a reasonable price.  Fillets can take you all the way to skill 82.  After that fish rolls will take you as far as 135 using just your fish and any batwings left over from the crunchies!  And by the time you get to this stage you should be able to buy the bat wings anyway.  Either find some willing newbies to collect them for you and pay them a good price (better way to help out newbies than giving in to their annoying begging requests!) or go to the third inn in East Commons.  There is an Erudite vendor there that sells unlimited amounts of spell components, including the wings.<P>
There's a whole bunch of other exotic things that you can bake up to this skill level, but I've used these as the ingredients are either freely available for a little hunting time or very cheap from the baking supplies vendors. If you happen to be in the North Qeynos area you don't even have to hunt!  This zone seems to have the biggest litter problem in the whole of Norrath when it comes to unlooted corpses so just wander out and pick up the supplies you need, while cleaning up the countryside in the process!<P> 
Once you get beyond this skill level you're looking at making pies and such and you have to start getting involved in pie tins, mixing bowls and all sorts of bits like that.  Once I get there and figure out the cheapest/easiest way up the skill chart I'll fill out the details here.<P>
