This ia a list of commonly found ingredients that are used for various skills or as spell reagents.  Most of these things are found by low level characters and are simply a pain for a higher level to obtain as the monsters that drop them give no experience any more and it simply becomes time consuming.  As a newbie character, once you can afford not to sell these items you will be doing yourself a service later on if you can afford to just bank them until you need them.<P>
