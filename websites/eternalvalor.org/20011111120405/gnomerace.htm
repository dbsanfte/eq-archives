<p><font face="Arial" size="3">On March 4, 2001, several EV members participated in the Drunken Gnome
Race.&nbsp; The goal was to run a level 1 gnome from Ak'anon to Kelethin.&nbsp;
To make it more challenging, the participants ran under the influence of <b>a
lot</b> of alcohol and without any buffs or SOW.&nbsp; Gibberish and basic
goofiness flooded guild chat for a bit while we took a break from the worries of
Norrath.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">BTW, a few prizes and an honorable mention were awarded...<br>
1st Place: Teaken<br>
Prize: 200pp and a 10 charge SoW potion<br>
<br>
2nd Place: Vampyyr<br>
Prize: 100pp and the satisfaction of knowing that he can walk those ramps in a
drunken stupor.<br>
<br>
Honorable mention for being the final gnome to finish the race to: Audam<br>
Prize: 50pp, the Title of &quot;The Little Gnome Who Wouldn't Quit&quot; and 20
bottles of mead so he can practice.</font></p>
