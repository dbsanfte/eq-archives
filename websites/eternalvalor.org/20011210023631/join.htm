<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Thank you for visiting the Eternal Valor web
site...we appreciate your interest in our guild!</font><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
<br>
<b>Who is Eternal Valor?<br>
</b>Eternal Valor started off in August 1999 by a small group of real life
friends.&nbsp; As many of us traveled the lands of Norrath, we met new people,
made new friends and our guild continued to grow.&nbsp; All members of EV strive
to act maturely, respect others and value honor, friendship and fun over
greed.&nbsp; With this in mind, we are selective on who we invite into our
family of friends.<br>
<br>
We have grown into a guild of real life and virtual friends.&nbsp; We care about
each other's accomplishments or problems in game and do our best to help where
we can.&nbsp; Some members like to roleplay and ham it up every chance they get
while others don't.&nbsp; Some are chatty while others are more quiet.&nbsp;
Some love to adventure, some love to quest.&nbsp; We're all different, but
there's one thing in common...the desire to make EV the best guild possible!<br>
