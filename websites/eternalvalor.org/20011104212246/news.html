On June 22, 2001, Eternal Valor decided to go our separate ways.&nbsp; EV had
accomplished a lot in almost the two years we were together and we should all be
proud of that!&nbsp; The message board will remain up until July 31, 2001 in
case former EV members wanted a common forum to communicate in.&nbsp; The
calendar will stay up until July 1, 2001.&nbsp; Good luck to all in Norrath!<br>
