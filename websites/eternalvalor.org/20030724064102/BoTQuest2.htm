Information (continued)</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial">Once you collect all six items, proceed to <a href="http://www.eternalvalor.org/AskrTheLost.htm">Askr
the Lost</a> who is located near the PoS zone out (n1200 n2500).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">You say, 'Hail, Askr the Lost'</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"> Askr looks up at you and when he does, you take note of the scraggly beard on his weather-worn face; the scent of ale
permeates your senses and pushes you to look away slightly. In an apparent drunken stupor, Askr begins to speak with surprising clarity. 'Here to wash
the windows and clean the flooring, are you? No? Well, you can't be much help then. And the likes of you obviously wouldn't be able to get rid of the
massive problem we're having. Bah, says I. You can help me no more than any of these other vagrants. Leave me alone to my ale and my misery.'</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">You say, 'What massive problem?'</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Askr points drunkenly towards the exit of the cave. 'Have you not seen the foul denizens of destruction outside?
Hrmph! Going everywhere they please, pillaging, plundering. . . I'm lucky to have
survived this long. Bah, it doesn't matter, there's nothing that anyone can do to stop them, and that is why I'm still stuck here with my *hic*
potions.'</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial">---HAND IN THE STORM GIANT HEAD TO ASKR--- (Note: he
will return the head to you, so don't panic)</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The drunken stupor that Askr had been in earlier appears to vanish in an instant; a glimmer of hope now flashes in the depths
of his eyes. 'This is the head of a giant. . . a storm giant from outside the caves.' Askr ponders what this revelation could mean. He mutters to
himself, 'If it is possible that someone has indeed bested a giant here in the planes, then perhaps it is possible. . .' He looks back at you very
sternly and asks, 'Tell me now and be truthful, was it you who severed the head of this giant from his body?'</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"> You gain experience!!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">You say, 'It was me'</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Askr the Lost says 'Truly, I am amazed that someone of your caliber was able to do what I could not. I have been stuck
in these desolate caves for so long, I had almost lost hope that I would ever find a way to get rid of those accursed giants. But you. . .  you have
been able to best at least one of them. It is reasonable to suggest that if you are able to dispatch one, you may be able to dispatch others. I need to
know for sure if you are as capable an individual as it appears you are. This is very important, so are you paying attention?'</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">You say, 'Yes, I am paying attention'</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"> Askr the Lost says 'This place was once beautiful and serene, with the great Karana's showers falling day and night soothing
the lands and the creatures that inhabit it. Alas, there was an invasion of a superior force -- the storm giants which you have encountered. They laid
waste to the lands, burned down trees, and have caused so much havoc I don't even know what is to become of it. Originally, they came as one group and
crossed the breadth of the land pillaging and plundering all that they could find. Over time, though, they grew apart and distinct factions grew around
Mount Grenidor.' [continue]</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"> You say, 'continue'</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"> Askr the Lost says 'To the south of Grenidor lay Srerendi, Shores of the Lost and the Srerendi storm giants. Born of the
ocean and the cool air, they lay claim to the shores and the plains inland as their own. To the west of Grenidor lay Krendic, Sands of Chaos and the
Krendic storm giants. They have skin that is thick as dirt and blend in well with their surroundings. To the north of the great mount lay Kelek`Vor, the
Forest of Tears and the Kelek`Vor storm giants. They are born of the wood and take great pleasure in seeing it used to their own purposes.' [continue]</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;You say, 'continue'</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Askr the Lost says 'I must know if you are truly capable of defeating the storm giants that abound here. To do this, you must
slay one of each of the three factions and return to me something specific to each tribe: from the Srerendi storm giants, return their shorn beard;
from the Krendic storm giants, a piece of their rocky carcass; from the Kelek`Vor storm giants, the crest from their warrior garments. These three
items will ensure that you indeed do have the ability to defeat the foul denizens that have seized control of these lands. When you have acquired the
three of these items, seal them in this bag and return them to me, so that I know that you are indeed capable of fulfilling a hero's destiny.'</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial">---AT THIS POINT, ASKR WILL GIVE YOU <a href="http://www.eternalvalor.org/AskrsBag.htm">A
