<p><b><font face="Arial">---PUT THE 3 ITEMS FROM THE GIANTS (ie: A Storm Satuur
Sash, A Storm Taarid Bone and A Storm Volaas Beard) INTO THIS POUCH AND HIT THE
COMBINE BUTTON TO CREATE ASKR'S SEALED BAG OF VERITY---</font></b></p>

new!</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial">---HAND THE ASKR'S SEALED BAG OF VERITY TO ASKR THE
LOST---</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Askr looks over the remnants of the storm giants in his hands then looks up at you with a glimmer of hope in his eyes. 'Then
it's true! You have the means to push back the scourge of giants. . . you must go forth to the Bastion of Thunder and finish there what you have
started here. It is imperative that you clear the forces of giants from the Bastion so that order can be restored to the thunderous reaches beyond.'</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">You have received a character flag!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">You gain experience!!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">You say, 'What Bastion of Thunder?'</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Askr the Lost says 'To be honest, I cannot say that it is entirely possible, what with the ferocity of the giants and their
reluctance to leave the lands they now inhabit. From what I do know, each of the Leaders of each tribe has one piece to allow entrance into the Bastion
of Thunder. When two of these pieces are combined, they form an esoteric medallion that allows instant passage to the thunderous plains beyond. If
you can find and seal two pieces of the medallion in this bag, I will be able to forge them into the medallion that will help you on your journey.'</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial">---AT THIS POINT, ASKR WILL GIVE YOU <a href="http://www.eternalvalor.org/AskrsBag.htm">ANOTHER
4 SLOT NO DROP POUCH</a>, SO BE SURE TO HAVE A FULL INVENTORY SLOT OPEN---</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial">---PUT THE 2 ESOTERIC MEDALLIONS INTO THE POUCH AND HIT
THE COMBINE BUTTON TO CREATE AN ESOTERIC MELD---</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Arial">You have fashioned the items together to create something new!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>---HAND THE ESOTERIC MELD TO ASKR THE LOST---</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The mystical medallion given to you by Askr settles around your neck and then disappears into nothingness. There is no
call for alarm, for the medallion is now a part of your soul.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Askr the Lost says 'You have retrieved the pieces! You are well on your way to pushing forth on your quest to return
balance to the plains of thunder. The most difficult part lies before you. . . deep in the heart of Mount Grenidor, there is a tempest that rages on
eternally. It is there that you must present your medallion to the skies above to be transported to the citadel of thunderous might. Take the
medallion and go forth, then deliver these storm giants to their creator!'</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">You have received a character flag!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">You gain experience!!</font></p>
