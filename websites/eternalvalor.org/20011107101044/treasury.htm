<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><font face="Arial"><b>Guild Treasury
Guidelines (revised April 14, 2001)</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">1) The guild treasury is managed by Kina
and Souleach.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Both have alts that
can hold items and monies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Kina's
alt is Munnypenny and she is located in Freeport.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Souleach's at is Dabnk and he is located in Kunark.&nbsp; In addition,
Draygar has two alts (Runesandpages and Researchone) in Freeport that hold
various words, pages and runes.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">2) Donations to the guild treasury
(money and items) are appreciated, but voluntary for the most part.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The only time that money will be required is when plane raids are
scheduled and special items need to be purchased (ie: coffins, gems for hate
teleport, etc).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The amount for
these special items will be split among the guild members attending the raid and
will probably vary from 50-75 plat each per raid.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">3) A list of items in the treasury will
be updated as new items are received.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The list will be posted under the &quot;Guild Treasury&quot; forum on our
message board at <a href="http://pub8.ezboard.com/beternalvalor66674">http://pub8.ezboard.com/beternalvalor66674</a>
and each member is responsible for reviewing the list
frequently.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If you see an item you
would like, please make an immediate post to &quot;claim&quot; the item.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span><b>First come, first served.</b><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"><b> </b> </span>Please
make arrangements with Draygar, Kina or Souleach to pick up the item.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">4) Members agree that items obtained
from the treasury are for use by you or one of your alts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Members also agree never to sell or give away these items without prior
consent from Kina or Souleach.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Members
will return items to the treasury when they have found a suitable upgrade.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">5) In order to make sure there is room
in the treasury for new incoming items, items that remain idle in the treasury
for an extended period of time will be sold and all monies returned to the
treasury.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Items ready for sale will
be noted as such on the weekly treasury list.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Those items worth less than 50 plat will be sold to vendors or the
general public on a monthly basis.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Those
items worth less that 250 plat will be sold to vendors or the general public
every two months.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Those items worth
more than 250 plat will be kept for four months then auctioned.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Binnin has volunteered to auction the items in EC.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Again, all monies obtained from selling these items will be put back into
the treasury.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">6) Please contact Kina or Souleach with
any questions regarding the guild treasury.</font></p>
