Erudite Magician
<BR><BR><BR><BR>

Fanir grew up as an only child on the island of Odus. He was born into a noble 
   family, with his father on the palace council. His father, Klanir, and his 
   family were highly respected in Erudin as his father was one of the islands more 
   respected scholars on the magical arts, specializing in conjuration. Fanir's 
   mother was a jeweler and created some of the most exquisite jewelry on the 
   island. Some of her magical jewelry have been seen as far off as Faydark. 
   As most Erudites are not very physical, so to was Fanir much stronger in the 
   mind than body. Ever since he was young, his father had taught him the skills 
   of the magi, while his mother was teaching him the art of jewelry making. He 
   always did well with the jewelry, but absolutely loved the mystical arts. 
   When Fanir was fifteen years old, he was practicing his bandage skills with the 
   knights when one of the guards rushed into the courtyard screaming that there 
   was a gathering of Heretics in the Toxxulia forest. They had ambushed the 
   diplomatic party that was sent out to try and improve relations between the 
   Erudites and the Kerrans. Heretic attacks were not that uncommon, however his 
   mother and father happened to be with this party. He leapt up and ran with the 
   rest of the group, which entailed a few paladins and other men and women who 
   have dedicated their lives to the mystical arts. When the party finally arrived 
   at the ambush site, the area had been torn asunder. There were animal carcasses 
   and shattered carts everywhere. Blood was drenched into the ground and 
   splattered on the trees. An eerie silence drew in upon the group as they 
   noticed that all the bodies were gone. They had been dragged off by the 
   Heretics, most likely for use in their necromantic arts. 
   Fanir was devastated during this time and spent every waking moment either 
   practicing his art, waiting for the day he could get his hands on an evil mage, 
   or drowning his pain at the tavern. The Palace started a massive hunt for any 
   of these evil mages and placed a large ransom for any proof that someone was 
   practicing the evil art of necromancy. After about a year had gone by, the 
   palace had found one of the Heretics gathering places in the Toxxulia forest. 
   The palace attacked the area in force. Fanir was with this group, very eager to 
   exact some revenge on the people who tore his parents from him. 
   The battle was large, and bloody. The necromancers were outnumbered and 
   surprised and the gods seemed to favor the palace army that day. During the 
   battle, Fanir had just finished off an animated pile of bones, when he noticed a 
   fresher zombie looking figure stumbling toward him and felt his skin turn to 
   fire as it attacked him. He immediately started to recite the spell fresh in 
   his mind to counter the attack. A brutal fight ensued and was mixed with 
   hand-to-hand combat and mystical energies. It was this time that Fanir 
   recognized a ring on the zombie's hand as one that his mother had made and given 
   to his father on their 25th anniversary. He went numb as he realized this THING 
   was his dead father. His shock almost cost him dearly as he froze and opened 
   himself up to attack by the creature. In a last vain effort, he channeled all 
   his remaining energy and burned the creature to ash where it stood. 
   Fanir entered a period of anguish and pain and developed a new level of hatred 
   for the Heretics. He finally turned to religion and started to follow the way 
   of Quellious. He worked through his veil of pain and hatred and found an inner 
   peace in helping others. He started to volunteer everywhere he could, from 
   helping to bandage the knights, to feeding the poor, and even helping younger 
   mages with their arts. He found peace in himself and feels that the best way to 
   honor his parents, is to pass on the values that they have instilled into him. 
   He continues practicing his jewelry skills, his medic skills, and the mystical 
   arts. To the core of his being, however, he still has a burning hatred for evil 
   and any practitioners of the dark arts.
