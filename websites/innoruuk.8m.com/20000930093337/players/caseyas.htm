High Elf Paladin
<BR><BR><BR><BR>

Caseyas Oberonx was born in the HighElf 
    inhabited city of Felwithe. Being an adventurous little lad, at a very early 
    age, Caseyas was allowed by his parents to adventure just outside the gates 
    and scarp with any of the small creatures he came upon. A love of battle as 
    acquired quickly. As time passed Caseyas ventured forth into the vast and 
    confusing forrest of Greater Faydark. Finding himself lost quite often he 
    discovered many treasures and dangers. From the tree-top city of Kelethin, to 
    the many Orc camps scattered throughout the land.Many of these locations were 
    frequently visited by the still maturing young elf. Spying on and raiding Orc 
    camps became a 
    favorite activity of Caseyas, doing this almost every day. Yet little did he 
    know that this small personal tradition would, one day, save his life. On a 
    fresh moring, unlike any other, Caseyas decided to take a quick trip to Kelethin 
    and then be off to a rather large Orc camp near one of the city's main lifts. 
    Upon his arival to Kelethin he noticed that the city was in an abormally high 
    bustle, yet no one would inform him of the problem. Caseyas pushed this oddity 
    out of 
    his mind for the moment, for he had better things to do. He grabed a small amout 
    of food and a new pair of boots and was on his way to the camp, yet when he got 
    there he found it deserted. Caseyas was confused by this, there were always Orcs 
    at the camp. Then he remembered the way the residents of Kelethin were acting, 
    and in no-time he returned to Kelethin, but his questions were still left 
    unanswered. By this time it had become very late in the evening so Caseyas 
    decided to go 
    home to sleep. Still far off from Felwithe, the young elf noticed huge flames 
    and smoke billowing high above the city. Running for all his worth he finally 
    arrived to find that the city had been attacked by a large Orc army and, to his 
    dismay, his father had been slaughtered in the frantic defense of their home. He 
    quickly learned that many of the women, one of whom being 
    his mother, had been abductedand a small party was being rounded up to retrieve 
    them. This action proved to be futile, for not only had the women been 
    sacrificed but, the group had been quickly overwhelmed by the enemy forces. The 
    call for retreat fell of deaf ears and the High Elves were killed one by one. 
    Caseyas knew his death would do no good to anyone but the Orcs so he decided to 
    withdraw from the battle. Knowing that there was no longer anything left for him 
    in Felwithe Caseyas gathered whatever he could; food, money, and things he had 
    gathered on his journeys (including a Minotaur ax and his father's kite shield) 
    and left the land of Greater Faydark, vowing never to return. Caseyas currently 
    resides in the Great Human city of Freeport where he has 
    devoted his life to the destruction of the evil forces that plague the land. As 
    a paladin he will help all who call his name.
