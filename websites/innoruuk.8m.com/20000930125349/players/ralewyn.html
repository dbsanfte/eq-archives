Dwarven Rogue
<BR><BR><BR><BR>

My mother died as I was born, and my father died shortly after on a drunken quest to kill Corflunk the ogre. I was an orphan, but fortunately a friend o' me father's decided to take me in. He ran a small pub in Kaladim, where I aquired me last name of Kegkiller, 'cause when the night was through he'd let me finish off the keg. It was also at this time when I decided to become a thief. A large man walked into the pub, he wasn't a dwarf, but he had a look about him that screamed rich. He had two escorts, and from the looks of it they were all high elves. Probably an ambassador, stopping in at the pub afore speakin with Kazon Stormhammer, our king. Anyway, a shady lookin dwarf walked into the bar and walked past one of the high elf guards. It was then that I noticed him slip his hand into the guard's pocket and pull out three or four platinum pieces. Unfortunately the guard saw him and chased him out of the pub. I followed and watched as another dwarf jumped out from the shadows and stabbed the unsuspecting high elf sguare in the back. The high elf ambassador and other guard stood back in disbelief. The ambassador looked at his other escort sharply, and the paladin shook from his startled sight to attack the new rogue. (I learned latter that there are no high elf warriors and that they substitute their warriors with paladins)As the other high elf guard drew his blade on the dwarf that had stabbed his friend, the original rogue had worked his way around this high elf and stabbed his spear into the elf's back, directly between the shoulder blades. I heard strange words and turned to see the ambassador casting a spell. The fireball shot forth and smashed into the original rogue, but the rogue (bein a dwarf an' all) managed to resist the spell's magical fire. The ambassador stopped his casting, smiled and went back into the pub, an that awesome display of teamwork motivated me to be the very best rogue, not to mention the platinum they had taken afore hand. Unfortunately, the king looked down upon the murder of the two high elves and after one of the thieves was caught he was quickly executed. This taught me a lesson I live by even today...Don't Get Caught.
