Half Elf Bard
<BR><BR><BR><BR>


Tenil is a quiet lad who grew up among the coastline villages upon Odus. His mother was his only companion, after being told his father died years before. Caea, his mother, revealed little more about their past, and just that they had had to leave their homeland at Tenil’s birth.
<BR><BR>
Many times during his youth, Tenil would notice his mother was not about, and no one had seen her for hours, occasionally even days. He spent much of his spare time, as such, alone and in deep thought. He developed a habit of talking to himself, or singing, or just whistling so he didn’t seem so alone. He also swam a lot among the ocean’s waves, as he had an unnatural affinity for the ocean and most bodies of water.
<BR><BR>
Truth is, his mother was one of the elusive Sea Elves who have no chronicled history of even existing. She bore a child from an Erudite man, and was sent from her home in disgrace. However she needed to spend at least 5 or six hours a day in the water, or else she’d die. This is what prompted Tenil’s lonely existence.
<BR><BR>
When Tenil came of age, he learned the truth about his mother, and his mixed heritage. Ashamed that he couldn’t be told this himself, and instead needed to pry it from his mother’s drunken lips, he set off immediately through the Toxxulia Forest for Erudin, in search of his father. His mother was soon behind him.
<BR><BR>
No one exactly knows what happened within that elusive city of the Erudites, but Tenil left the city alone, with a deep resentment for all of Odus..
<BR><BR>
He arrived in Qeynos several days later, with just the clothes on his back, and no skill to get him any money or shelter. For a time he tried to solicit his body, but that too was to no avail, as he could not subjugate himself to such lecherous actions, even with the burning hunger in his stomach.
<BR><BR>
Eventually, he met a ranger from Surefall Glade, whom he had an unshakable connection too. The ranger, Siorin Sharkbane, like Tenil, was a half elf, half of which was sea elf. The two felt like long lost brothers, and in no time, Tenil was moving to Surefall Glade to take up studies with his newfound companion.
<BR><BR>
His love, however, was not in nature or hunting, but rather in his one time hobby of singing. Any form of musical accoutrement was magical to him, and he longed to be heralded a famous singer like the Bards of Antonica. He even once caught a showing of Daylar de'Otaros within Freeport, while on some official business for Siorin.
<BR><BR>
This love one day brought him away from the Glade, and back into Qeynos. He met with several of the bards within the Wind Spirit’s Song, and decided he would join them. With a quick letter back to Siorin, he has decided to stay within Qeynos to pursue his newfound career.
