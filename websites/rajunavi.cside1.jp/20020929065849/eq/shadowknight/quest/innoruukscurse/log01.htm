<P>Kurron Ni says 'Out of my way, stranger,
I am on a delicate mission. Interfere with
my search and I shall relieve you of your
head! Bother me no more. '</P>
<P class="say">You say, 'What do you seek?'</P>
<P>Kurron Ni says 'I have traveled here in hopes
of finding a soul worthy of assisting me
in completing my mission. '</P>
<P class="say">You say, 'I am worthy'</P>
<P>Kurron Ni says 'I doubt it, but I have been
wrong before. Before I share with you the
details of my mission, however, you must
first prove your worthiness. Agreed? '</P>
<P class="say">You say, 'Agreed'</P>
<P>Kurron Ni says 'Very well then, my new friend.
I have an acquaintance that stands in need
of three pieces of Darkforge Armor. He requires
the breast, greaves and helm to complete
his set. I also must pay back a loan that
has come due in the amount of 900 platinum.
Return this to me and I shall share with
you my dark mission, and the immeasurable
reward that will be earned at its completion.
Show your face here without fulfilling my
request and I will offer you on the altar
to Innoruuk himself. Be off! '</P>
<P class="supplement">・ Darkforge Breastplate, Greaves, Helm,
900pp を渡す。</P>
<P>Kurron Ni says 'Well done, Rajuna, I honestly
didn't expect to see you again. Yes, yes,
this is perfect! My mission is nearly complete!
'</P>
<P>Your faction standing with Truespirit got
better.</P>
<P class="say">You say, 'What mission?'</P>
<P>Kurron Ni says 'My mission was to find a
pathetic shadowknight and bring him closer
to Innoruuk. You volunteered. By exercising
my superior powers of persuasion, I have
now taken from you a fine suit of armor and
enough coin to ensure that I will be sleeping
neither soberly nor alone for quite some
time! Now I ask you, worthy shadowknight,
do you not feel the fires of hatred coursing
through your veins like never before? That
is the very reward I spoke of! You have been
brought closer to my master. My mission is
complete! You foolish excuse for a dark knight,
I shall take your head and tell all of your
generous donation to the mighty Teir'Dal
rogues! '</P>
