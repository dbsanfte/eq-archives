<font size="+1" face="comic sans ms">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ohoh! So you feel that you are ready to undertake the next test of your 
knighthood!  This is indeed a great task and you should be level 15 - 20 to 
complete it.  It is best to take a friend or group at this level.  
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approach Lord Gikzic once again and ask him, "What greater concern?"  He will 
give you a page of a tome that was stolen by despicable froglok raiders.  
You must collect the other 9 pages and the tome itself to pass this test.  
Proceed to the Swamp of No Hope, make a left at the swamp itself and follow 
the road until it ends.  Go up the hill and camp at the small ruined house 
there.  If you face forward you will see an Iksar bandit camp.  Your are yet 
too young to handle them, but soon they will feel the bite of your sword.  
During the daylight hours kill any monster that you can handle, this will 
ensure a large spawning of the hated froglok raiders.  When night falls, if 
you have killed sufficient roamers, you should see a good 3 or 4 frogloks 
per night.  Now the pages are lore, so you will have more trouble getting 
the last couple, stay strong.  You should have 8 lore pages, 1 no drop page, 
and 1 no drop AND lore page, this is the correct combination to place in the 
tome and combine for the full tome.  Take the tome and the Knave's khukri 
back to Lord Gikzic and he will reward you with a Squire's Khukri,  indeed a 
great weapon for a young Shadowknight..
