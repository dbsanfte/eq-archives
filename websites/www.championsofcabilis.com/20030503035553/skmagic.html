<font size=3 color=yellow face="Comic Sans MS">
<br>Harm Touch
<br>&nbsp; To dispell some misconceptions of Shadow Knights, Your soul
is your sword (or mace, or in Ashikaga Daikoku's case a spear) Not your
spells, your spells act as a force multiplier, increasing what we can do,
but not being our life. This includes the holy grail of Shadow Knight misconceptions,
Harm touch. You will find that HT is an enabler, enables you to hunt further
out, try that slightly tougher MOB, cut the downtime, the deaths or the
mad train to the zone on a bad pull. As opposed to Many Shadow Knights,
the Ashikaga-Ryu teaches one to learn to recognise situations where your
HT may be needed, and use it early on. Very rarely (only to save the life
of a groupmate) will you want to kill with HT. Hit it early, the MOB will
flee/die sooner, causing you and yours less pain.
