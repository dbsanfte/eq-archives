<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI> <b>Happy Halloween my brethren! Today is a day of much sadness for the Champions of Cabilis.  Longtime member Belfior has decided that he will better serve the cause of Cazic in a new guild.  You can read his farewell post on the message board. He is one of the oldest Champions and we shall surely miss him. He will remain our ally of course and still has much respect for our cause.  Send him a tell if there are no Champions to aid you.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; On a positive note I started working on the LINKS page. Added some new links and changed the look of it. Still got plenty more to add but there's some good ones there. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;  In other news Hempire, Bhayne and myself have learned of the evil Skorpiki. They are half Iksar/half Scorpion. Excellent experience for those in their 30's. They reside in The Overthere. Kilanak and myself also did some scouting of Trakanon's teeth, that looks like it has a lot of potential. Be safe Champions.<br></b></font>

<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><B><LI>  Gather round Champions for there is much to tell.  You may have smelt the foul scent of Barbarians, Humans, and Elves in our lands recently. Not the usual stench we have become accustomed to but a new more foul odour. It's the smell of treachery.  We have received word that The 7th Legion have been plotting an attack on our fair city of Cabilis.  This has been prophesized and now is the time for us to prove our faith in our lord Cazic-Thule and our worth to the citizens of Cabilis.  Our messangers have delivered to us two messages from Fortenbras, this so-called leader of the fleshy ones. He indeed means to cause a war on our lands and he shall indeed have it! His foul messages are found on the forums link, please read them and comment.</b></font><br>

<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><B><LI>Did some work on the forums today as Tipsy was gracious enough to give me full access to them. Their look is a lot more in line with the rest of the page now, I think it looks a lot better. Added DrPain, Uona, Milik, and Sokrank to the members page. We are growing a little too quickly I think so I will be updating the recruiting criteria with the officers via the officers link in the forums, if you don't have the password and you should then ask me or a fellow officer.</b><br></font>

<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><B><LI>Changed the font on the front page today. Still not sure if I like it so let me know your opinions on the forums.  Added Kilanak's brother Keya to the members list too. The poll on when to hold guild events is producing some interesting results, basically that we all have different schedules. We're going to have to hold some separate events for the weeknight and weekend warriors, respectively.  Lets start brainstorming on some new events now.</b><br></font>

<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><B><LI>Continued learning some advanced HTML tricks today, check out my funky new buttons to our links.  Also there's a poll up on the forum page, please respond to it, it's about when the best time for guild events is, let's have some input.</b><br></font>

<font size="3" face="comic sans ms" ><B><LI>Today was a day that will stick in the memory of those hated half-breeds-The Sarnaks, for time.  Although we had a small number of Champions turn up to raid the Sarnak fort, those who came showed their courage and strength and our task was accomplished.  Seven Champions went into the Sarnak Fortess, I believe only 3 came out without giving their lives.  We had some help from an elf friendly to our cause. I guess all elves aren't so evil! After killing countless Sarnaks we took on the Chancellor of Di'zok himself. He was immediately aided by a see of lesser Sarnaks which made it difficult to wade through. Fortunately we had the strength of Belfior and Hempire dealing damage to him and he went down. Unfortunately he didn't drop the Jade Chokdai Prod :( Afterward there was some good dueling (Hemp and I dueled to a draw after my pet turned on me). Then it was prize time. A Foremans Tunic, Lumberjack Cap, Iksar Stave, Sarnak Emblazoned Tabard, and a few other nice items were given away. For those who couldn't make it, you missed out. Time to start planning our next event, toss your ideas on the forums.</b></font><br>

<font size="3" face="comic sans ms" ><B><LI>Congratulations to Bhayne. He became our newest officer today. I've noticed that we had no Necro officers and Bhayne has been very dedicated since joining.  Added Reptilo's member profile to the member page today too.  Today marked the 2000th hit on this page which is very impressive, the site had about 1200 when I took over so we are getting lots of hits.</b><br></font>
<font size="3" color="white" face="courier new" ><B>  Wednesday October 18th,2000</b><br></font>
<font size="3" face="comic sans ms" ><B><LI>Added Sslar, Sabassis, Rizzlas, Rarsi, and Robinshan to the members list today bringing our numbers up to 63! This is an amazing amount of members we have now and I'm very proud of you all for that. Hopefully we'll get a good turnout this Saturday considering our numbers.</b></font><br>  
<font size="3" color="white" face="courier new" ><B>  Monday October 16th,2000</b><br></font>
<font size="3" face="comic sans ms" ><B><LI>It has been confirmed. This Saturday at 11AM PST/2PM EST The Champions will raid the Sarnak Fort. Our mission: To kill the chancellor, a lvl 40 Shaman who resides there.  Only the bravest Champions need to apply for this mission. Lower levels will provide support by keeping the entrances clear of Sarnaks.  Afterwards some of Sasraaz's special brew and a prize or two.</b></font><br>
<font size="3" color="white" face="courier new" ><B>  Thursday October 12th,2000</b><br></font>
<font size="3" face="comic sans ms" ><B><LI>Added a new news function today, click on archives to see older news, that way you don't have to load all the old news everytime you come to the page.  Also added a few more members and a couple new pics on the pics page.  There are a couple of ideas floating around for the next guild event. One is a raid on the Sarnak Fort, the other a journey to the Commonlands to kill human guards.  Post your opinions on the forum link</b></font><br>

<font size="3" face="comic sans ms" ><B><LI>Updated the look of the site today.  Ishy provided an excellent new graphic and I changed the background color to black to accomodate that.  How's it look? Everyone like it? Let me know. Also keep the profile pics coming in and I'll put em asap.  If you're not on the members list tell me that too and I'll add you.</b></font><br>
<font size="3" color="white" face="courier new" ><B>  Tuesday October 10th,2000</b><br></font>
<font size="3" face="comic sans ms" ><B><LI>Congratulations to Hempire on becoming an officer today. Go Hempman!  Added a back story on the about link today as well as made my name linkable on the members site.  Ishy sent me a new logo today, with a bit of work it may be up tomorrow.</b></font><br> 
<font size="3" color="white" face="courier new" ><B>  Saturday October 7th,2000</b><br></font>
<font size="3" face="comic sans ms" ><B><LI>Today was a glorious day for the Champions. We raided Kurn's Tower and what a great event it was.  There were about 15 of us ranging in level from 10-41, the poor residents of kurns didn't stand a chance.  We cut a swift path through the Burynai and Skeletons in our way.  There were only 3 casualties in Chrom Sebthak and Jadescale but bodies were recovered.  Afterwards there was a great festival that I unfortunately had to miss. Much drunken fighting and prizes giveaways took place.  Our reputation grew and our ranks swelled by about 8 new members.  Thinks will only get better.</b></font><br>

<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><B><LI> Last night saw Ishy, Hempire, Sasraaz and Cradossk fighting some strange new ghosts and skeletons on the Field Of Bone beach. Could be worth checking out tomorrow at the guild event.  Reminder Tomorrow at 11AM PST and 2PM EST we are raiding Kurn's Tower, don't miss out all are welcome.</b></font><br>
