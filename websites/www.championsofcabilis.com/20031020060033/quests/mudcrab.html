<font size="+1" face="comic sans ms">Hail Hierophant Oxyn in the Shaman Guild. He will ask you about completing tasks for him. 
Ask him further and he will hand you a Component Mortar and asks you to fill it with two Small Mosquito Wings, one Bone Chips, and foraged Mud Crabs.  The wings can be found easily in the area close to Cabilis in the swamp zone.  The Bone Chips drop from any skelly, fight in The Field of Bone to get one at that level. The mud crabs are a very rare forage in The Lake of Ill Omen. You don't have to be actually at the lake itself, just in the zone. I have foraged these in all kinds of locations.  Be careful when you get mud crabs because if you have no food you will eat your mud crabs like a hungry Iksar would.  Combine the items in the mortar and hand in the new mortar.  You get some xp, faction and a few copper, along with some Cursed Wafers. At this point you will learn of the Scaled Mystic Armour quests and be directed to them. This is not necessary to complete for either the armour or cudgel upgrades but can be fun to do as a newbie.</font>
