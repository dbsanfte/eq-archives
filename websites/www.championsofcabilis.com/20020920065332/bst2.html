<font size="3" face="comic sans ms">After turning in the four Leech Husks to Prime Patriarch Vuzx and gaining your reward, he says the following....... 
<p></p>
      Prime Patriarch Vuzx says, ' Well done young patriarch! I believe you are ready to face large nuisances that prowl outside our city walls. Head out to the Field of Bone and return to me bearing three Spiderling Silks and a Scarab Carapace.' 
<p></p>
      Scarab Carapaces can drop off the two types of bettle hatchlings (lvl 2 to 4 ) which scuttle all over the FoB zone. The spiderling silks drop off the Bonecrawler and Bonebinder Hatchlings ( lvl 3 to 5 ) which also scuttle all over the FoB zone. The Bonebinder Warrens which is located off to the left of the Cabilis Gate in the grassy area is a great place to find these spiderlings. 
<p></p>
      Turn in the Scarab Carapace and the 3 Spilderling Silks and you gain better faction with Scaled Mystics and the Legion of Cabilis, Xps, and the Patriarch's Cap ( AC 4, Sta + 1)
