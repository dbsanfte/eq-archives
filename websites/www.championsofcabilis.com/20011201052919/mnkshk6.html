<font size="+1" face="comic sans ms">This quest originates in Cabilis, but has more involvement with "an Iksar
master" in the Timorous Deep.<br><br>
In order to initiate the quest, go to Master Niska (in Cabilis, located near
Master Glox) and state that "I will be your personal courier." She will hand
you a Tin Box which weighs 8 pounds, and request that you take it to Master
Rinmark, who in fact identifies as "an iksar master." Master Rinmark is
located on the chess-board island in the Timorous Deep. He stands meditating
atop a mountain peak on the island (you should have no problem finding him
as the island is quite small).<br>
Once the Tin Box is handed in to "an iksar master" (Master Rinmark) the
following reaction will be triggered:<br>
"An Iksar master opens the box to reveal a variety of pebbles. How grand!!
My pebbles!! Now I can continue with my rock garden!! Would you please
[assist old Rinmark in completing this rock garden]?"
You say : "I will assist old Rinmark in completing his rock garden"
"An iksar master pours the pebbles from the box into his pocket and hands it
to you. Take my box, Fill and combine within my box the following: a Radiant
Meteorite, Frontier Fools Gold, Petrified Redwood, Rile's Sand Coin, Sulfur
Stone, Fragment of Tektite, Plains Pebble, Jade Magma, Heart of Ice and an
Unholy Coldstone. Return the Full Tin Box to me and I shall reward you with
a Shackle of Bronze."<br><br>
The components are easy. This will probably be one of the most tedious and
boring quests you will ever do.<br><br>
Radiant Meteorite - Foraged in the Burning Woods.  This item is not no
drop so anyone can do this and give it to you.<br><br>
Frontier Fools Gold - There are indeed 2 different forageable gold
nuggets. Our desired nugget is will identify as Frontier Fools Gold. The one
we DON'T want and WILL NOT combine in the box is Genuine Gold Nugget.   A
good way to check is to try to sell it.  If it sells then it’s the wrong
one.<br>
<br>Petrified Redwood - Foraged in  Warsliks Woods.  This item is not no drop
so anyone can do this and give it to you.<br><br>
        Rile's Sand Coin - Forage in the Timorous Deep.  This item is No Drop.<br><br>
        Sulfur Stone - These drop from Drolvarg Scavengers. Scavengers can be
found roaming the middle of the zone. Walk straight outwards once you zone
in from Lake of Ill Omen. They're really known as "Scarlet Stones," but with
the identify spell these are indeed Sulfur Stones. <br><br>
        Fragment of Tektite - Pick up 2 carnelian gems. Grab a friend to cast the
invisibility spell on you, or buy an invisibility potion in west cabilis. At
the entrance to the evil outpost (coming in from overthere) you will see two
gargoyles. Run into the tunnel with invisibility and at the other end of the
tunnel will appear two more gargoyles, with one of having the name
"Tektite." He wants a replacement for his eyes, and seeks two Carnelian
gems. Run up behind him, feign, and hit sneak until it works. Get back up
(DO NOT HAIL HIM) and hand him the two gems in separate slots. You will
receive a piece of "Tektite." <br><br>
        Plains Pebble - Foraged in any of the Karanas.  This item is not no drop.<br><br>
        Jade Magma - Kill burynai miners in Frontier Mountains. This item is No
Drop. <br><br>
        Heart of Ice - In Lake of Ill Omen, these drop from "Ice bone skeletons"
near the lake shore. This item is No Drop. <br><br>
        Unholy Coldstone - In permafrost caverns, a goblin priest will drop them.
Priests are random common spawns deeper inside permafrost. This item is No
Drop.
