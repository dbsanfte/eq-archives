<font size="+1" face="comic sans ms">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sirtha Scarscale says 'The sarnak are a mockery of the Iksar. They are nothing more than beasts fit only to do our bidding! I require you to bring me the sword of one of their Order of Knights and the head of a sarnak berserker. These beasts have been attacking our patrols of late. I also require a stone called a ruby and a banded helm. Do this and I shall make a helm for you. 
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sarnak Knight's Sword drops off a Sarnak Knight in the Burning Woods, this is a high level zone so be careful. Knight's are by the castle or inside the castle. The Sarnak Berzerker head drops at a rate of about 1 in 4 off of Sarnak Berzerkers in Overthere or Frontier Mountain and looks like a Skull.  Hand these in with a ruby and a banded helm and you will be rewarded with a Dreadscale Helm AC 11, Int +5, Sv fire/cold/dis/poison/magic all +5
