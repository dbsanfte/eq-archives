<p>We are those that call Cabilis our home. Once a forgotten
race, we have now arisen to claim back our lost honor. With the recent
incursion into our lands by the other races, we can expect many perils
on our journeys as we venture forth into the lands...........We are:
The
Champions of Cabilis!</p>

<p>RULES:</p>

<li>The Champions of Cabilis Reside on the Nameless Server. Your
character must
be on the Nameless</li>

<li>Except
in special cases prospective members must be of the 15th rank to be
considered.</li>

<li>Obide
by Verant's 'Play Nice Rules', ie. no KSing, Ninja Looting, etc.</li>

<li>Help your brethren when they call for help, provided you are
able.</li>

<li>Conduct yourself as a 'Champion' would at all times.</li>

<li>No swearing in the guild channel, if you wanna /tell your
friends stuff like that fine, but not in the public window.</li>

<li>Share
information with your brethren, quests, strategy and so forth.</li>

<li>No begging.</li>

<li>Do not use /anon. Use /roleplay instead. You should be proud
of your guild. /roleplay allows
people to see your guild tag but not your level and class. </li>

<li>No account sharing! You were invited into the Champions
because of you, not your friend who
knows your account info. If you are showing someone the game with your
character go anon.</li>

<li>Have fun when you play !</li>

<li>We Shall only accept members of the one true strong race -
The Iksar</li>

<li>We shall try to RP in a manner that shows that we feel our
land has been
stolen and we wish it returned.
This doesn't include senseless insults to players of other races beyond
the point of good fun. Use your judgement here, if people are getting
generally pissed off then relax, apologize and move on.</li>

<li>Whenever possible we shall provide discounts on items to fellow members.
 This can be done through trade skills or surplus items.
 Overcharging a guild member is a serious crime if you are in the know when you do it.</li>
