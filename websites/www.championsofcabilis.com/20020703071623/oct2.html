<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>Happy Halloween Champions! I have taken a couple weeks off of Norrath to pursure various real life things and to play NHL 2002 of all things, damn that games addicting.  Tonight Verant has promised many GM events and happenings around Norrath so it would be a good time to log in tonight.  Congrats to Drakilen who I hear got his Robe of the Whistling Fists. Nice work man.  The new pic of the week shows the Champions of Camelot. This is a guild formed by CoC members who play Dark Age of Camelot together. Thanks to Sslarr for the pic. Game looks cool but I don't think I'll take the plunge.<br></font>

<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>A Few Raids took place this week. I wasn't at any of them so I'm not sure how they all went. I know Sabasiss picked up Scaled Hierophant Gloves on Tuesday. Congrats to him! There was a Kael raid on Wednesday and Thursday was Chardok. I did a few updates today.  Added a couple guides in the guide section. Bigole's Monk guide is up. If you know Bigole then you'll know it's his writing when you read it =p. The other guide is a Shaman guide that comes to us from Sikulik Spiritclaw of Bristlebane, a good read. I will be around tonight, hopefully we can find something to conquer.</br></font>

<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>Some good raids last week. Kael and PoG worked out well. I dinged 53 finally on the weekend which was way too long in coming. Yay me :) New pic of the week courtesy of Bhayne. It's from the what if files. What if we let softskins in CoC. Guess Bhayne had a weird graphic bug going. Pretty funny.  Updated a lot of members profiles today. My apologies in taking so long.  Welcome Hextor and Sassik as well. They are our newest members.<br></font>
<font size="3" color="white" face="courier new" >  Wednesday October 10th, 2001</b><br></font>
<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>Fairly quiet on the news front the past week.  Tonight is a raid on Kael Drakkel hosted by the newly formed Rings of Norrath which we are a part of along with the Guilds Legacy of Titans, Honor Bound, Resurrected Legends and Sisters of Deceit. This has been formed by Nalamien to help similar sized guilds do raids. So far it has been great even though it will take time to get running perfectly.  While not formally allied with these guilds we are formally in the Rings of Norrath. Treat members of those guilds as your friends :) Tomorrow is Plane of Growth with our allies Brothers of Darkness<br></font>
<font size="3" color="white" face="courier new" >  Wednesday October 3rd, 2001</b><br></font>
<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>Did a few updates today. The members page is really getting a bit out of wack. I really need new members to send me in their info and anyone who knows of anyone who is no longer with us to pass the info along. I know Jabrale retired last week. He will be missed. We could use some new guides. Written from within the guild or from other servers. The more info we can get on this page the better off those who go after us will be. Congrats to Sabassis on becoming a Mystic also. This weeks pic of the week is of Ishy and Srarnu's wedding.<br></font>
