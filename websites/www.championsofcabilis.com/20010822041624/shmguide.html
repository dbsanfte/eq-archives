Being a Shaman in a large group can sometimes be a daunting task.
Since Shaman have several different casting disciplines they can some times
take on multiple rolls when grouped with more than two or three people.
Several factors should be taken into consideration when memorizing your
spells and getting ready to assist your group when the fur starts to fly.
<p></p>
Lets take a look at what a Shaman is capable of. The first
discipline a Shaman has at his disposal is alteration. This skill allows the
Shaman to heal buff and apply spells such as regen and chloroplast and the
coveted Spirit of the wolf. One might argue that this is the most important
roll a Shaman can take in a group, after all buffs are the Shaman bread and
butter. But that isn't all a Shaman can do, many Shaman have found
themselves in the roll of primary healer ( when a cleric cant be found ) or
a mob debuffer and DOTer. These rolls require you to prepare yourself in a
completely different fashion. Lets take a look at how a Shaman might set him
self up to be as effective as possible during combat.
<p></p>
A good Shaman will need to be able to asses their group and try to
determine where they are needed most. No one looks more foolish than the
Shaman who isn't ready to apply the appropriate buff or slow the mob down so
the tanks don't get pummeled. Have you ever been watching your tanks die as
you realize that during your last down time session you forgot to memorize
the appropriate spell? How bad is it to cast regen on your tank when you
meant to cast heal? Staying focused on your group is what being a good
Shaman is all about.
<p></p>
One thing to keep in mind is that the group leader has the final say
on where you are to focus your skills. Chances are they invited you for a
reason and being pigheaded about what roll you play will only ensure you
don't get invited back. For a champion of Cabilis this is unacceptable given
the reputation we have as valuable members of any group. After asking what
the group leader requires of you begin by meming the spells that will help
you the most. Keeping in mind how large your group is and the mobs you are
hunting. Why is this important? If the tanks are pulling yellows and maybe
even reds then keep in mind that your debuff or slowing spell might not
stick right away, that red message that tells you the target resisted your
spell is something no Shaman wants to see. If you have a large group and you
are the main buffer than you may spend all of your time meditating trying to
get your mana back so that when those buffs start to fade you are right
there to keep them going strong. Lets discus a few possible rolls you might
find yourself in.
<p></p>

<b>WHEN THE SHAMAN IS THE PRIME HEALER</b>

<p></p>
When clerics and other more healing oriented classes hear that a
Shaman can be considered the main healer their first response is a snicker.
While it may be true that a cleric is the right guy for that job there is no
disputing that a well disciplined Shaman can hold a group together for quite
awhile.
<p></p>
What's the drawback to being the main healer? The first obvious
factor is mana conservation. No one can dispute that Shaman are the
undisputed kings of stat buffs, so why not have your Shaman heal and buff?
The answer is that no one has that much mana. If you are in a smaller group,
say you and two others, being the main healer and giving everyone a buff or
two might be a doable task. I guarantee you though that giving both
teammates every buff you have and trying to maintain a decent level of mana
for healing can result in tanks standing around for a long time waiting for
you to get your mana back. In later levels cannibalize in conjunction with
regen can lower med times a great deal but your still wasting valuable time
while those buffs are wasted on tanks who cant pull because you cant heal
them if the going gets tough.
<p></p>
That being said, what should you do if you want to heal your group? Lets
start at spell preparation.

<p></p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Have your highest heal on your first available hot key, keeping
the same hot keys for the same type of spells will result in        you
knowing what button to hit by instinct alone. Constantly switching hot key
set ups will make you slower and more apt to cast the wrong spell
and waste precious mana.
<p></p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. One tactic used that I agree with is the presence of a lower
level heal spell on stand by if mana is low and the fight is
coming down to the wire. This lets you get in one last hp hit to your tanks
that might save their life's. This is a matter of preference and
should be considered a suggestion only.
<p></p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. If you have cannibalize then learn the fine art of hp/mana
conversion and learn it fast. The tanks sacrifice hp during combat,
why shouldn't you? When used in conjunction with regen, cannibalize is a
Shamans best friend.
<p></p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Be at full mana at all times. Sound like a no brainer? Not
always. Keeping your nose in the book the whole night sucks, no
one can argue that fact, but its what needs to be done in order to be the
main healer.
<p></p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Be proactive. After each fight tell your group how much mana you
have. The standard format is a simple comment like "30m".
This is known to all members of the group and tells them that their healer
only has 30% mana. A smart tank will cool his heels and let you med
up, or suffer the consequences.
<p></p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. One know method of group healing is the 50% rule. The 50% rule
allows a tank to get to 50% before a healer starts to cast on him.
This is a good method because most tanks know that if they have other tanks
in the group they can back off and  conserve hp. This allows you to
retain mana in the event that you are needed to cast heal in order to save
lives you have the max mana possible.  Keep in mind that all
healers do it a little differently and this method might not sound logical
if you are used to doing it a different way.
<p></p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. There are those that will disagree with the 50% rule and state
that keeping the main tank healed up during the whole fight is      the best
way to ensure everyone survives, I agree but I have to point out that Shaman
are not always the best combat healers and that by allowing the tanks
to burn hp allows you to have mana left over during the down time right
after the fight. If teammates need to be cured of poisons or
disease than they are SOL until you med for awhile. Lets hope they have hp
to burn.
<p></p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. If the group has regen and the puling is going well then don't
waste mana on every little hp lost by the tanks, let regen do its
job. If you don't have regen then keeping the group up as healed as possible
might not be a bad idea.
<p></p>
Bottom line, watch those health meters. One error in cast time or a
heavy hitter laying the smack down on your tank might catch you by surprise
as you realize he's too far gone for you to help.
<p></p>



<b>WHEN YOU ARE THE MAIN BUFFER</b>

<p></p>
If the group is not asking you to slow the mobs or DOT them then you
get to enjoy the roll that was tailor made for Shaman, the main buffer. This
roll allows you to keep all the members buffed and if done right will allow
you to have some free time to help in the melee, actually watching a fight
instead of looking at your spell book can make the game that much more fun.
Since most of your stat buffs will be applied only to the tanks you may not
have to buff everyone in your group. There is no reason to give the cleric
in your group a strength buff or give the enchanter a stamina buff. The only
buff you will have to cast on everyone is Spirit of the wolf, most groups
ask this of you and its a good idea if things go bad.
<p></p>
So how do you keep everyone buffed and get your mana back in a
fairly quick fasion? Here's a few tips.
<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Always cast the buffs on your self and then your teammates. This
allows you to know when your tanks are going to lose        their buffs and
recast them in a quick seamless fashion that they wont even notice. A tank
should not have to worry about his buffs, not if a Shaman is on the
job.
<p></p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Try to put your buffs in the same order every time, that way you
will know which buff is fading with out waiting for it to fade or
right clicking it to see which one it is.
<p></p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Full mana and buff maintenance should come first, if you find you
are at full mana and join in the melee for a little bashing
fun then keep a close eye on your teammates. If a buff begins to fade drop
out immediately and re cast it on your group. Only return to melee
once you are at full manna and no one needs anymore buffs.

<p></p>
As you can tell being the main buffer opens it self up to more
fulfilling game play for a Shaman, like I said before, medding sucks.
<p></p>
<b>WHEN YOU ARE THE DEBUFFER AND DOTTER</b>
<p></p>
The other spell group that Shaman are given concerns debuffs and
DOTs. In a nut shell debuffers are any spell that lowers a mobs speed,
resistances, or stats. One example of a debuff is disempower, a melee debuff
that lowers an NPCs Stats so that he is weaker and cant hit for as much and
gets hit for more. Another is walking sleep, which slows a NPCs attack speed
down so he doesn't hit as often. These spells are often over looked by
Shaman and it should be noted that Shaman have some of the best spells in
the game for this task. DOTs are Damage Over Time spells like poison or
disease. These spells usually have an initial damage and then slowly rob a
NPC of hp over time. Some are designed as single target and effect only one
NPC, others are AE ( Area Effect ) and can hit a group of NPCs in a given
area.
<p></p>
DOTs are good for helping adding an extra level of hp drain so that
a NPC will be taking damage the whole time regardless of how well your tanks
are hitting or if the fight turns ugly and a few tanks need to fall back.
DOTs are used a lot by Shaman that are trying to solo and higher level
Shaman that use pets to help with melee.
<p></p>

I had considered adding a few helpful hints when soloing as a Shaman
but the topic is very broad and since your not effecting others by your
mistakes than the best strategy is to experiment with what works for you and
try to keep an open mind so you can refine your skills and make the most of
soloing.

<p></p>

As you can tell being a Shaman can be a challenging but rewarding
class to play, finding your niche in a group will take time but with
practice you will become an invaluable member of any group.
