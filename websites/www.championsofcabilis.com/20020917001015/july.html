<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>Updated a ton of member profiles. Gonna try to clean up the list again as it needs it. Cheer on Sabassis as he goes after Black Dire tonight, help him out if you can!  No events planned for the weekend so far, lets put our collective heads together for something soon.<br></font>

<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>Had a busy RL weekend so didn't get much done on the page. I managed to do some updates today though. A lot of peoples profiles were updated. As well a new guide from ever mysterious Daikoku. This time on Shadow Knight Spells. Thanks also to Cakulizi and Chulil for sending in a writeup on the 7th Necro Skullcap. They are young Iksar who hope someday to become members. They will have my blessing. I haven't played EQ for 5 days now so I'm looking forward to getting back on tonight.<br></font>

<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>Did a few updates today. Grizzlehammer sent in a great Shaman guide. A good read for any Shaman regardless of level. Amazing he knows so much at lvl 25 :) Cleaned up the members list a little. Would like new members to send in pics and profiles for that page ASAP. I added a PIC OF THE WEEK link on the front page. The first of the series is Ishy in Victory, take a look. I also added a tag on the bottom to let people know we play on the Nameless as the server scan is officially dead.  <br></font>
<font size="3" color="white" face="courier new" >  Monday  July 16th, 2001</b><br></font>
<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>Congratulations Ishy! The raid was a complete success. The Champions and a few friends were able to set up in CoM and lay some serious beats down. Raziear was the only one to die which is very impressive. Thanks to Roen for bringing him back to life. There were a couple drops while we were there too. Raziear got a MOSS which should help him out a lot since he lost all his equipment a couple months ago in a Verant bug.  Senova got a Shimmering Partisan a sweet Warrior weapon.  I'll try to get some pics up this week. Thanks to all who came out. Overall our best raid to date. <br></font>
<font size="3" color="white" face="courier new" >  Friday  July 13th, 2001</b><br></font>
<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>The anonymous Monk Shackle Quest writer emailed to tell me his identity. Thanks to Riksis Swifttail Iksar Monk of Quellious for sending that info in. Does my heart good to see Iksar across servers helping out. Reminder that this Sunday Ishy Drakos requests your attendence at his Reaver Raid in City of Mist. This is a 40 plus raid to help Ishy get the Books of Ghiosk needed for his Epic Quest. This will also put him slightly ahead of yours truly heh heh.  Time is 1:30PM PST 4:30PM EST. Figure it out if you are MST CST.<br></font>

<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>Wow 2 weeks with no updates. Am I slacking or what? I haven't been on that much over the past couple weeks is I think why I haven't done any updates. Got a bunch today though. I put the Quest Writeups for the Shackle of Steel and Scale up today. They were sent to me anonymously. Thank you whoever you were!  I also put a whole bunch of new pictures up in the pics section. More to come. I will try to get to updates every couple days but it's sooo nice out this summer it makes it hard.<br></font>
