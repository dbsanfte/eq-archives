<font size="3" face="comic sans ms">After you complete the last quest Mystic Dovan replies, "Mystic Dovan his voice booms loud and does not sound the same as before. You have brought the skulls back to the empire. For this you shall be rewarded. You are now a prophet of the Temple of Terror. Go and find the Skulls of Die Nozok. I shall wait within Zand. Bring them along with your Iron Cudgel of the Prophet."<br><br>
When he say's he will wait within Zand it is assumed that the skulls and cudgel to complete this one will be handed in to Hierophant Zand. When his voice booms loud and does not sound the same as before it is assumed he is Dai Or Die Nozok speaking through Mystic Dovan.  <br>
<br>The Iksar Skull Helm which drops off the Iksar Adherant in the Sarnak Fortress has been identified at Skull of Die NoZok. It's a common drop off of them and they are about lvl 22. <br><br>
The Skull of Dai Nozok is a much trickier one to get.  It involves a bit of a side quest.  First you must go to the Iksar Camp in the Swamp of No Hope. This is the same spot that Shadow Knights go for their pages so if you have a friend working on that quest you should hook up.  You are after the Froglok Ton Warriors who spawn near there.  They drop 3 Broken Totem Pieces and one complete Ton Warrior Totem. You need the three totem pieces which will identify as the Top, Bottom and Middle of the Dai Key to make the second Ton Warrior Totem. They are lore so keep grabbing em till you have 3 of em. It took me about 3 hours to get all of them and by that point I had 7 Pages for the SK khukri quest heh heh.  Then it's off
to the Burning Woods for some Mendglow Clay. Remember this great substance from the 2nd Cudgel Upgrade. At least now you will be high enough level to travel to Burning Woods without dying. Once there I'd start auctioning for Mendglow clay while you forage. Otherwise it could take a while. Most druids will just let you have it. Combine the 3 pieces of the Dai Totem with the Mendglow clay and voila you will make the 2nd Ton Warrior Totem or Key of Dai as it identifies as.  
<br><br>
The Next component is a tricky one. It is from The Mines of Nurga. The Mines are a seldom fought in place unfortunately but it also means the camp you need will likely be all yours. I soloed the camp at lvl 40 but anything less I'd get some friends. It would be good exp for a group in their low to mid 30's.  None of the Goblins in Nurga see invisible so invis yourself and head past the front guards. Once in nurga head to the right up a small waterfall. You want to get yourself to the room at -1500, -550. Here you will find 2 sets of mobs on each side of the room by some tents. Keep everything in that room dead and eventually Overseer Dlubbish will pop. He is a mid 30's mob who will drop a Skull Canopic. This is the last item on your quest.
<br><br>
Next you take your items 1) Skull Canopic 2)Ton Warrior Totem (Key of Dai#1) 3)Ton Warrior Totem (Key of Dai#2) to Overthere.  Inside the town of Overthere you will find an Iksar named Galdon Vok Nir. If you swim out around the wall and stop at the beach where you wait for the boat to Timorous Deep just hug the inside part of the wall. You shouldn't encounter anything along the wall. He is about 200 feet up the wall and not KOS or anything.  He is the one looking for these items.  Hand him the items along with 400 gp (40pp has been reported to work also).  He will hand you the much sought after Skull of Dai Nozok. I couldn't get him to talk when I did it but they may have fixed the dialogue so that he requests these. Regardless the talking isn't required.<br><br>
Return to Zand and hand in the 2 skulls with your Cudgel of the Prophet for:<br><br>

<br><br>This is our first Cudgel that has some impressive stats on it. I would definitely use this one in my low 20s even a litle higher for pride's sake.
