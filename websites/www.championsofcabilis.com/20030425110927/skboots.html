Find me these quills, a pair of skeletal feet, an emerald of fire, and some banded boots so that I may start working on them. Why are you still here?! Begone! 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cactus Quills are found off of Thorny Succelents in Overthere. They drop about every 1 in 6.  The Pair of Skeletal Feet drops off the Thick Boned Skeleton in Kurn's Tower. This is a 1 in 4 drop approx.  Item looks like whiskers or barracuda bones. 
<br>Hand these in and you'll be rewarded with:
