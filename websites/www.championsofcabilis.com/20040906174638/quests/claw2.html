<p>You say, 'i seek to become a patriarch of cabilis'

<p>Elder Patriarch Ixthal says 'I thought you might. I can sense your spirit is strong. For your first mission, you will need to use the spirits to guide you to collect some [rare items] we need on a daily basis in order to keep up with the demands of the city. This mission will also be great [training] for you.'

<p>You say, 'what rare items?'

<p>Elder Patriarch Ixthal says 'We gather several items that we trade with the Hierophants. These items include a cracked femur, creeper cabbage, and lichenclover. Once you have all of these items, return them to me with your Claw of the Cub and you shall be rewarded.'
