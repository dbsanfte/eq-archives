This quest takes you throughout the old world of Norrath for the ultimate goal of the spell, Life Leech.  This quest cannot be performed without being level 50, as the quest giver will not speak to you until then. 
<br><br><b>QUEST</b><br><br>
	The Quest begins in Rathe Mountains with a Necromancer named Kazzel D'Leryt, who can be found near the Feerott zone line, around - 500, -1200.<br><br>
	You say, 'hail Kazzel D'Leryt'<br>
Kazzel D'Leryt says, 'Finally a servant worthy of my needs…Apparently you are of high status…which perhaps means you might know a master [jeweler] capable of facitting a very magical yet fragile stone?'
<br>You say, 'I know a jeweler.'
<br>Kazzel D'Leryt says 'You will provide me with 2000 platinum pieces as a deposit, then you will take this stone to a master jeweler or [Darfumpel], have it facetted and return it to me along with an orb of pure crystal, a gold necklace the color of snow, and the [blood of Xenyari].  Do that and I will provide you with magic beyond that of most knights of darkness.'
<br>You say, 'Who is Darfumpel?'
<br>Kazzel D'Leryt says 'Darfumpel is a gnomish shopkeeper here in Rathe Mountains.  He apparently has a new technique for gemcutting.  However, he will not deal with me due to my affiliation with necromancy.  Speak with him and perhaps he might be willing to aid you for a pirce.  But make sure to hide your true nature.  He despises dark magic.'
<br>You say, 'Where can I get blood of Xenyarl?'
<br>Kazzel D'Leryt says 'Xenyari is a druid that inhabits these parts.  She is rarely seen, however I require a droplet of her blood.  Here is the catch though, one you may be well suited for if you are desiring magic of the knights of darkness.  Xenyari must give of herself willingly.  In other words, you cannot take her blood by force.  But rather, she must give you her blood of her own accord.'
<br><br>Now the quest begins by giving Kazzel 2000 pp.  He will then give you an uncut hyacinth and says:<br><br>
Kazzel D'Leryt says 'Very well.  Take this gem to a master jeweler and return to me with the other three items.'<br><br>
You then head up to the Northwest corner of this zone to a set of huts around 4100, 900.  In one of the huts is Darfumpel Zirubbel who will cut the gem for you.  Hail him.<br><br>
You say, 'I need a stone cut.'<br>
<br>Darfumpel Zirubbel says 'Yes, I use a new gemcutting technique that I designed myself.  It will bring out the beauty of any gem.  However, as arrogant as this may sound, I do not cut just any ordinary stones.  They must be rare or of extraordinary quality.  Have you an exceptional stone that requires faceting?  If so, what type of gem is it?'
<br>You say, 'It is an uncut Hyacinth'
<br>Darfumpel Zirubbel says 'A hyacinth eh? That is quite a rare stone.  Quite fragile and easily shattered too.  But with my new technique, I can assure you that I will not destroy the gem but it will cost you.  1000 platinum coins is my fee.  Provide me with the coin and the gem and I will cut it for you.'
<br><br>You then hand him 1000 pp and the uncut hyacinth.  He then gives you back a facetted hyacinth while saying:<br><br>
Darfumpel Zirubbel says 'I have not seen a gem such as this in quite some time!  It was not since I dabbled in a bit of necro…Wait…What are you going to use this for?  Nevermind.  I do not wish to know.  Here, take your gem and leave<br><br>
The druid that Kazzel mentioned is in the same area of the Rathe mountains as Darfumpel. A bit Northwest of the huts, around 5950, 14950, near a druid ring is where you will find her.<br><br>
You say, 'Hail Xenyari Lisariel'
<br>Xenyari Lisariel says 'Hello.'
<br>She doesn't say anything more except mumbles about a Prickly Pear occasionally.
<br>You say, 'what Prickly Pear?'
<br>Xenyari Lisariel says 'Yes yes! Prickly Pears!  Do you have any?  I just love Prickly Pears but Permafrost is just so far away even for us druids.'
<br><br>Now begins the trek across most of Norrath.  Prickly Pears are located in Permafrost off an Icy Terror.  The White gold necklace is located in Lower Guk off the Froglok noble.  And the Crystalized Orb is found in Sol B off the Stone Spider.<br><br>
When you get back to Rathe Mountains, after getting these items, find Xenyari Lisariel again and give her the Prickly Pear.<br><br>
Xenyari Lisariel says 'Prickly Pears! I love Prickly Pears!!  Thank you for getting these for me.  I really, really appreciate your gift and I shall not…OWW!!  I hate when I stick myself with the needles.  Oh look, I am bleeding now.  Sigh.  Can you hold this note for a moment please?  My hands are full and I must clean up.<br><br>
You then receive a bloodied parchment, which is one the last thing that Kazzel seeks.

Go back to the area where you found Kazeel before and turn into him the white gold necklace, Crystalized Orb, bloodied parchment, and facetted hyacinth.  
<br><br>
Kazzel D'Leryt says 'You are quite cunning.  After I fashion this Talesm, take it back to Xenyari.  She would 'enjoy' another 'gift', eh?'<br><br>
You will then receive a faceted hyancinth talesm.  Head back up to the Northwest section of Rathe Mountains, find Xenyari and turn the faceted hyancith talesm in to her. <br><br>
Xenyari Lisariel bounces around with glee at the site of your gift, smiles at you, and dons the Talesm.  As she clasps the Talesm around her neck, she begins to writhe in agony, and slowly fades from sight leaving just the Talesm, which is now pulsating with vibrant energy.<br><br>
You will now receive a pulsating hyacinth Talesm.  Take this back to Kazzel and prepare to be attacked.  Turn in the Talem.
Kazzel D'Leryt laughs heartily and whispers to you, 'well done worm, your servitude to my will has now expired…'
<br><br>
Immediately a monstrous zombie spawns and attacks you.  Kill the zombie only.  Loot the zombie's corpse to obtain the monstrous zombie heart.  Give this back to Kazzel.<br><br>
Kazzel D'Leryt says "Oh!  Umm… Well… I was just playing around with you…  Obviously you know I was joking…  We had a deal and I will abide by the terms of our agreement…  Here is my payment of your services… bye…'<br><br>
You receive the spell scroll for the 49th level SK spell, Life Leech.<br><br>
<b>RESULT</b><br><br>
Experience<br>
	Life Leech:  	Level 49 Shadowknight spell.  
280 pt Lifetap, 315 mana, Cast time 2 to 3 seconds, recast 2 to 3 minutes<br><br>
<b>RECOMMENDATIONS</b><br><br>
This quest takes time and money.  I recommend getting the quest pieces before starting the quest, running around, and spending 3000 pp.  The start of this quest is really simple, talk to Razzel, give him money, and get the gem.  Take the gem to Darfumpel, give him more money, and receive a facetted hyacinth.  Getting the white gold necklace, crystallized orb, and prickly pear takes time though.
	<br><br>The crystallized orb is located in Sol B.  It drops off the stone spiders, which is a specific camp, and is the common drop.  This item is not worth much, as it is pretty useless, and so if you spend some time and talk to the people holding the camp, they will most likely let you loot it once the orb drops.  If you have to camp the orb yourself, you will most likely need a full group or a few high level friends.  
	<br><br>The Prickly Pear drops off the Icy Terror in Permafrost.  They are generally found near the Ice giants and Vox so it is difficult to get one on your own.  It is extremely easy to get one if you go on a Vox raid, as raids must kill these MOBs first in order to get to Vox.  Usually prickly pears drop one in every two Terror's, so a couple shadowknights can get them in the same raid.  WARNING, PRICKLY PEAR IS A FOOD, thus put it deep in your bags or you will/might accidentally eat it.  
	<br><br>The White Gold Necklace drops off the Froglok Noble in Lower Guk, live side.  I bought mine because I hate Lower Guk and refuse to go there.  Cost me 1.5 k, though I hear you can get them for 1000 pp.  This is supposedly the common drop off the Froglok Noble, but that is all I know.
	<br><br>Again, I would wait until you have all these items before starting the quest; why run around if you don't have to.  I was not KOS to Razzel, Darfumpel, or Xenyari.  I would be careful around the huts where Darfumpel stays as I suspect Iksars and SK's are KOS to some of the roamers around these Huts.  Also I don't think the druids near Xenyari take to kindly to us either.  Don't know their levels, but why get into a fight when you don't have to.  
	<br><br>After running around, getting the faceted hyancinth talesm, turning that into Xenyari, and then getting the pulsating hyacinth talesm, get ready for the final fight.  The monstrous zombie isn't as difficult as he is startling.  Once you turn in the talesm, he will spawn, Harm Touch you and hit you with multiply 100 damage shots.  If you can survive this part of the fight I think you have a really good chance of winning.  My friends and I won this fight pretty easily with about 8 people, 51 sk, 51 ranger, 48 monk, 53 monk, 51 cleric, 44 shaman, 42 shaman, and a 49 necro.  No one died or came close.  The zombie is pretty magically resistant, so don't be surprised if some spells gets resisted, and I think he casts some spells including fear.  Just remember not to attack Kazzel or this battle could turn bad really quickly.
	<br><br>Once you kill the zombie the quest is essentially over.  Grab the monstrous zombie heart, turn it into Kazzel and congratulations on your new spell.
