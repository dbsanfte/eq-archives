<font size="+1" face="comic sans ms">Sarth Scarscale says 'Ahhhh....a breastplate you want, is it? Well, they are not easy to come by. Fetch me a scorpion chitin. Intact, mind you! They are extremely fragile and must be treated before they can protect your carcass. Also, fetch me a war braid from a sarnak to connect the pieces. I also require a ruby and your banded tunic. Do this and I shall make it for you, hatchling. Now, go!
<br><br>The Sarnak War Braid is a very common drop off of Sarnak Berzerkers in the Overthere.  The Scorpion Chitin remained unsolved for many moons but now has finally been discovered!  Zatharus of the Sarynn server informed me that his clutchmate Kletatelk has solved this quest. Many thanks for their info.  The Chitin was taken from the slain body of a large heartsting scorpion. This scorpion was slightly lower in power than the legionary who was 22nd level. It is a new mob added on the patch January 9th, 2001.  Other reports state that it may take a few kills before one will drop.
