<i>“The Faceless has taught us the value of creation. It was He who created the Iksar, He who created us as living weapons to destroy those who would oppose His will. And though we are but mortals, we too can learn from what our Lord Cazic-Thule has shown us. Those who learn to create can bring about the most destruction.”

<font size=+1 face="comic sans ms"><u>The Basics</u></font><br><br>
<font size=3 face="comic sans ms"><b>Money</b> </font><br><br>
<font size="3" face="comic sans ms">First of all, there are a couple of important factors one must take into consideration while blacksmithing.  First of all, you’re going to want a sizable source of cash (around 300 platinum that you can spend.) before you start into blacksmithing, as it is one of the most expensive skills to train in the game. 
<p></p>
<font size=3 face="comic sans ms"><b>Stats</b> </font><br><br>
You need to take into account that your stats will affect how successful you are in blacksmithing, and how much it is going to cost you. The stats you want to concentrate on when blacksmithing are: 
<p></p>
Intelligence and Strength: These two skills determine how high your success rate is. The more times you succeed in making an item, the more you can sell the item back and overall, will gain back a large portion of your money back. 
<p></p>Wisdom: This skill determines how quickly your skill will go up. In the end, this is what you ultimately want to do. The higher your Wisdom, the faster your skill will rise, the better stuff you can make, and the more profit you can gain. This is probably the most important stat when trying to raise blacksmithing.
<p></p>Charisma: This determines the expense of the raw materials, and how much vendors will buy your goods back for. The higher your Charisma, the less money you’ll spend buying materials and the more money you’ll get back for selling items to vendors.
<p></p>Its not a bad idea if you have extra money to buy equipment to raise these stats, especially Wisdom, since our shamans can give you a Strength and Charisma buffs (just make sure you say please and thank you when asking). I’ll tell you now that if you are not a shaman, blacksmithing will probably take twice as long, and be twice as expensive because you will not have as high a Wisdom score. Don’t let this discourage you however. After all, shamans usually concentrate on their alchemy skill, leaving the blacksmithing to the rest of us.
<p></p>
<font size=+1 face="comic sans ms"><u>Beginning</u></font><br><br>
First off, you’re going to want to go find your guildmaster. Once there, you will want to train your skill with your extra skill points. You can raise your skill up to 21 points, and it is suggested that you do so, as this will save you money and use your extra skill points towards something constructive. You’ll know you’ve put the number of maximum skill possible into blacksmithing when you get the message “You must practice this skill in the field.” This means you are ready to do some real blacksmithing.
<p></p>
<font size=+1 face="comic sans ms"><u>Metal Bits</u></font><br><br>
Metal bits are the basic piece you need to smith anything until you get to make armour. Thus, learning how to make these is important. First of all, you’re going to want to go into West Cabilis. Go towards Lybar (Location: Pos 288, Pos 529), near what looks like a little ice platform across from the Necromancer’s Guild. From Lybar, you can buy water flasks. You’ll want to buy several stacks of water, so you don’t have to keep running back to West Cabilis to buy more. Remember, you can’t use anything but water flasks, not foraged water or bloodwater. Otherwise it won’t work. 
<p></p>Once you’ve got some stacks of water, you’ll want to return to East Cabilis. Once there, you will want to make your way over to the forge and Klok Toren (Location: Pos 194, Neg 314). From Klok Toren, you’ll want to purchase a large amount of ore. You’ll want to make sure to buy the small pieces of ore for creating metal bits. Now, next to Klok Toren, you’ll see a forge. Right-click on the forge to open it. If the forge is being occupied, Cabilis has the luxury of having another forge, which you can use, located in the courtyard of the warrior’s guild (Location: Neg 382, Neg 35). Remember to bring your supplies with you, as you won’t be able to purchase them at the other forge.
<p></p>Now, it’s time to start blacksmithing. Into the forge, you will want to place two pieces of ore, and one flask of water. When doing this, make sure NOT to stack the pieces of ore in the forge.  Each piece of ore must be in a separate slot. (Hold down CTRL and left-click the stack to get one piece of ore) Once the items are in the forge, hit the combine button. Hopefully, you’ll have created a metal bit. If you put the maximum number of skill points possible into blacksmithing, you’ll also get the message “This item is trivial for someone of your skill level to make”. Don’t worry about that. We need these metal bits to make other things that will raise our skill.
<p></p>
<font size=+1 face="comic sans ms"><u>Scalars</u></font><br><br>
Now that you have learned how to make metal bits, you can now proceed to increase your skill. The first things you’ll want to make with metal bits are scalars. To make scalars, you will require a scalar mold. Scalar molds can be purchase from Klok Gritchit in the centre building of the three small structures beside the bank (Location: Pos 593, Pos 154). You will begin to become quite familiar with Klok Gritchit, as he sells most of the molds you’ll need before you start making armour. Anyways, once you’ve purchased a suitable amount of scalar molds, return to the forge. To create a scalar, add one metal bit, one flask of water and one scalar mold into the forge. Once you have used up all your molds, go and sell the scalars to a merchant, and then go purchase some more scalar molds. Remember, if you run out of metal bits, you’ll also have to make some more. Continue to make scalars until you’ve obtain a skill level of 41, at which point scalars will no longer be able to raise your skill and will become trivial. 
<p></p>
<font size=+1 face="comic sans ms"><u>Lanterns</u></font><br><br>
After trivializing scalars, the next object you’ll want to learn to create is the lantern. Lanterns are one of the more complicated things to make, as they require 4 different components. The lantern casing mold can be purchased from Klok Gritchit, or you can purchase them from Klok Nalgoz who stands right near the forge (Location: Pos 237, Neg 290). You will also be required to purchase bottles to create a lantern. Bottles can be purchased from Klok Sass, who sits in the brewing tent, on the right side of the bank entrance (Location: Pos 664, Neg 35). Once you have the molds and the bottles, return once again to the forge. To create a lantern, you will need to place one metal bit, one flask of water, one lantern casing mold and one bottle into the forge. Again, once you have run out of components, sell your lanterns back to one of the vendors, and purchase more components. Continue to create lanterns until your skill level has reached 68. At this point, lanterns will become trivial and you will be ready to move on to the next step.
<p></p>
<font size=+1 face="comic sans ms"><u>Skewers</u></font><br><br>
You now come to the point of making skewers. Be prepared to be making these for quite a long time. This is the true test of blacksmithing: getting through the boredom. Visit Klok Gritchit once again, and purchase skewer molds. Return once again to the forge, and open it up. It takes one metal bit, one flask of water and one skewer mold to create a skewer. This is going to get really repetitive, because you’ll want to keep making skewers until your skill level has reached 115. Have patience though, as you are drawing ever closer to being able to make armour. 
<p></p>
<font size=+1 face="comic sans ms"><u>Pots</u></font><br><br>
Once you’ve gotten to 115, you’re probably going to be dying to try to make something new. Now comes the time to make some pots. Go once again to Klok Gritchit, and purchase both pot molds and standing leg molds (remember to purchase an equal number of both, so that if you buy 10 pot molds, buy 10 standing leg molds as well). Make the trip back over to the forge. To make a pot, you will need to place one metal bit, one flask of water, one pot mold and one standing leg mold into the forge. Keep making pots until your skill level has hit 122, at which point they will become trivial. 
<p></p>
<font size=+1 face="comic sans ms"><u>Sewing Kits</u></font><br><br>
Only one step remains before you’ll have nothing else to make but armour, so let’s get to it. The final object you’ll want to make is the sewing kit. You’ll find the components needed for this task on the island of merchants that lies between the zone entrances to the Swamp of No Hope and Cabilis West. You’ll find a merchant appropriately named Klok Stitch (Pos 127, Neg 10) who will sell you thimble molds and needle molds (again, remember to purchase an equal number of each one). Once the materials have been purchased, returned to the forge. Place one metal bit, one flask of water, one thimble mold and one needle mold into the forge. Continue to make sewing kits until you reach 135. At this point, you have trivialized sewing kits, as well as every mundane blacksmithing item around. Now, you are ready to continue on to create armour.
