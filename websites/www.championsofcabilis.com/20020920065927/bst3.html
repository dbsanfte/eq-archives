<p></p>
      Prime Patriarch Vuzx says, ' You have overcome sturdy yet unintelligent creatures that plague our kind. You are now ready to face our foes that are more intelligent than the insects you have defeated. We have many foes possessing a degree of intelligance, the least of these foes being the tribes of goblins that inhabit our Empire's lands. Even now there are goblin watchers prowling just outside our gates. Locate four of these watchers, slay them and return to me with their Goblin Watcher Signal Torches. ' 
<p></p>
      These torches drop off the Goblin Watchers ( lvl 3- 5) which can be found in the newbie area around the Cabilis Gate in the Lake of Ill Omen zone. Don't be surprised if your jumped since most creatures in this zone are aggro to you, so watch your back. You can also get them in Warslick Woods to the left of where you zone in.
<p></p>
      Retrun the 4 torches to Prime Patriach Vuzx and gain better faction with Scaled Mystics and the Legion of Cabilis, Xps, and
