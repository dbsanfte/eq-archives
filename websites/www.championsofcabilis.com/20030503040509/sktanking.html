<font size="+1" face="comic sans ms">A) Know Your Role</font><br>
<p>
We are Damage Takers. Yes, especially with spells we can dish it out as well but our main job is to protect the casters, hold the mobs attention while the rogue backstabs. Given that, we fill the roll of a secondary tank far better than the primary tank role.
</p>
<font size="+1" face="comic sans ms">B) Roles To Know.</font><br>
The Ashikaga-Ryu defines the following basic roles within a group.<br>
<p>
<b>Attacker:</b> They that Strike.  Main melee damage force, should not be taking damage, should be dishing it out.  Monks will be your primary attacker class,  bu6t you may in your journeys run into groups where you will meet thosecalled rogues. Placement is critical with a Rogue, you need to stay on the opposite side of the Rogue for them to backstab, monks don’t need that attention and are better pullers.
</p><p>
<b>Crowd Control:</b> Stopping a unwanted second or third opponent in a battle from getting involved, This can be done by using root spells.  Out in the lands of the softskins, there are others who know the true power of fear, and follow Lord Cazic-Thule as do we.  Some of those Erudites that serve or master have learned the art of the Enchanter.  These Enchanters have spells that put their opponents asleep, one must be careful abut how one awakens awakens the sleeper, you must taunt beforehad, maybe more then once, then awaken with diease cloud, hit, bash, taunt.
</p><p>
<b>Healer:</b> They who cast heal spells, this will be mainly our breathern Shaman, but again there are others that share in service to our Lord Cazic-Thule, the clerics of the Erudites can be valuble allies, even more so in the second half of your seasons.  Though they will never replace our breathern, we would be failing in our duty to our Lord to ignore them.
</p><p>
<b>Nuker/Doter:</b> They that are offensive in spells.  Spell casters that cast damage causing spells.
</p><p>
<b>Primary Tank:</b> They that are the wall which no one passes.  Hold the attention of the mob, get hit, grind it to a pulp. In a dual pull, go for the biggest mob first. If the second Mob breaks Mez, or an Add comes by and agros on the casters, you stay on the Mob you have, with the attacker, the secondary will go for the save.
</p><p>
<b>Secondary Tank:</b> They that are the Guru-JOAT, Good at many, best at none.<br>
In a single pull situation, stand next to the primary, and wail and try to taunt the mob off him to soak up some damage. A key to this are spells: Lifestrike, Lifedraw, Siphon Strength, Disease Cloud, Ward Undead. Lifespike is only really useful until you get Lifedraw at level 29, they both serve the same purpose, keeping the mana drain on the caster to a minimum, taunting the mob. Siphon Strength is a low cost debuff/buff, should be cast on almost any serious Mob. The little-itty-bitty Disease Cloud is a great taunt spell, very low mana cost. Ward Undead is only used on Undead, is a pain to get reliable, but before Lifedraw it is killer damage, for a spell. Clinging darkness can also be used, but is kind of a waste and the Druid or Shaman should be rooting, so Darkness is redundant. 
<br>
In dual pulling situations, especially when you’re the puller is more flexible, and should be talked out with the group at least the primary tank. There seems to be two schools of thought here. 1) All three melees (1st, 2nd, and Attacker) team up up on the biggest threat while the baby wails on you until the enchanter mezzes it (if you have an enchanter) or the big mob is dead. 2) let the primary take one, you take the other and hold it off until the bigger mob is dead. The Ashikaga Ryu teaches that it is best that in the case of near equal mobs w/o an Enchanter split from the primary, so you don’t get hit from behind, otherwise gang up on the big mob, the baby should not be too bad, and if you have an Enchanter it allows them to do their crowd control work. This is really best agreed on by the group, so everyone knows what to expect, and depending on the group dynamics, the right answer will vary.
<br>
One other issue to decide with your party is if you are to break off, if there is an add, or one mob splits off from the tanks to go after the casters, again this is a situation which has no "right" answer but is situational to your group and should be discussed so that all are clear on what will happen when this occurs.
<br>
You may also be asked to throw DOTs (mainly Heat Blood/Heart Flutter) at the begining of combat, or to do a debuff suite: Cancel Magic, Syphon Strength, Shrowd of Hate, Shadow Vortex. at higher levels(39-40.)  This is where an Shadow Knight shines, the abilty to fill the holes in a group.
</p>
<font size="+1" face="comic sans ms">C) The Group is Greater Than the Sum of it's Parts</font><br>
<p>
<b>Group Make-Up</b><br>
The Ashikaga Ryu believes in the following group make-ups are the all-around best, given the areas you will be hunting (LOIO, FM, OT):<br>
<br>
Under level 34<br>
<ul>
	<li>You. (SK, Secondary Tank)
	<li>Warrior (Primary Tank)
	<li>Monk. (Attacker)
	<li>Caster/Nuker
	<li>A Shaman (preferred) or Cleric (Healer/buffs)
	<li>Druid (perfered, if no shamam) or other caster (Nuker/Dotter)
</ul>

Over 33<br>
<ul>
	<li>You. (SK, Secondary Tank)
	<li>Warrior (Main Tank)
	<li>Monk. (Attacker)
	<li>An Enchanter (Crowd Control)
	<li>A Cleric (preferred) or A Shaman (Healer/buffs)
	<li>Shaman or other caster if there is a Shaman healer
</ul>

<p>
Note:  Without a doubt Monk, SK, War, 2xNerco, Shaman or Monk, SK, War, Nerco, 2xShaman can make great groups, the higher level you go, the more reliant on spell casters you will be, and the longer you will be standing/sitting around as people (including yourself) wait to regain mana if you don't have an enchanter.
</p><p>
You may be doing Puller duty as well, so much the better for knowing the role, but on average monks do better. An interesting variation I’ve grouped with had an Enchanter puller, see the Variations section for details.
</p><p>
<b>Variations</b><br>
<b>The Tandem</b> The tandem group is really 2 three person groups, this is only recommeded for full groups on the upper end of the zones level. 2xSKs, 2xMonks, and (2xShamen if under 34/Cleric&Shaman 34+.)  The 34+ version can be done well by 2 shamen, but the Cleric's Superior heal makes them better in the primary healer role, with the Shaman doing secondary duty.  SK's both pull, one monk to SK, Under lvl 34, each shaman takes a pair.  Over 34, SKs pull, Monks join in, cleric if aval takes the tanks for heals, the shaman, the monks and backs up the cleric.  This group can put a little thrill back into the last days of a zone for you, you don't want to pull the highest lvl mobs, but the Xp comes faster then just 2 three man groups.  One last benifit from this group is the opprotunity to learn "Split Tanking" at a very basic level.
</p><p>
<b>The Pet:</b> You with a bunch of casters. Keep some bonechips handy, raise you pet, if the casters have pets, they do the same. You become basically the pulling Pet. Especially if your significantly lower level than your casters. One of my prouder moments in EQ was being complemented by a group of 37-38 casters for the job I was doing as a 31 level SK, I felt total inadequate for the job, but they appreciated having a person who thought out things instead of the typical Pet React. You need to just hold the mobs attention and let the DOTs and DDs do their thing.
</p>
<font size="+1" face="comic sans ms"><b>D) Death Is Light As A Flower, Duty Is As Heavy As A Mountain.</b></font><br>
<p>
Try and avoid it, it’s not fun, but it will be your job at times to take a death for your group. For a bad pull/train run it away from your group. Try Feign Death if you can. Die if you must. Don’t cause others deaths by your mistakes. If things are looking bad (And you should have a social button for this) tell your group to run, but give them time to withdraw before you do. I usually wait 10 secs. Beforehand discuss and ask the group to respond to the Run message, it can be running or just k. and time from the last that does.
</p>
<b>E) The Pen Is Mighter Than The Sword. (Words really do hurt)</b><br>
The Art Of Taunting.
<p>
Monks and Casters are your friends, taunting is the key to keep them and you alive.  In any fight, especially in your early soloing days, have a key made for taunt, and use it every fight to keep the skill up.<br>
Three spells will be key to boosting your taunting effectiveness: Disese Cloud, Clinging Darkness, and your best LifeX (Draw, Spike, Tap.)  Learn to intermix your taunts with these spells, protect your casters, protect yourself.  a good basic taunt stratagy to start a fight is as follows:  Disese Cloud on the incoming MOB, fight/taunt, Disese Cloud again, fight/taunt, Clinging Darkness, fight/taunt, Disese Cloud, then fight/taunt on, casting Disese Cloud whenever you see a "(Greater/Superior/Plain Old) Healing So-and-so." message or a nuker announces a spell.  If spells are coming fast and heavy, alternate in Clinging Darkness and/or your LifeX spell.  This stratagey will keep you high on the MOBs hate list, keeping you from running after a MOB, who is chasing after your groups Shaman, who just aggroed the MOB healing you, and is now waiting for you to get back to your job.
