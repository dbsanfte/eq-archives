Greetings young mystic, I offer my greatest advice up front, explore the surrounding zones around Cabilis.
Do not go very far inside each zone, slowly work your way in conning all creatures you see. Once you begin to get a feel for the zone and the creatures inside, use the wisdom Cazic gave you to decide what to kill. The reason I stress going to the different zones surrounding Cabilis is to help build versatility and the ability to quickly make decisions during the heat of a battle. <p></p>
The previous advice applies most strongly to early levels (1 – 7). During these early levels you will develop several skills both in character skills and as a player controlling your character smoothly and instinctively. An added bonus is that the exp. loss from dying at early levels isn’t hard to make up and the adventure of retrieving your corpse can be great experience in caution and stealth. During this early period of exploration you may develop several different pages of hotkeys and get familiar with commonly used commands and spells. <p></p>
My personal favorite spot for exp. at this level is to work your way to the pit until you can begin killing giant scorpions. These are a mainstay they go down rather easily for their level. Once you feel comfortable park yourself on the outside of the pit near the ruins (opposite side from the city) here is a constant flow of scorpions and bandits and such. When you see a monk or warrior of similar level give him a little buff (just a tease) and ask if he would like to team up, if not no biggie just keep killing. <p></p>
At about 7th level the life of the shaman becomes a bit more complicated. You can still solo yellow creatures with caution and even red on occasion. From about 7th to 9th level you need to start deciding whether to group up or go for the solo pulls. Your call here depends on the day, the people on and your mood.<p></p>
By 9th level you can head toward Kurn's Tower. Buff up completely before you zone in and be ready just in case. One side note on buffing, don’t rush it! Learn the buffs that last longest and start with those try to keep your mana at about 60% or more when buffing, this may be the last time you get to take your time and fully buff up safely. Once you zone in test the skeletons guarding the entrance and see how you do with one of them, if you look around you will see several diff types and levels of skeles in this first room so be careful. Remember you cannot SoW indoors! look around are there any others in the front hall soloing? If so ask them if they want a partner or do a /LFG or /ooc 11th level shaman looking to group! <p></p>
I could write volumes of advice on kurns but that will have to be left to others. Kurns like when you start in any other zone just takes time to get used to. See grouping guide <p></p>
When you get sick of Burnyai the Lake of Ill Omen is a good place to move on to along with the wars woods. Don’t be afraid to try new spots but one simple leveling tip is if you are in a spot getting great exp. and having a good time DON’T LEAVE. You will find people of similar level and playing times and can build some great groupmates, eventually you will become an expert at the area and will get to know several good grouping partners (along with the bad ones). Most of my fondest memories are of the time I spent in Kurns tower and the time I spent in Dalnir, these are both dangerous dungeons but if you take the time and are lucky enough to find good group mates you will be having so much fun the first time you notice your exp. gain will be when you hear the DING :) <p></p>

<font size=3 color=yellow face="Comic Sans MS">

Learn your spells look them up at castersrealm.com, become accustomed to casting them and how much of your mana they take. Don’t waste buffs but don’t be stingy. If you are in a group you want every tank to be at peak performance, the harder, faster they hit and the less damage they take the faster the exp. comes. <p></p>
If possible keep all buffs on you all the time, not because you definitely need them but because it never hurts to practice. <p></p>
If grouped the easiest way I find is to take the longest lasting buff and start with that. It takes a bit of getting used to I like to cast at least one cannibalize in-between every buff. Depending on the amount of mana needed, the lasting time of the buff and the number of people to buff. The perfect situation leads to all buffs loaded before the first mob gets back to the party and buffs fading at a comfortable interval where you can refresh all that need it without depleting your mana. Often I will buff myself first so when the buff begins to fade I will see it and know to prepare for buffing again. More often than not I can only do this at the beginning of the group or during extended downtimes, so make sure your party knows to tell you when the buffs start fading and hopefully you will have enough mana to start the whole process over again. <p></p>
Siks sidenote : if you find one of the tanks is constantly running his health down and draining your mana, make em sweat! LIE tell them 20m when you have 40 or start waiting a little longer to heal them. They will start slowing the pulls a bit then :)<p></p>

Make your first few movements count the most. Make sure that you use a debuff of some sort to start out with, if you get stuck pulling pull with a malise to minimize the amount of aggro the creature has toward you and to make your next spells stick, or if you are feeling brave pull with a dot and allow the tanks to pull the mob off of you. Enjoy this time in your life you are still a pseudo tank, you can still jump in after you have weakened and or even dotted the mob and pound on them. You may decide not to use dots to save on mana. The technique of using debuffs on mobs and medding while the tanks do the damage is good to get accustomed to in the late 20s. Use your top 2 debuffs on the mob and sit back and med while watching the parties health and healing when needed. If you have lots of mana and buffs are all done you may want to help pound on the critter cause every little bit helps and enjoy it while you can! <p></p>

Sit! You have the amazing greater heal now it heals 300 hitpoints ! You have to love it now you are actually making a dent when you heal. MOBS HATE YOU ! Be careful don’t heal immediately. You must use caution when using your new healing abilities if you suddenly heal 600 HP to your party and they have barely done 400hp of damage the monster WILL come after you. Circle around or root it do not attack it take the damage like an Iksar until your party pulls it off of you. If there are more than one mob you must be careful as well because the extra mob doesn’t have anyone to distract it so It will definitely take an interest in you. Be careful when healing but be sure that your tanks have confidence in you. Tell them if they are running low on Hit points and you know you only have one heal left in you. Constantly spout off your current mana. 20m….40m….whoah only 10m hold off on the pull, or OOM RUN RUN RUN ! hehe. After getting accustomed to your new heal play around feel out your parties and be vocal if you have a spell that is constantly not sticking perhaps some other member of the party is casting a similar debuff, be aware of this. Just remember most tanks start to think they can take on anything when they know that they will be healed if they start getting hurt, You can see there HPs but they cant see your mana dwindling away so keep them informed if a tank wants to pull a red when you JUST said 20m then …. <p></p>
  
  

<i>Siks sidenote, IMHO the Shaman is now the guardian of the casters (except the fools who keep getting in trouble). If your party is having a tough time and the mob finally takes off after you caster(usually the cleric or Wizard) , jump in there root it, nuke it, run up to it slap it in the face open your spellbook do whatever you have to to get the mob off of the caster. You can usually take a few hits whereas the wizards cannot, the enchanters need a sec to get a mesmerize off and clerics are just plain more important to be able to cast than you are.</i> <p></p>

Pet tactics and soloing I’m still working on this, so take my advise (all of it) with a grain of salt. I have found the best way to solo with a pet is to first and foremost buff you then the pet spell by spell giving plenty of time between buffs so as to make rebuffing easy and to have all buffs up at all times. Now pick a nice out of the way spot and park your pet using /pet guard here. Now if at full mana haste yourself then your pet sit down and mem a dot or debuff in its place stand up and get ready. Pull a mob using malisement unless you know that your debuff will stick the first time from past experience. Keep an eye on him so as to not loose the critter when your close enough to your pet and you know the mob wont lose you make a dash to the pet and hit /pet attack. Your pet will latch on to the mob while you turn around and cast a good dot and debuff this will usually aggro the creature toward you so back up a little if he keeps comin just fight it out with him a bit. Keep an eye on your pets health using /pet report health, if he starts getting low and the mob is still on him it is easy enough to aggro it back on you so don’t worry. Oh and Never die for your pet, use him to escape hopeless fights, it only takes 10minutes to regain mana for another pet it takes a lot longer to regain the exp. <p></p>
When you first get your pet practice at the giant fort with him it is fun and relatively safe. <p></p>

<font size="+1" color="8F3B29" face="comic sans ms"><b></b><p></p>ROAD TRIP<br><br></font>

Trip to the Oasis 9th level , you have Spirit of wolf time for a road trip ! Go to the woods and follow the trail out of the edge of town and take first left , this leads to giant fort. When you come to the bridge into the fort go into the stream that runs in front of the fort and go to the right. Follow this over a waterfall and be careful a giant hangs out at the corner of the fort along with a feisty goblin, go till the river forks and follow to the left until you see the next drawbridge with 2 giants (normally) guarding the fort. Veer off to the right until you come to the road, follow that to the end and when you reach the end of the road veer to the left until you come to the zone. <p></p>
Overthere go to the end of the road at the top of the hill you will be looking at the big statue go to the right and follow the hill avoiding the sarnaks and other baddies. When you reach the ocean follow the coast to the wall and swim out to the end of it looking for the ship if it isn’t there simply hug the wall on the dock side and goto the beach to rest Do Not go near the dock or into the city. When the ship show up start swimming out to it and swim up on the far side of it. In timorous deep when the ship is approaching or at the docks jump off and swim to the cliffs follow the water side of the cliffs completely around till you see a tree and wait there for the raft it will take you to oasis. <p></p>
I hope this has helped you in some small way.  May the spirits guide your hunt! <p></p>
