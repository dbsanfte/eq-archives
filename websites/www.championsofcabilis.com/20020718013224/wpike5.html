Who:	War Baron Eator		<br>
Estimated Time:	days	<br>
Minimum Level:	30	<br>
The quest starts with War Baron Eator (warrior guild master) <br><br>

You say "I am a brave trooper of the empire" <br><br>

War Baron Eator says "So you are a trooper? Word of your deeds has been spreading through the legion. If you truly wish to wield the pike of a trooper, then go and serve the garrisons of swamp, lake, and woods. 
Report to the Warlord and tell him you are a [trooper reporting for duty]. Their recommendations and your trooper pike shall earn you the rank of legionnaire." 
<br><br>
The warlord in the lake gives you a bag which you put four sarnak legionnaire heads in then combine and return, and he gives you his recommendation. 
<br><br>
The warlord in the woods wants four goblin warlord beads which you combine in a bag for his recommendation. 
<br><br>
The warlord in the swamp wants four Krup shield from the krup warriors which spawn randomly in the froglok city in Swamp of No Hope as well as they cave leading into Trakanon's Teeth in the Swamp also.  Combine in a bag and return for his recommendation. 
<br><br>
Then return all 3 letters and the trooper pike for the legionnaire crown plans. 
<br><br>
Next, ask Weaponsmith Grugle, "What Legionnaire Mancatcher", and he responds as follows : "To forge a Legionnaire Mancatcher a blacksmith of great skill would need the steel rod, a forge hammer and a forged Legionnaire mancatcher crown. That crown is forged with a geozite tool, crown plans, a raw crown (sold by Grugle) and a peridot (bought at vendors)."
<br><br>
The trivial skill to do this is up around 50 I have been told.  The final result is:<br><br>

Again utterly unusable by the obtain level. As of yet there are no further weapon quests for Iksar Warriors. As they are currently finishing the Shadow Knights and Shamans, one would expect Warriors to get a couple more quests in this line. The SK and Shaman weapons got considerably better near at the 5th/6th quest range so look for that here as well.
