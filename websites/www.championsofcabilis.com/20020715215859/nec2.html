<font size="+1" face="comic sans ms">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minimum Level 5.  Ask Master Xydoz in the Tower of Death about Second Rank Skullcap. He will
state that he seeks a Faded Tapestry. You need to be adept at tailoring and
acquire two pieces of the now destroyed tapestry and repair them. The pieces
are the Torn and Ripped Tapestry, which you find off of Sarnak Hatchlings as
rare drops in the Lake of Ill Omen. Tailor the two pieces together (the
result is a mended tapestry, not a faded one, but it works) and hand them in
for your Apprentice Skullcap - 2nd Rank
