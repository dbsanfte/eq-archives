<center><font size="2" face="comic sans ms">By Krikk</font></center>
<font size="2" face="comic sans ms">"I can see you have alot of devotion to your cause...Krikk, was it? I did too, but that was before the Crusaders were what they are now."
<p></p>
This voice spoke to me as a friend, and I was almost familiar with it, however had never met the speaker. An Iksar stood before me, his body naked other than the Robes that covered his ghostly translusent body. But I could tell he needed no clothes. The only weapon he needed was his distinguished honor. And his armor, strength and inteligence matched by gods. I stayed silent. 
<p></p>
"When I was younger, in the days before our Lord's blessing, there was a race of Snake-People who had enslaved our kind. How we resented them, and how relieved we were at their extinction." 
<p></p>
I knew who he was, and I remembered the text documenting these events. This must have been but a dream. 
<p></p>
"But something eluded us, Krikk. Look upon the moon. It glows so bright, we thought with a moon so beautiful, nothing so horrible could happen. But that very moon houses those we thought gone. Search the land, young knight, and find my lost strength. Once you're armed with that strength, the path to our final revenge will be open." 
<p></p>
Rile had spoken, and then I was awaking.
<p></p>
Librarian Zimor had recently begun work in the Crusader's guildhall, but had an extensive ammount of knowledge on our past. I told him about my dream, and asked about Greenmist. He told me he hadn't much idea of what the moon-portion of my dream had meant, but said I should join the crusade on Chardok to recover lost books. 
<p></p>
It was the moment I had been waiting for. The legions of Crusaders, Troopers, Mystics, Swiftails, and Warloks were departing for the Burning Woods to retake our library from the Sarnak swarms, and their crumbling lair, Chardok. We left later that day. 
<p></p>
In Chardok, the Lair of the Higher Sarnaks, built into a large mountain, we fought with every breath we had. In the library, Loremaster Piza'Tak Grand LoreMaster Di`Korr hid from our attack. I guess they knew why we were there. I pryed the History of Greenmist from the Loremaster's body, and after our raid on the Sarnak Stench-hole, returned to Cabilis. 
<p></p>
Librarian Zimor, "Thank you for returning this tome, Krikk. It was scribed before my existance. "
<p></p>
he held the book briefly, and looked lost in it's pages. 
<p></p>
"Here, Knight, take this to Prime Heirophant Qxyn downstairs. we've been waiting for the Shaman's visions to materalize." 
<p></p>
I took the note to Oxyn, downstairs. The tribe of Mystics began to howl, and in a fury of excitment, Oxyn handed me a Vile of liquid. I asked what was inside the bottle, and he refered me to Alchemist Granika, who was near the recently over-taken Overthere Outpost. I traveled through Warslisk woods to The Overthere, and sure enough, waiting near the east wall of our old Outpost was Alchemist Granika. I introduced myself, and gave him the liquid. 
<p></p>
"Ahh, what's this, Krikk? A Bottle of Liquid Deklium...amazing. I hope you're prepaired to fight. I've noticed that the wretched Tier' Dal within our old Overthere Stronghold are planning the release of something unearthly. With this, I can see which of their Gollem's have within them that which you are looking for." 
<p></p>
After some time, a group of undead Troopers made their way into the open from within the Fort, surrounding a Cliff Gollem. After he was alone, we swarmed around the living earth, and with his death, found the shard of metal that the Alchemist spoke of, the Chunk of Tynnonium. Upon my return to Cabilis, I let Oxyn examine it. 
<p></p>
"Thank you" He raised the Chunk of Tynnonium above his head, and again went into a Trance. Shortly after, he brushed it off, stood in silence for a moment, and then quickly scribed a note for the Librarian. 
<p></p>
"I'm glad you've returned. This Tome has been most informative, and seemingly, the Sarnak Collective has been studying the Greenmist. However, it's not for them. Rile meant for us to wield it. For you to. Here are some notes I've written for the creation of Greenmist." 
<p></p>
The Notes from the Greenmist Tome read as follows: 
<p></p>
I made these notes from my interpretation of the Sarnak tome. Read them carefully. The weaponsmith who created the Greenmist still exists in some form. He has been tormented for a very long time and may not remember his art. If this is the case, there may still be some chance of recovering the design of the sacred blade. The key lies with the Lich-King's beloved. It is rumored the lich had a mirror created that allows his beloved Drusella to see her former self in its reflection. Perhaps this artifact can offer you some assistance in this quest. Several items will be needed to recreate the Greenmist Khukri. A special hammer was specifically created to fold and sculpt the weapon's blade. Both the Greenmist and this hammer were created on the same day. Only the year is know. The year was 1406. The tome mentions that the Sarnak were actively seeking the tool. The formula that will be needed to melt the Tynnonium is written in the back of this book. Use this book when you find the forge needed to create the Khukri. You will need a design pattern, the block of Tynnonium, the hammer, and this tome to create the Greenmist blade. To finish the weapon, you will need the Lord of Pain's Khukri, this tome, the hammer, the Greenmist blade, and a Greenmist shard or fragment. We have not found any Greenmist fragments. All items must be forged in the hottest of all forges, the Forge of Dalnir. May the will of Cazic -Thule guide you. 
<p></p>
After some rest, Tsaer, my shaman friend, and I ventured to the Sarnak's other outpost near the Lake of Ill Omen. After some journey, we had fought our way into the fort. The small reinforcment of Sarnaks were weak at best, and with the death of one, Tsaer took an Iksar Skull from the lifeless Sarnak. At the far end of the Fort, there's a room with elite sarnak guards stationed there. We had guessed they were guarding someone or something important. After dispatching them individually, we found the hammer of 1406 on Weaponsmith Ko'zirr's carcass, which means the Sarnak were one step closer to achieving Greenmist's reconstruction than we were. 
<p></p>
Next, Tsaer, myself, and a small force of Iksar troopers made our way to Howling Stones, to find the lost love of Venril Sathir. After we brought her second death, one lucky trooper found a necklace that supposibly granted a physical supperiority to it's wearer. Some speculated it's authenticity. However, lying in her decrepit remains was also a Mirror. I brought this with me. 
<p></p>
The Sarnak inhabitants of Chardok were reportably bent on re-pilfering our recovered tome, Arch Duke Xog ordered a battalion of Cabilis's Knights to put an end to their attempts once and for all by striking their Highest Ranking members inside Chardok itself. Many Sarnak were slaughtered, including the Apprentice Herbalist. A pouch of trinkets was recovered by a lucky shadow knight who was on the raiding team, and he thought I'd be able to make use of the Greenish Metal Shard within. I thanked him. 
<p></p>
Next, I traveled to Karnor's Castle, the home of Venril's Spirit, and the minions he has control over. The kingdom was in the middle of the Dreadlands, a wasteland that lived up to it's title. Many fighters were already there warding off the beasts inside. I made my way to the Drovlog Captain's chambers, and suddenly felt a piercing instinct from deep inside. I looked into the adjacent room, and almost as easily as breathing, uncovered some filfth to find a broken sword. I felt the same feeling as I did in my dream. 
<p></p>
Deep inside Dalnir, where I forged the Dagger earlier, existed a wandering spirit, that of Dalnir himself. Remembering the greenmist notes, I showed him the Mirror of Self Loathing from Drusila, and he gazed into it. With a brief pause, muscle, bone, and scale materalized once again over his spirit. 
<p></p>
He let lose an unearthly scream at his rebirth, and breathed hard. When he was able, he spoke to me, "I've seen Rile, heard his urgent cries in my nightmares. How I wish to be in the land of the dead, to see him and our kind once again. Why have you brought me back, young knight?" 
<p></p>
I explained my task, and the mirror droped. I quickly retrieved it off the ground. 
<p></p>
"I see...return to me with a quill and partchment, Rile's old Blade, and that very mirror. I'll write you plans to fully restore the blade I once had a part in making." 
<p></p>
Reluctantly, I traveled back home, ripped off some parchment and grabbed a quill-pen, and returned with Rile's Broken Blade. I gave all four items, including the mirror, to the appiration of Dalnir. As soon as me remateralized, he began to scribe without a word. After, he silently handed me the notes he had made, smiled, and then dissapeared. I hope s in a place of peace. 
<p></p>
The notes instructed me to put the Greenmist Design Pattern, Tynnonium , the hammer of 1406, and Notes from Greenmist Tome into the creation of the blade. I did so, in the hottest forge. As in the design, the blade was realitivly basic looking, but resembled nothing I had ever seen in the Grand Iksar Arsenol. Rile must have been very proud of his impliments of destruction. 
<p></p>
Next, I gathered together the newly crafted Greenmist Khukri Blade , the Greenish Metal shard, Notes from Greenmist Tome, into the forge along with my Lord of Pain's Khukri, and forged them together with the Hammer of 1406. After the metal cooled, and the smoked disipated, I held in my hand something more beautiful than anything I had ever seen. The Unholy Khukri of Rile. Greenmist. The bane of the Shissar. Rile's wishes would not go unanswered. However, I was too tired to continue, and I fell into a deep sleep near the forge. When I awoke, a number of Kly Sarnaks had surrounded me. (I really need to sleep more at night) I glanced at my newfound weapon, and realizing it's strength, I smiled at my enemy.
