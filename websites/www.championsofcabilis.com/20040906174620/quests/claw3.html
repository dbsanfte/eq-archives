<p>Now onto the next quest in the series. Talk to Elder Patriarch Ixthal and...

<p>You say, 'i wish to continue training'

<p>Elder Patriarch Ixthal says 'That's the spirit. For your next task we will require you to show your skills at locating a [missing member] of the Patriarchs of Cabilis.'

<p>You say, 'what missing member'

<p>Elder Patriarch Ixthal says 'His name is Welgaz and he tends to roam the continent in search of a perfect training area. We have not heard back from him in a while now and we grow worried. You must now go forth and find him. Tell him I have sent you to find him.'

<p>Our lost little lizard is hiding out in warslik woods. Trotting over to Location -983.07, -1483.17, 275.60 you find the hungry lost iksar. 

<p>You say, 'ixthal sent me'

<p>an injured traveller says 'Oh, has he now? I can't return yet, I do't have the strength. If you were to [help] me I think I might be able to make it back though.'

<p>You say, 'i will help you'

<p>an injured traveller says 'Good. I have not eaten in a while so I will ask you to get me some Legion Lager and Noodles for my journey back.'

<p>The recipes for the items in question are:

<p>Legion lager: blood water, giant blood sack, deadbone barley. and bottle.

<p>Noodles: water, egg, and flour in an oven.

<p>After feeding his face our lizard says: 'You have returned with what I asked for. Here, take this note back to Ixthal and let him know I am safe and will be making the return trip soon.'

<p>He gives you a note that you turn in with your previous claw to recieve:
