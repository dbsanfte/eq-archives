Talk to Drill Master Vygan in Fortress Talishan. It seems that there is an Iksar traitor who keeps secreting the froglok slaves to freedom in the swamps. The demanding Drill Master does not like this, and wants you to acquire the head of the Iksar traitor and the fife of the Froglok escort. Give him these items, along with your Partisan Pike, and you will receive the Militia Pike. Froglock escorts are found in the Swamp. They drop the fife and a bixle berry pie. There is a baker named Klok Unlar next to the bank who talks about the pie. Give him the pie and he will discover that his apprentice Bugrin the Gatherer has been using it to smuggle with the froglocks. Bugrin will spawn outside the shop and start to run away. I highly recomed having SOW on or getting help. He's almost as fast as SOW. Hunt him down and kill him and you will get an Iksar Traitor's Head. Turn that into the Drill Master along with the fife and your partisan pike for the Militia Pike (Damage 9, Delay 46. AC 2).
