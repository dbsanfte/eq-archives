<font size="3" face="comic sans ms">First, you must find Prime Patriarch Vuzx at the Temple of Terror, which is the Shaman/ Shadow Knight guild located between the Bank ( the Block ) and the zone to the Field of Bone. Enter the glowing wall teleporter on either side of ToT enterance, and turn around and enter one of the two doorways. Give the Summons Note to Prime Patriarch Vuzx and hear what he has to say..... 
<p></p>
      Prime Patriarch Vuzx says, 'The Hierophants have sensed that your spirit is strong with obedience inspiring fear! You must learn to harness your [powers] over the scaled wolves! Wear this tunic so that the Legion of Cabilis will recognize you as a Scaled Spiritist.' 
<p></p>
(You gain a Dusty Green Tunic* (AC 2), your faction with the Scaled Mystics and Legion of Cabilis got better, and some Xp which equals a half a bub.) 
<p></p>
      You say,  what powers 
<p></p>
      Prime Patriarch Vuzx says, 'A Patriarch of Cabilis must learn to survive the hard way, by heading into the wild lands and mastering the creatures that reside in them. First you must begin to defeat even the most insignificant of nuisances. Go from this temple and return to me with four Leech Husks that have been skinned from the creatures by your own claws.' 
<p></p>
      Leech Husks drop off both Swamp Leeches and Giant Swamp Leeches ( lvl 1 to lvl 5 ). There are two places where you can find these creatures. Their main home is in the Swamp of No Hope zone in its newbie area around the Gate. You can also find them in the sewers of Cabilis, this enterance is located under the main boat dock in East Cabilis. 
<p></p>
      Return the four Leech Husks to Prime Patriarch Vuzx and you gain better faction with the Scaled Mystics and the Legion of Cabilis, Xps, and the Patriarch's Bracer ( AC 3, HP + 2 )
