<font size="+1" face="comic sans ms">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This quest is only worth doing if you are seriously into questing in Everquest. The reward is poor and the time required is great. This is the point when most Shaman stop their questing. If you think you have the dedication read on.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you finish the previous quest, Hierophant Oxyn says, 'We are in your debt.  You are truly one who shall collect all the lost ancient skulls.  Take your weapon.  Go to Hierophant Zand and he shall guide you further.  Tell Hierophant  Zand "I am the chosen savior" and he closes his eyes and bows before you. "I am honored to meet the one who shall pledge his life to the return of the Skulls of the Ancients.  However, I must see proof of our prowess as of yet.  Go to the outlands and retrieve one Froglok Hexdoll, and no, they are not found on Frogloks.  They are shaman dolls made by the goblin tribe."  
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This doll is found in Warslick's Wood. Zone in from West Cabilis and head immediately to your left. Once you get off the pavement you will come to a semi-open area with lots of low level mobs.  Keep killing everything there and eventually you will see a Goblin Hextracer spawn. He's an easy kill at this level and will drop the Froglok Hexdoll you need.  Return the doll to Hierophant Zand and he gives you a note to give to Crusader Quarg.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crusader Quarg is found on the top level of one of the buildings in the Cabilis area of the Field of Bone. Hand him the note and he gives you a six slot container and tells you to go to the Tower of Kurn and bring him the Skulls of the Caste of Bone Bretheren, a caste of powerful shamans who perished fighting undead in the Field of Bone several decades ago.  You are to get the skulls of the 5 Caste members along with the Skull of the Leader.  
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these skulls drop off the Undead Crusader.  They are called Iksar Skull with an X. You need 1 lore skull (The Leader) and 5 non-lore skulls.  The Undead Crusader is an ultra rare mob. I camped him for about 15 hours to get one skull though admittedly not in one sitting.  He spawns in 2 locations. One is the stairs that lead to the dining room at the top of Kurn's, the other is the also near the top on the stairs leading up to the Barracks.  The only way to get him to spawn is to continually kill every skeleton up there till he eventually pops. He is about lvl 14 so not as difficult as the Greater Scalebones you will be killing to get him to spawn.  He also drops a FS Morning Star with the Skull which is ironically a better weapon in damage/delay ration than the reward for this quest. They can be sold for around 10pp so combine that with all the bone chips you'll collect and you can make some money on this one. 
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Quest is maddening in how poorly it was thought out.  After repeatedly trying to get a response from Verant on this one I did receive a short word from Gordon at one point saying it would be looked into. I have heard that GM Aradiel has upped the spawn time of the Crusader and I pray for my brethren that this is the case. Regardless, dmg/dly ratio of your new weapon (shown below) is not usuable by the time you'd aquire it.  My advice on this one is to make a button with /auction wtb Iksar Skull with an X.  This is the only way I completed this one eventually buying them up for 40pp per just to say I did it heh heh. I'm sure they can be purchased easily for 5pp though.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once you have the one lore and five non-lore skulls with an X put them in the box Crusader Quarg gave you. It will change into a C.O.B.B. box. Hand that into Crusader Quarg along with your cudgel and you will receive Iron Cudgel of the Mystic.
