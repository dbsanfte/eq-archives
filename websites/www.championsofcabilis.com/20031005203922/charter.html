<font size="4" face="comic sans ms">We
are those that call Cabilis our home. Once a forgotten race, we have now arisen
to claim back our lost honor. With the recent incursion into our lands by the
other races, we can expect many perils on our journeys as we venture forth into
the lands...........We are <font color=red>The Champions of Cabilis!</font><br><br>

<font size="4" face="comic sans ms"> Rules:</font><br><br>
<br><font size="4" face="comic sans ms"><li>The Champions of Cabilis Reside on the Nameless Server. Your character must be on the Nameless</font><br>
<br><font size="4" face="comic sans ms"><li>Except in special cases prospective members must be of the 15th rank to be considered.</font><br><br>
<font size="4" face="comic sans ms" ><LI>Obide by Verant's 'Play Nice Rules', ie. no KSing, Ninja Looting, etc.</font><br>
<br><font size="4" face="comic sans ms"><li>Help your brethren when they call for help, provided you are able.</font><br>
<br><font size="4" face="comic sans ms"><li>Conduct yourself as a 'Champion' would at all times.</font><br>
<br><font size="4" face="comic sans ms"><li>No swearing in the guild channel, if you wanna /tell your friends stuff like that fine, but not in the
public window.</font><br>
<br><font size="4" face="comic sans ms"><li>Share information with your brethren, quests, strategy and so forth.</font><br>
<br><font size="4" face="comic sans ms"><li>No begging.</font><br>
<br><font size="4" face="comic sans ms"><li>Do not use /anon. Use /roleplay instead. You should be proud of your guild. /roleplay allows people to see your guild tag but not your level and class. </font><br>
<br><font size="4" face="comic sans ms"><li>No account sharing! You were invited into the Champions because of you, not your friend who knows your account info. If you are showing someone the game with your character go anon.</font><br>
<br><font size="4" face="comic sans ms"><li>Have fun when you play !</font><br>
<br><font size="4" face="comic sans ms"><li>We Shall only accept members of the one true strong race - The Iksar</font><br>
<br><font size="4" face="comic sans ms"><li>We shall try to RP in a manner that shows that we feel our land has been stolen and we wish it returned.
This doesn't include senseless insults to players of other races beyond the
point of good fun. Use your judgement here, if people are getting generally
pissed off then relax, apologize and move on.</font><br>
<br><font size="4" face="comic sans ms"><li>Whenever possible we shall
provide discounts on items to fellow members. This can be done through trade
skills or surplus items. Overcharging a guild member is a serious crime if you
are in the know when you do it.</font><br>
