<li><font face="comic sans ms" size="3">I have signed on to help update the web page more frequently. I will be working on updating the structure of the site to make it easier to update. I hope to add some new sections too. for example a spot for iksar related fan fiction. more things are in the planning. click on in and enjoy your stay. : )</p> <p> Ishy Drackos

<p><font size="3" color="white" face="courier new">Monday June 3rd, 
        2002</font>      <li><font face="comic sans ms" size="3">As my lack of updates clearly shows, I've been playing a lot of Morrowind lately. In fact in the interests of keeping this site up to date and current I am going to try to find a guild member to help out with web duties on this page. I am in a semi-retired state these days and I think the webpage suffers as a result. Any guild members who are interested, email me and we can talk about it. The pic of the week was sent in by Scalis. It's from one of the weekly Kael raids that have been going on lately. Giant killing has always been a good time. I updated the members page a little too, had a lot of those profiles waiting to go up.<br></font>
