<font size="3" color="white" face="courier new" >  Sunday December 31st, 2000</b><br></font>
<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>Well guys, site has been down over a week. I have it up at www.getwebready.com right now as a temporary fix. Our old domain name championsofcabilis.com is sitting in limbo right now as I"m not technically the owner of it. I will try to sort that out or come up with a better fitting domain name for us. I'll be updating the page as usual at this URL and I'll keep you posted on any changes. I'm going to start on a massive cleanup of the members list so if your name isn't there and it should be send me in your info.  Happy New Years, please go out and don't stay at home playing EQ! heh heh <br></font>

<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>Went through the members list today. It is a bit outdated so I reorganized it some. There is also a post on the General Forum listing all the members I will be removing who don't tell me or have someone tell me. Also I've changed the look so that those without a profile are lower on the list, a little incentive to get me a pic and a profile. I would like to institute a new policy whereby new members must provide the basic info or post once on the message board or lose their member status. Got too many players who aren't getting involved. I'd like to get a Velious event going for those down there on Dec.23rd. I've got the whole day off so I was thinking a raid on the Tower of Frozen Shadow may be in order.<br></font>

<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>Terribly sorry for the lack of updates over the past week. Been quite busy at work. More and more of us are arriving on the new Icy Continent of Velious. So far it has been a real treat, I encourage anyone above lvl 30 to head on down. The Coldain Dwarves have been very accomodating and seemed to geniunely care when I explained the plight of our people.  I'm looking to get something going for December 23rd as I have the whole day to play EQ, I'm up for any kind of Christmas raid or event you guys want so get those ideas cracking. Implemented a new background and I'm hoping to do a bit of a design overhaul in the next few weeks, let me know any ideas you have that way too.<br></font>

<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>My apologies that the site was down all day today. It's looking like I may be getting it hosted on a more stable server in the next week or so.  I signed us up with a new Everquest service. It's called <a href="http://www.eqsites.com"> EQ Sites.<a> Basically it's a banner system that doesn't pay us any money.  It shows banners from the ring of sites signed up with them. The more views we get the more times our add shows up on other peoples sites.  You'll see the banner at the bottom of the screen, please check out some of the EQ sites you'll see on that banner over time. So far the Velious count is up to Belfior, Jedielder, and myself.   When are you coming down to the coldness?  Remember Iksar have the same faction as everyone else there, it's a pleasant change. </font><br>

<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>The Scars of Velious hit the stores yesterday and so far a few of us have gotten a copy.  I wasn't able to get there last night but Jedielder told me of his adventures. I set off for the Icy Continent this morning and had quite an adventure.  We Iksar are not KOS there so that's a pleasant surprise.  I've posted all the screenshots I took this morning <a href="pics3.html"> HERE.</a>  Take a look and get yourself a copy, I think we shall enjoy these icy new lands and perhaps find a friendly land outside of Kunark.<br></font>

<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>VICTORY! The Champions of Cabilis were victorious in their defense of our fair city yesterday versus the 7th Legion. This was an excellent event I'm sure for both sides.  We had a force or near 40 Champions, the most online at one time ever.  We gathered our forces by the large Iksar statues in the Lake of Ill Omen.  After some wrangling, war was declared on both sides and the battle began. It was fast, furious, and extremely laggy but a heck of a lot of fun.  Each group had a target and executed well.  I was taken down by Fortenbras wolf but he too would fall soon after.  One of their druids did escape and try kiting us but in the end The Legion conceded victory to the Iksar. Congratulations to all those who came out, it was a great job by all.  Cazic is proud of his chosen ones on this day.  Pics of the event can be found <a href="pics2.html"> HERE</a>  Thanks for those who sent them in.  Now we must not grow too content, it is time to plan our next event.</font><br>

<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>I've changed the news format today. If you want to see any of the older news click on the link for the month at the top and you will have the news for that specific month. Just a way of keeping the front page a little more trim.  Our upcoming guild war is featured in the news items on <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/">EQ VAULT</a> the biggest EQ news site out there. Rejoice in our fame Champions, you've worked hard for it.  Now rest up for battle.<br></font>
