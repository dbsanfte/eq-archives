Who:	Xlixinar Arcut		<br>
Additional Zones: Cabilis East Kurn's Tower <br>		
Related Creatures: Grand Master Glox 		<br>
Xlixinar Arcut says 'You must first learn focus before being awarded the legionnaire scale helm. The Swifttails are the masters of focus and as such you will learn from the Grand Master of the Court. It has been so long, I do not know who is Grand Master now. Whoever it is, give him this note and follow his instruction. Once you have learned, return to us and the helm will be yours. <br><br>

Grand Master Glox sits whispering incoherently for a long moment before even regarding the note you dropped in front of him. The Grand Master suddenly snatches up the note from Xlixinar, removes a small charcoal marker from a belt pouch, and scrawls some intructions upon it. He drops the note immediately after finishing and resumes his meditation without a word. <br><br>

The note reads: <br><br>

"Glox's Instructions <br><br>

Atop the ancient tower of Kurn lives a mole. This mole has unwittingly taught the Swifttails much. It has taught us focus. Go into the tower, sit and meditate near his burrow, and settle yourself. When it peers out to look for food, use all of your pent up ferocity and kill the mole quickly. Upon its neck will be a collar. Return to me the collar and 2 star rubies and I will give you my reference for the Arcut." Reward(s): Trooper Scale Helm<br>
The mole spawns every 60 minutes in the top floor of Kurns. Hand it in with the 2 star rubies to Glox, he gives you a reference. Give the reference and a banded helm to Xlixinar Arcut and you'll receive the helm.
