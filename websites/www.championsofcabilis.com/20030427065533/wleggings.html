Drixiv Arcut says 'Our legs move us forward. If we move with hesitance we will surely fall and leave our charge exposed. Before you can wear the greaves, you must learn from the Brood of Kotiz. For if they did not wield their powers over the dead with confidence, their life forces would be sucked from them instantly, leaving them empty husks. Take this note to the Harbinger and listen to his instructions. <br><br>

Harbinger Glosk snatches the note out of your hands, obviously irritated. After reading a few lines, he glances up at you, his brow furrowed, then looks down again to continue reading. When he's finished, he hands the note back to you and takes a deep breath, shuddering slightly. He then says, 'Xydoz. Take this to Xydoz. He will test you.' The Harbinger watches you carefully as you leave. <br><br>

Master Xydoz snatches the paper from your hand and hisses in anger. Without even looking at the paper he growls, 'WHAT?! What is this tra...' He stares down at the paper, mouth hanging open wide in disbelief. He finally continues, saying, 'Very well, then. If you wish to know confidence I have a task for you. Our hated enemies, the sarnak, have a tome we have sought to return to our libraries for centuries. At this point, we believe it to be found in a small fortress they maintain near the Great Lake. One of their scholars will most likely have it on their person. Bring it to me along with two star rubies. <br><br>
The advisor spawns just to the right of the chancellor.
