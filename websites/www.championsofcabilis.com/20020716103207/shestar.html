<font size="+1" face="comic sans ms">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an excellent quest to complete in your early levels. It give you a decent helm which has the black antlered look which is the coolest in my opinion.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you hail Trooper Shestar, one of the troopers at the Cabilis gate in the Field of Bone he will tell you about his family's scaled coif helm.  He wants some money and wolf scales.  Give him 5gp and any loose wolf scales you get while hunting wolves in the Field of Bone. In return he gives you Shestar's Unfinished Coif.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tells you how to finish the coif too.  You take it to a forge in Cabilis, add three wolf scales (dropped by wolves in the FoB) combine with the unfinished coif and voila you will have created Shestar's Scaled Coif. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Important things to note. Do not use water in this recipe, just 3 scales and the unfinished coif. Also you need to have some blacksmithing skill to do this. Not much but at least 5 I'd say. Dump some training points in and you'll be fine.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here's the result:
