Additional Zones: Cabilis East 		<br>
Related Creatures: Harbinger Glosk Master Rixiz 	<br>	
Drixiv Arcut says 'You wish the boots worn by the ancients? Then you must first master the virtue of confidence. For our brothers of the dead, confidence is the virtue that allows them to control the forces that would tear them apart if they knew it not. When a warrior steps, he must be confident, for a weak step cannot crush your enemies. Take this note to the current Harbinger in Cabilis and learn from him. <br><br>

Harbinger Glosk hisses and says venomously, 'And I am disturbed yet again. I hope for your sake it is important.' The gaunt necromancer looks down at the paper in his hands and after reading a few lines gasps, then falls into a violent coughing fit. After recovering he takes a deep breath, puffs his chest out and hands the paper back to you. With his head held high, he says in a raspy voice, 'Show this to Rixiz. He will test you.' <br><br>

Master Rixiz takes the note and after reading a few lines opens his eyes wide in astonishment. He looks up at you and stares at you a while before he says, 'You spoke to the Brothers? A common soldier such as yourself interested in silly stories to frighten broodlings? Fine, then. You shall know confidence, if you live. If you have the strength to stride into a lair, go before the owner, and kill that thing in its own home, you will acquire a small part of the virtue we as necromancers must master to ply our art. In the Frontier Mountains lives a unit of the troublesome burynai. Invade their home and destroy their leader. Bring me proof and two fire emeralds.' <br><br>
There is a cave in Frontier Mnts and the Burnai is Snaork. Hes in pretty deep and surrounded by Burnai. <br><br>
