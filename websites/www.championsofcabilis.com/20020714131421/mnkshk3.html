Shackle of Stone (min level 8)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To prove that you are true to the cause of the Swifttail, you must perform
the task of cleansing. Ask Master Raska about the Shackle of Stone, and
receive your mission to hunt the Iksar Bandits, and return their masks. 
<br><br>
Iksar Bandits - Around level 9 in the Field of Bone pit. Get the two masks. 
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Return the Masks and your Shackle of Dust (remember that shackle, the one
that should have been in your bank until you reach Level 6 so not to lose it
due to corpse delay?) and Shackle of Clay, to get your new  Shackle of
Stone!  If you lost your shackle of dust beforehand, make a new Iksar monk
and then turn in the shackle of dust, then log on your main monk and turn in
the rest of the items.
