<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>The past weekend was a good one for the Champions. Our raid on Chardok on Saturday went very smoothly. We had nearly 2 full groups there of high levels and got some help from a kind Cleric in Allanh and his SK partner Jarroth. Kristana got a Sarnak Battle Shield while Sabassis picked up a Bard Only sword of great value.  Everyone listened and had a great time.  Sunday Chable moved within striking distance of his epic by finishing of the MoB in Nurga. Only the Lake of Ill Omen showdown for him which should be a great event.<br></font>

<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>Congratulations to Kilanik on being promoted to officer, this guy has been a Champion a long time and always there to help out his fellow Champs. Bug him with any issues or problems that arise!  This weekend should be fun filled. Tomorrow we are going to try to raid Chardok at 12PM PST 3PM EST. We need 2 groups minimum so show up if you are 46plus.  On Sunday Chable needs people's help again. This time closer to home in the good ol' Mines of Nurga. Epic Mob nasty fight, 2 groups needed. Updated the members page a bit, been slacking on the page all week.<br></font>

<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>Congrats to Chable for getting one step closer to his Epic. This guy is focussed on his mission, help him out whenever you get a chance!  I am continuing my Tailoring work and now can make all Wu's Fighting Armour for our monks, let me know what pieces you need.<br></font>

<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>Raid on the Plane of Growth went well last night. We were able to recover Bhayne's corpse with the help of our trusted allies Brothers of Darkness. This weekend Chable will be leading a foray into the Plane of Air to work on his epic. Time is Sunday 6PM PST 9PM EST. Help the brutha out! Have a good weekend all<br></font>

<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>Raid central the past few days. Final Redemption and Champions of Cabilis went up to PoG 2 more times on the weekend as well we hit Fear with Brothers of Darkness last night. We have really come a long way when I see how many high levels we have out there participating.  Updated the pic of the week today. This is hilarious. Kristana, Kilanik, Kisacki and myself all witness this lollipop floating around the head of the Thurgadin banker, we had to pose. Enjoy <br></font>

<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>Excellent raid last night with Final Redemption on the Plane of Growth. Big thanks to Jarnak and Sasraaz for including us on that. Hopefully it will be the start of a great relationship between the two guilds.  Daikoku's Shadow Knight Tanking Guide returns to the guides section after some re-writes, thanks Daikogu.  Time to look ahead to a Champions sponsored event lets get something going for sometime in the next couple weeks.<br></font>

<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>The Guild Bank officially opened yesterday. Zardossk is our guild banker, check the new section of the forum titled Guild Bank for more info on how this will work. Thanks Zardossk for taking on the task.  For any Champions who were stuck up in Hate last night when the server went down we are making a retrieval run today, be in BoD's Chat room at 4PM EST Today. Updated the members list heavily today. For the first time in a long time Monks are behind Shaman for most members. Now we can make Shaman jokes! New pic of the week featured Cradossk and the Tangrin.<br></font>

<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>25,000 Hits this webpage has gotten now in it's year of existence. Makes me very very proud. A lot of scaled surfers have dropped by to say hi and get info from us. We should all be proud as a guild. Having it as my homepage didn't hurt either =p. This weekend is Cradossk's RL birthday so look for him to show up drunk a few times.  Cleaned up the members list a little more and added a couple profiles today. Send em in if you haven't already. Have a great weekend!<br></font>

<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>Put up the new pic of the week. It features Chabasrn having some fun with newbies. He used voice graft on his pet skeleton and tricked some people, pretty funny Chabasrn! <br></font>
