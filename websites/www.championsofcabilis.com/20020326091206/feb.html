<font size="3" color="white" face="courier new" >  Tuesday February 27th, 2001</b><br></font>
<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>This Sunday at 3PM PST/6PM EST we are raiding Mistmoore to destroy Black Dire.  Proof of his death is required to advance further in the Epic Quest that Ishy and Cradossk are working on. Tsumak of the Harbingers of Death who also needs this to advance and will be bringing a group from his guild as well.  Black Dire is an extremely mean wolf and it will take 2 strong groups of players low 40's to 50's to smack him down.  Mistmoore is however an excellent mid-level raid area.  Check out this <a href="http://www.eqatlas.com/mistmoore.html">link</a> to learn more. All are welcome to attend. Tipsy has offered to port members with his Wizard from the Field of Bone.  Lvl 20-35ish players will have to organize themselves into groups when there though as I will be focused on the death of Black Dire.  If someone would like to step up to organize that please let me know on the boards. Also confirm if you can make it.<br></font>

<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>It was a good weekend for the Champions.  On Friday night a small group of us raided The Temple of Droga. This pit of Goblin evil was laid to waste by a group of us until they ganged up in mass numbers to repel us.  On Sunday Night we had a raid on Kaesora. Excellent turnout for this one as we had over 20 people out.  It was overkill really as nothing stood in our way. Thanks to those from Brothers of Darkness and Hand of Mana who assisted us. Got a couple pics of both events up. Unfortunately I went LinkDead after we had obliterated the Library. My provider apparently had placed bets on the minions of Xalgoz and didn't want me to compete. I was unable to get internet access for the next 3 hours. My apologies.  In other news we got our 10,000th hit on our webpage today. Hurray! Thanks for spreading the word everyone.<br></font>
<font size="3" color="white" face="courier new" >  Thursday February 15th, 2001</b><br></font>
<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>Put up some new profiles on the members page, thanks to Miracht, Mthisu, Tsureal, and Jennyr for the info. <font color="red">IMPORTANT:</font> The Kaesora raid on Sunday has been moved to <font color="red">7PM PST/10PM EST.</font> I know this is a little late but many higher level members indicated that this would be the only time that'd work for them.  I understand if it's too late for those who are 30 plus to come out, hopefully we can still put together a couple of kick-ass groups.  See you there :)<br></font>
<font size="3" color="white" face="courier new" >  Monday February 12th, 2001</b><br></font>
<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>Great news for the higher level Champions!  The Brothers of Darkness are planes capable and have extended an open invite for any Champions who'd like to go. If you are lvl 46 or higher and interested their next raid is on The Plane of Fear, home of our Mighty Lord Cazic-Thule.  The dates for this are February 24th and 25th. Sign up for it on their events board <a href="http://pub32.ezboard.com/bbrothersofdarkness">here.</a>  This is a great opportunity for those interested to learn multi-group style battling. This is the reason many of the high levels pushed so hard for an alliance so please take this opportunity. I won't be high enough level at that point myself.  In other news I would like to announce a raid on Kaesora for this Sunday at 7PM PST/ 10PM EST. This is for everyone lvl 30 plus that is interested. If we can put together 2 full groups there will be nothing to stand in our way of clearing the place and hopefully getting some nice items.<br></font>
<font size="3" color="white" face="courier new" >  Tuesday February 6th, 2001</b><br></font>
<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>Did a few updates today. Asmotiz, Necriite and Mebrnu both sent in their profiles so I posted those up. How's everyone's schedule looking for Friday night? Hoping we get a good turnout for the Arena battles with BoD, let me know if you can make it.<br></font>
<font size="3" color="white" face="courier new" >  Saturday February 3rd, 2001</b><br></font>
<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>We have formally been invited to an event being held by <a href="http://www.thebod.org">Brothers of Darkness.</a> They are having a mighty gathering at the Arena just outside of Lake Rathetear in Antonica.  There will be duelling, drinking and trading going on. They have promised to help us with transport as it is a bit far from our homelands. The date and time for the event is Feb 9th at 8:30PM EST/11:30PM PST.  I realize this is a bit late for many of you but I hope we can get a good turnout. I'll keep you posted on any news on getting TPs.  Also I archived the news from December to make the page less cluttered.<br></font>
<font size="3" color="white" face="courier new" >  Wednesday January 31st, 2001</b><br></font>
<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>Great news Champions! We have formed an official alliance with the Brothers of Darkness on this fine day.  They are a great guild of similar size to ourselves but with a more more varied membership. This will allow us to go on raids we would be unable to do without their help, i.e. Planes, etc.  Hopefully this will work out well for both guilds.  I would expect you to treat all of their members as well as we treat our own. If they ask favours of you please do your best to help them out.  Hopefully we should have better access to Ressurections and Teleports as a result too.  If you have any questions please feel free to ask. Also check out their webpage <a href="http://www.thebod.org">HERE</a> Drop by and say hi!<br></font>
