<font size=3 color=yellow face="Comic Sans MS">


Following the traditions from the proud days when the Faceless ruled Kunark, The Ashikaga Ryu maintains a deep reverence for the bow. As a spell casting tank many may ask the use for a bow, and the ever-present money pit, arrows.<p></p>
Remember back to the seasons of yore, as a Pawn of Greenmist. Until your 9th season, you have no spells, and for most of that season they difficult to cast and fail often. 
<p></p>
Not learning the art of meditation until the 12th season limits the usefulness of spells as your recovery time is bad. After the 12th season, for a little investment, your bow will be able to draw the attention of your foe from beyond your spells range.
<p></p>
A) It matters not how wide the barn is.<br>
First thing to remember with archery, that besides ego purposes, it doesn't matter if it hits or not. The Shadow Knight is capped at 75, so a Darkness/Fear Bow kiting (even with pet) will not be practical, especially if you do not have others supplementing your income.

Given that understanding one sees the path of a bow as a tool to aggravate your foe into running to a place of your choosing instead of his. This happens if your opponent is just shot at.<p></p>

B) The wise archer knows when not to draw.<br>
A bow is not good in all places, know your surroundings:<br><br>
Narrow caves and tunnels with moving creatures: Bad<br>
Open places with creatures just standing around: Good<br>
Open places with moving creatures: Risky.<br>
Hilly areas: Hard.<br><br>

Good places for bows:<br>
Mountain Giant Fort: FM<br>
Forest Giant City: WW<br>
Spiderling Grotto: FOB<br>
Bandit Camp: SONH<br><br>

Hard to use/but good places for a bow:<br>
The goblin fields around NE WW.<br>
Soloist's Valley: FOB<br>
The Ledge: OT <br>
The wilds of FM<br>
Sarnak Fort: LOIO<br><br>

Bad places for bows:<br>
Mines Of Nurga<br>
Kurns Tower<br>
<br>
Bows are more sensitive to elevation than spells, so using a bow in hilly terrain is likely to get you a lot of "You are too far Above/Below your target." messages. Learning positioning is crucial in those areas.<br><br>
C) The arms of a Crusader, the tools of an Artisan:<br><br>

<font size="+1" color="8F3B29"face="comic sans ms"><b></b><p></p>PRACTICAL IKSAR SK FLETCHING<br><br>
<font size=3 color=yellow face="Comic Sans MS">

During your first seasons hunting Newbie hill, save up at least 6-8 PP and some practice points (12.) If at level 5 you invest your first point in fletching, your skill will be 5, add the 11 others and your first arrows are trivial for you (Though you will still fail at it for a while.) 
<br><br>
For a bow, go to the Warriors Guild, find Granthrow, (505, -305) and buy a Long Bow the range/cost factor is unbeatable, with only Oak and Darkwood being able to beat it's range. The damage done doesn't cut it, but that doesn't mean anything, the Bow is a pulling tool, not a damage machine. (Cost 4pp 5gp 8sp 2sp)
<br><br>
Arrows are a different matter, parts for the cheapest hand made arrows are 2/3rd to 1/2 as much as the Basic Arrows from the Warriors Guild and the resulting arrows have +25 more range. The money you save will cover a lot of failures.  [A]
<br><br>
To make Arrows find Zotalz (350,520) in with the merchants to the far right side of the zone as you pass the Nerco Guild in West Cabilis. This is the corner across from the entrance to Warsilk's Wood. Buy from him a fletching kit, the book on fletching, and 20 of the following:
<br><br>
Field Point, Wood shaft, Round Cut Fletch, and Large Nock. You are now ready to make your arrows.
<br><br>
Clear you mind, /sit down, I for inventory, open a backpack and arrange for all 4 stacks of 20 components to be on the right hand side of your pack, open your Fletching Guide Book. Then open the Fletching Kit and move it as high on the screen you can, right next to the picture of yourself. Move the backpack contents window just to the left of that. Using the ctrl-click method (hold down the control key, click on the part) and move one item off of each stack to the fletching kit, click on the combine button.
<br><br>
Hopefully you made 5 arrows, if not keep trying, when you are holding your new arrows click on the picture of you on the right to put them in an inventory slot. Repeat that while you have supplies.
<br><br>
In your early skill building arrows you will want to use the arrows you practice to improve your skill as your ammo. This will change.
<br><br>
Until you get the "You can no longer increase your skill combining these items" messages, buy and combine the following:
<br><br>
Field Point, Wood Shaft, Round Cut Fletch, and Medium Nock (Trivial at 36)<br>
Field Point, Wood Shaft, Parabolic Fletch, and Large Nock (Trivial at 46)<br>
Field Point, Wood Shaft, Round Cut Fletch, and Small Nock (Trivial at 56)<br><br>
At skill level 56 you can now make the equivalent of Flight Arrows (1 Dam/150 Rng) at drastically (1/10th the cost) of Flight Arrows. These will become your stock and trade for your carrier, with one possible exception. [B]
<br><br>
Until bone shafts go trivial at 68, you may want to save yourself the work of making multiple arrows batches and use the following components:
<br><br>
Field Point, Bone Shaft, Parabolic Fletch, and Small Nock (Trivial at 68 ) a 2/150 arrow.
<br><br>
Otherwise use:<br>
Field Point, Bone Shaft, Round Cut Fletch, and Large Nock (Trivial at 68 ) and sell back to vendor<br>
Field Point, Wood Shaft, Parabolic Fletch, and Small Nock as your ammo.<br><br>

The first option is more expensive, but less annoying.<br><br>
After skill level 68 you will want to split your arrow making into 'practice' and 'ammo' Sell the Practice ones to the vendor.<br>
Ammo being: Field Point, Wood Shaft, Parabolic Fletch, and Small Nock<br>
Practice Being: Field Point, Wood Shaft, Shield Fletch, and Large Nock (Trivial at 82)<br>
For your final Practices use: Hooked Point, Wood Shaft, Round Fletch, and Large Nock (Trivial at 102)<br>
Congratulations, you are now a Master Fletcher, can make your ammo with minimal, if any failures, and are done except for making ammo as needed.  With your 100 range Long Bow and 150 Range "Class 2 wood point" arrows you have a range of 250, which beats the 200 or so range of our spells.
<br><br>
But, if one hears the calling of Greenmist as a Broodling, yet truly loves the bow, you can continue further, fulfilling the true way of the Daikoku-Ryu, a Crusaider and an Artisan.
<br><br>

<font size="+1" color="8F3B29"face="comic sans ms"><b></b><p></p>THE TRUE ARTISAN<br><br>
<font size=3 color=yellow face="Comic Sans MS">

To start, follow the 'Practical' Path to skill 82.<br>
You may want to unify your practice and ammo recipes again to the following:<br><br>
Hooked Point, Wood or Bone Shaft, Parabolic Fletch, and Small Nock (Trivial at 102)<br>
This is expensive for your level, but may be less annoying and gives you a 2/150 (Wood Shaft) or 3/150 (Bone Shaft) ammo supply.<br><br>
At 102 you can switch your ammo arrows to: Field Point, Bone Shaft, Parabolic Fletch, and Small Nock (2/150)
<br><br>
Practice arrows at this point are: Field Point, Wood Shaft, Wood Vane, and Large Nock (Trivial at 122)<br>
Then practice using: Field Point, Ceramic shaft, Round Cut Fletch, and Large Nock (trivial at 135)<br>
<br>
At 135 (129 really) it is time to lose the Long Bow. Put together 61pp and make yourself a bow.<br>
Buy the Bowyers Guidebook, an Ash staff, and silk string from the Vendor Klok Grogon on Merchant Island in East Cabilis (135, -200.) Each attempt will cost about 20pp, so you'll have enough for three attempts. 
<br><br>
Clear your mind, /sit down, sacrifice a Froglok if you have one, put the book in a primary inventory slot, open it, open the Fletching Kit, put in a staff and a string, and hit combine.
<br>
Hopefully Cazic-Thule will bless you with a new bow, 100 range, 50 delay, and 14 damage.
<br><br>
One last stage in achieve the status of Artisan, a mere formality, is to go make a full 100 Hooked Point, Bone Shaft, Parabolic Fletch, and Small Nock Arrows (3/150), fill your quiver and ammo slot with them and walk out of Cabilis 100% Pawn Archery Gear Free.
<br><br>
Footnotes:<br>
Prices are for a newbie lvl 1 sk, 60 cha, no faction improvements.  Faction improvements and CHA enhansements will effect the price of the more expensive items.
<br>
<br>[A]1 'Arrow' costs 1 sp, where as an hand made basic arrow costs as low as 5cp, 4 components at 6cp each can yeild 5 arrows.
<br>[B]1 Flight Arrow costs 2gp 5sp 5cp, where as the hand-made [Field Point(6cp), Wood Shaft(6cp), Parabolic Fletch(3sp 2cp), Small Nock(5sp 1cp) per 5 arrrows] version can cost as little as 2sp each. 
<br><br>
Notes:<br>
Anyone serious about fletching should have <a href="http://members.bellatlantic.net/~ewj/fletchguide/index.htm">http://members.bellatlantic.net/~ewj/fletchguide/index.htm</a> Bookmarked as it is THE resource on the web. It continues on to discuss Oak and Darkwood bows and more. This guide here is not a replacement for Aoenla Darkwood's work, but a class/race specialization as every guide I have found assumes that if you have a bow, you're a Ranger.
