<font size="3" face="comic sans ms">You must first do the monk shackle quests. Once you finish with the steel shackle you need to do 3 tests. 
<p></p>
The first is in town with Grandmaster Glox. Say "I am Ready for the Trial of Agility". You then will have to fight him (he is light blue to a 59). He drops the Mark of Agility. 
<p></p>
Next there is an Iksar Monk in The Deep named Grandmaster Rinmark. You tell him "I am ready for the Trial of Patience" and he will say that you will know when it's the time to attack. Wait for a few minutes and he will change from GrandMaster to Master. Wait again and he will change from Master to just plain Rinmark. Kill him at that point. He is a little thougher than Glox. He drops a Mark of Patience 
<p></p>
The last test is in Kaesora. You must have the shackle of Steel for this. Take this Shackle to the library and look for a mob on the second floor called Tome Keeper. Hand him the shackle and he gives you a book. There are different books, so this step varies depending upon which book you get. The book tells you what item you need, where to get it and who to hand it to. Get that item and hand it into the person it tells you to in the book and you will receive the Mark of Mind. 
<p></p>
Once you have all 3 marks head to the Dreadlands and look for a monk named Veltar. He is near the FV zoneline on top of the ruins in the desert area. Hand him the 3 marks to get your shackle of Tynnonium. Once you have that shackle head over to Cabilis. Right next to the arena is an underground entrance and look for a monk hidden in there. Hand him the shackle and he tells you of a monk in Howling Stones that is looking for the legendary weapons. Head to Howling Stones and at the bottom floor head north and you will find a monk feigning death on the floor. Hail him and he hands you a Flayed Skin Tome and says he will not speak to anyone but a monk of the Final Rung. Give him your shackle of Tynnonium and you get it back along with some xp and a bag with 4 slots. He then tells you to head to the Plane of Fear and tell lord Cazic Thule that Gandan Has failed in his task. Now head to PoF and go up to Cazic and tell him that Gandan has failed in his task. You will recieave a book that tells you what you have to place in the bag. 
<p></p>
You then need to head to Feerott by the Fear Portal and talk to a new named gnome necro. She asks for specific things to try and reanimate some bones. Get what she asks for and give them to her. When you hand them in her attempt fails so she gives you back the bones. They ID as Remains of Zanfi. 
<p></p>
There is a small quest from the Cabilis monk guild that requires 2 torn halves for a note that you hand in to the master behind Glox and he gives you a Thin flute. Take this flute and hand it in to Brother Balathin in the Dreadlands and he spaws up as a pissed off version of himself -- lvl 61 and hits for a max of 240 and can be slowed. Once killed he drops another flute. That is your second piece. 
<p></p>
now head to Sebilis in the crypt area and look for a skeleton named Fallen Monk. Hand him in your shackle. It will keep it and spawn again as fallen monk master. Kill him and he drops slightly glowing fists. They ID as Thules Blessed fists. That is the 3rd item. 
<p></p>
The last peice is hard to get since you have to do the stupendous tome quest (sorry I don't have the details on this). Once you have that done, head to Trakanon's Teeth with the book and a Crusaders Coffin(Sold in Cabilis). Hand them in to Crusader Vragor (spawns at around n2800 p2785) He will then spawn a lvl 59 Giant Dino named Zhokar. Kill him and he will drop bones and some rare spells. Those bones ID as the Remains of Tynn. 
<p></p>
Combine all the bones in the bag and you will get the satchel of Cazic Thule. Then take the bag and the 2 tomes back to Cazic Thule and you recieve the Whistling fists.<center>
