<font size="+1" face="comic sans ms">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sarth Scarscale says 'Do you know the beasts that call themselves sarnaks? One such beast who calls itself Zorash attacked an envoy of merchants who were to deliver a pair of special boots to me. It taunts us by wearing them as a trophy. Bring me the skull of this Grachnist and the boots. Return them to me along with a star ruby and your banded greaves, and I shall craft you an excellent pair of greaves. 
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Skull of Grachnist drops off of Grachnist himself a nasty MOB I wouldn't think of soloing till you are in your low 40's. Get a partner he'll spawn at the Northernmost Goblin Camp in Warslick's Woods.  His skull only drops about one in 4 kills so this could be a long camp.  Zorash's boots drop of Zorash, a named Sarnak in the Overthere. He spawns close to the tower just south of where you zone in from Warslick's. Keep killing everything there and he should spawn once every few hours.
