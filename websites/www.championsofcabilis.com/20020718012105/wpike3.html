This is the Third Upgraded Warrior's Pike quest. <br><br>

Ask War Baron Eator about the memory of Sebilis and he takes a step back and thinks to himself. Phelegm dribbles off his lips. "The Memory of Sebilis. Kept within my personal chambers. They have been taken. Taken by some corakin' Forsaken no doubt!!! You have been sent to me because you show excellent prowess. Find my Memory and bring them to me with your Footman's Pike." The memory of Sebilis is in three parts: ruby, sapphire and emerald. The sapphire and emerald drop from the thickbone skeleton in Kurns tower. The ruby is obtained by combining the thickbone skeleton's skull and a forging hammer in a forge. Return these to him for the Soldier's Pike Plans. Then go and ask Weaponsmith Gurgle "what soldier's pike" and he will tell you how to make one. Follow his directions. You need to smith an iron rod, forging hammer, a soldier's pike head, and the soldier's pike plans. To get the pike head, you need to smith a geozite tool, raw pike head, and frontier fool's gold. All of the other items can be bought from the weaponsmith. The fool's gold can be foraged in the Frontier Mountains with some difficulty. Since the real gold and fool's gold are both named the same, when the nugget is found it should be identified. Doing this will get you the Soldier's Pike.
