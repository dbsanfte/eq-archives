<font size="+1" face="comic sans ms">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minimum Level 10.  Ask Master Rixiz in the Temple of Death about acquiring the Third Rank
Skullcap. He hands you a Glass Canopic and asks that you place inside of it
the brain of a Sarnak Crypt Raider (found in the Lake of Ill Omen), and
immediately combine it with Embalming Fluid. This requires the brewing and
smithing skills. To brew embalming fluid you need: 1 rubbing alcohol (can be
bought). 1 bone granite powder (combine in a forge 1 bone chip + 1 bone chip
+ 1 granite pebble + 1 forging hammer) and 2 bog juices (brew snake scales +
water flask + bottle). Combine it to get a preserved Sarnak Brain (no drop,
lore), and return it to him, and he will reward you with the Apprentice
Skullcap - 3rd rank.
