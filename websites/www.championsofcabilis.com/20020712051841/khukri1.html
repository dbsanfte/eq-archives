<font size="+1" face="comic sans ms">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hail and well met young Crusader.  We will outfit you with a new weapon yet. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  First stand and slough off the slime of your birth egg, come with me young 
one.  Do not fear, I mean to show you the way of Greenmist.  If you are 
strong and chosen by Cazic then you will eventually feel the power of the 
great Greenmist in your scaly hands.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you are born, you are also born with a note to turn into your 
guildmaster.  Hurry and quickly turn this in, for the master will impart to 
you an ancient Pawn's khukri. This marks you as a young pawn indeed.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take your pawns khukri and equip it, readying to bloody it in the Lake of 
Ill Omen. Speak to Lord Gikzic in our Temple of Terror and ask him about the 
knaves khukri.  The lord will give you a Sarnak Head Pack and will ask you 
to fill it with four Sarnak heads.  This quest is best done around your 5th 
level of life, possibly sooner with a partner.  Go now to the Lake of Ill 
omen and search for Sarnak hatchlings, do not pass the first set of houses 
lest you perish under stronger monsters.  Return a full bag and your Pawn's 
Khukri to Lord Gikzic and he will award you the Knaves Khukri which is 5/26. 
Welcome to Knavehood!
