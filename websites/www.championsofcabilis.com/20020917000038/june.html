<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>Today was a glorious EQ day for me personally as well as for the Champions. I became the first player on any server to complete the Iksar Shaman Cudgel of the Hierophant quest. This is an immense honour for me personally. I have been at the forefront pushing to get this quest properly fixed as well as the ones beforehand for nearly a year now. Many Shaman on other servers had great contributions to this quest. Thanks to Mercuratrayin, Spri, and Mannra for their work on this quest as well as many many others.  There is promise of a 7th Quest to go in alongside the Greenmist quest but we shall have to wait on that. I updated the link in our quest writeups for anyone who cares to read it <a href=skull6.html>here</a><br></font>

<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>Had a fun event last weekend. About 25 Champions came out to raid the Crypt of Dalnir. We made our way through the Crypt eventually settling on the 3rd floor. We cleared out that room a couple times and killed the Overseer. There were a few minor problems with too many anxious players wanting to pull and some corpse retrieval needed after that. When we finished it was back to Cabilis for some loot distribution and dueling. Besides the Crescent drops there was a Bamboo Bo Stick and a 2Handed Practice sword to dole out. Accure and I faced off in a duel. He had challenged me earlier in the week and it was much anticipated. Thanks to Jobaber for helping me tear a hole in poor Accure. I finished with 60% HPs but my mana was running low, without my pet I couldn't have done it. Good fight Accure, thanks for proving the might of Shaman.  Afterwards there were some more prizes to be raffled. I had to log and mistakenly logged with some of the prizes. Bad Cradossk Bad! They will be auctioned at the next event. Thanks for the generosity of those who donated.<br></font>

<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>Was in the Plane of Growth with BoD last night. I have some new pictures up in the pics section for those interested in seeing what it looks like. I forgot to mention also that we have a new guide in the guide section by the ever talented Daikoku Ashikaga. This ones on SK tanking, very cool read.  Support for this weekends events sounds good, I'm looking forward to it :) Congrats to Ssizzel for winning the roll on the Tranquil Staff he won last night, he's a rich lizard now, hopefully he'll share the wealth :)<br></font>

<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>This Saturday afternoon is going to be a celebration for Champions. We are going to start with a raid of Dalnir at approximately 12PM PST/3PM EST. This will be raid for lvls 25-40 mostly but will be open to high levels to come for support also. Afterwards we'll march back to Cabilis and begin the festivities. We turned a year old a few weeks back and this will be our celebration. Drunken Dueling in the Arena, prize giveaways, etc. Festivities in Cabilis at 4PM PST 7PM EST. Come out if you can, I sent Cazic and invite, hopefully he shows. In sadder news longtime Champion Keya has retired from the game. He will always be remembered for his helpful ways, good luck in the RL bro!<br></font>

<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>Congratulations to Sasraaz and Ssizzel. Sasraaz was able to defeat the named Drake in West Karana to continue in his epic Quest. Ssizzel was able to complete his spell Life Leech at the same time. Thanks to those who helped out. Riptor Shadowfang, our master smith, has sent me a guide that will take you through the basics of smithing, bringing your skill up to 135, a good read for anyone interested in smithing. This Saturday is our Plane of Fear raid. Sasraaz will be leading this raid and it starts at 3PM PST sharp. Be in the Feerot if you're coming. This being a planes raid it is open to lvl 46 and up only.  I am working on a Dalnir raid for the lower levels too so they can get some adventure in too, hopefully for next weekend.<br></font>

<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>Belated thanks to those who were able to help me on the weekend in killing the Black Dire in Mistmoore. I was able to turn in his pelt for my Shaman Epic boots, a dream come true for me, thanks again to all!  There is some talk of a Champions of Cabilis birthday party this weekend in Cabilis though the time and date have yet to be cemented.  Added a couple more members to the list the other day. Welcome Jungilizt, Reevex, and Sebukuk.<br></font>

<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>Added Rukiss and Ssizzel's pics to the members page and a new guide for our guide section. It was submitted to me by Daikoku Ashikaga a Shadow Knight from the Tholuxe Paells server. It's a guide for Shadow Knight's interested in Fletching. Indeed I think it's an interested read for anyone interested in fletching, give it a look. I am almost done my Newbie Shaman guide but it's been slow going (lots to write). This Sunday I am going after Black Dire with my fellow Champions to obtain my boots for the Shaman Epic. I have about 8 people confirmed now. The time will be 2PM PST, meet up in Cabilis, we will be porting from the Lake Zone, thanks to Kwan's Druid Rayfel.  If you are 45 plus and interested please come help on this.<br></font>
