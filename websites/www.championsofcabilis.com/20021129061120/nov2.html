<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>The Champions of Cabilis will be hosting a raid on Kael Drakkel on December 12th at 5PM PST/8PM EST. This raid is open to all friends of CoC and members over lvl 44. It should last about 4 hours tops and hopefully will result in some good drops and faction for all. Sign up on the events board.  We haven't been raiding a lot as guild as of late so it's time to get that part of our game going again.</br></font>

<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>Twas a great weekend for the Champions. On Friday a group of Champs helped Sasraaz defeat the Golem in OT for his Greemist Khukri quest. Good turnout good fun sorry I missed that one.  On Saturday I had a good group come out to Siren's Grotto to help me kill a couple MoBs I needed for my 7th Prayer Shawl. Thanks guys. Seems that we are doing things as a guild again more often which is always a good thing. Welcome new member Jilaza a Shaman who seems to be a good recruit.  Look for an upcoming mid-level raid on Kaesora within the next 2 weeks. Details to follow.<br></font>

<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>A small group of Champions joined the Brothers of Darkness in the Arena in Lake Rathe last night. We did some dueling and group vs group fighting. It was refreshing and one of the more fun times I've had in EQ recently.  I finished 3-0 which made me pretty proud.  Lets hope we can have more fun events like these in the future.  Sasraaz would like some help on Friday at 5PM PST/8PM EST in OT to kill a nasty Golem for his Greenmist Khukri. If you are around come join in the fun.<br></font>

<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>Well it has been a bit of a rough week for Ye Olde Champions.  During the past week or so we have lost long time members Sabassis, Senova and Sleeze. As well 2 great guys in Ratrasik and Oloth.  To a man I liked all of these people and will greatly miss having them around.  Our post 50's now are really stripped down to those who will sooner quit EQ then leave the Champions but we will have to look heavily into more recruiting to fill those spaces.  I am going to be cleaning up the members page this week to get a better idea of who really plays anymore.  If you see your name off the list and it should be let me know.  I could write tributes to each of these guys but they know I'll miss 'em.<br></font>

<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>Well as if Ishy getting his Epic weapon wasn't enough, Cakaris went and tried to upstage him. Cakaris got his Spear of Fate on Sunday making for 2 Epic weapons in one week for our guild. Way to go guys!  Sunday afternoon saw some 12 Champs in The Overthere. We had come for revenge and we would not be dissapointed.  We slew many Dragoons that day including the hated General D'veers.  There were a few casualties but they were quickly rezzed thanks to Tiffini.  Thanks to all who came out, more fun events like that to come.<br></font>

<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>A lot of Champions have been having fun with the new light blue con.  Cakaris was spotted yesterday killing mobs in OT of all places and getting exp! I think this is a good move on Verants part. The exp is still so minimal you wouldn't choose to hunt it but it does open up the world more and allow high levels to return to places they left long ago.  This weekend on Sunday 4PM PST/7PM EST we will be giving the Goons a taste of their own medicine. Thousands or our people have died at their hands fighting in Overthere, on Sunday they'll see how it feels. Hopefully we can get 2 groups which will be ample. We can kill them continually until we feel justice is served!<br></font>

<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>Yesterday was a glorious day in the History of the Champions. Ishy Drakos completed his long quest for his Epic Weapon, the Spear of Fate.  He is the first Champion to have his epic and gives us all a great deal of prestige. He kept at it always trying to move forward in the quest. His unending effort has finally paid off. The new picture of the week shows him holding this weapon. I for one am extremely jealous. Maybe this'll give me incentive to get my ass in gear.<br></font>
