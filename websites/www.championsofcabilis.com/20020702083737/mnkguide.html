<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><b>RANDOM BITS OF INFO</b><p></p>
<li>1-15: If you can get some Fighting Batons and a Bamboo Bo Stick 8/20 2hb for keeping skill up. If untwinked use any of the clubs you can find around Cabilis.<p>
<li>20-30: Get an AM BO STICK with the lighting storm proc if you can find one. Warslick Wood's and Lake of Ill Omen are your best Kunark Zones. Wait till after lvl 29 to get a Cane of the Tranquil so the proc does not hurt you.<p></p>
<li>30-34: Do see if you can get some Cresent Armor in Dalnir... but i dont need to because of the new tailoring Wu gear for monks. the Feet is the only thing u need for magic ID's and Hands for hitting magic mobs but the Gem inlaid gauntlets will be magic so u don’t need the Wu hands 
<li>35 go to Crystal caverns in Velious the loc is in Eastern wastes neg 3300 pos 400 u go in the fort and to the shed in the back right open the door and left click on the Crystal u go to the zone there 
There is a bank there and u can buy food and water by using sneak.  You 
can't bind there so bind in giant or the Dwarfs town because there are not a lot of Clerics in that zone. The exp and loot is insane there. that is where I made enough to buy my Fungi.

I would fight there until lvl 41 then go to DL or COM or Lower Guk - exp flies with a good group there.

<li>45 was the  DL for me 

<li>46 was camping raster and i did not see him spawn... 



<li>47. The geonids in CC

 

<li>48. Geonids getting green but still good exp…

 

<li>49. thinking Bloodgills would be nice to have a fish bone earing for endure breath<p></p>

<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><b>RANKING OF IMPORTANCE</b><p></p>


1. Haste item(U need haste item like FBSS of the sliver chitin hand wraps u cant solo 
effective without this even it u have a Jade Mace and KD) <p></p>

2. Good Weapons (a good damaging weapon is more important like two Canes or the Tranquil) <p></p>

3. AC (this is the next thing u need to worry about..) <p></p>

4. HP’S (make sure u get some ac hp's rings for the lower lvls they are 500pp a pair for 5ac 55hp) <p></p>

(side note) for HP is the next thing u need to have ... the bad thing about monks is that they dont have a lot of HP's and Sony will not be giving us any more... the normal fight for me last one real life minute at lvl 40ish so u need to out damage your mob damage too u... <p></p>

i believe i have 840ac at lvl 40 and i was doing just fine <p></p>

5. Str and SV Magic items are your next items u need <p></p>

(side note) IF u got a str of about 130 u are doing ok i have 149ish more if u have my 6str 6dex rings on <p></p>

(side note)IF u dont have sv magic of 90 or more dont even bother dueling a caster at your lvl... but if u got your sv magic up and they can root or slow u down THEY WILL go down fast <p></p>
<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><b>SOME THINGS TO KNOW</b><p></p>

MAKE SURE U HAVE YOUR SAFE FALL MAXED !!!! Velious has a lot of hills and the Crystal caverns has a big mine that can do 355dd for a fall for a 47 monk with Safe fall of 189ish <p></p>

 

make sure u Instill doubt when u are standing there and running around the zone.. <p></p>

make sure u hit mend every time it comes up until u hit 100skill in it... think lvl 19 is the lvl u can reach that mastery B/C after u are a master at your skill for mend it NEVER fails again <p></p>

OFF HAND is total independent of your primary hand <p></p>

Damage bonus look this up on www.monkey-business.com on your link page that is important to understand <p></p>

FDING make a hot key that says /attack off then on the next line 
/doability "what ever your FD skill is" i did not think u needed to do 
this but TRUST ME u do... if u swing your weapon before u hit the ground 
use FD will fail if has not failed once after i made this Hot Key <p></p>

If u see the saying "your name" has fell to the ground get 
up because that means your FD did not work. hit attack again i think that helps u block and dodge more... but i could be wrong. and then FD again after your FD pops up... <p></p>

dont be afraid to go over weight i weight 27 with my 2hb now and i have 
more total AC with higher AC armor that weights a little more than i would if u had lets AC and lighter weight armor so do some checking to see what works the best. <p></p>

DEX helps u increase your weapons skill <p></p>

AGI help u defense skills go up... <p></p>
