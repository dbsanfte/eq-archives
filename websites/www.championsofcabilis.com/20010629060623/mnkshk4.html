<font size="+1" face="comic sans ms">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note : You can start this quest whenever you like, but I found Feign Death
was necessary before I could finish it.  Approx lvl 17.<br><br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talk to Master Niska in the Court of Pain about the Shackle of Rock, and she
tells you that she will give you the shackle if you bring her back the fists
of Talon Southpaw. You may want to buy the book about Talon from the Court
Chronicler if you have not already, and go ask the Bar keep in the Tink and
Babble about him. Seems he was almost impossibly-fast with that left hand.
Here's the catch ; he had two left hands, explaining his lightning speed.
Time to get those fists.<br><br> 
Fist One<br>
Dropped off a Sarnark Courier in the Lake of Ill Omen.  Normally spawns near
the windmill and along the lake area around there.   Just OOC in the zone
and let people know that you are looking for one and it should go pretty
smooth.  <br><br>
Fist Two and Three<br> 
The third fist is held by the Skeleton that the Great Oowomp will summon if
you give him five gold. The Great Oowomp is on the Ogre Island, where the
boats stop in Timorous. Here is the catch though, the hand is only the
thumb. The thumb is a container, in which you must place and combine, his
fingers. His fingers, named 'A Withered Finger X', where X is a length, drop
off the Fingered Skeleton in Kurns. I hope you hunted here and managed to
pick some up. Camp the Fingered Skeleton until you have all four fingers.
<br><br>

Note: The fingers are 2.5, 3, 3.1 and 4.  The fingered Skeleton spawns in
the basement of Kurns Tower.   

<br><br>
Now to head out to Timorous. Get a map of Warsilk Woods, if you don't
already know, and head to The Overthere (safest way is to head north along
the zone line then when you reach the beach go west along the shore, keeping
the water to your right.  When you reach a wall swim around the wall hugging
it until you reach the other side of the beach.  Stay there until you see
the boat dock and swim to it.  Make sure you get on away from the dock.  
This boat will take you to Timorous. After you zone in, stay on the boat
until it arrives at the Ogre Island.
<br><br>

Note: While waiting in The Timorous Deep, try to forage a riles sand coin
which is needed for your shackle of bronze quest.  It will save you a bit of
time and you will knock out parts of 2 quests in one shot.
<br><br>

Arriving at the Ogre Island, don't get back on the boat straight away. Head
towards the Great Oowomp, using sneak and trying to avoid other Ogres. I did
this at level 19, and everything except the Oowomp conned blue. Get as close
as possible to the Oowomp, and then Feign Death. Then, get five gold ready,
un-feign and quickly give it to the Oowomp. If you un-feign with sneak on,
you will have a few seconds before he and the other ogre near by aggro. Give
him the cash, and re-feign. He summons a skeleton. After the skeleton as
popped up, un-feign again, with sneak on, and ask him who Talon Southpaw
was. Follow the cues and get your fist. Feign again. These guys are weak,
and if you are fast, shouldn't lose much health. Get up, run to the docks,
FD to get them off you, and rise and repeat until you are on the boat back
to The Overthere. Stick the four fingers into the container you just got
from the Skeleton and combine them. You will have the second fist after
combining.
On the way back to Overthere, keep your eyes open for the Bandit shipwreck,
when you see it, jump off the boat, and then head for approx -5000, 3000,
and the Iksar Master . Find him, ask him what are the Fists of Talon
Southpaw, and then offer to return it. Take the bag, put the gloves, claw,
mandible, and sash in it, combine them, and give him the bag back. You will
have the Third fist after combining.
<br><br>

The four items are: <br>
Excavators Claw - This drops off Burynai Excavators in Kurn's Tower, and in the Pit.<br>
Excavators are fairly easy for their level. Around 16ish. 
Intact Mandible - This drops of Skulking Brutling, in Warsilk Woods. Around level 12, easy
kill. Drop is semi-rare though, it may take awhile. <br>
Sparring Gloves of a Goblin Pit Fighter - These drop off Goblin Pit Fighters, a semi- rare spawn in Warsilk Woods.
Head to any set of Goblin ruins and kill everything that spawns (you may
need some help for this) until you get the Pit fighter. <br>
Torn Sash from a Young Ronin - Head to the Oasis, I have found him here more often then Southern Ro.  Once
again OOC the zone and let them know you are looking for him.
