<font size="+1" face="comic sans ms">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This can be a fun quest to do if you are into the brewing skill. The Legion Lager you make is also used in the Restraining Order quest, read about that one <a href="restrain.html">here.</a>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In West Cabilis near the Warslick's Wood entrance there is a Trooper named Neozite, hail him and he will tell you of how he loved to drink Legion Lager. Unfortunately the master brewer can no longer make this.  He longs for a drink of this legendary booze and would be so happy if you could get him some.  
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legion Lager is made with the brewing skill. The recipe is as follows: 
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bloodwater - Can be bought at a vendor near Swamp of No Hope entrance in East Cabilis.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deadbone Barley - Can be foraged in the Field of Bone.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Giant Leech Blood Sac - Found on Giant Leeches in the Swamp of No Hope.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Bottle - Bought from Brewing Vendor by the Bank.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trivial Range for Legion Lager is about 40 so don't try to brew it without a brewing skill of 30.  Bring him the Lager once it's brewed and he'll be very greatful. You'll get faction, small amount of experience and small amount of coin.
