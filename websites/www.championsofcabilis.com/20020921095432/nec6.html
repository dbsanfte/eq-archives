<font size="+1" face="comic sans ms">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minimum Level 28.  Master Kyvix needs you to track down an item called the Kor Sha Candlestick.
It is in two pieces. 
<br><br>The first piece can be found on a Sarnak Revenant in the Sarnak Fort in The Lake of Ill Omen. 
<br><br>The
second piece was supposedly stolen by an Iksar named Grype. He tells you he
will give you a reward if you return his sloshing stein from a rogue dressed
all in black. This is the Halfling Swashbuckler, an extremely rare spawn in
Firona Vie. Kill the swashbuckler and take the stein back to Grype for the
base of the candlestick. <br>Bring them back with your occultist skullcap and
you will receive your Revenant Cap.
