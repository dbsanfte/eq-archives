<font size="3" color="white" face="courier new" >  Friday March 30th, 2001</b><br></font>
<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>The Sarnak Fort Raid went off well yesterday. We had an excellent turnout with about 20 in attendance.  Unfortunately another guild was there waiting when we arrived. We killed the Chancellor and gave the spear to them graciously even though they were complete idiots to us. Oh well what can you expect from softskins.  Many Sarnaks would die in the 2 hours it took for the Chancellor to return. When he did he was dispatched quickly by the assembled might.  Chabasrn, who or organized the event turned out to be the winner on the roll and will be giving the Jade Chokdai Prod to his alternate character a young Shaman called Karanizu.  Today marks my last day at my current job, please send all further correspondance to <font color=red><a href="mailto:crallen@abccom.bc.ca">crallen@abccom.bc.ca</a> </font><br>

<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>Chabasrn came up with a great event for this Thursday March 29th at <font color=red>5:30PM PST/8:30PM EST.</font>  This will be a raid on The Sarnak Fort in the Lake of Ill Omen. All levels are welcome to join in the mayhem. The goal is to kill Chancellor Di'Zok who can be a pesky character. He is usually surrounded by about 20 Sarnaks so it gets pretty nuts in there.  He drops the Jade Chokdai Prod an excellent Shaman weapon and the Key to Howling Stones. I would encourage Shaman in particular to show up to roll for this item as it's a great Shaman piercer.  Thanks to Chabasrn for organizing this event, he will be organizing teams, please meet up outside Cabilis in the Lake of Ill Omen Zone at that time if you are coming.<br></font>

<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>Did a major cleanup of the members list today. I removed some never seen members and added a couple new ones, notably Sorulis and Kodmid a couple of great mid 30's monks.  If you see anything else to fix let me know. I posted on the message board about my current personal situation. I am leaving my current job and my old email address with it. Please direct all emails to <a href="mailto:crallen@abccom.bc.ca">crallen@abccom.bc.ca</a> for now, my addresses of ice@intergate.ca and cradossk@iksar.org may not function after the end of the month. I will be starting a new job and our webhosting will be switching so the site may be down for a day or two maximum in early April. The full scoop is on my post. Congrats to Tipsy who had an excellent night in the Plane of Hate last night. He scored a Legionaire Scaled Breastplate and Boots the lucky guy!  No planned events for this weekend, we will have to get working on our next event, post ideas on the events board. Have a good weekend!<br></font>

<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>Chable sent me in a good quest writeup today for the Human Sashes and Headbands, sounds like a lot of work but some Monks should try it.  Also added a few new members to the members list as well as their profile. The Brothers of Darkness have invited our lvl 46 and up members to their Plane of Hate raid, sign up at their site if you are interested. I'm going to try to make 46 by then as there is some amazing Iksar Shaman only armour dropping up there now.  Also congratulations to Miracht, he is our newest officer. He has shown great maturity in his time with the Champions and I am proud to honour him with this title.<br></font>

<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>Did some cleanup of the members link today. I have posted a list of players I have not seen in many moons, if you have seen any of these people online please let me know as I will be removing them from the list in one weeks time.  Sasraaz sent me his writeup for the Lord of Pain's Khukri today, he is an elite Iksar Shadowknight for completing this quest the other day, congrats to him. I finished my Iron Cudgel of Channeler as well which is the second time on our server. I did a writeup for that quest and as well some thoughts on the unsolved next quest.  There are no scheduled events for this weekend but I encourage everyone to try to group, perhaps we can make a smaller event if enough people are online. Have a good weekend all.<br></font>

<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>Had some fun last night with Brothers of Darkness at their Gnome event.  Thanks to the Champions who made newbie gnomes and came out for the fun. We all ended up in Greater Faydark challenging each other to duels and littering the pod lift with corpses. Eventually some GMs came to shut down the event which was too bad as we were only having fun.<br></font> 
<font size="3" color="white" face="courier new" >  Tuesday March 13th, 2001</b><br></font>
<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>Posted Sasraaz's Realm of Heroes quest writeup as well as finished my writeup for the 5th Iksar Cudgel Upgrade today.  Have been neglecting the quests section for a while thought I'd fix that up.  Also added Hitek and Kasiz to the members page today, if you know of anyone not on the page please let me know in-game or via e-mail.<br></font>

<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>Was a good weekend for the Champions. The members in their 20's and teens had a good mini-raid of Kurns while the 30's and 40's Champions went about killing Coldain Dwarves.  Put on some new pics on the pics link for our page, we're on our 4th page of pics now.  Also updated some members links on the members page. Please send me in your info if you haven't already.<br></font>
<font size="3" color="white" face="courier new" >  Friday March 9th, 2001</b><br></font>
<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>Did a few small updates today, put a link to our ally Brothers of Darkness in the links section, cleaned up the members list a little and added a pic of Xakanis in the Plane of Fear.  Xilkorsis and Surik are planning on raiding Kurn's tower tonight so if anyone is available at 7PM PST/10PM EST please try to join them.  It's a great place for a low to mid level raid.  There are no other confirmed events lined up for the weekend but there will definitely be something happening Sunday late afternoonish.  Some ideas have been Dwarf Killing fun in Velious or a raid on the Tower of Frozen Shadow.<br></font>
<font size="3" color="white" face="courier new" >  Monday March 5th, 2001</b><br></font>
<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>Our Raid on Castle Mistmoore went off fairly well yesterday.  About 12-15 Champions were in attendance. We ported from Field of Bone thanks to Tipsy's Wizard Aandiwen.  In tow we had a full group from Harbingers of Death.  Took a while to get everyone organized and melee's bound in G Fay. After scaring some elves we made our way to Mistmoore and fought our way through elven bodies to the spot where Black Dire spawns. While we killed random mobs some Brothers of Darkness showed up to join in the fun. By the end we had about 4 or 5 full groups of high levels. Unfortunately that damn Black Dire took forever to pop. At around 7PM he did show his face and was swiftly dispatched to his makers. Tsumar of HoD won the roll on the pelt he drops as Ishy and I looked on in jealously. The plan was to get 3 pelts one for each of us.  I took a break for dinner as did many I suspect. Upon logging back in I found that Ishy was the only Champion to remain along with a handful of HoD guys and a good Iksar named Labbats. We tried once more with a much smaller group and at that point I lost my internet connection due to some personal issues.  I believe it was unsuccessful.  There was much good to take from our first raid off of our home continent but also some dissapointment.  For a guild of 120 members it's too bad we can never muster more than 15 out to events. <br></font>
