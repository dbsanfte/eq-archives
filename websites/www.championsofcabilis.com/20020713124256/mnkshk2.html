<font size="+1" face="comic sans ms">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first quested shackle. Minimum level 5.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talk to Master Raska in the Court of Pain. He calls you a whiff, and upon
asking him what a 'Whiff' is, you receive the chance to prove that you are
not so weak as he might think. Follow the dialogue, and take the four slot
bag he gives you.<br><br>
 You need four items to fill this bag. The items are:<br>
Goblin Scout Beads - These drop from low level Goblin Scouts in Lake of Ill Omen. They spawn
mostly around the area near town.  They are roughly Level 4 or so.<br>
Sabertooth Cub Canine - These drop off Sabertooth Cubs. They are usually around level 5. Also in
Lake of Ill Omen, so get this and the Scout beads at the same time. <br>
Froglok Skipper Stone - This tiny range weapon drops off Froglok Skippers, a fairly common spawn
around the Swamp of No Hope newbie zone. Approx. level 5 again.   I have
found them on the first island as you follow the path leading from town near
the newbie area of the Swamp.<br>
Large Scorpion Pincer - These drop off Large Scorpions, which are level 6ish. Look for them around
the Field of Bone newbie area, and the edges of the Pit.<br><br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stick these items in the bag, combine them, and return to Master Raska for
your Shackle of Clay.   You can do this quest again after you turn in your
shackle for the shackle of stone.
