<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>Great news Champions! We have formed an official alliance with the Brothers of Darkness on this fine day.  They are a great guild of similar size to ourselves but with a more more varied membership. This will allow us to go on raids we would be unable to do without their help, i.e. Planes, etc.  Hopefully this will work out well for both guilds.  I would expect you to treat all of their members as well as we treat our own. If they ask favours of you please do your best to help them out.  Hopefully we should have better access to Ressurections and Teleports as a result too.  If you have any questions please feel free to ask. Also check out their webpage <a href="http://www.thebod.org">HERE</a> Drop by and say hi!<br></font>

<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>Got back from Maui on the weekend and man oh man was it a great time.  Time for some updates on the page now :) I added about 10 new members to the members link hopefully I've got most of the new recruits on there, let me know if you're missing. We are slowing down our recruitment heavily as we've grown fairly large now.  We have an abundance of Monks now too so we'll not be taking any new Monks for the next while unless they are lvl 30 plus, please note that officers. I'm working on a recruitment form for all new recruits to fill out, hopefully will have that live by the end of the week.<br></font>

<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>The Iksar Shaman Quest was completed last night by Shakar of the Vallon Zek server, congratulations to him. It seems like a nice weapon, I can't wait :)  I am going to Maui tonight for a full week so I won't be back till next Saturday. Keep doing Cazic's bidding and watch for me on the message board. I'll still be checking my mail if you need anything urgent addressed.<br></font>
<font size="3" color="white" face="courier new" >  Wednesday January 17th, 2001</b><br></font>
<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>Patch day today. Implement the new experience for groups and certain dungeons. Within our territories this affects Kaesora, Droga and Nurga. All have had their experience upped. This makes them very attractive for future raids my brothers, should be a lot of fun :)  I added a Cannibalize II quest spoiler for Iksars on the quest link today, something for the Scaled Mystics.  Also the Iksar Shaman Cudgel upgrades are completable now and are progressing nicely, we may even get the 5th upgrade done tonight at this rate. Follow the progress at this thread <a href="http://forums.eqforge.com/shaman/showthread.php3?threadid=6015">HERE.</a><br></font>
<font size="3" color="white" face="courier new" >  Tuesday January 16th, 2001</b><br></font>
<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>Updated the Trooper Scale Pauldron quest with some more info today and I'm working on the Cannibalize II quest for Shamans as well.  Updated a couple members info as well.  I should make a mention that there will be some sweeping changes to the Experience system in Everquest. This was announced on Sunday and is a MUST read for players, especially hybrid classes.  The full info on it can be found <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/047840.html">HERE.</a>  Also there was finally some relief for Iksar Shaman everywhere. Our cudgel quests are confirmed being fixed in the patch tomorrow. They are live on test right now. Apparently they have added a semi-rare NPC who is a part of the quest for the Skull of Dai Nozok, some new text has been added as well to lead to it.  The reward for this 5th quest is apparently in line with it's difficulty now too.<br></font>

<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>Sasraaz completed his excellent writeup for the Crusader Khukri quest yesterday, that's up now for all to read. We welcomed Xilil as our strong new Shaman yesterday. He has displaced me as the strongest Shaman Champion, but I'm glad we've got him anyway, he'll be a great help in our cause.  Hope to get fighting going tomorrow in Kaesora or Droga, we shall see.<br></font>

<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>Got an e-mail from a fellow Iksar on the Sarynn server named Zatharus today. He informed me that the SK Dreadscale Breast Plate is now attainable. I posted his tips under the quest section. As well I added Kyki, Mebrnu, Glaydar, Thlorik, Cakik(re-added), and a pic of Kolish.  Lots of new faces, looks like it's time for a moritorium on Monks we have so many!  Also wanted to inform everyone that if they would like yourname@championsofcabilis.com as an email address that's easy for me to set up, just send me an e-mail telling me what email address you want it to forward to and I can do it that day. <br></font>
<font size="3" color="white" face="courier new" >  Wednesday January 10th, 2001</b><br></font>
<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>Added a link on the quests section today. Sasraaz gave us an excellent write-up on the Hero's Khukri quest, his write-up on the Crusader Khukri will be coming soon also.  If any aspiring monks are working on their new shackle quests let me know your progress and if you can do updates for that quest info.  Cleaned up a few peoples profiles with new level info as requested. Please lets get all members profiles filled out, keep bugging your brethren to come here. I'm working on a new section of the page that will allow people to submit requests to join, that should be quite useful once I get that going, give me a week to learn forms :) We also hit our 7000th hit today which is quite impressive considering 6000 of those have been in the last 3 months. Lets hit 10,000 by February! See you in Norrath.<br></font>
<font size="3" color="white" face="courier new" >  Monday January 8th, 2001</b><br></font>
<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>Put up a bunch of new pictures today, take a look at them. As well I added Boulderfist to our members list.  There is a cool new faction link on the link section too. Was a good weekend for the Champions.  We had a great fight in Kaesora yesterday as well there was a GM event in Frontier Mountains where mighty Sarnaks challenged the Champions as we roleplayed with them. Am going to make a real effort to get everyone's name on the members list, please send me your info if you aren't on there.  Patch tomorrow, hopefully they'll fix some quests or something :)<br></font>
<font size="3" color="white" face="courier new" >  Thursday January 4th, 2001</b><br></font>
<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>Hurray we've got our domain back. We are officially www.championsofcabilis.com again! WOOT!  With that taken care of I can get back to working on the page itself again. I apologize for letting it slip a little over the past few weeks, but hey it hasn't even been up LOL. I cleaned up the members list quite a bit today. It's smaller but more accurate now. There are however quite a few people who are not on this list. If you know someone who's not then please have them come to our webpage. Members who can't find the time to drop by the page and at least say hi aren't really needed in the guild.  My girlfriends back from a 3 week holiday so expect to see me a little less over the next week or so, can't be helped. <br></font>
