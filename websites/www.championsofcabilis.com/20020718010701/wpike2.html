This is the second upgraded Warrior's Pike quest.<br><br>

Talk to Drill Master Kyg in Fortress Talishan and ask about the Footman Pike. He hands you Footmans Pack and demands that you fill it with the weapons of our foes. What he requires are four javelins, two from Froglok Bounders and two from Goblin Hunters. Return this pack along with your Militia Pike and you'll receive Pike Head Plans and told to talk to the Legion Weaponsmith, and when done getting your Footmans pike to talk to the War Baron Sebilis about [the memory of sebilis]. 
<br><br>
Weaponsmith Grugle is just outside the warrior guild. Ask him "what footman's pike" and he says: "To forge a Footman's Pike requires skill and an iron rod, forging hammer and a footman pike head. To forge the pike head you will need a geozite tool, raw pike head, and petrified redwood." The Iron rod, forging hammer, and raw pike head (pike head) are all sold at the Weaponsmith himself. The Petrified Redwood can be found in Warsliks Wood with the foraging skill. It is also dropped by Succulents in Overthere. Using the blacksmithing skill, combine the Geozite tool, Raw pike head, and petrified redwood, along with the pike head plans, in a forge to get a Footman's pike head. Then combine the pike head, iron rod and forging hammer in the forge for the completed Footman's Pike.
<br><br>Verant has removed the smithing requirements on this so just put a few training points in and it'll be trivial apparently. The result is:
