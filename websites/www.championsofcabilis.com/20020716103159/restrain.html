<font size="+1" face="comic sans ms">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a fairly involved quest that is made up of a series of quests within. It can be a fun pastime for lower levels though as it can be completed within Cabilis and the close by areas.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head on over to the Tink 'N Babble everyones favourite Cabilis bar.  There you should find a city clerk named Doval. Hail him and he tells you that he needs to deliver a restraining order to several of the Troopers.  He is lazy and doesn't want to do all that walking.  He will hand you a letter which must be signed by all ten Troopers, and here's the kicker - he wants them signed in alphabetical order.  Find each trooper and give them the restraining order. Some will simply sign the order and give it back, others will require a small quest to get their signature.  Each will have some funny grumbling about how they shouldn't have to sign. Once you finish getting the signatures take it back to Doval at the Tink 'N Babble.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here are the troopers in alphabetical order, their location and what they need to sign:
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Frogzin (Lake of Ill Omen at the gate) - Just hand it to him and he'll sign it. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Fryp (East Cabilis on the way to the Warrior Guild) - Wants a Quill from the Necro Guild to sign. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Gummin (Field of Bone in a building to the left of the gate) - Needs a Legion Lager to sign. Legion Lager is it's own quest which I describe <a href="legion.html">here</a> 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Inkin (Swamp of No Hope at the gate - Wants a skipping stone dropped by froglok skippers. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Nishnish (East Cabilis at the Gate to Swamp of No Hope) - Wants two Barracuda teeth from barracudas in the Cabilis waterways 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Ogmire (West Cabilis at the Gate to Lake of Ill Omen) - Just hand it to him and he'll sign it. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) Ozlot (West Cabilis at the Gate to Warslik's Wood) - Wants two Sabertooth Kitten Teeth from Lake of Ill Omen.  
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) Roklon (Warslik's Woods at the Gate) - Wants Goblin Scout Beads from low level Goblins in Lake of Ill Omen. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9) Selbat (Lake of Ill Omen, in a building near the city gate) - Just hand it to him and he'll sign it. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(10) Taer (Field of Bone, he wanders a bit but stops at the City Gate occasionally - Just hand it to him and he'll sign it.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is possible though very rare to loot a completely signed Restraining Order from Froglocks in the swamp but like I say quite rare.  Once you have a completed Restraining Order, return it to Davol and he gives you a small amount of experience, some coin, and a random book from his library.  This is a book of Iksar History and can be one of the following: The Code of Combat, The History of Combat, The Tome of Combat, The Book of Knowledge.  The books are a good read on our history but have no other known function.  This can be an amusing quest that isn't hard to complete at lower levels.
