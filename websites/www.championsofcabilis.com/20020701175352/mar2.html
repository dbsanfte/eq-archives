 <p><font size="3" color="white" face="courier new">Thursday March 21st, 
        2002</font>      <li><font face="comic sans ms" size="3">The long awaited 7th and 8th Iksar Shaman Cudgels were completed the other night by Baroness Abani Draconae of the Tunare Server. Congratulation to the whole Iksar Shaman community who really pulled together to get this thing solved in under 2 weeks of it's release. The final stats are staggering in their goodness. 1H Blunt 14/22 10STA 15WIS 10INT 50HP 75Mana Sv Dis 15 Sv Poi 15 Effect Carnage. Well Carnage is a mini-avatar spell, 40 to all stats. Only real bummer is that it requires an emerald reagent. I would have loved to see some AC on it too as it is range equipable. That's where mine will probably rest once I get it. I have added writeups for these new Cudgels in the Quests section, have a look. Sirezz and Korsak led a scouting expedition to Rivervale yesterday. They killed a few Halfling guards and NPCs and got rather cocky some might say. Well things got ugly when the rogue trainer came out with his quad 300's and double backstabs for 600 plus. Mourtal and a new monk named Rorsak both died to the stumpies.  The conclusion? Don't go in there without a huge force that includes some who can CH. We'll think more on that.<br></font>
<p><font size="3" color="white" face="courier new">Monday March 18th, 
        2002</font>      <li><font face="comic sans ms" size="3">Our Glorious guild was mentioned in an article at the gaming news site <a href="http://player2player.net/article.php?sid=391&mode=&order=">Player to Player</a> The article discusses the stupid move by Verant to allow other races to wield our cultural weapons that we fought hard to earn from our early days as hatchlings. I mean why even pretend to have role playing in the game if you are going to do something like that?? Throw all armour/class/race restrictions if you are going to through that out. I encourage more people to spam Verant till they see the error of their ways. And while you're at it since Gnomes and Halflings get new classes to play I think it's high time Iksar Rogues were put into the game, it's a natural fit.  Today's pic of the week features Araak and Cradossk fighting the mighty and uber lvl 20 Muglwump. Ph34r it's l33t pow4!</font>
<p><font size="3" color="white" face="courier new">Tuesday March 12th, 
        2002</font>      <li><font face="comic sans ms" size="3">Lost a couple of longtime members this week in Senova and Kilanik. These guys wore our tag for well over a year but have moved on to Red Eye Express, Cakaris' new guild.  They promise to help the cause of the Iksar when called upon though. That makes Srarnu now the highest level in Guild at 57. WTG Srar :) In other news old and thought retired members Jennyr, Sorshaiz, and Kasiz returned out of nowhere. Welcome back guys. This weeks pic features Cradossk in the Plane of Fear kneeling before our lord and master Cazic-Thule. Enjoy.<br></font>
<p><font size="3" color="white" face="courier new">Tuesday March 5th, 
        2002</font>      <li><font face="comic sans ms" size="3">Missed a couple of few bigger news items yesterday in my excitement over the new colour scheme. Srarnu Drackos finished her 7th Necro Skullcap the other day. This is a real right of passage for Iksar Necros, think of it as their Greenmist, not so much in stats but in achievement.  Congrats to her, I know she's been working on it forever :) The other piece of news? Well ol' Kroknik Mandrake was promoted to the rank of Officer. He's wanted this a looooong time and promises to do his best at it. We lost longtime members Xakanis and Cakaris over the past few weeks, I should have put a tribute of some kind up here. They were both model Champions and I wish them nothing but the best in the new Guild Red Eye Express. I should also mention that our sister/brother Guild Slaves of Cabilis is doing very well. Roen is doing an excellent job with it. I believe they are changing their name to Forsaken of Cabilis which is a great name. They've got a message board up now too, drop by and say hi.

      <li><font face="comic sans ms" size="3">Out with the green, in with the red. The webpage was feeling kind of old and tired so I gave it a minor facelift today. Replaced most of the green with a crimson red and gave us a new logo. The old logo featured the old character models and was getting kind of dated. The new one can never go out of style as it features the symbol of our people.  Did a few miscellaneous changes but that was the big one, will be fixing little bugs on it all week.  I almost finished my epic on Sunday but blew it because of faction, dropped me back a couple steps, oh man that sucked heh heh.</font>
     <p><font size="3" color="white" face="courier new">Friday March 1st, 
        2002</font>    
      <li><font face="comic sans ms" size="3">Did a bunch of updates to the members section today as well as adding the 4th Beastlord Quest to the members section. Upcoming Events, Help Nighteater finish her epic on Sunday, Help Araak on the Beastlord Epic and a Trak's Teeth raid next week. More info on all of these on the events board.</font>
