<b>Who: </b> The Quest giver seems to be an Iksar by the name of Sartar the Unrivaled<br><br>
<b>Quest:</b>
	It seems that this is a fairly new quest, with corresponding quests taking place in East Freeport, Neriak, Grobb, North Qeynos, and Ogguk.  For the Iksar version of this quest, it begins in West Cabilis near some alchemy supply vendors.  The NPC is named Sartar the Unrivaled, and when hailed, follows a dialogue as show below:<br><br>

You say, 'hail Sartar the Unrivaled'<br>
Sartar the Unrivaled says 'Hello Sasraaz , I am Sartar. In my former life I forged my body into a versatile weapon capable of defeating any foe that crossed my path. I was a student, a leader, a scholar and a scoundrel. My deeds caught the eyes of the gods and Cazic-Thule blessed me, removing me from this plane and placing me within the [Realm of Heroes]. <br><br>
You say, 'what realm of heroes'<br>
Sartar the Unrivaled says 'The Realm of Heroes is where I lived for some time, with others who had performed great deeds. I enjoyed this paradise but I wished to return and serve my lord Cazic-Thule further. Perhaps it was because of the discipline I learned from my early masters and later as a master myself, that I eventually shunned that life of pleasure. So again, I return to this mortal realm to serve my [dark lord of Fear]. <br><br>
You say, 'what dark lord of fear'<br>
Sartar the Unrivaled says 'Hail Cazic-Thule, long may fear reign. I serve by rewarding others that have found the favor of the gods and whose actions have caught their attention and rewarded them appropriately. Those to receive the favor of the gods are on their way to the glory that I have achieved in [my past]. Their journey is simply at its beginning. <br><br>
You say, 'what is your past'<br>
Sartar the Unrivaled says 'I do not know whether it was one single deed in particular that caught the eyes of the gods or if it was many deeds throughout my life in service to Cazic-Thule. I choose to leave such questions to the philosophers and personally do not care why it is that I stand before you as I do now. Simply, my reward is to serve. Still, perhaps you would like to [hear one of my tales] since you seem so interested in listening to me speak. <br><br>
It was here that Miracht furthered the conversation with:<br><br>

You say, 'Who are the two masters?'<br>
Sartar the Unrivaled says 'Their names are not important 
for they are masters no longer. The two knew of each other's existence but neither 
knew that I was receiving training from both of them at the same time. I expect that 
if one learned I was receiving training from the other they would have both fought over 
whom would be the one to have the pleasure of striking me dead. They would [learn the truth] 
eventually, only on my terms. <br><br>


You say, 'What is the truth?'<br>
Sartar the Unrivaled says 'The truth was simply that I 
served neither master, only myself. At first it was a great challenge to slip between 
the two as their fighting styles differed so greatly. However, as the years past my ruse 
became perfected and switching between the roots of either style became natural and automatic. 
Indeed, I soon reached the point when I knew that I had learned all I could from both and had exceeded them 
in skill. [Yet I continued] to pay both visits. 


<br><br>
You say, 'Why did you continue to visit?'<br>
Sartar the Unrivaled says 'I simply wanted to be certain 
that I was able to defeat both, one after the other. I knew that should I slay the one 
master, word would travel quickly, no doubt fears would be raised and perhaps my duplicity 
revealed. My unique perspective having studied both styles afforded me the knowledge of 
how to [defeat both masters]. 


You say, 'How do I defeat both masters?'<br>
Sartar the Unrivaled says 'Defeat them both I did! I 
still remember the look of shock on their faces, how the pupils of their eyes dilated 
with fear as I switched from their native stance to that of the other style. That momentary 
loss of wits was the undoing of both and that weakness was their undoing. I defeated both
 masters easily. This was the humble beginning of my [rise to power]. 

<br><br>
You say, 'How do I rise to power?'<br>
Sartar the Unrivaled says 'With both local masters defeated 
word traveled quickly of my deeds. Those that would seek the masters for knowledge and 
training were suddenly without either. Through their destruction, I had laid the roots 
for my eventual ascension as head of my tribe. 

<br><br>
You say, 'What tribe?'<br>
Sartar the Unrivaled says 'Indeed, rather then to come to 
these two masters for wisdom and training they began to seek out my help. Soon, I had 
followers joining me from many of the other tribes and I became a leader of many. My 
tribe grew large and we were very powerful and successful. Often the passage of time 
swallows the great deeds of a hero and they are forgotten over millennia. Fortunately,
 the gods never forget. I have become bored with speaking to you Miracht . Leave me. 
<br><br>
You say, 'i would like to hear a tale'<br>


Sartar the Unrivaled says 'Very well, I shall relay to you a tale of my
beginning. The times in which I lived were much different from today. It
gives me pleasure to see the ancient cities being rebuilt and New Sebilis is
a testament to the superiority of our race. When I walked the land however,
we were still wandering in the wilderness. When I was young their were [two
masters] who lived solitary lives in the caves near what is now called the
Emerald Jungle. I served both and neither.

Recommendations:
This NPC appears in different forms in different cities around Norrath. When GMs have events now they often award players with coins. The coins are then redeemed at this NPC for the actual GM item. This is apparently to discourage uber guilds moving in and wiping out GM events as they can decide what to award to the person based on their level, etc.  
This doesn't mean there isn't some other quest here but I think it is unlikely. Especially considering he appears in many other cities in different guises. I think the text is just a smokescreen. <br><br>
