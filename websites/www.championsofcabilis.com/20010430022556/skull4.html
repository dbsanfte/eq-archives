<font size="+1" face="comic sans ms">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you're still questing huh? Well Kudos for making it through the last quest, your an elite Iksar Shaman now.  This quest wil restore you faith in Verant a bit anyway it's much, much easier than the previous one.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After completing the last quest Crusader Quarg smiles and says... "The temple shall be pleased.  You have done so well that I must ask you to [collect the Crusaders of Rok Nilok].  Take this chest. Inside you shall combine the skull of their leader and at least five of the caste members. You then will go to the Swamp Garrison and deliver the full chest and your Iron Cudgel of the Mystic to Mystic Dovan. Go to him now and inquire of the Crusaders of Rok Nilok."  Mystic Dovan spawns at night time in the Swamp of No Hope zone in the Cabilis merchants buildings. He's on the top floor of one of them.  When you ask him, the response is: "Mystic Dovan lowers his head in sorrow let us have a moment of peace. I cannot find the words to speak of the unspeakable act of the gods which took the lives of the legendary Crusaders of Rok Nilok. You must find the answers for yourself. All I can do is wait for their return."  Geez thanks for the lack of clues Dovan heh heh. 
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The actual legend of Rok Nilok says that he and his followers were shrunk down by a magical rain and that Nilok's head burns red. Well not a lot of points for originality here, it's just like the last quest.  You need 6 skulls - one lore and five non-lore.  The skulls are much easier to aquire however. They drop off of Goblin Bloodtracers in Warslick's Woods and are called tiny glowing skulls. By the time you finish the previous quest I'm sure you will already have put some of these miserable creature to their deaths. They spawn all over the place in Warslick's and always drop a skull.  If you want to purposely hunt them the best place I know of is the first goblin ruins you come to when you take the right fork out of Cabilis.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Combine the one lore and five non-lore skulls in the box Mystic Dovan gives you and return it to him. His reward is the Iron Cudgel of the Prophet, another useless weapon at the level obtained but hey you're doing these for the pride of Cabilis Shaman everywhere remember.
