<p>You say, 'Hail, Prime Patriarch Vuzx'

<p>Prime Patriarch Vuzx says 'Greetings. I only train those who follow the path of the Patriarchs of Cabilis and have yet to develop their [powers] over the beasts of the wild, or maybe you are trained and are here to [help aid in our cause]?'

<p>You say, 'i am here to help aid in your cause'

<p>Prime Patriarch Vuzx says 'Good. Well we shall see how well you match up with our needs with this first mission. Go out beyond the safety of our city walls and bring back proof of your inner strength and training. This proof will be in the form of a sarnak raider brain, a froglok bounder javelin, an iksar bandit mask, and a mandible from a rogue shaman.'

<p>You can find the sarnak raider in lake of ill omen. the iksar bandit mask is found on iksar bandits in the field of bone. The rogue shaman is found near the kurns tower in field of bone durring the night. bounder javelin drops off of froglok bounders in the swamp of no hope.
