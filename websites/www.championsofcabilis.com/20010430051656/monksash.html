<font size="+1" face="comic sans ms">These Quests have to be completed if you wish to complete the Robe of the Lost Circle and the Robe of the Whistling Fist Quests.<br><br>
I suggest that you make a mule for these quests... or spend days killing Blackburrow Gnolls for Qeynos faction and Deathfist Orcs for Freeport faction...but why? We are EVIL! At any rate I'll start with the sashes since there is less to get and a bit easier.<br><br>

<b>Freeport Sash Quests</b><br><br>

<b>White Sash of Order:</b><br>

<u>2 Deathfist Pawn Scalps</U> - From "Deathfist Pawns" that are in the newbie areas of Freeport. Keep in mind that "Orc Pawns" drop a scalp too but these are the wrong ones.<br>

<u>1 Snake Fang</u> - From lvl 1 snakes also in the newbie areas.<br>

<u>1 Bonechips</u> - Any 1 bonechip will do from a "decaying skeleton"<br><br>
Giving these to Velan Torresk in the Monk Guild will get you the White Sash of Order.<br><br>

<b>Yellow Sash of Order:</b><br>

<u>1 Deathfist Slashed Belt</u> - These are found in East Commons either roaming or at either if the Orc camps that are found here. The belts do not drop off of pawns so look for Centurions or stronger Orcs.<br>

<u>1 Giant Snake Ratle</u> - These drop off of the "Darkweek Snakes" that can be found in the East Commons.<br>

<u>1 Desert Tarantula Chitin</u> - Dune Tarantulas in Northern Ro are where you will find these. FYI, cracked chitin's will not work.<br>

<u>White Sash of Order</u> - This is the first Sash that you got.<br><br>
Give all 4 of these to Velan Torresk in the Freeport Monk Guild.<br><br>

<b>Orange Sash of Order:</b><br>

<u>1 Legionnaire's Bracer</u> - These drop off the Legionnaires of the Deathfist and Crushbone orcs. They're rather rare if you try to hunt legos in the Commonlands, the quickest way to get your bracer is to go to Crushbone (from Greater Faydark). There, they seem to drop like candy.<br>

<u>1 Greater Lightstone</u> - Willowisp type mobs drop these. The GLS is semi-rare, but not too hard to get if you hunt the wisps for a half hour or so. Alternatively, just send out an auction in West Commons. There are always people buying and selling lightstones there for a few plat.<br>

<u>1 Dervish Cutthroat Ring</u> - Any Dervish Cutthroat has a chance to drop one of these. There are three derv camps in North Ro, and one in West Commons.<br>

<u>Yellow Sash of Order</u> - This is the second Sash that you got.<br><br>
Give all 4 of these to Revia in the Freeport Monk Guild.<br><br>

<b>Red Sash of Order:</b><br>

<u>Sapphire of Souls</u> - This can be found from an NPC named "Ekeros" in the Najena dungeon. Ekeros is a somewhat rare spawn, you can find him in the room just outside Rathyl's room. Kill the Migician's for they are his place holder. When you kill Ekeros, the item you get is named "A Blackened Sapphire" - this is the Sapphire of Souls.<br>

<u>Wand of Marnek</u> - This drops from Priest Amiez on the bottom level of Befallen. It is named "a Blackened Wand". See EQAtlas for a more detailed zone guide.<br>

<u>Orange Sash of Order</u> - This is the third Sash that you get.<br><br>
Turn in these 3 items to Revia in the Freeport Monk Guild.<br><br>
Congratulations... you now have the Red Sash and can get away from one smelly flesh town and head to the next.... Qeynos.<br><br>


<b>Qeynos Headband Quests</b><br><br>


<b>White Headband:</b><br>

<u>4 Gnoll Pup Scalps</u> - gnoll pups spawn outside the Qeynos gates, but only during the daytime. This can be frustrating since you're stuck waiting for half an hour if you don't get your four scalps right away. So far, I have found no better place near queynos to find the gnoll pups and scalps, however.<br>
Give these 4 Scalps to Phin Esrinap in the Qeynos Monk Guild<br><br>

<b>Yellow Headband:</b><br><br>

<u>3 Putrid Rib Bones</u> - These drop from the putrid skeletons at the haunted ruins of Queynos Hills (the ruins are between Blackburrow and Surefall Glade)<br>

<u>White Headband</u> - This is the first Headband that you get.<br><br>

<b>Orange Headband:</b><br>

<u>2 Blackburrow Gnoll Pelts</u> - Look for Elite guards, commanders, guardsme to drop this in Blackburrow. Most of these gnolls have a chance to drop a pelt. Make sure you don't keep any ruined pelts, as they are useless to this quest.<br>

<u>1 Blackburrow Gnoll Skin</u> - These will sometimes drop off elite guards and commanders in Blackburrow. Fairly rare drop, I had to slaughter several spawn points of these types for about an hour before I saw one.<br><br>
Give these 4 Item to Phin Esrinap to get the Orange Headband.<br><br>

<b>Red Headband:</b><br>

<u>Head of Granhex Drah</u> - Granhex Drah, the leader of the Split Paw Gnolls, can now be found at the skeleton camp in South Karana. Kill him to get his head (I've heard it can be pickpocketed as well - now THERE is a skilled thief)<br>

<u>Head of Shen</u> - Dropped from High Shaman Grisok in South Karana. He's a fairly rare spawn, usually seen wandering around just east of the Aviak Tree. His placeholder can be an escaped splitpaw gnoll or another named mob, Shaman Lenrel I believe was the name. I just auctioned for this head and got it in a couple hours while I killed raiders for better Qeynos faction.<br>

<u>Brother Dareb's Skull</u> - Dropped from High Shaman Phido in South Karana. I have read about some people finding Phido south of the hermit. In any case, be prepared to auction for a while or bring a tracker, this is a true pain in the ass to find. I auctioned on this one as well.<br>

<u>Orange Headband</u> - This is the thrid headband that you get.<br><br>
Give these 4 items to Togahn Sorast of the Qeynos Monk Guild.<br><br>

<b>Purple Headband</b><br>

<u>Skull of Jhen'Tra</u> - Drops from gnoll embalmers at the camp in Lake Rathe (just after you zone in from SK). Note - at night this camp spawns undead mobs and not gnolls, you can only try for your skull in the daytime.<br>

<u>Dagger of Marnek</u> - Dropped by the thaumaturgist in Befallen. He spawns right by the priest for the wand so if you get the camp spot keep it until you get both pieces.<br>

<u>Coronet of Buried Blood</u> - This is actually Zaharn's Coronet, an item from High Priest Zaharn in Permafrost.<br>

<u>Red Headband</u> - This is the forth headband that you get.<br><br>

Give these 4 items to Togahn Sorast of the Qeynos Monk Guild.

Congratulations! You are one step closer to the Robe of the Lost Circle!<br><br>
