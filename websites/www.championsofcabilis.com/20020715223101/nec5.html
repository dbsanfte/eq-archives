<font size="+1" face="comic sans ms">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minimum Level 20.  After you complete the fourth rank quest, After getting the Dark Binder Cap
Master Kyvix says something about the 'true mission'. when asked he says the
following: Master Kyvix says 'I have been waiting for a Nihilist to return.
His name was Ryx and I fear his love of ale and the high seas has kept him
from his mission. All I want you to do is find him. He should be disguised
as a worker and he will give you a tome to bring to me. Return it with your
Dark Binder Cap. I am sure that is simple enough for one as simple as you.
Be sure to give him this." At this point he gives a spectacle which is Lore
and No Drop. 
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ryx is in fact in the Overthere at the port for Evil beings. He
is disguised as a skeleton worker, He is on top of one of the boats that are
on dry dock being built. You can levitate to get up to him. Or you can go
under the ship and walk away from the water under the boat and you will
enter it. Then go to the other side and you will be able to go up to top of
boat . He will respond to no messages. Giving him the spectacle gets the
message, "a skeleton worker stops working and begins to open his creaking
jaw. I live to study and quench my thirst. I live to Bash the Faces of
Pariah and entangle myself in the ivy of evergreen. I live. I want to
remember" What he wants is four items:<br><br>(1) A Forbidden Pariah Mask from
Iksar Pariah (Lake of Ill Omens, Warsilk Woods, Swamp of No hope) <br>(2) an
Ivy evergreen ring guard (from the Forest Giant Evergreens in Warsilk
Woods)<br> (3) the spectacle (that's what you get from the master)<br>(4) a
bottle of Green Death Rum. <br><br>Once he has all these four items he gives you a
metal key. You must be Level 20 to finish up. Cast Identify on the key and
you'll get either TIN I or TIN II. Depending on which message you give the
key to the Tin Banker I or Tin Banker II in the Overthere bank. You have to
wait till the General who is in the bank leaves to check up on his troops.
Giving the key to the banker will get you a tome and some money. The tome
reads the same as the note Iksar monks get to give their Guild master when
they begin the game, but this is the tome the Master Wants. Give him the
Tome and your Dark Binder cap. The quest results in the Occultist Skullcap.
