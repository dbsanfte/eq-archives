<font size="+1" face="comic sans ms"><b>Beginning:</b><br><br>
	This quest follows the Hero's Krukri Quest.  It starts by talking to Arch Duke Xog and ask him about the "Lost Scrolls of Vok Na Zov."  Once you mention this to him, the Arch Duke will then tell you about Argent and the lost scrolls, saying that no one can understand them.  He will then commission you to retrieve an understandable copy of the scrolls.<br><br>

<b>Quest:</b><br><br>
	This quest has basically been divided into two parts.  The first one sends you around the world in search of Illegible Scrolls and the second part sends you into the Temple of Droga to decipher the Scrolls, and even meeting the lost crusader Argent.
	There are 6 illegible scrolls throughout the world.  The first one is found on the Fallen Crusader who is located in the Library of Kaesora.  The next 3 scrolls are found on the Spectral Courier in the stables of City of Mist.  The final 2 scrolls are found in Castle Mistmoore, on the continent of Faydwer.  The fifth one is on the Dark Librarian in the Library, and the sixth one is on the Dark Librarian Assistant who is in a side room near the Throne Room in Mistmoore
	After retrieving all 6 scrolls, the next step is to head to Temple of Droga.  In the Jail section, there will be a Goblin Penkeeper and a Goblin Penmaster.  You must kill these MOB's and their placeholders until you obtain the Bone Key (Penmaster), Bone Necklace Key (Penmaster), and Stone Key (Penkeeper).  Once you have all 3 keys, you must wait for an "enslaved iksar prisoner" to spawn, this is Argent.  If you hail him he will say nothing, but if you mention Greenmist he will tell you it is a foolish quest and to leave it alone.  Give him the 3 keys, and he will return to you "a course iron needle," the part needed to make the "Always Works" machine to work.  
	Now with the 6 Illegible Scrolls and "a course iron needle" go directly across from where the prisoners are kept, to another jail cell where the "Always Works" machine is kept.  This machine will look Pottery Wheel and you will need to place the scrolls and needle in it, hitting the combined button, in order to make the "Stupendous Tome."  Take the Tome and your Hero's Khukri and return them to the Arch Duke to receive some experience, faction, and the Lord of Pain's Khukri.

<b>Recommendations:</b>  <br><br>
	This seems to be a rather long quest that will require some friends.  When going after the various scrolls, it is important to take it slowly or the many mobs that are in each zone will likely overrun your party.  
	In Kaesora there are tons of undead along with spiders.  While waiting for the Fallen Crusader to spawn, make sure to keep up will all the other spawns in the area, or you will have a train on you very quickly.  The Fallen Crusader spawns inside the Library, and the respawn time for it and its placeholder is about 20 minutes.  For a group of 6 level 40's and above, holding the library wasn't too difficult.
	The scrolls in the City of Mist come off the Spectral Courier who is another named mob.  He can spawn in either of the two stables, but is most often found in the Uppers Stables.  These Scrolls are lore and no drop, so the only way to know if you have all three of the Scrolls is to try to loot them until you have all three.  This might take a bit of time, and it will be necessary to have almost a full group to successfully pull the stables.  Again, take it slowly or you will find yourself running to the zoneline.  For a full group of low to mid 40's this camp will be both fun and excellent for experience.  The mobs in this zone are a mixture of undead and live monsters, so trying to cast invisible on yourself and running into the stables will not work.
	For Castle Mistmoore it is important to know the zone.  It has two different spawn cycles, one during the day that consists of live mobs, and one during the night that consists of both live and undead mobs.  The best time to kill these named mobs is during the day, though both can spawn at either time.  Both are casters, so becareful, and are surrounded by 2 other mobs.  The Library is on the second floor and to the right, while the Librarian Assistant is located to the left of to the stairs, in the side room closest to the staircase.  These mobs are good experience for a group of low 40's players.  
	Droga is a pretty mean place.  Most mobs can cast damage shields on themselves, which are often times more damaging than the mobs, so have a Dispel Magic memorized.  They can also cast SoW on themselves in this dungeon, even though you can't, and will run.  So it is extremely important to snare all mobs or else you will die very quickly.  Once you get a certain distance into the zone, you have to take another way around to leave it.  The mobs in this zone consist of wizards, necros, shadow knights, warrior, thieves, and shamans.  A shrink potion is a must for this camp, as you have to move in between barred jail cells in order to get to the various mobs, NPC's and locations.  Getting down to jail is pretty straight forward, the only obstacles being mobs.  Don't take this too lightly though, as these mobs are in large numbers and if you cause a train, you likely will not be able to zone out.  At the Jail, you will find the Penmaster next to a small campfire at the entrance to the Jail.  His placeholder will be a stationary spawn that can be either a spider or any of the other types of goblins in the zone.  Once you have the two keys from him, move inside and clear that area out.  The penkeeper will be in there room directly next to the area where the iksar prisoners are kept.  His key is rarer than ones off the penmaster, so this part of the quest might take a few hours. 
	After getting the key from his body, you have to wait for the Enslaved Iksar Prisoner to spawn.  This will usually happened from 9 pm to 7 am game time and he will be wearing banded armor.  Be careful as there is another iksar prisoner in the room, and sometimes it will be a Crazed Iksar Prisoner that will attack anyone.  After turning in the keys and receiving the coarse iron needle go directly across to the jail cell with a pottery wheel in it.  There is one static spawn in this room, so don't be surprised.  Once you get the Tome, casting invisible on the party and running out is not a bad idea and will prevent unfortunate deaths.  Droga can be done by a full group of low to high 40's, but even with such a group, you must be extremely careful. 
	After finishing with Droga, head back to East Cabilis and turn in the two items to receive the Lord of Pain's Khukri.
