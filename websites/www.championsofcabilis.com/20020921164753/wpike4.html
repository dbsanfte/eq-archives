This is the Fourth Upgraded Warrior's Pike Quest. <br><br>

Talk to Druill Master Kyg and say, 'who is footman moglok'. Drill Master Kyg says 'My dear friend, Warlord Hikyg of the Swamp Gate, has encountered some difficulty with a Trooper Moglok. He requested that I find a brave Soldier to take charge of the situation. Are you willing to [assist Warlord Hikyg]? 
<br><br>
You say, 'I will assist the warlord Hikyg' 
<br><br>
Drill Master Kyg says 'Good. Take this note to Trooper Moglok of the Swamp Garrison. He shall instruct you on your mission. 
<br><br>
Hand the note to Moglok and Footman Moglok beams a big smile. 'Oh joy. They have finally sent someone to help me on my mission. I was once a Trooper, but I got demoted. I failed to bring Warlord Hikyg the three heads of the Gubbnubb Triplets. Here is one head, but we need them all. Track the other two down and take all three heads and your Soldier Pike to Warlord Hikyg. I quit this outfit!! 
<br><br>
The head you get identifies as Head of Narsh. The other two heads drop from Froglok Outlanders in either Guk/Innothule
or, more readily, in the Swamp of No Hope.  The Swamp of No Hope spot is at pos829, neg2889. This is near the zone to Trakanon's Teeth.  Keep all the frogs dead and eventually a Froglok Outlander will spawn. One head always drops with a mushroom, and the other,
rarer one, drops with an ornate tin box. 
<br><br>
After you get the heads, you turn them in to Warlord Hikyg with your pike
and get the plans.
<br><br>
If you ask Weaponsmith Gurgle "what trooper's pike" he replies that you need a long iron rod (buy from a vendor), a forging hammer and a troopers pike head (along with the trooper's pike plans). To make the troopers pike head you need a geozite tool and a radiant meteorite, which can be foraged in the burning woods. 
<br><br>The Final Result is:<br><br>

Not a very usuable weapon at the level it's obtainable but the AC is nice as well it's got a nice look to it.
