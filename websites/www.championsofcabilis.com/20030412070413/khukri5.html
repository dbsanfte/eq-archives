	This quest starts after you complete the Zealot's Khukri quest.  Lord Qyzar mentions a [matter of betrayal].  You say, "what matter of betrayal?"  He responds, "One of our agents, a Hero by the name of Goxnok, has found evidence that the book titled, Charasis, has been taken from this temple and is to be delivered to an unknown foe in the outlands. Go at once to the lower levels of the temple and greet Goxnok. Hurry before he departs."  
	When you reach the bottom level, you find an iksar crusader waiting for you.  You say , "hail goxnok."  To which he responds to you, "Hail, fellow crusader!  Hero Goxnox of the Temple of Terror is ready to do the bidding of his lords.  Are you the one who is to [apprehend the traitor]?"
	You tell him, "I will apprehend the traitor."
	Goxnok responds to you, "This cannot be.  I was told a duke would attend the matter.  Still, if the Lords have sent you, then you must be able to complete the task.  The [traitor] most certainly must be stopped from delivering the [Charasis Tome].  The [recipients] appear quite formidable and I cannot handle such a deed, not single-handed."
	You respond, "what charasis tome?"
	Goxnok tells you, "The Charasis Tome, the tome of the old city of Charasis.  It was taken from this temple and must be returned.  The one sent to [apprehend the traitor] who stole the tome must be [ready to depart] with me at once."
	You tell him, "I am ready to depart."
	You receive the a silver looking coin from Goxnok.
	Goxnok then makes some movements about putting a backpack on his shoulder and says, "Very well.  I shall follow shortly.  You must depart on your own.  Go to the plains of the old skinless outpost.  Beware, they have returned and patrol the hillside.  Keep an eye on the gates of the outpost.  I will be disguised within their ranks, I shall kneel as a sign. Give me this coin as your token."
	There are a few other messages that you could have said to receive more information.  If you say, "who are the recipients?"
	Goxnok will show signs of fear, while his face turns olive, and will tell you, "I do not know.  The [spider riders]!!  I have only heard tales of them from dying lizards.  Evil skinless stubs.  From the wounds inflicted on the lizards, I can tell they are vicious opponents.  Bloated and frayed flesh, disembowelment.  Their steeds must have also joined the fray, for some of the victims were covered in webs."
	If your respond to this by saying, "what spider riders?" He will say, "As I have reported, the babble states they appear to be skinless stubs who ride giant spiders. Most encounters occur when the moon is high.  Little is known about them and only in recent weeks have they begun to appear."
	Also you can ask the iksar crusader, Goxnok, "who is the traitor?" and he will tell you that, "I am afraid I do not know.  The babble is that he is from Cabilis, but he could have been a disguised sarnak.  Who knows?  The tink is that at night within the Outland territory, near the old skinless outpost, they are to meet.  We should depart at once.  Go get outfitted and let me know when you are [ready to depart]."
	This will again lead to you saying you are ready to depart, receiving the coin, and beginning the quest.

Quest:<br><br>
	After talking to the iksar crusader, Goxnok, you must head to Firiona Vie to complete this quest.  Once in the zone, you must go to /loc of about -2500, -1550 and wait for Tracker Azreal to appear.  When he is indifferent to you, usually after 7 or 8 pm game time, give him the coin.  He will then reveal himself as Goxnok and say "I cannot see well in this disguise but I thought I smelled you.  I have [news of the Charasis Tome].  	You ask him, "what news of the charasis tome" and he will reply that "The Charasis tome has been scribed and now another copy exists.  The traitor obviously wants to keep a copy for himself.  I told you will deliver both copies to Lord Qyzar along with your Zealot Khukri and you shall be awarded that of a crusader.  Let us rest for a minutes, and then I shall show you the meeting place."  
	He stays in place for a few seconds, and then will just run off.  You must follow him as he makes his way to the meeting place.  During the journey he will stop twice.  I don't remember what he says the first time, but the second stop he says, "Look!! There past the wolf people, near an ancient tunnel can be found the meeting place.  I fear we may be too late.  I thought I saw a shadow dash from the tunnels, but I did not see any spider riders.  We will see when we reach it."  
	You then proceed to around /loc -639, 946 and confront the drachnid spy.  You have to kill it, Goxnok will help you a bit but will heal the drachnid as well.  Once you kill the spy, loot it to receive the Charasis Tome.  
	Now you hail Goxnok again and he sighs slowly and /em's seeing confusion on your face.  He then tells you, "Yes Sasraaz (in my case), I am the traitor.  What I can gain by giving up this tome outweighs any patriotic obligations I may have once had.  That city is dead, it is now time for you to choose Iksar.  You can walk away and never spead of this to anyone…or you can die…what will it be?"  You then fight and kill him to receive the Charasis Tome Copy.  
	Head back to East Cabilis, and turn the Tome, the copy, and your Zealot's Krukri into Lord Qyzar, who is on the second floor of the Shadow Knight guild.  Lord Qyzar is the person that originally mentioned the "matter of betrayal."  Once turned in you will receive exp, faction, and a Crusader's Krukri.

Recommendations: <br><br> 
	This is a damn hard quest.  Probably harder than the Hero's Krukri quest that actually follows this one.  It is hard not because the MOB's you have to kill are particularly challenging, rather the other MOB's that jump in are difficult.  I did this quest at level 42, and had Crad (Level 40 Shaman, and Siak (Level 46 Monk) with me and by the end of the quest we were quite beaten up.  There is no way that I can see a level 42 Shadow Knight doing this by himself unless no MOB's jumped in, but I don't believe that is possible.  I recommend a larger group with healers and people that can invis and SoW the whole party.
	First off, to get to the location where you first meet Goxnok when disguised like Tracker Azreal, the best idea is definitely not the straight approach.  FV is loaded with people that hate Iksars and can see through invisible.  Either go through the Swamp of No Hope and follow the zone wall until you get to /loc -2500, -1550 or enter through the Lake of Ill Omen, and go clock wise around the zone wall until you can get close enough to make a break for that /loc.  
	Once at the first meeting place, make sure you are invis'ed and wait for 8 pm game time (watch out for Caster looking pilgrims as they tend to see through invis).  Once 8 pm rolls around, look for the tracker.  I found him actually in a rock and was only able to give him the coin by clicking on his feet.  I think this was an isolated incident though, as I have never heard of that before or after completing the quest.  Before hailing him, definitely check if he is indifferent to you when you are visible to him.  So get a good distance away, have FD ready to go, and then uninvis and con him.  If he is indifferent, make sure no MOB's are around him, and then give him the coin.  If there are MOB's around, especially Pilgrims and Drixies, they will jump him and you almost immediately and that is not a fight that you want.
	So after giving him the coin and speaking with him, you will have about 20 seconds or so to make sure everyone has SoW and I recommend invising again.  He will then start running, follow him, but again beware of Pilgrims during the journey.  Goxnok is going to stop 2 times and mention some stuff.  Don't uninvis until you actually see the Drachnid spy, and then when you do start to fight it, make sure you are far enough away from the two camps of Drovargs that are in the area and away from, if possible, the roamers.  
	The spy is easy to kill, so is Goxnok.  Once they are killed and you have the two items, invis and follow the wall counter clock wise around the zone until you get to the zone that you originally entered FV in.  Head back to East Cabilis, turn in the 3 items, and congratulations on completing one hell of a quest.
