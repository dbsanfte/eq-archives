<font size="+1" face="comic sans ms">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you deem yourself ready to enter true knighthood?  
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time you must approach Lord Korzin and ask him "what is a skull of torture?"  The skull 
you seek is a stolen skull hidden deep inside Kurns tower, and is called a 
"glowing skull" (not to be confused with a "skull with an X" which is for a 
shaman quest).  Proceed to Kurn's tower at about the 15th level of existence 
witha group, or 18th for being alone.  Kurns by the way is excellent 
experience and the bone chips I have delved from there still supply my 
making of a pet at level 49!  If you proceed to the second floor basement of 
Kurn's tower and seek greater scalebones, they will mayhap drop your skull.  
Be warned the skull is fairly rare so do not give up.  Return the glowing 
skull and the Squire's khukri to be knighted and receive the Knight's Khukri.
