<font size="+1" face="comic sans ms">After you complete the last quest Mystic Dovan replies, "Mystic Dovan his voice booms loud and does not sound the same as before. You have brought the skulls back to the empire. For this you shall be rewarded. You are now a prophet of the Temple of Terror. Go and find the Skulls of Die Nozok. I shall wait within Zand. Bring them along with your Iron Cudgel of the Prophet."<br><br>
When he say's he will wait within Zand it is assumed that the skulls and cudgel to complete this one will be handed in to Hierophant Zand. When his voice booms loud and does not sound the same as before it is assumed he is Dai Or Die Nozok speaking through Mystic Dovan.  <br>
<br>The Iksar Skull Helm which drops off the Iksar Adherant in the Sarnak Fortress has been identified at Skull of Die NoZok. It's a common drop off of them and they are about lvl 22. <br><br>
The Skull of Dai Nozok is a much trickier one to get.  It involves a bit of a side quest.  First you must go to the Iksar Camp in the Swamp of No Hope. This is the same spot that Shadow Knights go for their pages so if you have a friend working on that quest you should hook up.  You are after the Froglok Ton Warriors who spawn near there.  They drop 3 Ton Warrior Totems and a Key of Dai. You need the three totems which will identify as the Top, Bottom and Middle of the Dai Key to make the second Key of Dai. They are lore so keep grabbing em till you have 3 of em. It took me about 3 hours to get all of them and by that point I had 7 Pages for the SK khukri quest heh heh.  Then it's off
to the Burning Woods for some Mendglow Clay. Remember this great substance from the 2nd Cudgel Upgrade. At least now you will be high enough level to travel to Burning Woods without dying. Once there I'd start auctioning for Mendglow clay while you forage. Otherwise it could take a while. Most druids will just let you have it. Combine the 3 pieces of the Dai Totem with the Mendglow clay and voila you will make the 2nd Key of Dai.  
<br><br>
The Next component is a tricky one. It is from The Mines of Nurga. The Mines are a seldom fought in place unfortunately but it also means the camp you need will likely be all yours. I soloed the camp at lvl 40 but anything less I'd get some friends. It would be good exp for a group in their low to mid 30's.  None of the Goblins in Nurga see invisible so invis yourself and head past the front guards. Once in nurga head to the right up a small waterfall. You want to get yourself to the room at -1400, -1200. Here you will find 2 sets of mobs on each side of the room by some tents. Keep everything in that room dead and eventually Overseer Glubbish will pop. He is a mid 30's mob who will drop a Skull Canopic. This is the last item on your quest.
<br><br>
Next you take your items 1) Skull Canopic 2)Key of Dai 3)Key of Dai to Overthere.  Here's where the quest is bugged but doable.  Inside the town of Overthere you will find an Iksar named Galdon Vok Nir. He won't speak to you as his faction is bugged but he is the one looking for these items.  Here's where it gets tricky. Get a partner who can cast invis. Galdon Vok Nir is very low level and won't aggro. Approach him and get your 3 items out, hand em to him in a trade window along with 400 gp (40pp has been reported to work also).  Before you click on trade have your friend cast invis on you. That will make your faction with him indifferent. He will hand you the much sought after Skull of Dai Nozok.<br><br>
Return to Zand and hand in the 2 skulls with your Cudgel of the Prophet for:<br><br>

<br><br>GM Aradiel who handles these quests has promised to fix the faction of Galdon Vok Nir so hopefully by next patch this can be done properly without a partner. This is the first truly quality cudgel, hopefully the next one will be something people will really want to use. This one would be good for a mid 20's Shaman though.
