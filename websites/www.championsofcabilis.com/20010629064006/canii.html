<font size="+1" face="comic sans ms">At Level 39 Shaman are given an upgraded Cannibalize spell, Cannibalize II.
It is not quite as mana efficient as Cannibalize I, but it is much faster so can get you that crucial extra bit of mana 
you need for healing that dying tank.  Many will claim that the quest is not doable at lvl 39 and not to bother attempting 
it till lvl 45ish.  They are wrong as I have just completed it at lvl 40, starting at lvl 39.
<br><br>
The Quest originates the Timorous Deep.  At the Ogre Village by the boat to Overthere you will find occasionally The Mighty Oowump.
She is a low 30's Ogre Shaman who will be indifferent to Iksars.  The other Ogres aren't and she will change her attitude once you 
kill one in her presence so be a bit careful, she's tough.  She will tell you of the time she spent with a Barbarian family The McMerins.
She stole the spell McMerin's Feast which will require Clay of Ghiosk, Crushed Dread Diamonds and Powder of Yun. Most rare are chips from the bones of one who has touched the Bath of Obulus. 
Handing in these components will get you in return the spell.
<br><br>
The first item Crushed Dread Diamonds are by far the easiest. There is a difficult way to get these which involves charming a tough NPC in Dreadlands and some other questing but there's a much 
easier way to get this.  Go to Timorous Deep and fire up levitate and sow/scale of the wolf.  Head to the South East corner and the Golra Island (location: -8840, -6080) Along the beach here you will
find the Crushed Dread Diamonds free for the taking. I have heard they are an 8 hour spawn but they were right there when I went there.
<br><br>
The Powder of Yun is Yun Shaman Powder. This is a little more tricky. It drops off Froglok Yun Shaman in Trakanon's Teeth. They spawn closer to Old Sebilis so will be very difficult to get on your own 
without a good group.  There is other Shaman powder that drops that is white, you don't want this it's a decoy.  The Black Yun Shaman Powder isn't NO DROP so my advice is to fight at the zone to the Swamp of No Hope
and simply auction for it.  It's a great spot to practice your new spells and get good experience. Park your dog and keep on pulling.  Eventually some kind soul will give or sell you some of the powder.
<br><br>
The next item is Greyish Bone Chips which drop in Karnor's Castle off the Skeletal Warlord. Best thing to do here is zone into Karnors and be patient. Auction to loot the bone chips, they are NO DROP and useless to everyone but Shaman.
If you don't have any Jarsath Armour auction for looting some of this excellent NO DROP armour while you're here to make the trip worthwhile. 
<br><br>
The toughest part of this quest I found to be the Strange Ochre Clay. It drops fairly deep in the City of Mist from the Army Behemoth. CoM is a great place to hunt though so if you can get a group at the bridge you will not only get some
of the items for the epic quest but also get some great experience here.  The Clay isn't NO DROP so again a higher level may have some or some rotting in a bank account. This took a lot of auctioning to get as most people just destroy it :(
<br><br>
When you finally get this piece you can head back to Oowump and turn in these 4 item for your new spell.  Some people will tell you Cannibalize I is a better spell but I bet they don't have Cannibalize II.  From some I've talked to the ratio of mana
to hp becomes better the higher level you are with this spell so you're ahead of the game if you get this one early. I have found that at level 40 you are better off with Cannibalize I.  Apparently lvl 45 is when the ratio really works well for Can II.
Enjoy.
