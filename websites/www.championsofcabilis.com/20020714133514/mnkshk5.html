<font size="+1" face="comic sans ms">Approx level 25.  After completing the Shackle of Rock Quest, Master Niska says he has heard
of [troubles with an outlander]. Say, 'what troubles with an outlander' and
Master Niska says 'It seems Klok Ephmir has encountered an outlander who was
hunting the food we lizards enjoy. The Legion will not act without proof of
this outlanders existence. We were asked by the Baron to find this proof. We
shall do this. You shall provide me with the outlanders head and the
shackles of Rock and Stone!!" 

<br><br>
Klok ephmir can be found on the island of merchants. You say, 'hail Klok
Ephmir'. Klok Ephmir stares at you with a wicked smirk. So you share the
Brood's love of Frogloks. Alive, they provide much trouble. Dead, they
provide much delight. I have found many uses for the Frogloks. From fine
meat to fine mats. Ask if you do not see something. You say, 'what
outlander'. Klok Ephmir turns pale at the mention of the Outlander. The
Outlander!! That is what the lizards in the Tink N' Babble have dubbed him!!
He is tall and strong. Get close enough and he will kill you on sight!! I
think he could even defeat the likes of Bruiser Noz!! I spotted him near the
edge of the swamps. He was headed toward the fields of Firiona. 
<br><br>

Kwinn the Outlander Spawns in Fironia Vie. He is a rare spawn and is usually
killed by Frogloks soon after he spawns. Kill him and he drops a head.
Return his head and shackles of rock and stone to receive the shackle of
copper.
