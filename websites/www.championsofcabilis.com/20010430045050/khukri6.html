Unfortunately, I really don't know how this quest starts.  I have heard that it starts
 by asking Lord Qyzar about either the Visceral Dagger, or about the two crusaders 
 who were sent after the dagger, Golin and Fodcod.  I figure this isn't the most
 important part of the quest, while the history part of it would be interesting.  
<br><br>
Quest:<br><br>
The quest asks you to find the pieces of the Visceral Dagger, put it back together,
and then return it to Lord Qyzar with your Crusaders Khukri, with the result being
exp, faction and the very nice Hero's Khukri.  To perform this task, you must head
to Dalnir, and camp 4 different rooms for the 4 pieces necessary for the dagger.
The exact places and mobs for the pieces of the dagger are listed below.  The 
Hilt looks like a long metal tube/pipe.  The Forge Hammer of Dalnir looks like 
a normal war hammer or Forging Hammer, the Jagged Metal Shard and Sharp Metal Shard look like a
Canine tooth.  Once you have acquired these pieces, you must combined 
them all (3 pieces of dagger and hammer) in the "Always Works Forge" also located in 
Dalnir.  Once combined, you will have the Visceral Dagger, and then, as stated above,
you turn in the Visceral Dagger and your Crusader's Krukri into Lord Qyzar, who is 
up in the Shadow Knight's Guild, for <br><br>

<br>
Recommendations:<br>  <br>
The hilt seems to be the easiest part to get, as the Kly Implicator is surrounded by relatively weak mobs (compared to the others on the 3rd floor).  Bhayne (36th Necro), Ishy (34th Shaman), and I, (37th SK) at the time got it easy.  
The Forge Hammer of Dalnir is the second easiest item to get, as the statue room has only 4 or 5 static spawns and the Undead Crusader drops it every time it pops up.  I got this hammer with 4 or 5 people, ranging from about 34 to 39, but probably could be done with fewer people at the same level or the same number of people but with lower levels.  Healers is a must for this room.
NOTE:  IF ARE GOING TO THE THIRD FLOOR IN DALNIR AT ALL, MAKE SURE YOU ARE ABLE TO INVIS, OR YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO GET OUT.  IF YOU CAN'T INVIS YOURSELF I WOULD BRING A 5 DOSE INVIS POTION WITH YOU JUST TO BE SAFE.
The 3rd and 4th item are equally hard to get.  The 3rd item, the sharp metal shard, is located in the church room, with about 8 or 9 Kly static spawns, many of who are casters.  Best advice here is to pull sets of 2 or 3 from the room with a monk, using FD pulling, who has high magic resist, and keep doing that until the room is clear, move in, and wait for the repops, killing them as fast as possible.  Unfortunately, the Kly in the Church room is a rather rare/long spawn. I have personally camped him for 4 hours, and have yet to see him.  This was done with a group of 3 (37 Shaman, 40 Monk, and 40 SK) with the hardest part being the initial clear of the room (props to Jedielder for the amazing FD pulling that night).  
The 4th item, the Jagged Metal Shard, is dangerous and hard to get.  You must venture almost to the end of the 3rd floor of Dalnir and fight off many Kly, many of who are casters, in order to get to the Lab and kill the Kly Implicator who is also strong.  This is dangerous because of the number of Kly in the vicinity.  I lucked out and had a 50+ Necro who was already killng the Implicator letting me loot the item.  I would recommend a high 30's group, with a least 4, one who is a healer another who is a good pulling monk.  Pull the Kly's in surrounding areas into the empty room right after the "River" on the third floor, but before the Kly rooms.  After those have been clear, move in closer, to the lab, but not into the lab, and then wait for the Implicator to spawn, killing all other pops as quickly as possible.  Beware of the room down the hall from the Lab, as it is filled with many Kly, many of whom are casters.
The final part to making the Visceral Dagger is to take the pieces of the dagger to the "Always Works" Forge in the "Forge Room" in Dalnir.  I haven't done this yet, but have seen the room.  It has 2 static spawns, sometimes casters, sometimes not.  The danger of this place is that the next two rooms are full of Kly, one of which has the Kly Overseer in it.  I would think the best way to do take this room would be everyone invis into the room, wait for everyone to get there, and bum rush the two static spawns, making sure to snare/darkness them.  If you don't get them quick and the runners get into the other two rooms, you are dead (Monk's and SK's FD, Casters Gate, Warriors try to get a res).  After you make the dagger, invis the group and head to the teleporter.  
After that just make sure you turn in the correct items into the correct NPC, and congratulations on getting a really nice weapon.
