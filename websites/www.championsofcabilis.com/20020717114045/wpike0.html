Drill Master Vygan in Fortress Talishan discusses how to upgrade pikes. The Drill Master says that each upgrade requires a geozite tool. When asked about that he hands you a Pincer Satchel which he requires two Large Scorpion Pincers to return to him and prove you are a real warrior. When you return it, he assigns you a new task. The task varies, and seems to be randomly assigned, but seem to each result in a geozite tool. It may be that you need to do each and can keep increasing the level of your pike through new upgrades. Here are some I know: (1) He gives you a note to deliver to Lord Vyzer in Warslik. It appears some goblin thieves have stolen some pages from a poem he once wrote. He seeks the return of the pages (giving you a 4 slot contain book to fill), and promises the tool upon completion of the task. (2) He gives you a note to take to Warlord Hizyg in the Swamp of No Hope. The Warlord will then give you a bag to fill with 8 froglok slave shackles and bring it back to him. (3) He gives you a note to Lord Zyzz in Field of Bone. 
<br><br>Warlord Zyzz gives you a sack to fill with 4 scorched bone shards from militia skeletons. Completing the task gets you a Geozite Tool, which is used to forge the warrior pike quests.
