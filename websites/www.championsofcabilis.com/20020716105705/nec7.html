<font size="+1" face="comic sans ms">After gaining your 6th Skullcap, talk to Harbinger Glosk. Tell him " I 
am the new revenant". He will stop his chanting and gaze into your mind. <p></p>

He says, " Yes. Yes you are. You shall do as I command. Take this. It 
is incomplete and must be ready for the emperor within the half season. You 
must find the [ Four Missing Gems ]. When you have them, then you will have 
to Quest for the  [ Grand Forge of Dalnir ]. Within it's fire, all shall 
combine. Return the Sceptre to me with your Revenant Skullcap. Go. " 
<p></p>
You recieve a No Drop/ Lore Item sceptre with an icon and stats of a 
mace. 
<p></p>
Ask Glosk " What Four Missing Gems ", and he says: <p></p>
The missing sceptre gems are; An Eye of Rokgus, A Gem of Yet To Come, 
A Heart Of Torsis, and The Crown Jewel Of Ganak. 
<p></p>
      Ask Glosk " What Grand Forge Of Dalnir " and he says: 
      " I know little of it other than it once belonged to the Ancient 
Haggle Baron, Dalnir. From what I have read, it's fires require no skill, but 
will melt any common forge hammer used. Dalnir was said to call upon The 
Ancients for a hammer which could tolerate the magical flames. " 
<p></p>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. No brainer about the Magical Forge. If you have traveled far, and 
reached Dalnir, the Always Works Forge is the forge you need. 
<p></p>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. The Magical Forge Hammer you will need can be " borrowed " form the 
Undead Smith who is also found in Dalnir. 
<p></p>
      Now for the gems: 
<p></p>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Eye of Rokgus - The Burynia Slaves found in the Mines of Nurga drop 
this gem. The Slaves are a rare spawn, so be ready for long camping times. 
<p></p>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Gem of Yet to Come - The Sarnek Gem Oracles which are found at Lake 
of Ill Omen and The Overthere, drop this gem. 
<p></p>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. A Heart of Torsis - Conned as " a shiny emerald ", drops off a 
Greater Charbone which carries a fine steel ulak and a shield ' Captain of 
the Guard '. He can be found in the upper level of the Emerald Jungle. I think this may drop from the Captain of the Guard in City of Mist as well.
<p></p>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. The Crown Jewel Of Ganak - Dropped by a Pirate in Firiona Vie. 
<p></p>
      Put the four gems, with Sceptre, and the Smith hammer into the Always 
Works Forge and you will get the completed sceptre. Return the sceptre and your Revenant Skullcap to gain 
your 7th Skullcap.
