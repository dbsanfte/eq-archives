<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>Today was the wedding of Ishy Drackos and Srarnu Shadowcast (now Drackos). Was a great time for all who attended. Took a while to get the GM to come for the ceremony but it was a good chance for Champs old and new to hang out and meet each other. Tipsy Bartender dusted off his armor and came out as well as our old pal Sasraaz. The wedding was held on the island beside the Tangrin and he watched the whole thing. After the ceremony which included a lot of weeping Iksar we celebrated with booze, food and dueling. Cakaris was the Arena Champion schooling myself, Xakanis and I think one other.<br></font>

<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>Congratulations to Jebrn who was promoted to Officer yesterday. He has been a long time Champion who always looks out for his brethren. Welcome to the club Jeb.  The new pic of the week shows the cowardly Shaman Sslarr in one of his usual poses. One can almost hear him screaming, "Not the Face! Not the Face."  Hope Cazic-Thule doesn't see this shot Sslarr, for shame!<br></font>

<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>All Champions and their friends are cordially invited to the Wedding of Ishy Drackos and Srarnu Shadowcast this Saturday, September 29th at 4PM PST/7PM EST in the Field of Bone.  This should be a fun event. If you've ever wanted to see the Champions create a newbie Iksar on the Nameless to join us in our celebration. There will be booze, fireworks, and general merriment.  Don't miss the Cabilis social event of the year!!!!<br></font>

<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>Updated the picture of the day today. It shows Scalis in the Stonebrunt Mountains. Scalis has moved from a new recruit to part of the gang right away with his generosity and maturity. Thanks for the pic Scalis. Cleaned up the members page a bit today too. It needs some serious work. <br></font>

<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>30,000 hits for this website today. Well not all today of course but over the course of a year mostly. I'm pretty impressed by that. I started this website with zero knowledge of HTML and no real concept but it came together. Thanks to all who have contributed and all who visit. You make me proud!<br></font>

<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>We lost one of the great Champions today. Chable Bloodyfist was one of the longest standing Champions. He originally got me into this game as we played together on a clan in Team Fortress Classic. We spoke at length about his feelings with EQ.  He has joined Brothers of Darkness our allied guild and will still be around.  As with many of us post-50 EQ can become a drag at times. He was looking for something to spice things up and found he was grouping more regularily with those guys. He will always be around to help out any Champs and will still be around for the joint BoD/CoC raids. /Salute Chable we will miss you over here.</br></font>

<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>Today was an awful day in the history of the world. Terrorist attacks on the United States took place on a scale never seen before.  Our hearts go out to anyone who was directly touched by this tragedy.  All EQ issues pale in comparison.<br></font>

<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>Been a fairly quiet week for the Champions this past week. Mostly just people exping. There was a Fear raid with Honor Bound but it turned out to be a 5 hour corpse retrieval so we won't mention that =p. Going to be some restructuring of the Guild Officers and their duties over the next week, I'll keep you posted.<br></font>
