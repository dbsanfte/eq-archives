<font size="+1" face="comic sans ms">This is the first of the series of Cudgel Upgrade Quests. These quests can provide you with a half-decent weapon at low levels and some adventure. The eventual reward is an excellent item.<br><br>
The First Quest is triggered after you complete the Mud Crabs quest or by asking Hierophant Oxyn, "What Lost Skulls." <br><br>
He tells you, "You must have heard of the Trilac Brotherhoods disappearance. They are the skulls of three soon to be ancients. They were taken from this temple by a silent intruder. Crusaders are always on duty. I do not know how they got into our vault. Every petitioner is ordered to search for the three skulls and return them to me along with their Petitioner Cudgel and then they shall become Clairvoyants." <br><br>
This quest can be done at around lvl 6 as you'll need gate to get out easily. There are actually 2 ways to get to the spot where the Iksar Outcasts spawn. This is the way I did it. You can apparently swim to it from the Canals in East Cabilis also.  <p></p>
Go in the East tower of the Shaman guild into the basement. You get up there by walking through the curtains down there.  
If you cruise around down there you should see a large pit with a drop for about 100 damage so be full health when you do this and sneak as close to the edge as possible before dropping. Once down heal up and head to the back end of the cave down there. Push along the wall and you will find a a secret wall. It pops you into a room with 2 low level mobs (scorps, wolfs, skelly's, mosquito's) that spawn on opposite sides of the room. In this room keep those spawns clear. They spawn every 30 seconds or so so keep killing. You can make some good money down there but the exp is a joke at this level. Eventually an
 Iksar outcast will spawn. Kill him and he drops one of the 3 lost skulls. You need to have 3 different ones, they are all named - Waz Skull, Logrin, and Morgl. Keep it up till you get 3, then gate out. There is a way to walk out but trust me it's much safer gating. Hand in these 3 skulls with your Cudgel to Hierophant Oyxn and he will give you The Iron Cudgel of the Clairvoyant pictured below.  To make sure you are in the right room killing the right spawns take a stroll down the hall you should see a small staircase, if you do then the room you were in is the right one.<br><br>
