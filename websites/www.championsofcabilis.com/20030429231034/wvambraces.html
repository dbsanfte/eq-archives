This particular fighter uses his tongue liberally while fighting. He has ingested many deadly contagions and licked things from the slimy surfaces of the darkest and dankest crevasses imaginable. His tongue will do well to further our cause in pain and suffering. <br><br>
Pit Fighter Dob is in the goblin fort in WW. Take his tongue back to Vek for a note. Take the note to Xlixinar with banded sleeves for :
