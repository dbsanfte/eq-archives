<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>VICTORY! The Champions of Cabilis were victorious in their defense of our fair city yesterday versus the 7th Legion. This was an excellent event I'm sure for both sides.  We had a force or near 40 Champions, the most online at one time ever.  We gathered our forces by the large Iksar statues in the Lake of Ill Omen.  After some wrangling, war was declared on both sides and the battle began. It was fast, furious, and extremely laggy but a heck of a lot of fun.  Each group had a target and executed well.  I was taken down by Fortenbras wolf but he too would fall soon after.  One of their druids did escape and try kiting us but in the end The Legion conceded victory to the Iksar. Congratulations to all those who came out, it was a great job by all.  Cazic is proud of his chosen ones on this day.  Pics of the event can be found <a href="pics2.html"> HERE</a>  Thanks for those who sent them in.  Now we must not grow too content, it is time to plan our next event.</font><br>

<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>I've changed the news format today. If you want to see any of the older news click on the link for the month at the top and you will have the news for that specific month. Just a way of keeping the front page a little more trim.  Our upcoming guild war is featured in the news items on <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/">EQ VAULT</a> the biggest EQ news site out there. Rejoice in our fame Champions, you've worked hard for it.  Now rest up for battle.<br></font>

<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>Big Lizard Roar for Scarlax. He sent me in all the Warrior Trooper Scale Armour quest info which has now been posted.  Great job Scarlax. We now have the best resource for Iksar quests on the net. If anyone knows of any other quests we don't have info posted on by all means send it in. I think the next phase we'll work on is putting up guides for each of the classes.  Our glorious day of battle is only 3 days away now, train hard Champions!<br></font>
<font size="3" color="white" face="courier new" >  Wednesday November 29th, 2000</b><br></font>
<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>Finished Shaozin's quest writeups today. The Necro ones are up and as well I got graphics for both the Monk and Necro ones. We now have the greatest Iksar resource on the net that I know of. Congratulations all !  Also we've moved past 4000 hits, another accomplishment.  There is an important post by Shaozin regarding items given to you by fellow guild members. Please take a read, it's on the general section of the forum.  Basically any item given to by a higher level for free is to be in turn passed on for free to another needy Iksar, not sold for profit.  Think of it as selling your XMAS presents, that doesn't go over well.  4 Days till the Battle stay ready brothers.<br></font>

<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>Shaozin got me the write-ups for the Monk and Necro quests today. I have put up the Monk ones, hope to get the Necro ones up tomorrow. You can view them on the quests link.  I added a new section on the forum called News. Feel free to tell of your adventures in Norrath for the day in here. Should be fun, thanks to Belfior for the idea.  I've been really busy at work this week so apologize for the slow updates.  If you've sent something into me it should be up now. There are a few new pics up on the pics link. A very cool one of Belfior especially.  Hopefully I'll be cleaning up the members list a lot this week, clearing out old members, etc as well.  Be strong Champions, our battle with the Barbarians approaches. Don't forget this Sunday at 3PM PST/6PM EST in the Lake of Ill Omen we do battle with The 7th Legion. <br></font>
