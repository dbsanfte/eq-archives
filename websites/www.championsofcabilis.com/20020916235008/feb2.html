      <li><font face="comic sans ms" size="3">Well how's that for taking a break 
        from updates? Way too long I know but I have been super busy. Went down 
        to Salt Lake City for a week and a half to cheer on the Canadian Olympic 
        Team. Looks like my cheering worked though Canada finished 4th in medals 
        and soundly defeated the Americans in Hockey. But enough RL stuff. I'm 
        back in EQ land now. My account has expired so I have to get it going 
        again but I should be around by this weekend. The pic of the week features 
        Scalis learning from the Skorpiki masters.</font> 
        <p><font size="3" color="white" face="courier new">Friday February 8th, 
        2002</font> 
      <li><font face="comic sans ms" size="3">A group of Champs made a foray into 
        Chardok this week. They got fairly deep I'm told and had a number of close 
        calls. Way to kill Sarnaks! Dracyal was also promoted to the rank of officer, 
        congrats to him. Have a good weekend.</font> 
        <p><font size="3" color="white" face="courier new">Monday February 4th,

      <LI><font face="comic sans ms" size="3">Last night saw the Champions raiding 
        the City of Mist to complete Sasraaz and my epics. This was an ambitious 
        plan but definitely a doable one. Unfortunately when we arrived the SK 
        mob Lhanrc wasn't up. Sas was bummed I'm sure but didn't show it. We then 
        went to assault Lord Rak' Ashiir. We had an initial wipeout then a regroup 
        before we were finally able to slay the bastage! We went after Neh'Ashiir 
        after that to complete my epic but that resulted in another wipeout so 
        we called it a night after that. Well Cakaris thought that he'd like to 
        upstage us so with his new copy of Torpor he set off on a rite of passage 
        for all uber lvl 60 Shaman - The Soloing of the Dragon Yeldema. Cakaris 
        soloed the baby dragon and the screenshot of the week proves it. And wait 
        that's not all, I'm not out of quality news yet (that's what happens when 
        I don't update the page for a couple weeks =p) I have officially passed 
        on the torch of leadership of the Champions of Cabilis to Ishy Drackos. 
        Ishy has been my right hand man from day one of this guild and is the 
        perfect replacement for me. He has passion and fire for this game. I have 
        been playing a lot less lately and rather than feeling guilty about it 
        I'd rather just assume an officer/webmaster role. You shouldn't notice 
        too much of a difference in the day to day stuff. If anything there will 
        be more events and the guild will get stronger. I haven't retired though, 
        you'll still see my ugly mug around Cabilis.</font>
