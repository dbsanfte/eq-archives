<font size="+1" face="comic sans ms">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next cudgel upgrade can be quite a fun quest to do as it involves 4 different items and pottery skill. After turning in your skulls and cudgel from the previous quest Hierophant Oxyn again sends you to find more skulls. He says that the skulls of the ancients have been sent away, and offers you the task of retrieving them, but first, to prove yourself, you must retrieve the two skulls of the 'Cleansers of the Outlands.' <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first skull drops in the Lake in the lake of Ill Omen. It drops off a lvl 10ish MOB called the Stuffed Barracuda.  This allows you to put some of your newly aquired spells to use. Go to the South side of the lake by the goblin ruins there. Make sure you have plenty of batwings as you will need levitate to pull this off.  Once you are levitating head for the ruins in the lake itself and start working on your spell sense animals. There are many normal barracuda's that will eat you for breakfast here so be very careful not to break the water or lose your levitate around there it's not a fun place to do corpse retrieval.
Once you find the stuffed barracuda move forward casting more sense animals till you get a good bead on it. Then break the water (a light source is really helpful here too) and the barracuda should go down quickly as it'll be high green/low blue to you. Once it dies, right click it immediately or your precious skull will sink to the bottom of the lake. That'll get you the Skull with an I.  
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other skull is much more involved. It requires three separate pieces sculpted together with pottery skill.  The first item is A Jawless Skull. It drops off the Rogue Shaman who spawns at the first bandit/marauder ruins you come to when zoning into Warslick's Woods from Field of Bone. Bring a partner in his mid teens at least and try to keep the ruins clear. The rogue shaman should spawn within half an hour of clearing there. The next piece is the mandible for the skull. It drops off another Rogue Shaman who spawns around the outside of Kurn's Tower in Field of Bone.  He is fairly rare, best bet is to keep all the random Iksar spawns around there clear.  The 3rd piece is arguable far too 
difficult to aquire at the mid-teens level. It's mendglow clay. I'd suggest buying this from a high level druid as it can only be foraged from the Burning Woods, a 45plus zone. To reach Burning Woods zone to the Frontier Mountains from The Lake of Ill Omen. Once in FM put levitate on and follow the zone high up to your left. This will take you across the southern edge of the zone till you eventually come to the entrance to Burning Woods which is a tunnel. Zone in and get yourself comfy because you could be there a while. I got mine within half an hour but if you're unlucky it could take much longer. Just keep hitting your forage button everytime it comes up. It's a good time to work on spell skills like Divination or Evocation that you don't raise as often as your others. There are no mobs at the zone so you are safe in the tunnel. Ask around the zone and someone else may have the mendglow clay you need also. Once you get it gate back to Cabilis and begin working on your pottery skill. This is an easy skill to raise and it goes up quickly and cheaply. I'd suggest you get your 
skill up to about 50 before attempting to make the 2nd skull.  Failing on your attempt will make your scales melt!  Combine the jawless skull, the mandible, and the mendglow clay (DO NOT ADD WATER) and hit combine on the pottery wheel. You will have a new item - Skull with an II. 
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now turn in your 2 skulls and your cudgel into Hierophant Oxyn and he will reward you with Iron Cudgel of the Seer.  This quest can be quite an adventure and takes you to many zones a young Iksar will be getting his first glimpse of. The weapon is fairly decent for it's level range too.<br><br>
