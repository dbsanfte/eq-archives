Who:	Xlixinar Arcut	<br><br>
Xlixinar Arcut sends you with a note to Prime Hierophant Vek. He will tell you of a Potion 
he needs you to make. <br><br>
The potion is Gray Ice and 2 pondfish spines. The Gray Ice is from the highest 
peak in Frontier Mnts by the Mountain Giant Fort. The Pondfish spines are from Pondfish.  They spawn 
in the small pond that feeds the Lake of Ill Omen coming from Firiona Vie. You combine the 2 pondfish 
spines along with the grey ice in an oven along 
with a pot.  I was able to do it no problem with my Baking skill at 25. 
<br><br>Then
you get some "Hopeless Willow Moss" which is a difficult forage in Swamp of No Hope. Combine it 
with a bottle, Flask of water, and the vial of poison in a 
brew barrel. This is also trivial around 20-25 in skill. You then get your potion, give it to a froglok slave (located 
somewhere in Cabilis normaly near the FoB entrance). 
The poison will kill the frog and you must bring back the remains with 2 Fire Emeralds. He will give you the proof you need. Take what he gives you and a Banded Mantle to the Skorpiki for the "Pauldrons" <br><br>
