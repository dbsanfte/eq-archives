<font size="+1" face="comic sans ms">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an excellent quest for a young Iksar to do. It will provide you with decent armour at your level and great exp. I'd start working on this one as soon as you begin your character.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go to the Haggle Baron in East Cabilis. He's a crafty old vendor. Downstairs he has a merchant named Klok Mugruk working for him. Hail him and he will give you an eight slot backpack. This backpack extremely useful to have starting out anyway so it's definitely the first thing that should be done.  He requests that you fill the bag with curscale skins. These are found on Scaled Wolf Pups and Cubs. Both are found in the Field of Bone close to the city. The pups are the lowest mobs in the game so you can start killing them immediately.  Once you have eight skins in your pack click combine and turn the new item in Klok Mugruk. He'll give you a random piece of curscale armour as well as exp and some coin. This is better armour than cloth but not quite as good as leather.  You can repeat this quest as many times as you like, completing your armour set or selling/trading the excess pieces.  The experience is particularily excellent at low levels with this one too.
