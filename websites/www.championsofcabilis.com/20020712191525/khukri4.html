<font size="+1" face="comic sans ms">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have arrived at this point then you are truly not a hatchling anymore.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  In the next test offered to you Speak with the Lord Qyzar.  In 
response to his question answer him the year of the birth is 371 ag  and the 
name of the father is Rile.  The Lord has dispatched a knight named Grizzle 
to seek the Kromdul fortress named Chalp.  Grizzle was supposed to map out 
Chalp.  To obtain the Zealots khukri you must obtain the Chalp diagram from 
Grizzle and return it and your knights khukri to the lord.  Grizzle may be 
found sitting near the guards in the Warsliks Woods.  His name shows as Iksar Knight. To obtain the Chalp 
diagram Grizzle requires you to retrieve 3 spells in the Woods.  2 of them 
are found in the giant fortress close by, I believe off of sapling giants.  
They are labeled a misscribed Gate and misscribed lifetap if I recall 
correctly.  The third is located at the lake in WW.  Follow the river to 
where it opens into a lake, swim out North and West and dive to locate the 
last spell.  If you must the location is: +4332/+4215.  Take the 3 spells 
and purchase a shovel in Cabilis, hand the 4 items to Grizzle who then 
rewards  you with the Chalp diagram.  Take the diagram and your knights 
khukri and hand them in to receive your Zealots khukri, a mighty blade 
indeed.
