<hr color="green">
<center><font size="2" face="comic sans ms">By Cradossk</font></center>
<font size="+1" face="comic sans ms">After you complete the last quest for you Cudgel of the Channeler (and many congrats by the way you are an elite Iksar Shaman by now) you speak to Hierophant Dexl, the other Hierophant. This is the conversation. <br><br>
You say, 'Hail Hierophant Dexl' 
<br><br>
Hierophant Dexl seems to be preocupied. He is examining an egg. 'What?!! Who has [sent] you to me? Bah!! Away with you.' He ignores you and continues chanting. 
<br><br>
You say, 'Di Nozok sent me' 
<br><br>
Hierophant Dexl drops the egg he was holding. Egg yolk splatters on your foot. His eyes roll back into his head. He speaks, but his voice is that of a female. 'I await you, Cradossk . My sisters and I yearn for the return of our skulls. We are the [Sisters of Scale]. Find us and bring to this hierophant our skulls and your iron cudgel of the Channeler. Go.' 
<br><br>
You say, 'Who are the Sisters of Scale' 
<br><br>
Hierophant Dexl wipes egg yolk from his clothing. 'My, what a mess!! Hmmph!! What did you say? Sisters of Scale? They were a legendary trio of mystics. We once had their skulls sealed within this temple, but now they are lost. I sent a channeler to retrieve them. His name was Vagnar. I am sure he shall find them.' 
<br><br>You say, 'who is vagnar' 
<br><br>Hierophant Dexl says 'He's a capable channeler, I trust he knows where to look and will prepare himself. Any competent servant of our Lord would prepare potions and supplies before going on such a quest. If he doesn't come back, it's no great loss, he wasn't Hierophant material anyway
<br><br>This is as far as Dexl goes.  The next set of clues was found on the Herb Vendor Island in West Cabilis. The dialogue goes like this.
<br><br>You say, 'Who what where is Vagnar' 
<br><br>
Jaxxtz says 'Vagnar? I don't recall.....Unless Vagnar was that shaman supposedly on some quest to save our entire race from total destruction..someone always on one of those. He bought some charms to ward of [Dragon kin]. He's most likely in the belly of some beast now. 
<br><br>
You say, 'What Dragon kin' 
<br><br>
Jaxxtz says 'Yes he said he needed to steal secrets from the hated Sarnaks to aid him in his true quest. He said the sarnak know ways to cleanse the mind from intrussion, he would say no more. 
<br><br>This is the end of dialogue that any has been able to get at this point. There are a number of theories around the Iksar Shaman community here are a few things we suspect.<br><br>
In the Temple of Droga there is a Jail which has Iksar Quest NPCs for the SK and Monk weapon quests, possibly for the Warrior weapon upgrades also. There is an NPC there who is an Iksar Slave who appears to be mad. He is unresponsive to hails and when killed gives negative faction to Scaled Mystics.  He also drops an Iksar Skull which when ID'd shows as Skull of Digalis.  This was handed in to Dexl though 
and he gave the old "An unwanted gift or a worthless bribe? Bah!! I shall destroy it regardless." I still believe it be connected perhaps he won't acknowledge it with out the other 3 skulls. Perhaps the right phrase is needed to get him to speak, even more likely it would be the right item to give to him.
<br><br>There is a coerced Iksar in Dalnir who spawns in the Imprecator Room.  He can be charmed but so far speaking to him has yielded nothing. He appears to be a shaman though so is a likely candidate.
<br><br>In the Burning Woods, high up in a tower only accessable through some very tricky work with spirit of the Cheeetah is a Sarnak NPC named Atheling Plaguebringer.  He has flagged as a candidate in the previous quest but responded to none of the hails thrown at him regarding that quest. So far no one has tried any dialogue with him regarding this quest.
<br><br>By far the most promising lead on this now has to do with a long forgotten potion recipe that drops off Sarnak Adherants in the Sarnak Fort in Ill Omen.  This ties directly into the text given by Jaxxtz the herb merchant.  The recipe is written in Lizardman and when read show's this<br><br>
Xinth<br>
From Opal Slush and Dristilate shall come Xinth. From Sarnak Nightdust, Gorge Moss, and Sponge Mushroom shall come Opal Slush. From Firiona Drixie Dust, Stoneleer Emerald plume, and Slate Chant Rock shall come Dristilate.<br><br>

<br><br>
The Dristilate has been confirmed created with those items and an alchemy bag, the Opal Slush is held up by the lack of Sponge Mushrooms. These were originally not in game but GM Aradiel has stated he'd put them in as of January. I'm still looking though so this may still be bugged. I will hassle him on this. 
<br><br>
Some theories are that Xinth when given to the Iksar Slave will lead to much more info and skulls. Possibly it might need to be given to a Sarnak in the Ill Omen Fort also who will then warp you to Atheling Plaguebringer who could give further info. At this point the quest is confirmed working so it's just a matter of time and hard work to get the next cudgel.
