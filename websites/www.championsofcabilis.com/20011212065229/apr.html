<font size="3" color="white" face="courier new" >  Monday, April 30th, 2001</b><br></font>
<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>Was a good weekend for the Champions. On Saturday we took a couple gropus into Droga for some good old fashioned Goblin killing. For many it was there first experience on a dangerous dungeon crawl. I think they learned a lot. There were a few casualties at the end sadly. Thanks to Zardossk and Bigole for sucking up their deaths without complaint.  Sunday saw myself, Bhayne and Xakanis joining a pickup raid on the Dragon Lady Vox. We joined about 30 other adventurers and stormed the beasts lair. Unfortunately her waves of AOE damage of 500HPs quickly reduced our forces and people began to flee. Bhayne and Xakanis boldly gave their lives. I ended up gating to avoid death. I was without ftp access to our site for a few weeks but am back taking care of things again. Cleaned up the members page a little today, added a few new members. If you aren't on the members list please let me know and I'll add you. Also I added Sasraaz' Quest writeup for Leech Life, the lvl 49 Shadow Knight Spell Quest. Good reading for all you SK's out there.<br></font>
<font size="3" color="white" face="courier new" >  Thursday, April 26th, 2001</b><br></font>
<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>Today marked the one year anniversary of Cradossk's creation. It is also the one year anniversary of Kunark. I'm sure many of our older members will be seeing the anniversaries of their characters in the next little while. Congrats to all Iksar on the first year of our existance in Everquest. We have come a long way!<br></font>

<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>The past few days were glorious for the Champions of Cabilis. Tuesday night saw a group of Champions 10 strong and made up of some of our mightiest members slaying Dragoons. That's right the hated soldiers from Overthere who had dispatched so many of us in their time would meet their makers on this night. Do to some excellent pulling by Kodmid and Chable we were able to get them in singles. With 10 Champions ranging from high 30's to low 50's we dispatched them with little casualties.  A great time was had by all! Welcome to new members Jawz and Msisy! I updated the 6th Cudgel Upgrade Quest with some new info today as well, this is still unsolved but I'm working hard on it.<br></font>
<font size="3" color="white" face="courier new" >  Tuesday, April 24th, 2001</b><br></font>
<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>My apologies for the lack of updates over the last few weeks. I'm back for good now and should have time to work on the site again.  Big Thanks to Scarlax for his Fishing/Gambling event on Saturday. Turnout was decent at about 20 Champions.  Congrats to Chabasrn for winning the fishing tourney. He caught 2 - 17lb fetid bass. YUM! YUM!  He was rewarded with a 10 shot sow potion for his efforts. Some great duels took place also. Hempire and myself squared off and I was able to prove the might of the Shaman. Thanks for taking it easy on me Hemp! I missed out on the gambling and still haven't heard who won that.<br></font>
<font size="3" color="white" face="courier new" >  Friday, April 13th, 2001</b><br></font>
<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>Happy Holidays to all. Things have been rolling along nicely in Norrath without Cradossk it seems. That's a testament to all the other Champions hard work. Hopefully I'll be able to log in sometime this weekend on my new system. Scarlax is working on his fishing event which I believe is next Thursday, will have to hear from him for confirmation. I return home in one week, will see all your scaley faces then!<br></font> 
<font size="3" color="white" face="courier new" >  Friday, April 6th, 2001</b><br></font>
<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>Greetingsss Champions. Today I am leaving my real life home for 2 weeks. During this time website updates may be sporadic and I may or may not be online to play Everquest at all. I hope this won't be the case but it may very well be.  During this time I would ask that you treat all officers as leaders on issues.  I would hope that you will be able to have some fun events in my time away. When I return I should have a new box with a 1.2 Ghz processor so my enemies will be in trouble. Keep up the good fight while I'm gone. <br></font>
<font size="3" color="white" face="courier new" >  Tuesday, April 3rd, 2001</b><br></font>
<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>Sasraaz has organized a raid for tonight. This is for lvl 40plus and is on the Sarnak Fort in Burning Woods. Think of it as the sequel to last weeks raid. This time the MOBs will be tougher, I scoped it out yesterday and all Sarnaks there are lvl 40plus. The time is kinda late on this one for some people. 9PM PST/12AM EST is the start time, meet up in Frontier Mountains at the Lake Zone. Hope to see you there!<br></font>
