Drixiv Arcut says 'Our hands are our most useful and deadly instruments, after our minds. When we use them other than in service of our lord and ancestors, our actions are false. Without knowing righteousness we can never be sure if our actions are in the name of fear. The Chosen, the Crusaders of Greenmist, know fear intimately. Their actions are never without the blessing of our lord. Take this note to the Archduke. He will recognize my writing and instruct you. <br><br>

Arch Duke Xog takes the note without even a glance in your direction and begins reading. After a long silence, he lets his arms drop to his sides and says quietly, 'We kill, Glaakt. That is our job, our duty in life. Our targets are chosen for us. We merely listen. Right now I am being told there is a traitor not far from here, near the ocean. Go to him and end his life. Bring me his head, and two star rubies. As you do this, try hard to listen to our Lord's instruction. If you hear even a whisper, you will know more righteousness than most of this city.'

Kerosh Blackhand is the rat bastard you have to kill. I promise to personally kill him over and over.... He's in the marauder cave. He may or may not have a placeholder.<br>
