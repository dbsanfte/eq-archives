<hr color="green">
<center><font size="2" face="comic sans ms">By Riksis Swifttail </font></center>
<font size="+1" face="comic sans ms">After finishing the shackle of bronze quest, ask Master Rinmark aasks 
you to help him rescue a student of his. When asked about the student, he 
hands you what appears to be the base of a key. 'This was delivered to my by 
a dying student. He collapsed jast after handing it to me. He was 
accompanying a student of mine named Veltar. They were questing for the 
legendary Whistling Fists. The key is made of metal I have never felt of 
heard of. Find him.' 
<p></p>
The key is a two slot container named "part of a large key". 
<p></p>
      Then you need to find Veltar. Veltar can be found in the jail in 
Droga. There are two doors between you and the main jail area. The keys for 
both of these doors are dropped by the goblin penmaster that spawns at the 
fire just across from the jail entrance. The key to the first (outer) door is 
"A Bone Necklace", the key to the second (inner) door is "A Bone Key". You 
will probably need to kill the penmaster a few times to get both keys. 
Alternately, you can A) Have someone pick the locks, or B) Drop into the 
inner jail area from the pit trap above. You will still need the keys if you 
plan to walk out. 
<p></p>
      Once into the inner jail area, there are four cells. In the cell 
directly across from the entrance spawns another goblin penmaster, who drops 
"A Bronze Key". This key opens the door of the cell just to the right of the 
entrance. In this cell spawns "an iksar slave" who looks like a monk. You can 
get the bronze key, have someone pick the lock to this cell, or just throw a 
shuriken at him and feign once he is outside the cell. 
<p></p>
You say, 'hail an iksar slave' 
<p></p>
      An iksar slave seems to have lost all hope. He sadly looks to the 
ground. His shackles are different than the others you see in this cell. One 
is definitely steel and not of goblin design. The other is made of an 
unfamiliar metal. 
<p></p>
You say, 'Are you Veltar?' 
<p></p>
An iksar slave's soiled face shines with a glint of hope. 'You know my name? 
Who has [sent] you to find me?' 
<p></p>
You say, 'Master Rinmark sent me' 
<p></p>
      An iksar slave says 'Then word has gotten to him!! If you be a monk of 
the third rung I will accept your aid. You must find the [coppernickel key]. 
It is required to release me from this goblin shackle. I have no reward to 
offer other than the shackle of steel. Give me both your shackles of the 
third rung along with the key and I shall reward you the first shackle of the 
fourth rung. 
<p></p>
You say, 'Where is the coppernickel key?' 
<p></p>
      An iksar slave says 'The key is split into three parts. Part one is 
the base and must be combined with the two remainder pieces. One piece is in 
here and the other was lost. I overheard the goblins chattering and 
recognized the goblin phrase, 'lair of flying mouths'!! As for the base, I do 
not know. 
<p></p>
You now need to collect and combine the three pieces of the coppernickel key. 
<p></p>
1. You already have the base, which you recieved from Master Rinmark. 
<p></p>
2. The second piece is "A Copper Key", dropped by the goblin interrogator in 
cell across and to the left of the jail entrance. It identifies as "A 
CopperNickel Key |..". 
<p></p>
3. The "lair of flying mouths" is a reference to Dalnir. "A Nickel Key" is 
dropped there by a goblin penkeeper on the third level. It identifies as "A 
CopperNickel Key ..|". 
<p></p>
Combine the nickel and copper keys inside the base. This results in "A 
Coppernickel Key". Give Veltar the coppernickel key, and your bronze and 
copper shackles. 
<p></p>
An iksar slave hands you a shackle and removes the coppernickel shackle so he 
may flee. He places your shackles on his wrists and darts into the darkness. 
<p></p>
You now have the Shackle of Steel.
