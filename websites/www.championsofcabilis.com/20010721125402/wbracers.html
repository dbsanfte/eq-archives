<font size="+1" face="comic sans ms">Starts in:	The Overthere	<br>
Who:	Drixiv Arcut	<br>	
Additional Zones: Cabilis East <br>		
Related Creatures: Arch Duke Xog 	<br>	
Drixiv Arcut says 'The bracers of our ancestors embody righteousness. When we strike, and our forearms are soaked in the blood of our enemies, our purpose must be pure. Else that blood will burn our souls and anger that which we live for. Go and find the Archduke in Cabilis and give him my note. He will teach you of righteousness. For if our chosen did not know righteousness, our people would not be. Go! <br><br>

Arch Duke Xog takes the note and glances at it briefly then lets out a heavy sigh and stares out over the city for several minutes. Finally he says quietly, 'Several months ago we lost contact with one of our crusaders. His name is, or was, Geanik. The last we heard from him he was furthering our cause against the loathsome Goblins that reside in Warsliks Wood. Just recently we were visited by a [strange Iksar]. <br><br>

You say, 'what strange iksar' <br><br>

Arch Duke Xog says 'Yes, he was dressed in rags and hadn't eaten in days. He rambled on about seemingly nothing, obviously he had lost his mind at some point. The guards brought him in because he told them he had valuable information concerning a captured Crusader. According to the mad man, our missing knight was captured by a group of cultists that follow a false god. The cultists intend on converting him apparently. Your [test] will concern Geanik. <br><br>

You say, 'what test' <br><br>

Arch Duke Xog says 'Learning Righteousness is learning to listen to one's own heart. At all times our Lord of Fear speaks to us. Our heart is through which he speaks. If we are pure in action and undistracted in mind we can hear the very words of our Father. Your test will be to find our lost Crusader. When you find him you must listen, and act based on what you hear. If your actions are Righteous, I will give you my reference. Bring me proof of your action and two sapphires. <br><br>
Reward(s): Trooper Scale Bracers<br><br>
Geanik is an iksar prisoner on the second floor of dalnir close to the exit zone. kill him and get his heart. when taking the note to the brothers in ot make sure to take 2 banded bracers to hand in and you get 2 trooper sacel bracers.
