<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>Today marks the one year anniversary of the Champions of Cabilis. It was one year ago today that I received the acceptance email from Verant for our guild. Later that night I petitioned and was met by GM Valdemar outside the bank in Cabilis. On that day we were born. Hundreds have worn our guild tag over the past year. I salute all of you, past and present, for you have truly made me proud and our guild the envy of many others. Lets keep up the good work and see if we can still be here in another year.  In sadder news Abola has quit Everquest. Sorry to see a Champion go but we can't all play forever.<br></font>

<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>Many happenings for the Champions over the past few days. Some Champions spent some time in The Plane of Fear with our allies Brother of Darkness. Many good drops for the Champions. I know Chable got Shiverback armour, Bhayne some boots, and Ishy a belt and epic quest item. Congrats to them. In sadder news Tipsy Bartender has left our guild for the Crimson Tempest. His farewell post is in the private section. Sad news but he assures me he is with us in spirit still and will be there should we call upon him. He as one of the original Champions and will be remember fondly. Best of Luck to him. This weekend Bhayne orchestrated a few raids on the Tower of Frozen Shadow. Quite a lot of fun in there. I can see many more raids there as it appeals to a wide level range and has some nice drops. I'll put some pics of it up in the pics section. Tonight we go into The Plane of Hate again with BoD, good luck to those who are coming<br></font>

<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>Sorry about the lack of updates but hey what can I say? It was a long weekend in Canada :) The past weekend was a fun event for Chabasrn. We took him to Firiona Vie along with a small group and went to help him with his Crusader's Khukri. Our first forray proved fatal for a few of the younger members but after regrouping it went off without a hitch, congrats to Chabasrn. Congrats also to Tipsy who Dinged 55 last night making him the undisputed Iksar Warrior Champion of the server (Kabakaba has retired) Way to go Tipsy Bartender! Some Champions will be in the Plane of Fear tonight with our allies BoD, wish them luck.<br></font>

<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>It was an "Epic" Weekend for the Champions.  Friday night saw Sasraaz embarking on his Shadow Knight Epic Weapon quest. This was initiated by killing Kirron Ni at the Outpost in Overthere. A strong group of Champions and friends won handily. On Saturday it was Ishy's turn to further his Shaman epic. After missing out on killing Black Dire a couple months ago Ishy was determined. With a small but mighty group he was able to dispach the great wolf. Ishy was then able to get his Black Fur boots. Awesome Shaman booties that have an insta-cast of SoW.  Ask Ishy and he'll give you a running show.  Your humble leader is greatly jealous of these and will be planning a similar raid very soon.  The week is wide open for events now. Hit the forums and lets decide on an event for this weekend.<br></font>

<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>Last night marked the end of an excellent two day raid on the Plane of Hate organized by our allies The Brothers of Darkness.  This was the most widely attended Planes Raid the Champions have been on - A Testament to our Growing Power.  In attendance were Chable, Tipsy, Bhayne, Rukiss, and myself (Cradossk).  We had great success there and were only wiped out twice heh heh.  Rukiss was awarded the Scaled Hierophant helm, one of the nicest Shaman helms in the game. Tipsy recieved the Legionnaire Scale Pauldrons and Legs also top items. Congrats to both of them.  There are pictures up of the event on the pics link to the left.  We hope to go on more raids like this in the future.  Our next event will be this weekend, a raid on Castle Mistmoore to gather quest items for our Shaman's and Shadow Knights, more info on our events forum.<br></font>

<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>The Champions raided the City of Mist last night and it was one of our best events to date. We had a solid turnout of powerful members. We ended up with 4 groups ranging from at low of 31 to a high of 52. We didn't go incredibly deep but I think it was an educational trip for all.  A few Wraith Bone Hammers dropped and Chable was our only casualty.  Should have some pics of it up in the pics section today. Added a few more members profiles today, Meble, Dracyal, and Rolymm. Send yours in today!<br></font>

<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>After some discussion with my fellow Champions I have decided to add a 'guides' section to our website. It's under construction right now but you can see the button for it on this page.  I will have to add that button to each page as this website wasn't built with a style sheet. Regretting that now. Anyway regardless I think it will be an excellent addition to our site and will spice it up with some new content.  I call upon my fellow Champions to write some guides, especially the veteran EQ players who can teach the newer ones a few tricks. I leave it to you my brothers.<br></font>
