        <li><font size="3" face="comic sans ms">Sasraaz is now one step from completing 
          his Epic! After a good turn of fortune and the guidance of Cazic I'm 
          sure, he ended up only needing to kill the final nasty mob. We have 
          a tentative date of Sunday Feb 3rd at this point as the day that BoD 
          will be available to assist. There are no Iksar Shadowknights on the 
          server with their Epics and Sasraaz shall have his! We are all super 
          proud of the guy, WTG Sasraaz! Krikk from I'm not sure which server 
          has done an excellent Greemist walkthrough so I added that to the quests 
          section. Updated the Pic of the Week and the members list a bit too.<br>

        <li><font size="3" face="comic sans ms">Had quite a successful raid on 
          the Hole last night. I good turnout by the Champions as well as a good 
          turnout by Ssizzel's guild Controlled Chaos and we had ourselves a raid. 
          Sasraaz got one of his epic parts and the raid hit a stall not long 
          after when many softskins ran in fear of the single cleric that was 
          staying. Well in true Iksar spirit we pushed on to High Scale Kirn and 
          I was able to loot the ring and move on to within 2 steps of my epic. 
          Thanks so much guys!<br>

        <li><font size="3" face="comic sans ms">The Kaesora raid was quite a success 
          from all accounts. 3 groups went down and laid waste to the place. Congrats 
          to all who came out. Our recruiting drive has really paid off as of 
          late. Some great new members have joined the ranks of the Champions, 
          welcome new Iksar. This week's pic of the week is courtesy of one of 
          those people, Vasudan Broussard. I got a good laugh out of it, enjoy.<br>

        <li><font size="3" face="comic sans ms">Was a quiet Kael raid last night 
          though there were a couple drops including Silk Legs. A small but powerful 
          group of Champions and Allies did the bank area and the chanter house. 
          Perhaps doing Kael every week burned people out a little bit, not sure. 
          We have a Kaesora raid on Saturday at 3PM PST/6PM EST for mid levels. 
          The mid levels have been crying out for a raid for some time now so 
          Ishy has put a good one together. Try to come out regardless of your 
          level as this will be a fun event. Kaesora is a great dungeon.<br>

        <li><font size="3" face="comic sans ms">I hope everyone had a great New 
          Year's. Mine was great, I partied my ass off and as a result the page 
          didn't get updated this week. Bad Crad! Was a good week for CoC. Sasraaz 
          put together an amazing Raid on Kael. More than 40 people turned out 
          to beat up Giants in the Arena. Sasraaz and I are planning a raid on 
          the Hole on January 16th at 5PM PST/8 PM EST to get farther on our Epics. 
          Please come out and help the brethren. We have had a lot of new faces 
          join over the past couple weeks. I won't try to name them all but looks 
          to be a good crop of recruits. Veinos, the funniest Iksar alive, sent 
          me the pic of the week. It's the Osama Bin Laden MoB, lookout!</font>
