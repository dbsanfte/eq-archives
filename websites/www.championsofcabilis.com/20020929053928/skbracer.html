<font size="+1" face="comic sans ms">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sarth Scarscale says 'Have you ever seen Bloodgills? I hear they will devour a broodling in seconds and that their scales are tough as iron. Bring me some of these scales, a banded bracer, and a sapphire as blue as the sky. Only then will I give the bracer to you, broodling. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bloodgill Goblins inhabit the Lake in the Lake of Ill Omen.  You can pull them from the lake onto the shore and you should be able to take them in your 30's I believe.  The scales drop off them about 1 in 6.
