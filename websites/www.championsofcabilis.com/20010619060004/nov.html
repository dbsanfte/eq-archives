<font size="3" color="white" face="courier new" >  Thursday November 30th, 2000</b><br></font>
<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>Big Lizard Roar for Scarlax. He sent me in all the Warrior Trooper Scale Armour quest info which has now been posted.  Great job Scarlax. We now have the best resource for Iksar quests on the net. If anyone knows of any other quests we don't have info posted on by all means send it in. I think the next phase we'll work on is putting up guides for each of the classes.  Our glorious day of battle is only 3 days away now, train hard Champions!<br></font>
<font size="3" color="white" face="courier new" >  Wednesday November 29th, 2000</b><br></font>
<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>Finished Shaozin's quest writeups today. The Necro ones are up and as well I got graphics for both the Monk and Necro ones. We now have the greatest Iksar resource on the net that I know of. Congratulations all !  Also we've moved past 4000 hits, another accomplishment.  There is an important post by Shaozin regarding items given to you by fellow guild members. Please take a read, it's on the general section of the forum.  Basically any item given to by a higher level for free is to be in turn passed on for free to another needy Iksar, not sold for profit.  Think of it as selling your XMAS presents, that doesn't go over well.  4 Days till the Battle stay ready brothers.<br></font>

<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>Shaozin got me the write-ups for the Monk and Necro quests today. I have put up the Monk ones, hope to get the Necro ones up tomorrow. You can view them on the quests link.  I added a new section on the forum called News. Feel free to tell of your adventures in Norrath for the day in here. Should be fun, thanks to Belfior for the idea.  I've been really busy at work this week so apologize for the slow updates.  If you've sent something into me it should be up now. There are a few new pics up on the pics link. A very cool one of Belfior especially.  Hopefully I'll be cleaning up the members list a lot this week, clearing out old members, etc as well.  Be strong Champions, our battle with the Barbarians approaches. Don't forget this Sunday at 3PM PST/6PM EST in the Lake of Ill Omen we do battle with The 7th Legion. <br></font>

<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>Scarlax sent me writeups for the Warrior weapon upgrade quests so I've posted those on the quests link, thanks Scarlax.  Have a good weekend all and I'll see you in Norrath tomorrow morning :)<br></font>
<font size="3" color="white" face="courier new" >  Thursday November 23rd, 2000</b><br></font>
<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>My apologies for the site being down again today, hopefully it should be stable now.  I added a few new members to the members list today. Welcome Miracht, Siths, Saskak, Daeryn, and Jebrn to the Champions.  That brings our numbers up to 92 now, though I'm thinking of doing a roster trim since some of you I never see online these days. If you want to be a Champion I encourage you to post on the message board to show that you are reading it and that you have something to contribute.  Important news on the Guild War in the Private Forum over the past couple days.  Shaozin in particular had a great idea.  If you need the password to the forum ask in Guild Chat or send me an e-mail.  Sasraaz has graciously done the Shadow Knight Quest Armour writeups which I have now edited and posted, follow the quest link for that, thanks Sas!<br>

<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>Sorry that the site was down all day yesterday, should be back up fine for all now.  Patch again for 11 hours starting at 3AM PST, hopefully this will be the last one for a while and clear up any sound and video problems people may be experiencing.  All the Shaman Armour quests are done and posted now, hopefully I'll get some more spoilers to post on the quest links for the other classes *HINT HINT*.  I'm back in Kunark now so I'm here to help my brethren, after I get my lvl 36 back heh heh, Antonica was very cruel to me.<br></font>
<font size="3" color="white" face="courier new" >  Friday November 17th, 2000</b><br></font>
<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>Added the new Mystic Scale Armour info under the Quests link today. Hopefully we'll get the other classes info up soon.  There is a new link on the forums called private. To get the password ask one of us in guild chat or e-mail me via the contact link.  This is where we will be discussing tactics for the upcoming guild war with 7th Legion.  Have a good weekend all.<br></font>
<font size="3" color="white" face="courier new" >  Wednesday November 15th, 2000</b><br></font>
<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>IT'S ON! The 7th Legion have raised their shameful flesh covered heads and agreed to battle for the pride of Kunark.  They shall meet us outside the gates of Cabilis in the Lake of Ill Omen at 6PM EST/ 3PM PST on Sunday December 3rd, 2000.  Please make every effort possible to be there that afternoon. This is for the honour of our guild and should be an excellent event if we get the right turnout. It will be a last guild standing type event so we really need the bodies out.  Cazic has summoned you, be there!<br></font>

<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>Flash version of the site is live now. Had to work some bugs out of it, I think it looks fairly cool.  Got some correspondence from the hated 7th Legion today. The time that could work out is last Sunday of the month at 9PM EST/6PM PST. How does that sound? Their leader works all day Sunday so that's the best time on a Sunday. Please let me know if that'll work. Special Thanks to Reptilo and Samc for saving your great leader's ass this weekend in Solusk's Eye. Big Lizard Shout out to them :)<br></font>

<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>Added a new server status updater which you see now to your right.  Thanks to Boiscan and Innoruk.com for that one, kind of nifty I think.  Haven't recieved a lot of response on the next guild event idea. Please add your thoughts on the Forum under Events.  Our Server, The Nameless was down today, but happily it's back up, wonder if they did anything noticable..... Anyway still working on the Flash intro to our site, it's going to be pretty sweet when it's finished, I'll keep you posted.<br></font>
<font size="3" color="white" face="courier new" ><b>  Tuesday November 7th, 2000</b><br></font>
<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI>Had our 3000th hit today, so congrats all around to those who've visited. Also took the bold off this headline text, which do you prefer? Reptilo has finished a write-up for all the Shadow Knight quests. Check it out on the quest link to the side if you are a SK. Thanks Rep!  I've received word from that despicable barbarian Fortenbras. They still mean to fight us but the date is as of yet undecided. In the meantime I think we should have a guild event soon. I'm thinking Sunday November 19th would be a good time.  I'll put up a vote on the forum page. The choices are either The Mines of Nurga or the zone area of Trakanon's. Personally I'd like to do Trakanon's as it's close to Cabilis and do-able even if we don't get a huge turnout.<br></font>
<font size="3" color="white" face="courier new" ><b>  Friday November 3rd, 2000</b><br></font>
<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI> <b> Had some server troubles this morning but they are fixed now as you can see by reading this. Did up a few more quests, take a look at the Quests link now. Kwanzei has offered to write some Monk ones but I'd love if some Champions pitched in to write some more.  I'm still in negotiations with 7th Legion about our guild war, they seem to be backing off a bit (I think we scared em with our enthusiasm!).  Have a good weekend all, May Cazic Be Your Guide!</b><br></font>
<font size="3" color="white" face="courier new" ><b>  Wednesday November 1st, 2000</b><br></font>
<font size="3" face="comic sans ms"><LI> <b>Added a new link today. There is now a Quests link on the navigation bar to your left. It's pretty empty right now but I will be adding a few quests to it every day. I've never done any of the other classes quests so if anyone is interested in doing some writeups by all means send them in to me.  Added Raziear, Rassan, and Hydd to the members list today also.</b><br></font>
