Houses and offices.</span><hr size=1> There are four houses that make up the Bringers of Retribution, each with 5 ranks in it (listed in order of lowest to highest):<br>
<br>
<u>The house of Knights (Paladins, Warriors, Monks, Beastlords):</u><br>
This house is the fighting arm of the guild.<br>
<br>
<b>House ranks:</b><br>
1. Page<br>
2. Squire<br>
3. Knight<br>
4. Captain<br>
5. Crusader<br>
<br>
<u>The house of Arcanists (Enchanters, Wizard, Magicians):</u><br>
<i>Before the Godswar there was no house of Arcanists, nor any organisation like it amongst the good gods. Though many wielders of the arcane magics worshipped the gods of good, they had not really joined together for any purpose - each of them did their own research and only rarely did they come together for the conclaves of their guilds.<br>
<br>
The Godswar changed all that . Where before, the arcanists had not really had any reason for dealing with the gods so closely, they now had no choice.<br>
<br>
Many problems surfaced for the wielders of magic in the beginning of the Godswar, not the least of which was the onslaught by the undead hordes lead by necromancers. Prior to the war, although believing in seperate gods, a magician of Tunare and a necromancer of Innoruuk could respect each other as wielders of magic, and pass each other by, now only hatred exists.<br>
<br>
Today the house of Arcanists welcome all wielders of arcane magic, who worship the good gods, protecting its members and aiding in their training if possible, so that they can fill their place in the Godswar, fighting for Retribution !</i><br>
<br>
<b>House ranks:</b><br>
1. Apprentice<br>
2. Scribe<br>
3. Arcanist<br>
4. Archarcanist<br>
5. Magister<br>
<br>
<u>The house of Priests (Clerics, Shamans, Druids):</u><br>
<i>Originally this house existed in the realm of Tunare, the plane of growth. It was a gathering point of those priests of Tunare who undertook the pilgrimage of visiting the plane of growth. Initially most of these returned to Norrath to serve its people, and spread the belief of Tunare, but some remained in Tunare's realm, and so the house became a permanent focal point for those who now visit the plane of growth.<br>
<br>
When the godswar came to Norrath, the five gods of good came together and each of them agreed to send some of their most loyal servants, from their planes, back to Norrath, there to serve in the godswar. Tunare sent the house of Priests.<br>
<br>
Though it was a house of Tunare worshippers, the godswar has meant that the Norrathian house welcomes worshippers of all the gods of good. The house of Priests do not at this time own a temple, but are instead welcomes in all the regular temples of the five gods of good, where they seek to spread belief in the raging war, that good shall triumph !</i><br>
<br>
<b>House ranks:</b><br>
1. Novice<br>
2. Acolyte<br>
3. Priest<br>
4. Highpriest<br>
5. Templar<br>
<br>
<u>The house of Shadows (Rangers, Bards, Rogues):</u><br>
This house gathers information for the guild and are generally believed to be the eyes and ears of the Bringers of Retribution.<br>
<br>
<b>House ranks:</b><br>
1. Ward<br>
2. Explorer<br>
3. Scout<br>
4. Shadow master<br>
5. Shadow lord<br>
<br>
(Look to seperate section of this book for information on how to achieve these ranks).<br>
<br>
Apart from the houses, the guild also holds what we call offices. Offices are seats of power within the Bringers of Retribution, often across houses. The exact amount of offices is not set firm, but they all have one thing in common: they represent a point of contact and management. Each office usually have a title associated with it, often Lord or Lady or some such.<br>
<br>
One office deserves special mentioning: the Council of Retribution - there are not a set number of seats to this council, but all of them are titled Lord or Lady of Retribution. These represent the highest authority within the guild, above all houses. They rule the guild, and whenever their ruling is called for it is final !<br>
<br>
Not all offices may at all times be filled. If an office is vacant and a member has a desire to hold it, then he or she should contact the the appropriate leader, after fullfilling the requirements for the office, both of which are listed in the office description below.<br>
<br>
<u><b>Offices:</u></b><br>
<i>Lord / Lady of Retribution</i> - The Council of Retribution, where these people sit, is the supreme leading organ in the guild. This office can not be applied for : it is a position offered by the existing council. There are no limit to the amount of people on the council. The requirements are at least rank 5 in any house. Upon assuming this office the member leaves his or her house to join the Council of Retribution. New positions offered must be approved by all existing holders of this office. Should a person be deemed unworthy to continue holding this office he or she can be removed if all other members of it accepts such. The removal requires at least 2 people to accept it, thereby meaning this council will never have below 3 members by use of expelling.<br>
<br>
<i>Lord / Lady of Treasury</i> - This person has moderator rights to the treasury forum. Due to the rules of the world of Sullon Zek, this person is not responsible for holding guild items (as you cannot make holder characters), but instead holds and reports on the coffers of the guild, as well as gems used by the guild for plane raid purposes and cleric spells and so forth. This person also manages and spends the cash used on training guild craftsmen etc.<br>
Apply to the Council of Retribution for taking up this position. You must be a regular web board visitor, as well as a member of at least rank 4 of any house. This Lord / Lady has the rights to appoint/accept Barons / Baronesses as needed, and as members show themselves willing to.<br>
<br>
<i>Lord / Lady of Recruiting</i> - This person has moderator rights to the Members Count forum. This person is responsible for active recruiting of new members (as opposed to friends of new people asking for an invite opportunity), as well as for editing the Members Count profiles and list with info presented by the members. This person is also responsible for finding new members a sponsor, who will agree to sponsor them. Lastly this person is responsible for the quest/training approval until the member reach rank 3. This person can assign Barons / Baronesses as needed and as members are willing to.<br>
<br>
<i>Lord / Lady of Craftsmen</i> - This person has moderator rights to the Craftsmen forum. He/She is responsible for getting some craftsmen trained for the guild, and for researching new recipes and other information that is discovered in game or on websites, that can aid our work. This person, naturally, do not have to supply the funds for the training of the craftsmen, which should, hopefully, be able to be at least partly funded by the treasury. Keeping good stock of the Craftsmen forum, with item lists, tabs on who can make what, and what it takes, and such is the primary tasks of this person.<br>
<br>
<i>Lord / Lady of the Board</i> - This person is largely responsible for keeping the message board on track, updating where needed, changing sections, adding and removing forums, and other website based work. Barons and Baronesses can be appointed to help as needed. Where other positions give moderator access to individual forums, these people manage the board in general. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub86.ezboard.com/ueltharinstarsoul.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Eltharin Starsoul</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_star.gif" BORDER=0> at: 2/15/02 1:20:29 pm<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub86.ezboard.com/fbringersofretributionfrm16.showPrevMessage?topicID=4.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub86.ezboard.com/fbringersofretributionfrm16.showNextMessage?topicID=4.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub86.ezboard.com/fbringersofretributionfrm16.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/slate/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub86.ezboard.com/fbringersofretributionfrm16.threadControl?topicID=4.topic><img src=http://www.tsa.nu/images/pix.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub86.ezboard.com/fbringersofretributionfrm16.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=4.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub86.ezboard.com/fbringersofretributionfrm16.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=4.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub86.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="bringersofretributionfrm1">Introduction<option value="bringersofretributionfrm2">Gossip and Rumors<option value="bringersofretributionfrm3">The Trading Store<option value="bringersofretributionfrm35">Member Applications<option value="bringersofretributionfrm56">WoR Reunion<option value="bringersofretributionfrm16">The Book of Retribution<option value="bringersofretributionfrm59">Friends and Allies<option value="bringersofretributionfrm10">The Den<option value="bringersofretributionfrm12">Official Raids<option value="bringersofretributionfrm58">The Hunt<option value="bringersofretributionfrm18">Epics and Quests<option value="bringersofretributionfrm34">Guides<option value="bringersofretributionfrm8">Tradeskill Masters<option value="bringersofretributionfrm11">The Pack<option value="bringersofretributionfrm47">The Theatre<option value="bringersofretributionfrm55">Guild Suggestions<option value="bringersofretributionfrm64">Cash<option value="bringersofretributionfrm65">Equipment<option value="bringersofretributionfrm66">Spells<option value="bringersofretributionfrm63">Hall of Elders<option value="bringersofretributionfrm62">Testing of Elders<option value="bringersofretributionfrm61">Council of Elders Discussion Area</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#fff09d>- </font><a href=http://pub86.ezboard.com/bbringersofretribution>Wolves of Retribution</a><font color=#fff09d> - </font><a href=http://pub86.ezboard.com/fbringersofretributionfrm16>The Book of Retribution</a> <font color=#fff09d> - </font><a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/stats/sz_summary.jsp">Official Sullon Zek PvP Points Page</a><font color=#fff09d> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.3<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
