Perhaps one of the most difficult environments to &quot;live&quot; in, Sullon Zek (SZ) is a Player vs. Player (PvP) server like no other. A deity based alliance broken down into three teams (goods, evils, neutrals) constantly at war with each other, your character is fair game for being PvP'd as soon as level 6 is reached. You can even be PvP'd under level 6 if you are not within the confines of a safe or newbie zone. Sullon Zek is not considered a Roleplay (RP) server, but if you think about it, SZ is probably closer to RP than any other server because you can go out and fight for your beliefs. If you are able to come to and survive on SZ then you know you got skills. <br>
<br>
Wolves of Retribution<br>
WoR is once again, slowly expanding and growing and we are &quot;Ohana.&quot; Basically, that boils down to the Wolves of Retribution being a &quot;Family&quot; or Social type guild as opposed to a Raid, PK (Player Killer) or LDON guild. We encourage community and comraderie among our members and our goal is to provide an environment where people from all over and in all time zones, can come together to develop their characters and experience the game in a positive way, in this the most difficult of all EQ environments. Keep in mind that we do have members that go out and Raid, PK, or do LDON, but there is no mandatory requirement to do so. We even have members who are in total RP mode, but again there is no requirement for it.<br>
<br>
Membership Requirements<br>
As soon as a player hits level 15, they become a potential candidate for inclusion into the Wolfpack. Our membership includes all classes, many levels and we seek to be more inclusive than exclusive. Although we play hard to achieve our goals, we try to balance with a more Casual and friendly atmosphere. Post an application for membership on our public board if you feel this more laid-back style of play is for you...<br>
<br>
Code of Conduct<br>
Members will treat one another with respect. The indignities inflicted upon us by the opposing teams does not need to continue among our own members. Any grievances should be brought before an officer if you can't come to an agreement among yourselves. Please remember that we like guildchat to be positive and fun and though serious topics are permitted, we do not tolerate obscene or abusive guildchat. Any racist, sexist, or other derogatory remarks are not tolerated in guildchat, on our public channels, on our raids, or in groups.<br>
<br>
Raid and Epic Policy<br>
The Raid/Epic coordinator has the right to determine priority of epic battles and raids. If a member wishes to do a specific raid, then please post in the proper section and/or contact the Raid/Epic coordinator. Epic priority takes into account the level and class of the character, participation in guild events, the difficulty of encounters, and where the person is in regards to completing the epic quest. In addition, epics that benefit the guild as a whole may have higher priority than those epics that mostly benefit the individual.<br>
<br>
Loot Policy <br>
&quot;Need before greed&quot; should be our motto in groups and raids, but also remember that our casters use up components to buff us and that should be repaid first.<br>
Group Loot - There are several ways to award group loot, but I recommend that a Master Looter (ML) be appointed who will loot all items from group kills. If there is an item that is &quot;needed&quot; by one member, but not others, then it is okay to award that item to them with a full group consensus. If more than one member needs an item, the ML should either award the item based on the greater need, or you can let them roll on the item. All other loot should be sold at the end of the group and then split evenly. Again this is a recommendation. <br>
Raid Loot - We do not use DKP or any other point system. The raid leader may award loot based on need or deed. Any other item can be rolled on and once you have earned or been awarded an item, you should do the honorable thing and allow others to also win items, before you try to get something else. The only exception to this would be on items that only you can use.<br>
<br>
PK policy <br>
WoR may have a PK arm of the guild, but we are not a traditional PK guild and there is no requirement for you to engage the enemy just because you see them in zone. I encourage you to defend yourselves and others when necessary. And, by all means if you wish to engage or hunt, please feel free to coordinate with our PK officer, or do so as you see fit. Help guildies and other goods when able, but I do not expect you to die against impossible odds. WoR does not condone griefing or CC'ing, but I do recognize that there may be certain times where it is unavoidable. If you offer LnS (Loot and Scoot) and it is refused, then it is your decision on how you want to handle it.<br>
<br>
Roleplaying Policy <br>
Sullon Zek is a Deity Allignment PK server, but it just may be the truest form of Roleplaying we can come across. If you wish to roleplay your character, I'm sure that some will play along, but there is no requirement to do so.<br>
<br>
This is who we are, if you are interested or want more information feel free to contact us in-game or through posting. <br>
