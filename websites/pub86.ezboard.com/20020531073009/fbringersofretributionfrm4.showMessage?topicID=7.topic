<br>
Daylight breaks and mammoths roam, their tusks valuable and thier hides as armor. My group of men were chosen to kill today so the women could make some new cloaks and leggings. We unsheathe our swords and charge at a small male, we slash him to the bone and cut his tusks off and skin him. We stop when we hear the sound of a mad mammoth charging. We turn to look but are too late, He swings his mighty tusks to the side and knock half of us down. I stand next to a man and try to push him away but are to late he is impaled and im thrown into a icy hill. I look up to see injured men running back to our village and a man fall down, I look away as the mammoth rears up and a loud crunch and a dead shriek rings out. I limp to my village to see our children trampled and houses crumpled. Our finest warriors tried to slay the beast but are unsuccessful, it kills all of them and leaves few alive enough to breath. Some men are left hanging from roofs and others crushed. The elder of the village screamed one word that i could understand, &quot;Shadowhide&quot;. The legendary mammoth that could not be killed by any weapon but one forged in the fires of Velious, Made with Blackened alloy and velium melted together and shaped into the head of a spear. The shaft made of black iron and cooled with the blood of a virgin elf. The weapon i must avenge my brothers with seemed so far and as i look upon the beast the more i am angered into killing it. I grab what remained of my blackened alloy armor and walk out upon the ice of Everfrost to reach the Dwarfs in kaladim.<br>
<br>
I walked to a small caves that stunk of gnolls, it could only be the way to Black Burrow. Home of the gnolls and thier canine ways, i walk near the entrance and hail the nearest gnoll. It turns and howls to warn the others. I swing my sword and do not wish to kill it because my father said never kill anythign that you dont want to eat.....I wish the mammoth had known this. I slice thier legs to make them unable to follow and rush through Black burrow to Qeynos hills and run faster as i had half the whole area of Black burrow following me. I see a guard and wish him well as i rush by and hear a lound shout and a dogs screech. I find my way to the karanas to only see what many had told tails about from my homelands, a vast streach of grass and and dirt. I walk for hours on end to reach the other side, lions and griffons attack and beetles eating the remains of other dead beings. I finally come across a large group of spires and a woman inside of it. She was chanting a strange song. I walk up to her and hail her, she turns and stares at me for a second then looks away. She continued her chanting, I asked her if she was a wizard who could take me to Kaladim and the dwarfs. She stoped her chanting and shouted that she was busy and if i disturbed her again she would send me to my eternal grave in hell. Since i was never good at dieing i pulled out my sword and slashed at her for her threat. She blocked my blow with magic and stunned me, then she walked around me saying things in a unknown tongue. I assumed from what i had learned that she was a dark elf, and that she was thinking of a way to rob me and cast me into a different world. I felt like this was the end and i would never be able to avenge me village and kill &quot;Shadowhide&quot;. Then with some strange inner strength i felt the binding come loose and swong with all my might at the dark elf. I sliced the pendant around her neck and was thrown backwards into the grasslands, that was a mistake i guess. I was knocked out and awoke to a darkness, i rolled over and saw a gypsie camp and thier fire breaking the darkness.<br>
I walked near and hailed their leader.<br>
<br>
They sat me down and asked why i was out here in the middle of nowhere. I told them my tale and they all fell silent, then one said she might be able to help me shorten my journey. She pulled out some blackened alloy and iron. she placed them in a bag and handed in to me, I thought it would be as heavy as a mammoth tusk but was light as a gnoll paw. I thanked her and asked if this was all till i saw what she pulled out next. She pulled out a flask of glowing liquid, crimson in color and bright as a willowisp. She told me it was the blood of the Virgin Elf Gypsie Princess, Elftear. I felt guilty about taking it but thanked her. They then said some magical words and i felt as if i was thrown into a black pit. I fell for what seemed like minutes and landed in a mountain range that i could only assume was Butcher Block. I stood up and saw a goblin holding the Princess's blood. I yelled at him to give it back but he ran off into a mountain. I followed him in and finally caught up with him, I slashed at him and connected with his wrist. He shrieked and threw the flask into the air, I dove to catch it adn slid deeper into the cave. I finally stopped and held up the flask triumphant. I turned around and was near the exit when a bandit shoved a dagger into my back. I felt a sharp pain of thousands of needles and turned around to see a dwarf. he slashed at me again and i stopped the blade with my chainmail gloved hand. I yanked the dagger away from him and pinned him to the ground. I said that father always proclaimed dwarf tasted good and stabbed his dagger through his throat and kicked him rolling down the cave, I stood till i heard a muffed thump and a crack of bones.  I continued on to kaladim nursing my wound on my back. i felt weaker and weaker as i continued on. Finally i saw the entrance to Kaladim. i rushed in and said hello, the guards then took my to thier leader and king, but that is a later story. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccb9b><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub86.ezboard.com/bbringersofretribution.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=uluianbardethninja>UluianBardethNinja</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ward Uluian</span><br>  Posts: 48<br> <font color=#330000>(3/2/02 2:58:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub86.ezboard.com/fbringersofretributionfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The last of our kind</span><hr size=1> (Continued)<br>
as i entered the kings Throne room i looked back and saw a red strem and wondered if that could be me. I looked back to the king and realized i was no longer standing but being held up by the guards. The king spoke out of the bravery i expressed by entering his kingdom after slaying the glorified bandit Gundl and his friend 6 Fingers the goblin. I tried to speak back about my quest but i could not make a sound with my voice. Finally the king noticing the wound i had (Like the red stream wasnt enough) he ordered me to the cleric guild for healing. I passed out halfway there and woke up later to a bearded woman standing over me. I let out a whisper and asked how long i had been out. She replied i had been out for 3 days and they thought i wouldnt make it so the had etched a gravestone reading &quot;Loud Mouthed Stranger who stained our floors with his blood after the mighty battle between He and the bandit Gundl&quot;. I smiled weakly at the stone and said my name was Uluian of the Guild Ninja Bard. She replied he name being Halfpent. I spent 4 more days in Kaladim before they replied to help me on my quest. They sent me out on one last mission of killing the two ogres Cornflunk and Zarchoomi. As a reward for slaying Gundl they gave me a old blade of the last man to see them. I immediately noticed that it had not gained rust and weighed much less then my sword. So i set out to kill the two ogres, I figured it would not be too hard considering their size. I thought they may have left the mountains, but things always happen to be bad at the best of times. A giant man that looked deformed and half the size of a normal giant had jumped from a 50 foot cliff and landed infront of me. He spoke a slured speech and the best i could make of it was I am Cornflunk, you have trespassed on Greenblood land and shall die for destroying his lands. I spoke back with I had never seen his lands nor touched them, I was Uluian the last of the Ninja Bards and must slay him to avenge my Tribal Honor. He was extremely fast for his size and had hit me before i could step aside. His punch felt like a Mammoth crushing my rib cage with its foot. I fell backwards a few feet and didnt have time to grasp my aching chest because a 300 pound man had leaped to kill me. I rolled aside to find a female ogre standing there with a spell being casted. I unsheathed my newly won blade and cut her leg in hopes of stoping her. One the blade and touched her flesh and torn through it i felt a rush of power and lept up onto my feet. Nothing could prepare me for what happen next. A fully grown female ogre let out a bellow so loud it shook the nearby mountains. I felt like my head would explode as the noise kept coming. I screamed my pain but it was only a whisper compared to hers. I felt rage and pain to make her stop and turned around with the blade ready to kill. I let out my rage into a mighty swing and cut her head from her shoulders. Cornflunk who had recovered from his leap had hit me from behind and i felt his words of rage and sorrow as he screamed for his lost friend Zarchoomi and I who had killed her. I felt pain but it was only a bee sting compared to the thought of losing my life on my journey of revenge. I swung at him and we fought for hours, both of us looking to revenge something we loved. We finally reached a beach and were worn out from constant fighting. I knew this was the last chance i had or the last place i would see. I swung my heavying sword like a club and knocked the tired cornflunk into the water. He started splashing and i knew he could not swim from this. I do not know whether it was the hatred from Shadow Hide or memory of him hiting me, but i lept upon him and held his fat head under water till his grasp on me had weakened and fallen away. I waded out from the ocean water and drug my worn out body back to Kaladim to continue on my journey. I felt sorrow for the two ogres but also felt hope that i would be able to put their deaths towards helping the future. The sun was setting and my hopes were rising.<br>
