<br>
Searing, please, for the love of god give it up.  I know what I did was wrong.  Semian messaged me today on some character and was talking to me.  I told him I was sorry.  <br>
<br>
As for me having debts, most of the gear that was taken WAS given back.  Some of the crafted wasn't because it was sold, but the weapons, haste sash, rings, earrings, and most of the other stuff was.  If you want me to pay for the crafted then message me in game.  I have your money.  You'll return the money that Nevron gave to you, though.<br>
<br>
Now, about your &quot;theories&quot;.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  &quot;yeah so what i am in Trump so there is no reason to apoligize or take any kind of responsability for my actions Nevron did that.&quot; <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Yeah, sure.  Keep trying to convince people I'm the spawn of satan.  If the above was true I wouldn't run across the world when people asked me for a rez.  Ask anyone that has been talking to me the past weeks I've come back.  I'm ALWAYS off rezzing someone if I'm not raiding.I don't even get time to xp anymore.  I rez, raid, and faction. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  in Quartan's case i know 99% of the facts and 100% of the lies. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
You think you know everything.  Or maybe you do and you just make up stuff to try to make me look worse.  Either way, get over it.  You have some serious problems if you wish death on people who did something in a game.<br>
<br>
<br>
Semian, if you read this, I am sorry.  I screwed up, I realize it.  If you want you can message me in game.  I'll repay you for the crafted and I'll PL you as much as I possibly can.  I'll make it up to you some day.<br>
<br>
I won't respond again.  If anyone has something to say to me message me in game. <p>

     someone does something wrong to me or someone who was treated me well i hold a grudge i am never stop until it's made right or atleast try my best.<br>
     Semian was great to sanctus lumen. at the time he was our highest tank and when he had to leave EQ he knew he was taking the highest (or second highest) tank in our guild with me so he gave his account to people in SL to use it for our sake. he didn't sell him account or sell his stuff on Ebay just to help us out, and you abused it and ruined it for all of us in many ways.<br>
     As soon as Semian says &quot;hey Searing i have forgiven Quartan i am cool with it i think he should be given another chance&quot; then i will be ok. and i never heard you apologize for anything you did. and if you are now trying to do so it's kinda sad it has to take all this time and all this crap just for you to do the right thing.<br>
<br>

It is against guild policy.  From day one the bullshit in game has always stopped with us.  Anyone who has ever done things like kill steal, crossteam, same-team train, or, for example, steal accounts, was removed from SL long ago.  If Searing or anyone else in SL trains anyone over this, they will be disciplined as per our charter.<br>
<br>
I decided long ago that people in my guild were not going to stoop to the pathetic level that so many of my teammates have unfortunately chosen.  If new guildleaders want to give the reject trash of the server a second, or in some cases, a tenth chance to @#%$ up a guild, that's their business, and their mistake.  I'm not gonna do anything except sit here and tell you &quot;Hey, I told you so&quot; a few months from now.  However, just as it is my guild policy to avoid same-team training and other such nonsense, it's also my policy to not muzzle my members.  If Searing wants to come here and complain about Quartan, so be it.  He's angry, and he has more than a valid reason.  <br>
<br>
If you're going to make a guild that's based on &quot;second chances&quot;, if you can even call this a second chance with a straight face, then you're going to have to deal with the fact that a lot of people are going to be upset with it.  If Leges came back to the server tomorrow and I guildinvited him, I can't even imagine the shitstorm that I would have to deal with.  And yet, for being such a good team villain, Leges never scammed any accounts.  An example of a confessed account scammer would be your guild member Quartan.  So any bad press you Trumpies get on having an account scammer in your guild is your fault.<br>
<br>
Despite all that, I am still going to bend over backwards to help your guild, or any other, because I want badly for this team to succeed.  So even though IMHO there are a lot of total rejects on the team, I try to get them geared in our tradeskill gear, and I offer whatever force we can muster for raids to any guild that wants it.  My hope is that some of the @#%$-talking, loot-whoring, account-scamming, same-team-training, kill-stealing people will pull their heads out of their @#%$ asses, and start treating their teammates like teammates.  And hey, every once in a while, I notice somebody who was a complete @#%$ six months ago becoming a team player.  If that happens in even a handful of cases, then I'm a happy camper.  I get farther that way then encouraging my guild members to give the assholes what they deserve.<br>
<br>
That said, I will say right now: hold out no hope whatsoever for the redemption of Quartan.  Take a look at his utterly remorseful posts from SZ@W a while back.  This is a person who without motive scammed an account and equipment from an SL member.  Unfortunately for him, he was foolish enough to pick the wrong person to share his plan with.  When I confronted him, telling him I had a log file of specifically what occurred, he still tried to lie his way out of it.  When I presented that log file to several other guild leaders as a warning when he left SL, Quartan cried about it on SZ@W, continued pleading his innocence, and attempted to smear my reputation.  When that backfired, he finally decided to &quot;come clean&quot; with a post in which he mocked the player whose account he scammed, and explained how proud he was of his successful scam.  He then spent the next month sniping at me/SL on any thread in which we were mentioned (and many which we weren't), because he was all upset that I caught him.  If you believe for a heartbeat that he feels bad about what he did, especially considering the, hrmm, unorthodox method he chose to reacquire the Quartan account, your head is squarely inserted in your rectum.<br>
<br>
I'll tell you right now, the amount of 100% deserved abuse you're going to take for having Quartan in your guild will far outweigh any benefit he provides.  And he will scam someone in your guild, I will guarantee it.  Though most of SL will regard that event as Comedy Gold with good reason, I'll honestly feel a little bad about it, because it would have been preventable if you would have listened to me.  But hey, like I said, it's your guild, not mine.  In my guild, there's no room for people like Quartan, because my goal is to recruit quality human beings, not to pad the roster.  You guys can proceed at your own risk.<br>

to me it Seems Quartan is willing to pay back everything he stole and make up for it and some way and wants to prove that he's a good guy now..... why don't u just let him??<br>
<br>
Stop yelling and screaming i think this should be put to a end..... i don't like seeing goodies scream at eachother<br>

i think its time this forum should come to a close because its obvious he wants to make up for what he did and is stopping just give him a second chance.....i mean if we didn't have second chances in the world..............were would we be? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub86.ezboard.com/uszdanien.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SZ Danien</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Castle Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#fff09d>(8/4/02 2:49:38 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub86.ezboard.com/fbringersofretributionfrm47.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=35>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: my first, last, only comment on teh drama</span><hr size=1> Q prevented me / Dracore / Daran from getting scammed by his friend (Yes he had our account info´s).<br>

<br>
There are several servers to choose from, why did Quartan come back here, knowing most of us read the sz@war thread containing his confession?  He can be one of two things, a really bold thief that wants to yet again take advantage of peoples trust, or he is very courageous and &quot;facing his demons&quot; so to speak.  <br>
<br>
Time will tell, but I believe in second chances.<br>
