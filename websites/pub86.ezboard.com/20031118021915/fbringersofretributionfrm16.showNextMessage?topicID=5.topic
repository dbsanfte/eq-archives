Ranks and achieving them</span><hr size=1> We have already described elsewhere how to gain the ranks 1, 2 and 3. Here we will describe the differences between the ranks and also how to gain ranks 4 and 5.<br>
<br>
Upon entering the guild, a member joins rank 1; the focus of this rank is learning what the guils is all about, showing real intent of joining (by performing a few quests), and learning the other members of the guild. How long a time goes by before reaching rank 2, can vary greatly from person to person.<br>
<br>
When rank 2 have been achieved the focus of learning/progress goes deeper into the guild itself, and the quests on this rank level should hopefully reflect thus. A quest that requires finding a few guildmembers to help solve it is a good example of this ranks focus. Also the member should at this stage learn many of the specialities of his or her particular house, as well as the other houses, whereas rank 1 focused more on the basics of the guild and connecting with the sponsor, this rank adds the layer of houses.<br>
<br>
Rank 3 members, are what is generally referred to as full members. They are no longer undergoing teachings to become members, and are in fact now able to sponsor members into the guild themselves. Many people will find this level to be satisfying to them, as it offers full membership privilegies, but yet does not make the demands, higher ranks make.<br>
<br>
Should a character wish to join rank 4, then the quests to do so, should focus on leadership skills, especially in raids against enemies, and enemy zones. Having quests that require gathering a full group of suitable members to go obtain a specific item, or kill enemies of a particular place, is not uncommon for this quest level. Only in the heat of battle can the gods judge if a person is fit to lead.<br>
<br>
If rank 4 is gained, the member has basic leadership privilegies as well as raid planning rights. Very often these people will be the ones leading the guild in raids and other such events, where strategic knowledge and keeping a cool head in the heat of battle is vital. Most people who wish to lead are quite content with achieving this level of rank, as the 5th one mostly adds paper working responsibilities. Whether a person of rank 4 has ingame officer status (to invite new members) or not, is judged by their interests as well as the needs of the Council of Retribution, and the house leader.<br>
<br>
The head of the houses are the ones of Rank 5. Not only have these people proven themselves leaders in tough situations, they have also dedicated themselves to even more responsibilities, keeping and maintaining their houses.<br>
<br>
One person of rank 5 will always be considered the leader of their house. Any other persons in the same houses with rank 5 are considered close aids and advisors of said leader, but he or she will be the one in charge (if they so desire). The leader of a house is responsible for keeping track of the members of their house, finding new members of the same house if needed, organizing house specific events, and not least: create the house specific rules. These rules are by choice not heavily defined at the beginning of the guilds history, and how each house is run, will be created by these house leaders. A few thing are required of any house's rules though : They have to specify who or what leads the house (whether it be a knightly council or a single person), they have to keep in line with the lines the gods set down for the house (dont go crossing into other houses well recognized territories, such as the house of priests beginning to focus on runes and pages trading), AND they have to specify how the leader of the house is chosen, past the first appointment by the Council of Retribution. One house might choose to have it a monthly test by combat, where the winning member of rank 5, achieves the ruling of the houses, where another house might choose to have it voted democratically each 3 months, or even only pass it on, on the request of the current leader. In any case it has to be specified what happens when a new leader has to be chosen, so that the Council of Retribution do not have to take part each time.<br>
<br>
Those are the basic differences between the five ranks, and there are also hinted as to the difference between quests to achieve the last ranks. Here are the specifics of those quest levels :<br>
<br>
To achieve rank 4, a member has to complete 4 additional quests, at least half of which shall require leading a group to reach the goal. Half of them should also focus on obtaining wealth in coin or item form for the guild coffers. These two demands can intermingle in a particular quest.<br>
<br>
Reaching rank 5 requires one to complete at least 5 more quests, 3 of which must be ones requiring at least one full group lead to reach a goal, while 1 of them must be an out of game assignment, such as writing an essay on class spells, PvP tactics of that house, or some sort. The last quest should be a personal quest part of which are a pilgrimage to sacred lands, namely the realm of Tunare, where the person must go before the goddess and pledge their loyalty to good (OOC: Tunare is the only goddess whose realm are assessible, therefore she is the one who accepts all the good followers to do this). The last quest should also require obtaining an item of great personal value to the quest undertaker, and equipping such item at the ceremony where rank 5 is bestowed.<br>
<br>
Quests to achieve rank 4 and 5 are given out by the house masters (for rank 4) and by the Council of Retribution (for rank 5). Note that this does not mean the whole council have to make the quest, merely that a member of that council have to make the quests for getting rank 5.<br>
<br>
The level requirements for obtaining the different ranks are currently as follows (these numbers are not set in stone currently and will be bypassed to satisfy the needs of the guild and to award old and good members) :<br>
<br>
Rank 1 - 15+<br>
Rank 2 - 15+<br>
Rank 3 - 20+<br>
Rank 4 - 30+<br>
Rank 5 - 46+<br>
<br>
There are no required minimum time spent on each rank level, beyond the time it will take to complete the quests given.<br>
<br>
NOTE: any person who are to obtain ingame officer status are REQUIRED to use this msg.board often actively. Failure to do so can result in termination of officer rights ingame. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub86.ezboard.com/ukyrakasa.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kyrakasa</A> at: 1/18/02 2:59:18 pm<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub86.ezboard.com/fbringersofretributionfrm16.showPrevMessage?topicID=6.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub86.ezboard.com/fbringersofretributionfrm16.showNextMessage?topicID=6.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub86.ezboard.com/fbringersofretributionfrm16.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/slate/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub86.ezboard.com/fbringersofretributionfrm16.threadControl?topicID=6.topic><img src=http://www.tsa.nu/images/pix.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub86.ezboard.com/fbringersofretributionfrm16.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=6.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub86.ezboard.com/fbringersofretributionfrm16.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=6.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub86.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="bringersofretributionfrm1">Introduction<option value="bringersofretributionfrm2">Gossip and Rumors<option value="bringersofretributionfrm3">The Trading Store<option value="bringersofretributionfrm35">Member Applications<option value="bringersofretributionfrm56">WoR Reunion<option value="bringersofretributionfrm16">The Book of Retribution<option value="bringersofretributionfrm59">Friends and Allies<option value="bringersofretributionfrm10">The Den<option value="bringersofretributionfrm12">Official Raids<option value="bringersofretributionfrm58">The Hunt<option value="bringersofretributionfrm18">Epics and Quests<option value="bringersofretributionfrm34">Guides<option value="bringersofretributionfrm8">Tradeskill Masters<option value="bringersofretributionfrm11">The Pack<option value="bringersofretributionfrm47">The Theatre<option value="bringersofretributionfrm55">Guild Suggestions<option value="bringersofretributionfrm64">Cash<option value="bringersofretributionfrm65">Equipment<option value="bringersofretributionfrm66">Spells<option value="bringersofretributionfrm63">Hall of Elders<option value="bringersofretributionfrm62">Testing of Elders<option value="bringersofretributionfrm61">Council of Elders Discussion Area</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#fff09d>- </font><a href=http://pub86.ezboard.com/bbringersofretribution>Wolves of Retribution</a><font color=#fff09d> - </font><a href=http://pub86.ezboard.com/fbringersofretributionfrm16>The Book of Retribution</a> <font color=#fff09d> - </font><a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/stats/sz_summary.jsp">Official Sullon Zek PvP Points Page</a><font color=#fff09d> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.246j<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
