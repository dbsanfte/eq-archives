<br>
     I first came across Iackey in Paludal when raven was only 45 and even then Iacky was hard to kill.  He seemingly can't be snared, rooted, mezzed, or at times &quot;hit.&quot;  When I was beating on him in PC, he was fighting a shroom for xp and pk'ing just about any even con and some red cons that came into the zone as well.  He killed the shroom and probably finally realized his hp was low and then said something like &quot;oh, if I'd known you were a red I would have paid attention to killing you instead.&quot;   After that fight he came back, did an LnS and each time I saw him in zone... I could not target or hit him.<br>
<br>
     My next meeting (I was a 52 Ranger) with Iackey was in LFay when he was going in and out of MM pk'ing (again) even cons and red cons with impunity.  This time he was duoing with a dark elf caster and again I was not able to hit him or damage him or root or snare... I did not see the normal messages this time either.  So instead I went after his partner, dispelled him and killed the partner.  <br>
<br>
     My third (non encounter - but I was on Pav and in zone) time seeing Iackey was this past week in Tenebrous when everyone and their brother was in an uproar about him being all over the zone and killing again even cons and reds with very little problem.  Pav saw him coming out of Katta with a full group on his heels so being the good little bard, I aquired a target and conned him as a green to 37 Bard and I began a chase.  I got right behind him and started trying to snare and put songs on him and nothing stuck and again no messages of him resisting.  So I gave up the chase as futile and later I heard Meaolil was in a fight with him. <br>
<br>
     So what is my point here?  When Iackey is one-on-one or duoing, he has the gear to beat you quick and get out of town.  I think Meaolil was 32 or 34 at the time and Iackey was an even con to him, and even though Meao was hitting him and getting him down in HP, Iackey's gear won the fight in the end (Rangers should not stand Toe-to-toe with Warriors (or SK's or Pally's) and should joust them).  I also chatted with some of the other higher levels and none of the chanters could get a mez on him, none of the Rangers could get snare to go and many of them were not able to hit Iackey and that should just not be.  <br>
<br>
     I believe Iackey is about 28 to 32, but he is beating (single handedly) evens and reds.  I also believe that Iackey will ghost in order not to take damage from the higher levels.  When I chased him in Lfay, he would run around and his partner would be hitting me and I couldn't even hit Iackey with a bow when he was in full view.  Are there other explanations for this?  I guess so, but even in TM with 7 goods after him, he couldn't be touched.<br>
<br>
     If someone can explain whats going on with him and how he is killing red cons that are sometimes 10 levels higher than him, I'd appreciate it.  He is either a premier PK'r with so much knowledge of the game that he's become untouchable or he is something else.<br>
<br>
     I also urge guildies to avoid him if he is in a zone with you... why ?  Look at my comments from above and put 2 and 2 together.  Why waste your time on him when you can be concentrating on another kill or finding another area to xp.<br>
<br>
     On a final note, I was in Gfay the other day and saw his corpse sticking out of a tree, so I know he can be killed and I applaud whoever got him.  As for me, If I see him attacking someone I'll go after him and try to stop the attack, but as soon as he becomes unsnareable and unhittable, then I'm gonna back off and wait for him to attack again.  <br>
<br>
     A level 30 ish Evil with 89,115 points in a top 20 group that includes PK'rs much higher than him... whoulda thunk!!!  <p>Ravenwolf Pureheart, 55th Season Outrider of Tunare<br>

She has tons of respect for him.  She also claims that she kills him or runs him off permanently every time she encounters him.  He will log on some high level Evil alt named...Macken? when he's being beat, and she answers that by logging on HER high level alt and chasing him off again.<br>
<br>
Being an evil equivalent of Laura means...he's an experienced and motivated PK who chose an ideal PvP class and PKs a LOT.  He's twinked up the wazoo, and stays midlevel so that he can more easily rack up points.  How does that work? Well the lower level you are when you get a kill, the more points that target is worth for you, and the less you lose when a high level enemy drops you.  Apparently a twinked midlevel SK (or Druid, in Laura's case) is more powerful for their level compared to their same level enemies than an equivalently geared higher level of the same class.  Therefore a level 35 Laura or whatever level Iackey is can rack up more points by staying midlevel than they could by levelling up.  Consider that evens to him and even low reds on average are extremely soft with poor gear (especially they have low resists) and aren't necessarily as bright as higher levels...they haven't had to deal with PKs that are as dangerous and they haven't had to deal with the more challenging higher level PvE situations.<br>
<br>
He may also just level very slowly because he prefers to PK...which is almost the same thing.<br>
<br>
It's easy to be immune to being &quot;snared, rooted, mezzed&quot;.  You just need excellent MR gear.<br>
<br>
I don't know how he keeps you from &quot;target[ting] or hit[ting] him&quot;.  He may hack.  He may use those little non hacking abuses of the game like ghosting and hillbugging and zone plugging.  Most PKs use the latter abuses.  You cannot compete without doing them.<br>
<br>
&quot;Rangers should not stand Toe-to-toe with Warriors (or SK's or Pally's) and should joust them.&quot;<br>
<br>
Rangers will tend to lose jousing contests with these classes also.  Rangers before AM3 are among the weakest melees (and after AM3 they aren't really melees anymore anyway) and in my opinion need to fight dirty to win when fighting other melees, utilizing Track, mobility and if they can HP attrition using their heals.  They have some advantage at range against all but the SKs and this can help too.<br>
<br>
I agree that you should avoid fighting Iackey unless you either have an obscene level advantage as well as are an experienced PvPer, or else you are very good and very well equipped, because he is a deadly foe for a number of reasons. <p>Caffron, Wizard of &lt;<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub79.ezboard.com/bsanctuslumen" target="top">Sanctus Lumen</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->&gt;, the Good team PK guild.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6c6a6c><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub86.ezboard.com/bbringersofretribution.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ravenwolf159>Ravenwolf159</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 121<br> <font color=#fff09d>(8/10/03 11:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub86.ezboard.com/fbringersofretributionfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=468.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Can someone explain.....</span><hr size=1> Thanks for the info.

As for jousting... I've used it successfully by jousting... hitting with a few arrows, getting to an area to do a quick heal and then jousting again.

I was toe to toe with him in katta last week (stupid i know) but i could not even get a decent track on him, kept going arwry, dont know if the track was messed up or not. As for lacky's pking ability, i saw him knock the crap out of a level 40'ish pally the other day in katta again while i was in there trying to solo the sonic wolves. fortunatley for me he didnt see me, or paid no attention to me. I have little experience with pking, i have done a couple with karc ( level 52 druid) but only 1 or 2 with meaolil  one was a dwarf in bb with ammaron, the other was totally by accident, i  helped a pally in gfay knock a wizzy down. I thought for a min that mabey he was a gm or something, jsut didnt have his title up, but i got some info on gm's and found out he was not one. I know he is twinked out the wazoo, to the max to have mr so strong at that level is totally mind blowing. The MR gear for that wouldnt be as effective i thought at his level. Huh just dunno, except  that he is a pain in the arse, more so than cabruna is. one final thing here, could someone please explain the stuff in the other post about the different &quot;hacks&quot; or &quot;tricks&quot; that were mentioned, such as &quot;ghosting&quot; and others, it would be helpful for my pking experience to come<br>

Kinda like a cheat code that would give you 30000 hp, or a command that would allow a ranger to gate without gate potions or a weapon that hits for much more than it should...etc....ect... either way hacking is not allowed and if it can be proven that someone hacked (very hard to prove) then that account can be banned for a while.<br>
<br>
     Ghosting and plugging are too additional ways of hacking but are not looked upon with the frowning eye like the other type of hacking is.<br>
<br>
     1) Ghosting can best be explained in that &quot;meaolil&quot; is at one end of a zone and wants to get to the other side without getting in a fight.  Meaolil actually will unplug the internet connection which causes a break in the system and then Meaolil will start running across the zone while watching the linkdead meter....while running across zone, meaolil is impervious to damage because the computer believes that meaolil is still at the start of the zone and nothing has updated.  Just prior to going Linkdead, meaolil will then replug the connection and everything will start catching up with him.<br>
<br>
     2) Plugging is pretty simple, you unplug the computer in order to avoid the death.  I've been told by a gm that plugging is actually frowned upon and can be used as a game infraction against the plugger, but they also said it's very hard to prove someone plugging when they are in the midst of zoning.<br>
<br>
     I personally have not plugged, ghosted or hacked... but there are some ways that you can bug track and can also make it seem you are ghosting when in fact you are not.<br>
<br>
     1) One way that may bug track is to run around in a circle several times so it looks like you are in several areas around the same spot.  I've seen people also run backwards in a circle to do the same thing.  And it seems to work, but not always.<br>
    <br>
     2) On the ghosting issue... I recently learned a technique where as you are running forward you also have the character &quot;bounce&quot; move to the left or right or back and forth between left and right.  You are basically running forward and to the right or left at the same time, but you are doing the right and left moves by tapping them out instead of doing it in a steady manner.  You can still be hit by someone coming after you from behind, but you won't get hit as often and the person chasing you will see you bouncing in front of him.  When he can't hit you like he normally would, it appears you are ghosting.<br>
<br>
     I'm sure there are other &quot;tricks&quot; of the trade and I'd love to see others post them if possible.<br>

<br>
Plugging...the kind I have experience with...isn't real plugging but instead turning the computer off.  If you do it while zoning, you never come out the other side...it's the melee equivalent of Gating.  Plugging while in a zone makes you an NPC and you start to regenerate hit points REALLY fast making you tough to kill, but you usually die anyway.<br>
<br>
Ghosting is when you make the computer lose track of where you are due to lag...kinda like the &quot;plugging&quot; described above.  I've heard if you type /who while running and then turn, the game loses track of you and assumes you're still running forward...then when it realizes where you are it ports your image to the correct location...and people following you see you disappear...<br>
<br>
Strafing is running sideways and forward at the same time...it makes you run a little faster than normal because you run at the vector sum of forward and sideways motion.<br>
<br>
People appear to run in circles when they ghost sometimes.  That may be what you observed Ravenwolf.<br>

<br>
I dropped him pretty quick with poison and disease chants (of course, bards dont' get these until level 50), but none of my magic based songs stuck. And since he did kill Dizeez three times in a row, I decided to CC the bastard, and was very easily chaining him and chanting him until his two red friends showed up and chased me from the zone. So his MR must be high, but his DR and PR probably are less robust. <br>
<br>
And its nice being faster than his fat ass. I don't know what SoW he has, but it is pretty good for a midlevel char.<br>

<br>
these are holes in the game that people have found out.  no one should 'use' them.  it ruins the reality of what eq is suppose to be like.  you arent suppose to be able to escape a foe in the middle of a giant zone.  you are suppose to die becuz you got yourself in that situation.  anyone who uses any of these should not even be allowed to play.  its not skill, its cheating and bending the rules, whether they can be cought or not.<br>

I am verry honorable person, due mainly to my Marine Corps background, in my everyday life and in game. What i ment by my post was trying to better understand the &quot;loop holes&quot; in the game, to be better off at serving my guild. By better understanding the &quot;loop holes&quot; in a zone i am in if i see it and know what they are doing, i mabey be able to alert other goodies as to helping them avoid a certain pk death. So now that i am thinking about it, offended i am and an apology i will be expecting!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>

i simply voiced my opinion.  an act of bravery and honor is not in what one says they can do, it is in their actions.  however i have no reason not to beleive you as you are with WoR and im sure for a good reason.  i see no reason to test your &quot;faithfullness&quot; as your quote puts.  i meant not to offend you in saying that you do use &quot;hacks&quot; or wish to implement any loops or holes within the game.  see you online.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Whoot, sweet info on some of them tips, i will definately have to try the &quot;Bounce&quot; thing, might be of some use in pk sitiuations, mabey<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
ok this is your own words.  this bounce thing is a glitch in the game that shows the person being attacked as bouncing around allowing them to get hit less.  THIS IS ANOTHER HOLE.  you specifically said &quot;i will have to try this&quot; meaning you were intending on using a part of the game that is glitched to further yourself in a situation.  boy im sure glad i dont put my full trust in people who are so devoted to honor.  again, i dont wish a query with you, but neither will i apologize for asking a question. <br>
<br>
i dont like fighting, but playing a warrior for me is more then happenstance.  i will defend myself as needed.  you are no longer offended, you stand corrected.<br>

On the  bounce thing, is there a way to target the person &quot; bouncing&quot; so as to be able to effectively target them rather  than just missing target? mabey with bow, or will snare stop the &quot; Bouncing&quot;<br>

The same with the running in circles and what ever to throw off track or what ever. Its just another rl tactic used to confuse the enemy that some people apply to ingame strategies. Whats wrong with that??? No one is changing codes or anything even remotely close to that. These are valid offense and deffensive tactics used by experienced players.
