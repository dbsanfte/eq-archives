Ribbons and medals</span><hr size=1> First off I want to point out that the list below is by no means complete yet. The basics are in there, and as the immediate future will lead to suggestions for more medals and ribbons, they will be added, until this section of the book is complete.<br>
<br>
Let me begin by explaining the difference between a medal and a ribbon, in the Bringers of Retribution.<br>
<br>
First off, if we had some graphics for it, you would see that a medal was alot bigger than a ribbon, but since we dont, I am gonna stick with the mathematic reason, which is simply: a ribbon is something you can figure out when you will be awarded - a medal is something that you are awarded for deeds that cannot really be put into numbers. Its as simple as that.<br>
<br>
Secondly ribbons are more or less divided into 4 categories for each ribbon type. From lower to higher they are : Copper, Silver, Gold, Platinum. Each of the ribbons for a given achievement is awarded at a set point in your characters history. In time you can have all 4 ribbons for an achievement type, each of them showing that you achieved a step on the road to perfection of a trade, a skill, fighting ability, and so on.<br>
<br>
A medal is awarded for special deeds, noticed by the leaders, or reported to the leaders, of the guild. You cannot really be certain when you will be awarded a medal (generally speaking), nor are there several grades of the same medal. Each medal stands for a specific deed performed. You ARE able to be awarded the same medal more than once though, each of them corresponding to a specific incident, or series of incidents that lead to your acknowledgement before the leaders, in the shape of a medal.<br>
<br>
Now, let me list the ribbons:<br>
<br>
<u><b>RIBBONS OF CRAFT</b></u><br>
One ribbon exist for each craft skill in the game. They are divided into skill levels, corresponding to a specific ribbons metal. Copper is awarded at skill 100, Silver at 150, Gold at 200, and Platinum at 250.<br>
<i>Ex: Copper Ribbon of Smithing</i><br>
<br>
<u><b>RIBBONS OF ACHIEVEMENT</b></u><br>
These ribbons are awarded for achieving specific levels in the game. The metals are awarded per the following levels: Copper at 20, Silver at 30, Gold at 40, Platinum at 50.<br>
Note that there is an exception to the general rule about ribbons and medals, in that there are no ribbon for reaching level 60, but instead a medal, as it was felt that a bigger reward should be awarded for reaching this milestone.<br>
<i>Ex: Silver Ribbon of Achievement</i><br>
<br>
<u><b>RIBBONS OF RETRIBUTION</b></u><br>
For getting on the PvP point board on the official Sullon Zek page, you can be awarded these ribbons. The metals each stands for a number of times your name has been witnessed on the board by an officer (notes will be taken under your roster entry, with dates and witness). Copper is for 1 time, Silver 5 times, Gold 10 times, and Platinum 25 times.<br>
<i>Ex: Silver Ribbon of Retribution</i><br>
<br>
<u><b>RIBBONS OF ZONES</b></u><br>
For mastering a zone, a ribbon can be awarded for that zone. Mastering includes knowing the layout of the zone, knowing the drop list of the zone, and leading a successful raid into the zone. There are no list of zones here which a ribbon exists for, as the list would be too long; generally there is a ribbon for each zone that is not a hometown for any of the player races in the game. Also for this ribbon type, there are no metal grades, just one ribbon for each zone.<br>
<i>Ex: Ribbon of Kithicor Forest</i><br>
<br>
<u><b>RIBBONS OF DRAGONS</b></u><br>
A ribbon exist for each named dragon in the game. To be awarded the ribbon, the member must take part in defeating one of the great wyrms of our world, and the deed must have been witnessed by several other members of the Bringers of Retribution. The metal categories for this ribbon type, corresponds to the number of times a member have taken part in this. Copper for 1 time, Silver for 5 times, Gold for 10 times, and Platinum for 20 times. Each proved attempt will be noted by a leader under the members profile entry in the roster, so it is easy for anyone to see when a member is due for these ribbons, as well as the history of defeating the named wyrms of our world.<br>
<i>Ex: Copper Ribbon of Nagafen</i><br>
<br>
<u><b>RIBBONS OF AVATARS</b></u><br>
These ribbons work exactly the same as the Ribbons of Dragons, except that they correspond to the godly avatars instead, who must be defeated on their home planes, where they dwell.<br>
<i>Ex: Gold Ribbon of Innoruuk</i><br>
<br>
******************<br>
Those were the ribbon types. Let us now proceed to the medals:<br>
<br>
<u><b>PURPLE DRAGON MEDAL</b></u><br>
This medal can be awarded to members who have fallen valiantly in battle, saving others by sacrificing themselves in a fight against our enemies.<br>
<br>
<u><b>GOLD DRAGON MEDAL</b></u><br>
This medal stands for exemplary conduct above and beyond the call of duty. With conduct is meant general behavior, willingness to devote time and energy to a noble cause and the guild, and similar actions.<br>
<br>
<u><b>SILVER DRAGON MEDAL</b></u><br>
For exemplary behaviour in combat against enemies (PvP), this medal can be awarded. Exemplary does not necessarily mean that you never loose - it means that in victory or defeat you remain an example to those who try to make a life on Sullon Zek.<br>
<br>
<u><b>BRONZE DRAGON MEDAL</b></u><br>
The Bronze Dragon Medal stands for exemplary behaviour in combat against the environment (PvE - against NPCs), much in the same way the Silver Dragon Medal stands for PvP.<br>
<br>
<u><b>PLATINUM DRAGON MEDAL</b></u><br>
Achieving level 60 will win you this medal. It is a feat that should be recognized with more than a ribbon, and wearing this should make you as proud, as it makes us proud to award it to you for long and faithful work in the war on Sullon Zek.<br>
<br>
<u><b>BLACK DRAGON MEDAL</b></u><br>
For winning against impossible odds (PvP), the Black Dragon Medal can be awarded. It is not an easy medal to win, and respect should be given to those who come to wear it.<br>
<br>
<u><b>BLUE DRAGON MEDAL</b></u><br>
The Blue Dragon Medal is awarded for being an extraordinary example for other guild members. The wearers of these medals have proven themselves on countless occasions to put the guild before their own goals. They are the epitome of what a guildmember could become in relation to other members.<br>
<br>
<u><b>MEDALS OF ARMOR - </b></u><br>
These medals are one of the examples to the rule that you cannot calculate when you will be awarded a medal. They stand for acquiring a specific armor set, deemed to be class specific and possibly from a specific zone also. The list is not complete, but goes from the basic Norrath Armor, such as Lambent Armor, over plane armor, to the new class armors being discovered outside our native regions. During a ceremony where you are expected to display the full armor set, you will be awarded this medal.<br>
<i>Ex: Medal of Armor - Kunark</i><br>
<i>Ex: Medal of Armor - Plane of Hate</i><br>
<br>
**********<br>
<br>
That was the list as it exists now. More ribbons and medals will be added as needed later on. For now, let us enjoy these goals to accomplish, and have fun being the Bringers of Retribution.<br>
