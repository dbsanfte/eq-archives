*Tries to catch his breath*<p>I interviewed over 12 members last night for the Leadership Positions and I believe I have it narrowed down to where the High Council can make the best decision for our new leaders.  If there is anyone else that I have missed, and I know I have because of when we are all online, please let me know when we can meet before this Thursday.  I can chat to you during the day over ICQ or meet in the game in the evenings.<p>I have updated the Join page with the help of the Hospitalers.  When you are approached by a stranger in the game that wants to be a member or wants to know your Guild Master please send them to the web site.  Get a macro setup because everyone will be doing this a lot.  Everything is on the Join page on how to become a member and you do not need to waste your time in game when it is already provided for you on the web site.  A new Applicant Page will be going up in the next couple days and we will be tracking the people that are interested in the guild once again.<p>The Members page has been cleaned up.  I split the list into 2 parts now, one being the Active List and one being the Non-Active List.  The Active List is everyone that has received the guild functions or been doing a good job keeping in touch with the other guild members.  The Non-Active List is a list of members that have not received guild functions, changed their name without me knowing, or have been missing for some time.  I do not mean to offend anyone so please do not be upset if you are on the Non-Active List.  You let me know and I will get you moved ASAP.<p>Let me know what else we need to work on the web site, I am getting bored again, hee heee<p>Cyxe<br>
