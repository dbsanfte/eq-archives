      <p>Arcane Adventurers is a <b>Good, Lawful, Non-Pk, Role-playing Encouraged</b> guild.</p>
      <strong><p><big>Goals: </big></p>
      </strong><p>To have fun, share our ideas and experiences, and in general, enjoy one
      another&#146;s company!<ul>
        <li>Our main goal is to organize an ever-growing group of people together as a whole. To
          build a foundation of relationships with others, so that we may influence them towards the
          Path of Righteousness; thus increasing our standing in the world. </li>
        <li>Leading by example will be a mainstay of our cause. We will show the world a strong,
          generous, and helping face. Never will it be said that we did not have time to help others
          in need. </li>
        <li>Defending the weak and helpless should become second nature to us. We must never use our
          powers to cause harm to others, save only in defense. Beings of an evil alignment are just
          that, evil, and thusly do not fall under this.</li>
        <li>We will always strive to improve and expand our own personal abilities and knowledge by
          sharing our resources and experiences with one another. </li>
        <li>By uniting as a whole, we will pool our resources to possibly purchase a guildhall, have
          the developers make us a guild skin for our characters, and further expand our influence
          upon the world. </li>
      </ul>

    <blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li>When addressing a fellow guild member that is of higher rank then you, it is encouraged
          to please use their title and name while addressing them in public. At all other times you
          can use Brother/Sister or their name as the form of address.&nbsp; This is not something
          we require it but it shows respect and dedication to your peers.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>We all desire peace. With this in mind we will never directly attack other good aligned
          people, save in our defense. No exceptions allowed! If you are found trying to pick
          fights, participating in thievery, or generally belittling the cause of this guild, YOU
          WILL BE BANISHED FROM THE GUILD. </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Being a generous and forthright player is a requirement. You will take the time to help
          those in need. You will help those of lesser stature train and become better at what they
          do. You will be generous to others with you while adventuring and you will take the time
          to listen to others needs. No matter if they be of this guild or not. A non-member in need
          is a potential future member.</li>

        <li><b>Only good aligned characters are allowed, no Dark Elves, Shadow Knights, etc... The
          game takes into account your actions and this will influence how NPCs react to you. If a
          Cleric of Nife and a Cleric of Innoruuk were to group together, they&#146;d both lose HUGE
          amounts of standing within their respective guilds and smaller amounts to other related
          parties.</b></li>

      <ul>
        <li>All members are required to read the message board daily and to keep up with changes on
          the web site. Many members work hard on this tool for the guild, it is not put up for fun.
          Members not keeping up with changes will be warned once and then removed from their band,
          the second time removed from the guild. All changes are sent to the members by ICQ in the
          form of a URL link. </li>

      </b><blockquote>
        <p>The Guild Laws were created in an effort to formalize the guild&#146;s response to
        negative actions that reflect poorly upon the guild. The Thane is the Keeper and Enforcer
        of both the rules and the laws. All judgements, if not clearly defined, shall be decide
        upon by the full counsel. </p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>The Thane will not participate in an active manner in the judging counsel. Instead he
        will act as an impartial advisor to both sides and provide his knowledge of the laws in an
        open format. Once judgement has been passed, the Thane will see that the judgement is
        carried out in its full extent.</p>
      </blockquote>

        </b><p>These are Crimes that by their nature, break down the overall purpose of this guild

        everyone to your ICQ list and rename each name with the suffix AA (Example: &quot;Cyxe -
        AA&quot;) this way all the members will be easy to find. Questions relating to the guild
        or game should be posted on the message board so everyone can learn from your questions.

        pertain to them.</p>

        need to donate money to the treasury, managed by the Reeve. It is called a
        &quot;Trust-Tax&quot; because it is <strong>not</strong> based on a set amount or
        percentage. Everyone is encouraged to donate what he or she can. If we notice you <strong>never</strong>
        donate to this cause it will eventually creep up on you...</p>
