This is the sixth part in the ten part series of Coldain Ring Quests. You do not have to do any of the earlier parts in order to do this entire part, except for the turn in at the end. This one you will need a strong partner to do.<br>
<br>
After you complete the fifth quest...<br>
Garadain Glacierbane says 'Without your assistance, we would have lost our camp and our lives. Again, I thank you. Now that you have proven your loyalty to the throne I have a special [favor] to ask of you.'<br>
<br>
You say, 'What favor?'<br>
<br>
Garadain Glacierbane says 'For several seasons there has been an unsolved mystery in this land. Not far from here an elite team of Coldain and their trained wolves were gathered to make a strike at the Kromrif. No one knows just what became of our strike force. Bring me proof of their fate and proof that whoever was responsible for their loss is no more.'<br>
<br>
Now you need to find Korrigain.  He is a ghost Coldain that only spawns at night.  He spawns near the Southwestern most dwarvish huts in Eastern Wastes (the same ones with Icefang).<br>
<br>
You say, 'Hail, Korrigain'<br>
<Br>
Korrigain says 'Who dares disturb my rest? If ye be a friend of the mighty Coldain, then show me proof and I shall tell you of my plight. If not, then be on your way.'<br>
<br>
Now hand him your Obsidian Ring from the previous quest.  (He gives it right back).<br>
<br>
Korrigain says 'Many seasons ago I stood here in life with my comrades, the best warriors Thurgadin had to offer. Along with our faithful wolven army we were poised to eliminate the Kromrif presence in the region. Somehow, the enemy was made aware of our plans and just before our attack, a group of Ry'Gorr oracles charmed our wolves, forcing them to tear down their own masters. We were caught by surprise and died a savage death.'<br>
<br>
At this point Icefang will wander out to where you are standing (presumably he despawns and respawns).<br>
<br>
Korrigain says 'All that remains from that battle is my loyal Icefang. He will not rest until I am avenged. Follow and watch after him. He alone knows where our attackers lie and he cannot overcome them by himself. May Brell bless you with success, farewell.'<br>
<br>
Icefang runs in a semi-direct route across EW to the Orc camp near the Iceclad Bridge (also known as the Great Span).  I would recommend guarding him as he'll sometimes get distracted and killed along the way.  If this happens, you have to start this part over again.<br>
<br>
When he gets close to the Orc hut, four oracles of Ry'Gorr spawn and Poxbreath Yellowfang spawns as well.  These are all around level 50, so you'll need help doing this.  You can let Icefang die once the orcs have spawned.  The easiest way to kill Poxbreath is to have someone Pacify him.  When the oracles run off to kill Icefang, simply pull Poxbreath off in the other direction (northish).  Two or three people should be able to kill him pretty easily at level 50.  Fear Kiting works quite well if you can get him Pacified, but don't have the healing power to tank.<br>
<Br>
When he dies, he drops a note.  Take it.  It reads:<br>
Commander Yellowfang, Your handling of the Coldain elite guard was outstanding. It will take the stumpymen many years to recover from that slaughter. My superiors are well pleased. Your loyalty and service to the Kromrif have sealed an alliance between our peoples that we shall honor from this day forward. The bulk of this treasure is for you to distribute among your men as you see fit. We ask that you provide well for your coldain informant, Rodrick Kotrad, as your success would have been impossible without his cooperation. Surikka Squatnot <br>
<br>
Rodrick <b>Tardok</b> will spawn in the building outside Ry'Gorr keep.  To get him to spawn, you need to let a Ry'Gorr Emissary walk out of the keep and linger by the building for a few minutes.<br>
<br>
Once the Emissary walks away, you can kill Rodrick.  (Or just kill both of them).  Rodrick is fairly Magic Resistant, hits quite hard, and procs "Whirl til you Hurl" which is a Stun fairly frequently.  Either take a small group to kill him, or cheat and get a higher level person to do it for you.<br>
<br>
He drops his head and the Dirk of the Traitor.  The Dirk is a horrible weapon, but is used in the 9th ring quest, so you may want to hang onto it.  The head is the last piece you need for this part.  Return to Garadain with the note from Poxbreath, Rodrick's head, and your Obsidian ring.<br>
<br>
Garadain Glacierbane lowers his head and mutters, 'At least there will be some closure for their families, thanks to you. The Ry`gorr will pay for this with their lives! I will ask you to help us in the invasion of Ry`gorr keep, but first I have a delicate [mission] I was hoping you'd handle.' <br>
