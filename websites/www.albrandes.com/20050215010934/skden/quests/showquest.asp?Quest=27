Find Hukulk over the pool of lava in the Shadow Knight guild in Grobb.  If you talk to him he offers you two quests: one which requires bone chips, and one that will give you the Helm of Hukulk.  I don't have the exact text for this quest because I did it over 2 years ago.<br>
<br>
If you ask him about the Helm of Hukulk, he goes on for a bit about how his girlfriend was stolen from him by someone in Neriak.  He's not that broken up about it, but he gave her some Happy Love Bracers that he'd like back...  while you're at it, go ahead and bring him the head of the guy who stole her too.<br>
<br>
You can find Lynuga (very rarely) in Innothule Swamp and ask her about the Happy Love Bracers.  She'll tell you she gave them to Guard Lumpkin in Neriak, but she doesn't see him anymore.  Six of one, half a dozen of the other, though, you need those bracers.  Since you already know where to go (from reading this) you don't need to bother finding her as she has nothing to offer you.<Br>
<br>
In Neriak - Foreign Quarter, in the Troll/Ogre area there are some tunnels where Guard Lumpkin walks around.  Though I can't remember exactly, if you ask him about Lynuga or the Happy Love Bracers he tells you that he gave the Bracers to Ratraz.  At this point, you should lure him to an out of the way corner and dispatch of him.  He's relatively easy to kill at level 20 even if you're not very well equipped, just save Harm Touch for when he starts to run as you don't want him getting any help.<br>
<Br>
Now that you have his head, you need to find Ratraz.  He's a bouncer at Maiden's Fury in Neriak - Third Gate.  Find him there.  I'm not sure if he talks to you or not, so just kill him.  Apparently he's not very popular because no one will help him.  Once you've killed him, take the Happy Love Bracers (which make quite a fashion statement in their own right) and Lumpkin's head back to Hukulk.  In his excitement, he'll give you his Helmet.<br>
