<!----------------------------><B>December 10, 2002</b><br>Most of the time I'm playing I forget I even have disciplines, and realized, I wasn't entirely sure what they all did.  Granted, that was before I was level 51, but after I got resistant and used it a few times, I forgot all about it.  Fast forward.  After I hit 54, I didn't even remember I had a new discipline until almost a bubble into the level.  Unfortunately, it's a damn worthless discipline that should have been given to wizards or something, but it's still a discipline.  Anyway, my point is that I put up a quick description of all the disciplines along with a little insight into them.  Enjoy.<br><div align='right'>--Rozzl Grimtouch<br>The Seventh Hammer</div><br><hr><br><B>December 4, 2002</b><br>Only want to make a quick point today...  If you have questions, I'd be glad to answer them, just tap me out a quick e-mail.  However, if there's an attachment on the e-mail, I'm not even going to read the message.  Especially if the attachment is...  say...  an executable.  I don't know how stupid you think I am just because I'm a Troll, unfortunately, because of my untrusting nature, this means that even if you have a graphic in your signature, I probably won't read your e-mail.  It's not that I don't trust you, just that I don't trust my virus software.<br><div align='right'>--Rozzl Grimtouch<br>The Seventh Hammer</div><br><hr><br><B>November 30, 2002</b><br>Happy late Thanksgiving.  I added poor descriptions of the Thurgadin Quest armor.  Someday I'll put it on the armor sets.  However, I'd like to point out that this is Shadow Knight "sell-out" armor.  Dwarves worship things like Brell Serillis...  Don't waste your time with these fellows, besides, they make the most delightful sounds when they die.<br><div align='right'>--Rozzl Grimtouch<br>The Seventh Hammer</div><br><hr><br><B>November 26, 2002</b><br>I hate you Kenny.  More armor.<br><div align='right'>--Rozzl Grimtouch<br>The Seventh Hammer</div><br><hr><br><B>November 25, 2002</b><br>I don't really have anything to say here, and haven't added anything to the site in a couple days.  I just wanted to point out to all you first time Shadow Knights that you've picked a tough class.  If I had a nickel for everytime I heard "Alright, now all we need to do is find a Shadow Knight and we can get this raid started," well, let's just say I wouldn't be a rich man.<br><div align='right'>--Rozzl Grimtouch<br>The Seventh Hammer</div><br><hr><br>

      I have a database now, my hit counter works, and more to come.<br>

      I added some starting info...  Statistics, stuff you need to know, and where to fight for a little while for each race.  Click on the link under Articles or just click <a href="http://www.albrandes.com/skden/articles/starting.asp">here</a>.<br>

      You can now <a href="mailto:rozzl@albrandes.com">contact me</a> with feedback...  or anything else really.  I've gotten tons of requests to finish the site (and I'm working on it) but right now my computer is kind of crapping out on me and I don't have any database software, so you'll just have to wait.<br>

      Ok, slow progress.  Everything is more dynamic now...  using ASP for the menus and most pages so adding content should be a bit easier from here on out.  Once I get organized more I'll start adding spells, starting stuff and other random stuff that I find in other places but needs to be compiled for the Shadowknight community.<br>

      Here it is...  The Shadowknight Den.  I'm designing this site primarily because I haven't found a good site for Shadowknights that exclusively dealt with relevant information for them.<br>
      This is just the first release, and I plan on making significant upgrades over the next few months.  Eventually I'll get around to setting up a database and making these pages more dynamic instead of this pure HTML.  Here are some of the things that will sooner or later be added:<br>
      <ul>
       <li>Spells listing with random details</li>
       <li>That's it...  that's all I have planned for now.</li>
       <li>First step is to develop the database though</li>
       <li>Stop reading now, I'm just mumbling</li>
      </ul>
