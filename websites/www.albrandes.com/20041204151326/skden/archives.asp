<!----------------------------><B>February 11, 2004</b><br>Do you remember...<br>
When Firiona Vie was captured and we went to Kunark to rescue her?<BR>
When teeth were needed to teleport to most locations in Velious?<br>
When Rubicite armor (not spiked, barbed, etc...  just plain Rubicite) dropped in the Lost Temple of Cazic-Thule?<br>
The first time Nagafen and Vox were killed?<br>
The Scimitar of the Mistwalker?<br>
<br>
Wouldn't it be nice if someone had kept track of these bits of the history of Norrath?  It's too late now, as everything is lost to the annals of time.  But...<br>
<br>
If you're planning on playing the World of Warcraft, I'm planning on tracking the history in that game to a great level of detail.  Check out <a href="http://www.albrandes.com/azeroth">The History of Azeroth</a>.  Since the game hasn't even launched yet (hell, as of this writing, the Beta hasn't even started) so there's very little information.  But it can't hurt to check it out and I encourage anyone to send me any historical information on WarCraft that is either interesting or relevant.<br><div align='right'>--Rozzl Grimtouch<br>The Seventh Hammer</div><br><hr><br><B>December 5, 2003</b><br>Finally added a summary of the sleeper kill on the sleeper page.<br><div align='right'>--Rozzl Grimtouch<br>The Seventh Hammer</div><br><hr><br><B>November 18, 2003</b><br>It seems the Sleeper was finally killed.  Sometime last night a conglomeration of folk on Rallos Zek managed to do it.  This isn't exactly new since it's sprung up almost everywhere.  Now I get to change all my crap to reflect this.<br><div align='right'>--Rozzl Grimtouch<br>The Seventh Hammer</div><br><hr><br><B>November 3, 2003</b><br>Finally found the in game text from Skyshrine talking about Kerafyrm's creation and the war on the dragons.  I added it to the bottom of <a href="/skden/articles/sleeper.asp">The Sleeper page</a>.<br><div align='right'>--Rozzl Grimtouch<br>The Seventh Hammer</div><br><hr><br><B>October 5, 2003</b><br>I am interested in Lore.  One thing in the game that I find to be worth reading.  I've chronicled as much Sleeper's lore as I could find, and always enjoy reading the history of Norrath.  In such, I am starting to chronicle <a href="/skden/articles/ldon.asp">The Lost Dungeons of Norrath lore</a>.  I'm trying to remember to log information everytime I get new text from the wayfarer's.  If you know anything that I don't have logged, please send it to me.  Include which theme, and how many adventures you completed to get that piece of lore.  Thanks and enjoy.<br><div align='right'>--Rozzl Grimtouch<br>The Seventh Hammer</div><br><hr><br><B>September 26, 2003</b><br>I decided that it would be interesting to know who woke the Sleeper on each server, and what date.  I added a section about that to the beginning of the <a href="http://www.albrandes.com/skden/articles/sleeper.asp">Sleeper page</a> and filled in the ones I knew off the top of my head.  If anyone is interested, and you know who woke Kerafyrm on your server, e-mail me if you feel like it at <a href="mailto:rozzl@albrandes.com">rozzl@albrandes.com</a> and let me know the guild, and if you can, the date.  At the very least, please send me a link to their website so I can research it a bit too.  Meanwhile, hope someone finds it interesting.<br><div align='right'>--Rozzl Grimtouch<br>The Seventh Hammer</div><br><hr><br><B>August 5, 2003</b><br>I don't usually editorialize, and this is significantly off topic for Shadow Knights, but since about a third of the hits this site gets are for the Sleeper page anyway...<br>
<br>
There's been a bit of a furor over the waking of the Sleeper on Xev.  I believe this only leaves the Sleeper asleep on a handful of servers, the only one of which I know is Stromm (newbie) server.  I am now going to be circuitous and hard to follow for a little while.<br>
<br>
Many message boards have "flamed" (for lack of a better term) Hawkestone as being selfish bastards who have ruined the server by waking the Sleeper.  In reality, they have changed 0.5% (or less) of the content of the server.  And the value of that change is not so negative as it once was (before the Tomb's revamp) so the change is not that big a deal.  So Shrouds of Longevity are not there...  ok, that's probably the worst thing to come out of this.  That is not a good argument for disapproval of the event.<br>
<br>
Now new people to Sleeper's Tomb will not be able to see the Sleeper.  True, and this is a shame, but one of the more common bashes I've seen was that "You did this, now I'll never be able to" in nature.  A bit hypocritical don't you think?  Criticizing Hawkestone for destroying an event just because you wanted to destroy it.  This shows that the critcizer's intentions were to be selfish and run the event.  What Hawkestone's goals were is unclear (to me, at least).  That is not a good argument for disapproval of the event.<br>
<br>
They've ruined one more of the few remaining chances <i>anybody</i> will ever have to kill the Sleeper.  Surprisingly, I haven't seen this argument made yet, and as I can see, it's the most valid of any argument.  By waking the Sleeper with a force of 30-40 (as I've heard it, I do not claim this to be an accurate number) players they doomed themselves to defeat.  If the decision had been a conscious one by Hawkestone to wake the Sleeper, it should have included other high end guilds in this decision, and put forth a coordinated effort to actually kill him.  Had there been...  say 120-150 people equipped in PoP and Vex Thal gear, then there would have been at least a decent chance of winning.  Now I realize, it's difficult to get that many people coordinated even when they are all in the same guild, and 3 or 4 guilds working together on an event like this is unheard of, but only 30 people caused the event to be a complete waste.<br>
<br>
Anyway, hate Hawkestone all you want, I'm sure in your eyes, your reasons are just as good as any I can offer to support or counter your feelings.  My only hope is that on any remaining servers, that there can be an "alliance"...  if just for a few hours...  if only to say "I was there when the Sleeper hit 50% health".<br><div align='right'>--Rozzl Grimtouch<br>The Seventh Hammer</div><br><hr><br><B>August 4, 2003</b><br>Added a little more info to the Sleeper page...  nothing big.  Oh yeah, Hawkestone woke the Sleeper about a month or so ago (on Xev server) haven't been able to find much info on this though...  seems to have pissed a lot of people off.<br><div align='right'>--Rozzl Grimtouch<br>The Seventh Hammer</div><br><hr><br><B>July 25, 2003</b><br>Added some info to the Sleeper FAQ from recently finding a reliable source.  (I believe)<br><div align='right'>--Rozzl Grimtouch<br>The Seventh Hammer</div><br><hr><br><B>July 10, 2003</b><br>As of 7pm yesterday the site is now on the new server.  If you don't know what I'm talking about, don't worry, it won't affect you at all.<br><div align='right'>--Rozzl Grimtouch<br>The Seventh Hammer</div><br><hr><br><B>April 30, 2003</b><br>Moved the SK Den to a new server, if something breaks, I'll fix it when I get back from my honeymoon.<br><div align='right'>--Rozzl Grimtouch<br>The Seventh Hammer</div><br><hr><br><B>April 21, 2003</b><br>The ShadowKnight Den will be closing soon.  I'm changing servers and at this point don't plan on porting all the ASP code over there and retesting it.<br>
<br>
Add that on to the fact that I don't play my SK anymore so am not really aware of any Shadow Knight issues that arise and I don't think it's reasonable to keep it up.  If I have the free time when I move servers (2 or 3 months), I may move the code over, but probably won't go over it with a fine tooth comb to make sure nothing breaks.<br><div align='right'>--Rozzl Grimtouch<br>The Seventh Hammer</div><br><hr><br><B>March 10, 2003</b><br>No big surprise, but there are dozens of places that already have a full complement of maps, and others in the works.  In light of that I'm going to go ahead and kill the maps section.  I may continue to post maps as I occasionally make them, but don't expect big things.<br><div align='right'>--Rozzl Grimtouch<br>The Seventh Hammer</div><br><hr><br><B>March 7, 2003</b><br>OK, the map section is open now.  I'll put a link on the menu soon, but for now, click <a href="/skden/maps/maps/asp">here</a> to see the three maps I have so far.  I mapped out Gunthak, Dulak, and Torgiran.  Enjoy, and let me know what you think.<br><div align='right'>--Rozzl Grimtouch<br>The Seventh Hammer</div><br><hr><br><B>February 27, 2003</b><br>Forget about the layering format of the maps.  I was making my maps and realized, after placing several labels, that I forgot to switch back to Layer 1 for more lines, and realized that this is probably a pretty easy thing to forget.  So do it however you want, for that matter, just include all the things on one layer, it'll make it easier.<br><div align='right'>--Rozzl Grimtouch<br>The Seventh Hammer</div><br><hr><br><B>February 26, 2003</b><br>Send me your maps.  Shortly I'm going to set up a page with various maps for the cartography system in LoY.  I know pretty much every currently active EQ site out there is doing the same thing, so why be different.  If you make a map of a zone, and want it published for use by others, send it to me and I'll include it on my page along with the author (unless otherwise specified).  I've almost finished mapping out Gunthak and Dulak myself, so expect those up soon.<br>
<br>
Map format:<br>
Layer 1: All the lines.  Buildings, Walls, terrain changes, etc.<br>
Layer 2: Labels.  Notable NPCs, false walls, pits, traps, etc.<br>
Layer 3: Misc.  Small quips of strategy.  How to break a room, best route from A to B, etc<br><div align='right'>--Rozzl Grimtouch<br>The Seventh Hammer</div><br><hr><br><B>February 14, 2003</b><br>Happy Birthday, everyone.  I added a handful of the Greenmist quests today (although, ironically enough, I didn't add the final quest cause I ran out of time and got to come home).  So if you're an Iksar, and too big of a Tang to do the real epic, then you can now find a description of how to do the gimp version.  <br>
<br>
Anyway, as a bonus (to someone), Nick Yee has a new survey for MMORPG players.  Since I imagine anyone who reads this site plays a Shadow Knight, go ahead and fill the survey out and give more support to the case that MMORPGs don't cause people to kill themselves.  You can find the survey at <a href="http://www.nickyee.com/mmorpg/main.html 
">http://www.nickyee.com/mmorpg/main.html 
</a>.  I think.  I haven't tried the link yet, though, so don't yell at me.  Anyway, my fiance' is lookin all sexy at me right now, so I'll see you later.  Happy Valentine's Day.<br><div align='right'>--Rozzl Grimtouch<br>The Seventh Hammer</div><br><hr><br><B>January 31, 2003</b><br>Part 2<br>
Lots of people still have viruses.  I hate to waste this space with this, but about half the mail I get has either a worm, or an intentional attack attached to it.  If you send me an e-mail, I will respond.  Even if all I say is "thanks".  If I did not respond, that's because you had a virus attached to the e-mail, so I didn't open it.  Whether you're trying to infect me or just don't know you have it, it's there.  If the former, then I don't need to tell you where to go.  If the latter, then run a virus scan.<br><div align='right'>--Rozzl Grimtouch<br>The Seventh Hammer</div><br><hr><br><B>January 31, 2003</b><br>Well, thanks to last Tuesday's patch, mayhem and chaos were spread throughout the lands.  Personally, Rozzl spent some time moonlighting as a level 50 Bard.  Other than several LDs though, that was the worst thing I experienced.  Some other things I heard of included:
<li>One person briefly became a level 198 cleric</li>
<li>Entire zones being given 80,000 AA points</li>
<li>People randomly being dropped for 20k damage</li>
<li>People beind randomly ported to their bind points</li>
<li>People randomly being ported to a room resembling a box</li><br>
Feel free to e-mail me anymore that you may have noticed as it's very funny.  Note, everything in the list were things I heard third hand and have no way of knowing the truth value.<br><div align='right'>--Rozzl Grimtouch<br>The Seventh Hammer</div><br><hr><br><B>January 25, 2003</b><br>Thanks to people submitting the accurate skill caps.  I believe I have all of them correct at level 50 now.  I also added another quest or two, but I don't remember which ones.<br><div align='right'>--Rozzl Grimtouch<br>The Seventh Hammer</div><br><hr><br><B>January 15, 2003</b><br>First of all, I added another 10 armor sets to the sets of armor.  That brings the total to 17 right now.  If there are other sets you want to see, e-mail me and let me know and I'll try to put them together someday.<br>
<br>
Legacy of Ykesha.  Finally an expansion that portrays the Trolls as more than overgrown, stupid animals that are content in their own stupidity and do not seek to better their race (That's straight from one of the original Prima Strategy guides).  Anyway, with Frogloks becoming playable, one would have hoped that they could be Shadow Knights, but nooooooo, they all have to worship Mithaniel Marr and be "good".  They're even liked in the good cities.  If this apalls you as much as it does me, send them an e-mail and demand your right to play as a Froglok Shadow Knight.<br><div align='right'>--Rozzl Grimtouch<br>The Seventh Hammer</div><br><hr><br><B>January 10, 2003</b><br>Hey everyboddy. (Hi Dr. Rozz)  Not much going on in the ShadowKnight world.  However, if you play EverQuest, or any other MMORPG (which I assume you do or I can't imagine why you would look at this site), Nick Yee has been doing some good research on MMORPGs.  If you've taken some of his surveys before, then you know what I'm talking about.  I strongly encourage you to participate in these studies as they're probably the most reliable source for MMORPG players habits available.  If you'd like to participate, two new surveys are available at <a href="http://www.nickyee.com/mmorpg/main.html">this link</a>.<br><div align='right'>--Rozzl Grimtouch<br>The Seventh Hammer</div><br><hr><br><B>January 8, 2003</b><br>E-mail update.  OK, I figured it out.  I finally got around to checking the mailbox for viruses and (it's a good thing for the protection built in) because the reason it appears I couldn't get at those e-mail was because they contain viruses, and it was protecting me (what a sweet service).  Anyway, if you sent me an e-mail in the past couple weeks, and I didn't respond to you, you have a virus, whether you know it or not.  I would recommend scanning your system.  If you do not have virus protection software, I would strongly recommend running <a href="http://housecall.antivirus.com/housecall/start_corp.asp">HouseCall Antivirus</a> to scan your system on a regular basis.  However, if you're looking at this site, you are probably online at least a chunk of your time, and probably download plenty of things as well.  Get some protection, people.<br><div align='right'>--Rozzl Grimtouch<br>The Seventh Hammer</div><br><hr><br><B>January 7, 2003</b><br>Quick note on e-mails sent to me.  For some reason, about 1/3 or the e-mails that I get won't open.  I'm not sure if there is something wrong with the e-mail itself, but it seems unlikely since it's so frequent.  More than likely it's a problem with my mail host.  Anyway, I apologize if you asked me a question and I haven't answered it, if that's happened, it's probably because I couldn't open your e-mail, try sending me another one.<br><div align='right'>--Rozzl Grimtouch<br>The Seventh Hammer</div><br><hr><br><B>December 31, 2002</b><br>Happy New Year everyone.  I added a few Plane of Knowledge quests today.<br>
<br>
On a side note, mainly for those of you newish to the site.  This site sprung up some 3 years after the game was released, so it's nowhere near as complete as some other class specific sites.  When I started it, I only intended it to be a good place to come for information on the SK epic, including the checklist and fast-track walkthrough.  Since then, I've added a bunch of articles and other things about Shadow Knights.<br>
<Br>
The quests I have aren't original unpublished quests.  They're all easily found other places, but I have them here as an easy place to find quests that relate to the class at certain levels so you don't have to go searching through many areas to find a good quest for you.  I also have tried to make them as complete as possible answering questions that were asked in message boards in other places.<br>
<Br>
Anyway, you probably didn't even read this much, so I'll just say Happy New Year again and walk away silently.<br><div align='right'>--Rozzl Grimtouch<br>The Seventh Hammer</div><br><hr><br><B>December 30, 2002</b><br>Dropped in a few more quests today, ironically enough, I added several Coldain and several Frost Giant quests...  take your pick, but I recommend killing dwarves...  They make the most delightful little sounds when they die.<br><div align='right'>--Rozzl Grimtouch<br>The Seventh Hammer</div><br><hr><br><B>December 29, 2002</b><br>Just back from vacation, made a few corrections to a couple articles thanks to user submissions (Thanks guys).<br><div align='right'>--Rozzl Grimtouch<br>The Seventh Hammer</div><br><hr><br><B>December 19, 2002</b><br>I compiled a quick and dirty list of all the skill caps I was fairly confident of, and took guesses at the ones I was fairly confident I could guess.  If you know I'm right or wrong in any of the places where I guessed, or know one of the caps I didn't even bother to guess at, please let me know the correct value and I'll update it accordingly.<br><div align='right'>--Rozzl Grimtouch<br>The Seventh Hammer</div><br><hr><br><B>December 18, 2002</b><br>It recently came to my attention that there is not an accurate list of Shadowknight skills with skill caps anywhere on the web.  The list on CastersRealm is nice, but rather out of date.  Unfortunately, I don't have a complete list of this information myself.  I'm going to start trying to compile a list of these skills, but need your help.  Particularly for the weapon skills I need help as I have not bothered with most of them.<br>
<br>
If you know a skill cap for any skill for level 50, 60, or 65.  Please send me a note with the skill and the skill cap and which level (50, 60, or 65...  I don't need to know the cap for 1 hand blunt at level 32) and I'll work on compiling a complete reference.  Meanwhile, in a week or two I'll try to put up the ones I know with blanks in the spots I'm not certain about.<br>
<br>
If you have any information about the way skills (or even Harm Touch damage) scale above 60, I would appreciate that as well.  Thanks.<br><div align='right'>--Rozzl Grimtouch<br>The Seventh Hammer</div><br><hr><br><B>December 10, 2002</b><br>Most of the time I'm playing I forget I even have disciplines, and realized, I wasn't entirely sure what they all did.  Granted, that was before I was level 51, but after I got resistant and used it a few times, I forgot all about it.  Fast forward.  After I hit 54, I didn't even remember I had a new discipline until almost a bubble into the level.  Unfortunately, it's a damn worthless discipline that should have been given to wizards or something, but it's still a discipline.  Anyway, my point is that I put up a quick description of all the disciplines along with a little insight into them.  Enjoy.<br><div align='right'>--Rozzl Grimtouch<br>The Seventh Hammer</div><br><hr><br><B>December 4, 2002</b><br>Only want to make a quick point today...  If you have questions, I'd be glad to answer them, just tap me out a quick e-mail.  However, if there's an attachment on the e-mail, I'm not even going to read the message.  Especially if the attachment is...  say...  an executable.  I don't know how stupid you think I am just because I'm a Troll, unfortunately, because of my untrusting nature, this means that even if you have a graphic in your signature, I probably won't read your e-mail.  It's not that I don't trust you, just that I don't trust my virus software.<br><div align='right'>--Rozzl Grimtouch<br>The Seventh Hammer</div><br><hr><br><B>November 30, 2002</b><br>Happy late Thanksgiving.  I added poor descriptions of the Thurgadin Quest armor.  Someday I'll put it on the armor sets.  However, I'd like to point out that this is Shadow Knight "sell-out" armor.  Dwarves worship things like Brell Serillis...  Don't waste your time with these fellows, besides, they make the most delightful sounds when they die.<br><div align='right'>--Rozzl Grimtouch<br>The Seventh Hammer</div><br><hr><br><B>November 26, 2002</b><br>I hate you Kenny.  More armor.<br><div align='right'>--Rozzl Grimtouch<br>The Seventh Hammer</div><br><hr><br><B>November 25, 2002</b><br>I don't really have anything to say here, and haven't added anything to the site in a couple days.  I just wanted to point out to all you first time Shadow Knights that you've picked a tough class.  If I had a nickel for everytime I heard "Alright, now all we need to do is find a Shadow Knight and we can get this raid started," well, let's just say I wouldn't be a rich man.<br><div align='right'>--Rozzl Grimtouch<br>The Seventh Hammer</div><br><hr><br><B>November 23, 2002</b><br>Added some Frequently Asked Questions.  If you have other relevant questions, please e-mail them to me and I'll add them to the FAQ.  Also, there's one new quest to get faction with Iksars.  Hope that's enough for today, I want to go enjoy my weekend now.<br><div align='right'>--Rozzl Grimtouch<br>The Seventh Hammer</div><br><hr><br><B>November 21, 2002</b><br>Alright, today's update is not really directly related to Shadow Knights.  But it's my site and I'll do what I want.  If I want to rename it the Beastlord den and put pictures of cutesy animals up, then by golly, I will.<br>
<br>
Good thing I don't want to do that.  Instead, I took a look at the Sleeper.  Despite having made the realization rather early, that I would never enter this zone, the Sleeper, being the most powerful being on Norrath (so far) interested me.  Over the past year or so, many things have happened, lore was released, and the Sleeper became Kerafyrm.  Well, over time, Lore has become distorted and I've realized that for the most part, people don't know anything about the Sleeper, and what they do know is at least partially wrong.<br>

So I've put together a somewhat comprehensive summary based on: what I remember, what came from Sony, and what I was able to research about it.  I'm fairly confident of the accuracy of most of my facts, and it was quite a chore to filter out all the crap other people have assumed about the Sleeper and tried to pass off as true because they heard it fifth hand.  Anyway, the link is under articles.<br><div align='right'>--Rozzl Grimtouch<br>The Seventh Hammer</div><br><hr><br><B>November 19, 2002</b><br>I've gotten a lot of requests for a guide to using Harm Touch.  And by a lot, I mean somewhere between 0 and 10, I'm not saying exactly.  So there it is.  On the left.  Under skills.  Gad damnit, do I have to hold your hand?  I know, I know.  It's kind of worthless, but I hadn't seen anywhere that actually spelled out how much damage Harm Touch did at different levels, and until I got above, 40, I didn't even know there was a bonus.  Also it can be confusing with so many things that affect Harm Touch (1 discipline and 2 AA skills) so I threw in a quick explanation of those along with my suggestion as to what you should be doing with them.  There are a lot of quests coming up as well as more armor sets and skill guides to AA and disciplines.  I'm busy though, don't rush me.<br><div align='right'>--Rozzl Grimtouch<br>The Seventh Hammer</div><br><hr><br><B>November 18, 2002</b><br>Dark Elf newbie quests are there.  Expect other races soon.  Maybe I'll add them to the armor sets someday too.<br><div align='right'>--Rozzl Grimtouch<br>The Seventh Hammer</div><br><hr><br><B>November 17, 2002</b><br>Started collecting information on armor sets, which basically means there's a link (under articles) and one armor set from which I can build off of.  If you don't like it...  go worship Tunare.<br><div align='right'>--Rozzl Grimtouch<br>The Seventh Hammer</div><br><hr><br><B>November 16, 2002</b><br>Fixing some behind the scenes stuff now and working on some updates for later this week.  I also added some more of the Darkforge armor quests (though the text is the same, I added where to find the drops needed for the other pieces).<br><div align='right'>--Rozzl Grimtouch<br>The Seventh Hammer</div><br><hr><br><B>November 14, 2002</b><br>OK, I quit playing awhile ago, and obviously quit updating the site.  I have started playing again though, and may start updating the site (my first piece of fan mail made me realize someone out there likes me).<br>When I originally created this site, it was designed to just be a good place to come for information regarding the epic.  I then got ambitious, added a few articles and even some quests.  Well, long story short, I'm lazy.  Got out of the game, got out of the site.  If I can muster the fortitude, I hope to add at least lists of armor sets and a few more quests.  Feel free to e-mail me if there's something you think should be added.  I probably won't add it, but if it makes you feel better to tell me, then more power to you.  And who knows, maybe someday, somehow, I will.  Meanwhile, there's one new quest in there for you today just to show you I'm serious.<br><div align='right'>--Rozzl Grimtouch<br>The Seventh Hammer</div><br><hr><br><B>May 18, 2002</b><br>Haven't added much recently.  Have some stuff to add, but lack the time to do it in.  I did finally post a link to some spells, but if you're here, you probably already know about that.<br><div align='right'>--Rozzl Grimtouch<br>The Seventh Hammer</div><br><hr><br><B>April 17, 2002</b><br>Got the quest database set up, only one quest in it now, but it's a pretty good one.  This will only hold quests which are beneficial to Shadowknights.  If you want general quests, go somewhere else.  You're probably a Paladin anyway<br><div align='right'>--Rozzl Grimtouch<br>The Seventh Hammer</div><br><hr><br><B>April 16, 2002</b><br>I have a database now, my hit counter works, and more to come.<br><div align='right'>--Rozzl Grimtouch<br>The Seventh Hammer</div><br><hr><br><B>March 29, 2002</b><br>Updated the table on Charisma's effect of Fear<br><br><div align='right'>--Rozzl Grimtouch<br>The Seventh Hammer</div><br><hr><br><B>March 28, 2002</b><br>I added some starting info...  Statistics, stuff you need to know, and where to fight 
for a little while for each race.  Click on the link under Articles or just click <a 
href="http://www.albrandes.com/skden/articles/starting.asp">here</a>.<br><br><div align='right'>--Rozzl Grimtouch<br>The Seventh Hammer</div><br><hr><br><B>March 25, 2002</b><br>You can now <a href="mailto:rozzl@albrandes.com">contact me</a> with feedback...  or 
anything else really.  I've gotten tons of requests to finish the site (and I'm working on 
it) but right now my computer is kind of crapping out on me and I don't have any database 
software, so you'll just have to wait.<br><br><div align='right'>--Rozzl Grimtouch<br>The Seventh Hammer</div><br><hr><br><B>March 20, 2002</b><br>Ok, slow progress.  Everything is more dynamic now...  using ASP for the menus and 
most pages so adding content should be a bit easier from here on out.  Once I get organized 
more I'll start adding spells, starting stuff and other random stuff that I find in other 
places but needs to be compiled for the Shadowknight community.<br><br><div align='right'>--Rozzl Grimtouch<br>The Seventh Hammer</div><br><hr><br><B>March 17, 2002</b><br>      Here it is...  The Shadowknight Den.  I'm designing this site primarily because I 
haven't found a good site for Shadowknights that exclusively dealt with relevant information 
for them.<br>
      This is just the first release, and I plan on making significant upgrades over the 
next few months.  Eventually I'll get around to setting up a database and making these pages 
more dynamic instead of this pure HTML.  Here are some of the things that will sooner or 
later be added:<br>
      <ul>
       <li>Spells listing with random details</li>
       <li>That's it...  that's all I have planned for now.</li>
       <li>First step is to develop the database though</li>
       <li>Stop reading now, I'm just mumbling</li>
