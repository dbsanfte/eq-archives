Before you start this quest, you should have retrieved a <a href="showitem.asp?file=WhiteGoldNecklace">White Gold Necklace</a> from the Froglok Noble on the live side of Lower Guk, a <a href="showitem.asp?file=CrystallineOrb">Crystalline Orb</a> from the Stone Spider in Nagafen's Lair, and a <a href="showitem.asp?file=PricklyPear">Prickly Pear</a> from the icy terrors outside of Vox's lair in Permafrost Keep<br><br>You say, 'Hail, Kazzel D`Leryt'<br><br>Kazzel D`Leryt says 'Finally, a servant worthy of my needs!  Apparently you are of high status, which perhaps means you might know a master [jeweler] capable of faceting a very magical, yet fragile stone? '<br><br>You say, 'What master jeweler'<br><br>Kazzel D`Leryt says 'You must provide me with 2000 platinum pieces as a deposit, then you must take this stone to a master jeweler or [Darfumpel], have it faceted and return it to me along with an orb of pure crystal, a gold necklace the color of snow, and the [blood of Xenyari].  Do that and I will provide you with magic beyond that of most knights of darkness. '<br><br>You say, 'Who is <a href="showitem.asp?file=Darfumpel">Darfumpel</a>?'<br><br>Kazzel D`Leryt says 'Darfumpel is a gnomish shopkeeper here in the Rathe Mountains.  He apparently has a new technique for gemcutting, however, he will not deal with me due to my affiliation with necromancy.  Speak with him.  Perhaps he might be willing to aid you for a price, but make sure you hide your true nature.  He despises dark magic. '<br><br>You say, 'What blood of <a href="showitem.asp?file=Xenyari">Xenyari</a>?'<br><br>Kazzel D`Leryt says 'Xenyari is a druid who inhabits these parts.  She is rarely seen, however, I require a droplet of her blood.  Here is the catch though, and one for which you may be well suited if you desire magic of the knights of darkness -  Xenyari must give of herself willingly.  In other words, you cannot take her blood by force.  Rather, she must give you her blood of her own accord. '<br><br>Give Kazzel 2000 platinum.  Receive an <a href="showitem.asp?file=UncutHyacinth">uncut hyacinth</a><br><br>Kazzel D`Leryt says 'Very well, Rozzl.  Take this gem to a master jeweler and return it to me with the other three items. '<br><br>I forgot to log the rest<br><br>Find Darfumpel in a hut near the zone to Lake Rathe.  Hand him 1000 platinum and the uncut hyacinth Kazzel gave you.  Receive a <a href="showitem.asp?file=FacetedHyacinth">faceted hyacinth</a><br><br>Find Xenyari in the unkempt druid rings north of the hut with Darfumpel and give her a prickly pear.  Receive a <a href="showitem.asp?file=BloodiedParchment">bloodied parchment</a><br><br>Return to Kazzel with the faceted hyacinth, bloodied parchment, white gold necklace, and Crystalline Orb.  He thanks you and hands you a <a href="showitem.asp?file=FacetedTelesm">Faceted Hyacinth Telesm</a>.<br><Br>Go back to Xenyari with the Telesm.  Xenyari Lisariel bounces around with glee at the sight of your gift, smiles at you, and dons the telesm.  As she clasps the telesm around her neck, she begins to writhe in agony, and slowly fades from sight leaving just the telesm, which is now pulsating with vibrant energy.  Receive a <a href="showitem.asp?file=PulsatingTelesm">Pulsating Hyacinth Telesm</a><br><br>Return to Kazzel.  Make sure you have at least one group all members above 50 including at least one cleric.  This will prove a difficult fight with these forces, so it is recommended you have at least 8 people before turning in the Telesm.<br><Br>When you hand Kazzel the Telesm, a level 53 <a href="showitem.asp?file=MonstrousZombie">Monstrous Zombie</a> spawns on top of him.  This creature summons, hits in the 170's and is undead.  I must have tried to cast fear type spells over 20 times and it was resisted every time, so don't count on that tactic.  He has approximately 8,000 hit points.  After you kill him, loot the <a href="showitem.asp?file=MonstrousZombieHeart">monstrous zombie heart</a><br><br>Return the heart to Kazzel and receive your Life Leech spell.  NOTE: He despawns as soon as you hand him the heart, but immediately respawns at his spawn point.  If you have multiple people completing the quest, it can be done<br><br><br>
