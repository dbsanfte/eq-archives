<h2><div align="center">Lost Dungeons of Norrath Lore</div></h2>

Here I am attemptint to chronicle the information imparted by the Wayfarer's Brotherhood for various levels of service at each of the different camps.  If you have a log from one of the camps that I do not, please send it to me and I will add it to the list.

<h3>Takish'Hiz</h3>
2 - (forgot to log)<br>
<br>
4 - Ruanya Windleaf says 'I apologize for my depressed mood the last time we spoke Trebla. I am ready to begin the story of my ancestors now. The tale begins soon after the planet of Norrath began its journey around the sun, called Sol. Our fair mother of the Plane of Growth, Tunare, put the first intelligent beings on Norrath, the elves. About the same time, Brell Serilis of the Plane of Underfoot created the dwarves who dwelled inside the very crust of Norrath. Then, Prexus, the Ocean Lord, created the Kedge to rule the oceanic depths of the world. Around that time, Veeshan claimed the skies, Tunare the surface lands, Brell the underground and Prexus the seas. It wasn't that simple really, but it will have to wait. I must practice my archery now, friend. I need to be prepared for exploration and battle at all times.'<br>
<br>
6 - Ruanya Windleaf says 'You have returned in good time, Trebla. I am between tasks at the moment, but I will need to do more scouting of Takish-Hiz shortly. I wanted to tell you about a critical turning point earlier in our history. There was a time when the lands of Norrath were split amongst the gods so they would have true homes for their creations. Tunare and Solusek Ro, the Prince of Flame, both wanted to claim the Elddar Forest as their own. There was no settlement though, Tunare simply acted more quickly. As I will tell you soon, Solusek Ro took exception to Tunare's hasty creation of the elves. I must continue with my scouting now.'<br>
<br>
8 - Ruanya Windleaf beams with pride, her upturned eyes brightly greeting you. 'Ha, I beat my companion Escon Quickbow in an archery competition. Grand day! Yes, I have more information for you about Solusek Ro. The Prince of Flame watched the elves quietly build and live without conflict for thousands of years. Takish-Hiz was built out of wood and marble with much skill and beauty. It was so striking and bright the gods could see it glow from a great distance. Solusek Ro became envious and angry at Tunare and her creations. In fact, his vengeful acts brought ruin to the elves of Takish-Hiz.'<br>

2 - Barstre Songweaver says 'Bah, you made me miss a note! No matter. I've been interrupted a lot lately with all the inquiries I get! I've been collecting stories and information from all over these days. I fancy myself a bit of a historian now when it comes to the goblins and orcs. It's important to understand the history of both of those creatures to understand what is happening in the Rujarkian Hills. That's my opinion, anyway. Those are no ordinary orcs in the hills. See me soon and I will have a tale or two for you.'<br>
