<h2><div align="center">Lost Dungeons of Norrath Lore</div></h2>

Here I am attempting to chronicle the information imparted by the Wayfarer's Brotherhood for various levels of service at each of the different camps.  If you have a log from one of the camps that I do not, please send it to me and I will add it to the list.<br>
<br>
To begin your quest, you must first talk to a Wayfarer in your hometown, after you've talked to them, they will send you to the wilds.  You will meet a leader at any of the five camps.  Once you answer their questions, you can begin your adventure.<br>
<br>
You say, 'Hail, Vual Stoutest'<br>
Vual Stoutest says 'Welcome stranger. I'm afraid you must answer some questions before I can consider opening our wealth of skill and knowledge to you. First, what does the Wayfarers Brotherhood call the tasks they will ask you to do for them?'<br>
<br>
You say, 'Adventures'<br>
You have completed a step toward becoming a great adventurer. Well done!<br>
Vual Stoutest says 'We will reward based on your improving position with the Wayfarers Brotherhood. We keep a certain type of log that records how often and well you help us. What is it called?'<br>
<br>
You say, 'Favor Journal'<br>
You have completed a step toward becoming a great adventurer. Well done!<br>
Vual Stoutest says 'Who discovered that some treasures have strange magical properties by poking one with his dagger?'<br>
<br>
You say, 'Morden Rasp'<br>
You have completed a step toward becoming a great adventurer. Well done!<br>
Vual Stoutest says 'Our brilliant magi use a special kind of magic to help teleport us between camps. What is it called?'<br>
<br>
You say, 'Farstone magic'<br>
Vual Stoutest says 'Congratulations! I believe now that you are trustworthy enough to take on some of the adventures the Wayfarers Brotherhood have to give.  We will be able to continue with our discussions once you complete some adventures. We can also help you with travel between our camps. Be well, fair Draffer. I'm sure, someday, you will be a great addition to the Wayfarers Brotherhood.'<br>
You have completed a step toward becoming a great adventurer. Well done!<br>
Your faction standing with Wayfarers Brotherhood got better.<br>
Vual Stoutest says 'Take this Adventurer Stone with you on your journeys into the dungeons. You will find it useful.  Should you lose it somehow, come talk to me and I'll replace it.'<br>
<br>
Now your quest begins.  Each of the five themes has their own unique history which I give you here.

<h3>Takish'Hiz</h3>
0 - Ruanya Windleaf says 'My ancestors have been trapped under the sands for many, many years, so many I believe they've forgotten where they came from. I would tell you more, but you would need to do a few favors for the Wayfarers Brotherhood.'<br>
<br>
2 - Ruanya Windleaf says 'I must tell you, I'm a little saddened by the fate of the elves in Takish-Hiz. By all accounts, that city once held such great splendor and beauty. Now it is such a menacing place. It does torment me some that I cannot walk amongst the echoes of my ancestors without fear. I'm so glad that you've come to hear the story though. I'm feeling somewhat morose at the moment, but I'd be glad to start this long tale another time.'<br>
<br>
4 - Ruanya Windleaf says 'I apologize for my depressed mood the last time we spoke Trebla. I am ready to begin the story of my ancestors now. The tale begins soon after the planet of Norrath began its journey around the sun, called Sol. Our fair mother of the Plane of Growth, Tunare, put the first intelligent beings on Norrath, the elves. About the same time, Brell Serilis of the Plane of Underfoot created the dwarves who dwelled inside the very crust of Norrath. Then, Prexus, the Ocean Lord, created the Kedge to rule the oceanic depths of the world. Around that time, Veeshan claimed the skies, Tunare the surface lands, Brell the underground and Prexus the seas. It wasn't that simple really, but it will have to wait. I must practice my archery now, friend. I need to be prepared for exploration and battle at all times.'<br>
<br>
6 - Ruanya Windleaf says 'You have returned in good time, Trebla. I am between tasks at the moment, but I will need to do more scouting of Takish-Hiz shortly. I wanted to tell you about a critical turning point earlier in our history. There was a time when the lands of Norrath were split amongst the gods so they would have true homes for their creations. Tunare and Solusek Ro, the Prince of Flame, both wanted to claim the Elddar Forest as their own. There was no settlement though, Tunare simply acted more quickly. As I will tell you soon, Solusek Ro took exception to Tunare's hasty creation of the elves. I must continue with my scouting now.'<br>
<br>
8 - Ruanya Windleaf beams with pride, her upturned eyes brightly greeting you. 'Ha, I beat my companion Escon Quickbow in an archery competition. Grand day! Yes, I have more information for you about Solusek Ro. The Prince of Flame watched the elves quietly build and live without conflict for thousands of years. Takish-Hiz was built out of wood and marble with much skill and beauty. It was so striking and bright the gods could see it glow from a great distance. Solusek Ro became envious and angry at Tunare and her creations. In fact, his vengeful acts brought ruin to the elves of Takish-Hiz.'<br>
<br>
10 - Ruanya Windleaf says 'Quickly now, Trebla. I have spotted some tracks nearby I do not want to lose. I just came back to the camp for supplies. Solusek Ro reached down to Antonica with his fiery touch and arched the spine of the world. The geographical act would be slow and not draw attention to his actions. He then called upon the power of the Ro, the sun. The sun began to dry the forest. Now,  I really must go. I don't want to lose the tracks I found.'<Br>

<h3>Mistmoore Catacombs</h3>
0 - Vual Stoutest says 'Ever seen a vampire bare its fangs right in your face?! Darned excitin' I gotta say. But there's so much more to Mistmoore's Catacombs than just vampires. If you help the Wayfarers Brotherhood some, I'll fill ya in.'<br>
<br>
2 - Vual Stoutest says 'Greetings. I've been sent here to keep watch over what transpires in Mistmoore's Catacombs. I'm sure you know already that the Wayfarers Brotherhood are spread far and wide across Norrath. Morden Rasp, our leader if you didn't know, asked me to be a bit wary of those we're not chums with. Sorry to say you don't look familiar to me. If you manage to do a few jobs for us, though, I may be able to provide you with some information I have about Mistmoore's Catacombs. Xyzelauna Tu`Valzir may have some work you can do.'<br>

<h3>Deepest Guk</h3>
0 - Selephra Giztral says 'The curse in Deepest Guk is incredibly strong. It's interesting how Deepest Guk came to be like it is today. If you manage to do some work for us, I will share the story with you!'<br>
<br>
2 - Selephra Giztral says 'Ahem, sorry. I had a fly stuck in my throat. By the looks of you, I'd say you're an adventurous spirit. Unfortunately, many similar spirits have been lost in that slimy place we now call Deepest Guk. In fact, those who have been overcome by the curse that creeps in there have lost their very souls. I'm hoping the next time we talk I'll have more information for you. Take care, most-promising hero.'<br>

<h3>Miragul's Menagerie</h3>
0 - Teria Grinntli says 'You must be of some assistance to the Wayfarers Brotherhood before I will reveal my knowledge about Miragul's Menagerie. It is so strange a place that only the most trusted can be given its background. Our information might give some the knowledge to overcome the state of chaos in there.'<br>
<br>
2 - Teria Grinntli says 'Can you believe it's true? Miragul's Menagerie has been found. I remember all the stories I heard after I came to Norrath from Luclin, but the ones that really captured my attention were those about Miragul. Even though I enjoyed the mystery around the tales, I couldn't be more thrilled to actually set foot in that world of madness. I will share the stories with you.'<Br>
<br>
4 - Teria Grinntli purrs as she looks at you with piercing feline eyes. 'It is so wonderful to see you again. I remember hearing that under the tundra of the Frigid Plain there was a network of tunnels and rooms that were known as Miragul's Menagerie. Now that we've found it, it's a far stranger place than the stories suggested. To start at the beginning, I should say that Miragul was once a prominent member of the Council of Erud and was a student of all the schools of magic available there. If you knew that we've got a good starting point to continue our meetings. We'll pick up from there when you return to me.'<br>

<h3>Rujarkian Hills</h3>
0 - Barstre Songweaver says 'Greetings, Draffer. I always have a story to tell, but I've been consumed with learning about the Rujarkian Hills. If you do enough work for us in those hills, I can share some of my knowledge with you!'<br>
<br>
2 - Barstre Songweaver says 'Bah, you made me miss a note! No matter. I've been interrupted a lot lately with all the inquiries I get! I've been collecting stories and information from all over these days. I fancy myself a bit of a historian now when it comes to the goblins and orcs. It's important to understand the history of both of those creatures to understand what is happening in the Rujarkian Hills. That's my opinion, anyway. Those are no ordinary orcs in the hills. See me soon and I will have a tale or two for you.'<br>
<Br>
4 - Barstre Songweaver says 'Wonderful to see you, Draffer! I always enjoy telling a story to a fellow explorer. Let's start with the goblins and the orcs and where they came from, shall we? To start with, you should know that the hero that was considered the mother of all of the goblins was named Rujark. Her name is about the only thing the goblins of Norrath can agree upon. Obviously, the hills over yonder once belonged to Rujark's goblins, but they do not anymore. That's all I will divulge for now!'<br>
<br>
6 - Barstre Songweaver says 'Perfect timing. I just put down my lute. Did you know the orcs were created by Rallos-Zek? Oh yes! They were bred for battle. Mighty creatures indeed and very determined. They rely on slaves, whether they be orcs or other creatures. Each orc seemingly belongs to another! Return soon for more Draffer. I'm sure we will spend a lot of time together!'
