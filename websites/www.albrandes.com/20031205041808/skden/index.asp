<!----------------------------><B>November 18, 2003</b><br>It seems the Sleeper was finally killed.  Sometime last night a conglomeration of folk on Rallos Zek managed to do it.  This isn't exactly new since it's sprung up almost everywhere.  Now I get to change all my crap to reflect this.<br><div align='right'>--Rozzl Grimtouch<br>The Seventh Hammer</div><br><hr><br><B>November 3, 2003</b><br>Finally found the in game text from Skyshrine talking about Kerafyrm's creation and the war on the dragons.  I added it to the bottom of <a href="/skden/articles/sleeper.asp">The Sleeper page</a>.<br><div align='right'>--Rozzl Grimtouch<br>The Seventh Hammer</div><br><hr><br><B>October 5, 2003</b><br>I am interested in Lore.  One thing in the game that I find to be worth reading.  I've chronicled as much Sleeper's lore as I could find, and always enjoy reading the history of Norrath.  In such, I am starting to chronicle <a href="/skden/articles/ldon.asp">The Lost Dungeons of Norrath lore</a>.  I'm trying to remember to log information everytime I get new text from the wayfarer's.  If you know anything that I don't have logged, please send it to me.  Include which theme, and how many adventures you completed to get that piece of lore.  Thanks and enjoy.<br><div align='right'>--Rozzl Grimtouch<br>The Seventh Hammer</div><br><hr><br><B>September 26, 2003</b><br>I decided that it would be interesting to know who woke the Sleeper on each server, and what date.  I added a section about that to the beginning of the <a href="http://www.albrandes.com/skden/articles/sleeper.asp">Sleeper page</a> and filled in the ones I knew off the top of my head.  If anyone is interested, and you know who woke Kerafyrm on your server, e-mail me if you feel like it at <a href="mailto:rozzl@albrandes.com">rozzl@albrandes.com</a> and let me know the guild, and if you can, the date.  At the very least, please send me a link to their website so I can research it a bit too.  Meanwhile, hope someone finds it interesting.<br><div align='right'>--Rozzl Grimtouch<br>The Seventh Hammer</div><br><hr><br><B>August 5, 2003</b><br>I don't usually editorialize, and this is significantly off topic for Shadow Knights, but since about a third of the hits this site gets are for the Sleeper page anyway...<br>
<br>
There's been a bit of a furor over the waking of the Sleeper on Xev.  I believe this only leaves the Sleeper asleep on a handful of servers, the only one of which I know is Stromm (newbie) server.  I am now going to be circuitous and hard to follow for a little while.<br>
<br>
Many message boards have "flamed" (for lack of a better term) Hawkestone as being selfish bastards who have ruined the server by waking the Sleeper.  In reality, they have changed 0.5% (or less) of the content of the server.  And the value of that change is not so negative as it once was (before the Tomb's revamp) so the change is not that big a deal.  So Shrouds of Longevity are not there...  ok, that's probably the worst thing to come out of this.  That is not a good argument for disapproval of the event.<br>
<br>
Now new people to Sleeper's Tomb will not be able to see the Sleeper.  True, and this is a shame, but one of the more common bashes I've seen was that "You did this, now I'll never be able to" in nature.  A bit hypocritical don't you think?  Criticizing Hawkestone for destroying an event just because you wanted to destroy it.  This shows that the critcizer's intentions were to be selfish and run the event.  What Hawkestone's goals were is unclear (to me, at least).  That is not a good argument for disapproval of the event.<br>
<br>
They've ruined one more of the few remaining chances <i>anybody</i> will ever have to kill the Sleeper.  Surprisingly, I haven't seen this argument made yet, and as I can see, it's the most valid of any argument.  By waking the Sleeper with a force of 30-40 (as I've heard it, I do not claim this to be an accurate number) players they doomed themselves to defeat.  If the decision had been a conscious one by Hawkestone to wake the Sleeper, it should have included other high end guilds in this decision, and put forth a coordinated effort to actually kill him.  Had there been...  say 120-150 people equipped in PoP and Vex Thal gear, then there would have been at least a decent chance of winning.  Now I realize, it's difficult to get that many people coordinated even when they are all in the same guild, and 3 or 4 guilds working together on an event like this is unheard of, but only 30 people caused the event to be a complete waste.<br>
<br>
Anyway, hate Hawkestone all you want, I'm sure in your eyes, your reasons are just as good as any I can offer to support or counter your feelings.  My only hope is that on any remaining servers, that there can be an "alliance"...  if just for a few hours...  if only to say "I was there when the Sleeper hit 50% health".<br><div align='right'>--Rozzl Grimtouch<br>The Seventh Hammer</div><br><hr><br><!-------------------------------->
