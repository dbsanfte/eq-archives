This is the fourth part in the ten part series of Coldain Ring Quests.  You do not have to do any of the earlier parts in order to do this entire part, except for the turn in at the end.  This one you will need a group, or at least a strong partner to do.<br>
<br>
After you receive your Gold Insignia Ring, Garadain asks you for a hammer to smith the dagger with.  In order to get this, you must find Tain Hammerfrost.  He is very easy to find, and is usually spawned.  When you come from Iceclad Ocean, he is over the first snowy mound and a little bit to the south.  Were it not for the mound you just crossed, you'd still be able to see the bridge from where he is.<br>
<br>
When you find him and hail him, he says something about needing your [help] because the giants are almost upon him.<br>
<br>
You say, 'I will help you'<br>
<br>
He says some drivel about them being almost upon you.  Immediately, 4 giants between level 43 and 45 spawn over the hill towards the bridge and start charging towards Tain.  You can let him die, then kill the giants, but you'll have to wait for him to respawn to turn in the vial from their leader, Ghrek Squatnot.<br>
<br>
Depending on the strength of your group, there are many different strategies for this.  Probably the safest is to have someone draw aggro from all of them and kite them around, then your group will pull them off one at a time to kill them.<Br>
The only one you need to kill is Ghrek, once you kill him, loot the vial from him and give it to Tain.  If Tain died, you must wait for him to respawn (reported to be 6 hours, but in my experience was only about an hour) and tell him you will help again.  Then turn in the vial and get away from him before the giants get to you.<Br>
<br>
When you give him the vial, he will give you the hammer.  Take the Hammer and your Gold ring back to Garadain and he will give you the Platinum Coldain Insignia Ring.  This is the first ring that you <i>might</i> consider replacing some of your jewelry with, depending on the quality of your jewelry.<br>
