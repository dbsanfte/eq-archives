Here's an item no Shadow Knight should be without.  These boots may not have good stats, but the effect is the cat's ass.  They are a right click, instant casting movement speed buff.  They won't make you run as fast as Spirit of the Wolf, but if you're trying to outdistance that Spiroc in Timorous Deep, throw these things on, click 'em, and you'll be tearing up the shores.<br>
<Br>
Start by finding Hasten Bootstrutter in the Rathe Mountains (South of Southern Plains of Karana).  First you have to catch him, because he runs very fast, then hail him to stop him from running.  If Brother Zephyl is in the zone, then you will not be able to find Hasten because once when they were younger, Hasten stepped on Zephyl's robe, and Zephyl holds a grudge.<br>
<br>
Anyway, once you find Hasten Bootstrutter, he will ask for three things: a) A Ring of the Ancients  2) A Shadowed Rapier and d) 3,250 pieces of gold.<br>
<br>
Several things to note.  The Shadowed Rapier (which can be found from Shadowed Men in many zones) is NO RENT and will disappear when you log off.  The 3,250 pieces of gold must be gold.  Do not give him 325 platinum pieces or 32,500 silver pieces.  Give him gold.<br>
<br>
The only really difficult piece to get is the Ring of the Ancients.  This can be found in several places on an Ancient Cyclops.  In Southern Desert of Ro is the most common place to find him.  If you constantly kill everything in the desert portion of the zone, you can expect the Ancient Cyclops to appear about once every two to four hours.  However, everyone wants to kill him and you might have to fight for him.  The other popular place is in the Ocean of Tears.  Here he will appear on the same island as the magician selling spells.  Since this is a static spawn (only one spawn point on the island) you probably will not get him stolen from you here.  If you camp here you can expect him to pop about once every six to 24 hours.  Occasionally he will show up in the Karanas.  This is very rare though and isn't worth the time to look for him.<br>
<br>
Once you have all the parts, go back to Rathe Mountains and find Hasten again.  Give him all the pieces and he will give you the boots.  They have 1 AC and no stats, but the effect is where the money is.<br>
<br>
NOTE: This quest can be multi-quested.  (i.e.  Have one person hand Hasten the NO DROP ring, then have the person who wants the boots hand him the rapier and the gold.)<br>
