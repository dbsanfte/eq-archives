<h2>Guide to Shadow Knight Disciplines</h2> 
<h3>What they are, when to use them</h3>
</div> 

<div align="left">
Note: You must have Velious registered on your account before you can use any disciplines.<Br>
<h3>Level 51: Resistant</h3>
Duration: 5 minutes<br>
Affect: Adds 10 points to all resistances<br>
Re-use: 60 minutes (decreases by one minute per level)<br>
Resistant is the first discipline you get, and it's borderline useless.  The only time you'll use this discipline is when you're on a major raid or on a minor raid.  Either way, it only works against casters.  Most of the time though, the 10 points it adds to all resistances really won't affect your performance that much for the 5 minutes every hour you can use it.  But by all means, it's your first one, so go crazy.<Br>
<br>
<h3>Level 54: Fearless</h3>
Duration: 11 seconds<br>
Affect: Makes you immune to Fear for the Duration<br>
Re-use: 60 minutes (decreases by one minute per level)<Br>
The Fearless discipline is another borderline useless discipline.  Since it only lasts for 11 seconds, it won't even last for an entire raid style encounter.  And when you get to level 59, one of the first things you should do is put AA points into the Fearless skill, as being permanantly resistant to Fear is better than once every 11 seconds.  Basically, use this at the beginning of fights against dragons that cast AE Fear or if you're fighting something in the regular course of your day that is notorious for using Fear.<br>
<br>
<h3>Level 55: Unholy Aura</h3>
Duration: Instant (aka, does immediate damage)<br>
Affect: Increases damage of your harm touch by 50% and makes it harder to resist<br>
Re-use: 72 minutes (This also uses your harm touch timer)<br>
Finally, a useful discipline.  Basically, when you get this, you'll use it in place of Harm Touch for several levels until you get your Harm Touch AA abilities trained.  At which point it becomes pretty useless, just like your other disciplines.  That's right, along with having the hardest epic quest to complete, we get the worst disciplines.<br>
<br>
<h3>Level 60: Leech Curse</h3>
Duration: 15-20 Seconds<br>
Affect: Gives you health back for every point of melee damage you inflict on your targets for the duration<br>
Re-use: 72 minutes<br>
OK, here's a good one that never gets old.  It still won't keep you alive the same way a warrior's defensive discipline will, but it may give you a few extra seconds until your cleric get's off his complete heal.  By the time you get this, you're probably hitting for around 200 on a regular basis.  So, even though you are probably being out damaged on a point for point basis, this will seriously decrease your total damage taken for its short duration.  In fact, if the re-use time were something reasonable like 15-20 minutes, it would be a damn fine ability.  As it is, it's the best you get.  When should you use it though?  Well, my recommendation would be to treat it basically like a second Harm Touch.  It has roughly the same chance of saving your ass if it's coming down to the wire, but is never going to make a big difference in the greater scheme of things.<br>
