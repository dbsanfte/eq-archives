This is the second in the series of Coldain Ring Quests.  It is possible to do all but the final turn in without completing the first ring quest (as those HQ kodiak pelts can be pretty rare).<br>
<br>
First, go back to Garadain Glacierbane (still in the coldain camp in Eastern Wastes around -2600, -400) and ask him "How can I be of assistance?"  He will give you a broken axe and tell you to give it to his brother, Boridain Glacierbane.<br>
<br>
Boridain can be found around -2450, +1550.  His respawn time is approximately 3 hours with rumors of a way to trigger his spawn.  He is violently green and really can't hold his own at all.<br>
<Br>
If you're doing this alone, then you probably need to be well above level 40.  Either way, you should make sure the entrance to the giant fort is clear before starting.  To start, hand Boridain the broken axe that Garadain gave you.  He will mutter something about hunting for a Rabid Tundra Kodiak and wander off shortly thereafter.<br>
<br>
Follow him.  He'll attack any giants or orcs he sees, and maybe other wandering monsters as well.  Make sure he doesn't get hit much because he'll go down faster than a Halfling after a stout Tumpy's Tonic (everyone knows halflings are sluts).  If you aggro anything along the way, kill it or have an enchanter mem-blur it.  He'll walk right up to the gates of the giant fort at which point he'll turn northeast and begin walking towards the jail area.<br>
<br>
Shortly before he arrives at the jail, he'll sit down and take a break.  This is a great opportunity to pull the giant from the prison to kill (there is a giant and an orc in the SW corner of the prison area in a ruined building, these are the two you need to kill.)  It's probably best to kill the giant first because he's very easy to single pull and is the tougher of the two that are there.  Once he gets up, he'll walk right into this building before turning around.<br>
<br>
Now he starts heading south towards the Ry'Gorr fort.  Once again, kill anything that aggros along the way.  As you start to get near the fort, warn people who are hunting there of his approach.  He will attack anyone in wolf form and you'll probably have to start over.  Also make sure the two static spawns at the gate are gone and that the Emissary isn't wandering around looking for Rodrick.  Once he's walked right up to the gate, he'll turn around and head back to his spawn point (which isn't very far).<br>
<br>
This part is high traffic for giants and you may get an add on your way back to his spawn point.  As soon as he gets back to his spot and gives up, a Rabid Tundra Kodiak will spawn and rush in to attack.  Be careful, because he'll also attack any giants that are nearby.  The Rabid Kodiak is no pushover, he's about as tough as a giant and hits for almost 100.  He has the nasty habit of giving you rabies also (Fear works very well here).<br>
<br>
By the time you've killed him, Boridain has probably despawned, if not, loot the Rabid Kodiak Skin and give it to him.  If he has despawned, loot the Rabid Kodiak Skin anyway.  Then go to Garadain and get another broken axe.  When Boridain respawns, give him the broken axe, then immediately give him the Rabid Kodiak Pelt.  He returns the axe to you.<br>
<Br>
At this point, you take the axe that Boridain gave you and give that, along with your Copper Ring, to Garadain Glacierbane to receive the Silver Ring.<br>
