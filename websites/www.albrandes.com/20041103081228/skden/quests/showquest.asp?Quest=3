Note: This quest can be done solo at 45 except for the part about going into the Tower of Frozen Shadow and Thurgadin.  For that you should have at least a partner with you to help you finish off the Incoherent spirit who is a Shadow Knight (level 42-45) and uses Harm Touch but no spells.  Petcas Coldbeard is a tough one, you may be able to kill him if you pull him to the zone to Icewell Keep, but he is HIGHLY magic resistant so you likely won't be able to darkness him for snare, and if he walks a little ways from the zone line, a cleric dwarf nearby will heal him.  And he resists Harm Touch too most of the time.<br><br>You say, 'hail Staff Sergeant Drioc' <br><br>

Staff Sergeant Drioc glances over at you with a sneer and says, 'I have much to do and organize. If you have anything of importance to say you had best speak up now or leave before I lose my patience.' <br><br>

You say, 'I am looking for work' <br><br>

Staff Sergeant Drioc stops looking over his papers and takes a moment to size you up. You fight the urge to run in fear as the collosal humanoid considers you. After a moment he says, 'Very well. Our campaign to conquer the so called Tunarean Court has need of reinforcements. The Kromrif are already spread to thinly in the Eastern Wastes so mercenaries will have to do. Take these orders to the commanding officer in the field and follow his orders. Payment will be discussed after you complete your assignment. <br><br>

Give this to Lieutenant Krofer, who can be found outside the city gates in the Wakening Land. The reward for this first task is experience but no faction. The Lieutenant will then give you several other tasks to perform. <br><br>

No 1: He first asks for 2 panther meat, 1 raptor meat and 1 Tar Goo Strand. Return these to him for some coin and faction. Panther meat can be found on the panthers roaming the zone.  Raptor meat can be found off the various Tigeraptors in the zone.  And Tar Goo Strands can be found off the Tar Goos in the Geonid caverns in the zone.  Rumor has it they can also drop for Tar Goos in other zones, but I have never seen one<br><br>

No 2: His second quest requires you to catch a messenger roaming the Wakening lands and return proof to him. This is a Sifaye Messanger, it roams between the POG tower, the north wall, and Skyshine areas. Not to hard to kill. Kill it and loot note and return it to Lieutenant Krofer and recieve a Studded Velium Cloak.  If you don't get any adds, you should be able to solo this fairly easily at 45<br><br>

No 3: His third quest is initiated by saying "I am prepared". Tell Lieutenant Krofer "I am prepared". <br><br>

He will then give you a Letter for War to take to Staff Sergeant Drioc in Kael, who upon receiving the Letter for War will peruse, sign it, say to return it to Krofer and that the troops will be on the way shortly. <br><br>

Return the note to Krofer (who gives you another note to return to him after the battle) and 4 giants spawn at the Kael zone 2 Berserkers, 1 Acolyte and 1 Corporal. <br><br>

Follow them to the NE camp of Sifaye (1762, -285) and wait for the Corporal to say his squad is ready. <br><br>

Say "Troop Attack" and they will charge the Sifaye Village. The surprise is 4 Sylvan Guardians and a host of other creatures including phase panthers will pop up to help defend the Sifaye camp.  <br><br>

As soon as you tell your troops to attack, I would recommend Gathering Shadows and getting out of dodge… err..  Wakening Lands.  This is a scripted sequence and you are meant to lose. Return to Krofer with the mission report and he will send you inside to see Drioc again. Drioc will then curse and rage and tell you that you must explain it to his finacier and gives you the failure report back. <br><br>

Although he does not divulge who his finacier is, I can tell you that it is an NPC named Noble Helssen who is located next to Wenglawks in the Noble's building. <br><br>

If you hand Helssen the failure notice he will inform you that it was not your fault and that Drioc was to blame. He then will divulge that he seeks to not only control the wakening land but the very force of Growth itself. <br><br>

He wants you to help him accomplish this goal. He will hand you a tablet inscribed with the runes of binding and tell you to seek out a turtle by the name of Corudoth in the Iceclad Ocean. He also will occasionally give you the Enchanted Velium Mask as a reward for getting this far (I am not sure if this is given out every time). <br><br>

Corudoth can be found under a chunk of ice at approximately -6000,+6000 in Iceclad. If you tell him that he "owes Helssen" he will deny owing Helssen anything. Handing him the tablet however will change his tune. <br><br>

Corudoth curses and goes into a fit of frustration before finally giving in. The ancient sea turtle finally says, 'Fine. I dont know what Helssen wants with that but I know where you can find it. Years and years back I traveled with what was called the Icy Mugs. We were a mercenary company out for fun and profit, and there was plenty of that. During our adventures we ran across a great many foes. <br><br>

You say, 'what great foes' <br><br>

Corudoth says 'Yes. One of note was the vile and evil sorcerer Rosh. A better example of depravtity and anti-morality I cannot think of. He researched magics destined to end all life on this cold chunk of rock and snow. We made it our mission to destroy him. In the end we defeated him, but alas our friend and comrade was slain. Poor Abrams was left cursed forever to wander that spire of ultimate loathing, the Tower of Frozen Shadow. <br><br>

You say, 'who is abrams' <br><br>

Corudoth says 'Abrams was a brave warrior and a good friend. His great maul could always be counted on to strike true as he used his body to shield others from greivous wounds. He sacrificed himself to save us from the eternal suffering he now endures up in that dark tower. The book you now seek, is in his possesion. You must first destroy his tormented form to free him from his madness. Tell him you seek the Arcanum and then give him the lock of hair I just gave you. You also will need the key? <br><br>

You say, 'what key' <br><br>

Corudoth says 'We ambushed Rosh on an expedition into the cursed Tower. When we faced him, Abrams ran forward and grabbed the Arcanum. He held it to his chest as lightning and flame rained down upon him. With Rosh busy trying to save his book it gave Petcas and I enough time to strike Rosh down. We went to Abrams and found our friend left a smoking pile of Coldain ruin. He underwent a strange transformation in which the Arcanum was lost. We decided Petcas should keep the key. <br><br>

You say, 'who is Petcas?' <br><br>

Corudoth says 'Petcas has retired from the life of an adventurer as I have. I would not tell you where he is as he is a good friend, but what I owe Helssen is stronger than comraderie or even friendship so I must comply; it is the word of Veeshan. Petcas now owns a small bar in the Coldain city of Thurgadin. To get the key you must fight your way into the city and kill Petcas. I wish you a most horrendous death Dark Elf. Now leave me to my sleep. <br><br>

Petcas can be found in a building just to the right of the Thurgadin zone when facing out from Icewell Keep. He drops an ancient rusted key. <br><br>

Abrams ghost can be found on the sixth floor of the Tower of Frozen Shadow. His ghost goes by the name of an incoherant spirit and has a very long spawn time. Killing the ghost will spawn Abrams. Hand him his beard and he will hand you the Arcanum of Rosh. <br><br>

Return the Arcanum and the Ancient Rusted Key to Helssen and he will give you a voucher. There are three rewards here and it is your choice which path to take. <br><br>

He will tell you that you can redeem the voucher with Kellek for "an item worthy of a hearty and rugged combatant." This reward is the <a href="showitem.asp?file=collar_of_the_storm">Collar of the Storm</a>. <br><br>

He will tell you that you can redeem the voucher with Wenglawks for "an item to be worn by only the most pious." This reward is the Girdle of Reflection. <br><br>

He will tell you that you can redeem the voucher with him for "a sorcerous trinket of his own design". This reward is Helssen's Prismatic Trinket.<br><br>Alternate rewards:<br><a href="showitem.asp?file=girdle_of_reflection">Girdle of Reflection</a><br><a href="showitem.asp?file=helssens_prismatic_trinket">Helssens Prismatic Trinket</a><br>There are intermediate rewards not pictured here.<br>
