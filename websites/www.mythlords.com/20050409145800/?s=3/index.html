It does not seem so long ago that we were making our first attempts at raiding.<BR> First brood dragons and NtoV taught us much as this group of friends began making our journey up through the tiers. We learned much along the way. We learned the power of resists, the agony of gaters, the heartwarming joy of what a flurry drake can do to your raid in a few moments=)<BR><BR> We learned about CR in Grieg's End=/ We also learned that the Grieg fight is the worst fight ever! <BR> We learned the burrower ring, BoT Towers (ugh), Seru, Ssra and VT. We never did save the gnome in CT, but darned if we did not kill him on a regular basis!!! We gained some superb people along the way, and we lost some as well. But even when things sucked and we were stuck farming, we always had fun. (Well, at least we tried to!)<BR><BR> Then came PoP and it's love for encounters requiring numbers. I remember thinking there was no way we could do it and still be a casual raiding guild. But we all made it happen by believing in ourselves and having faith, plus a strong, strong hate for losing=p<br><br> The first biggest problem we had in PoP was RZ. That was one heck of a struggle that demoralized the heck out of us as he took bite after bite out of our pride. But we kept after it and finally,  FINALLY he died=)<br><BR> Then came the Ol' Mistress Xegony, she learned us good as well=p Numerous attempts and strategy changes and headaches later... She fell as well. (I still think the devs own shares in Tylenol and Jack Daniels.)<BR><BR> The last hoser in our way was Coirnav. Dang these encounters and their need for bodies. Time and time again.... we ran out of it. So we geared some more in Fire- BoT Towers part 2 - We just kept plugging away getting as much of an edge we could and one day everything worked perfectly and we beat the encounter with almost 2 minutes left on the clock. What a rush!!<br><br><br>Now here we are in PoTime, with as much gear as the elemental and various other targets could supply! Dropping these bad boys and girls left and right on our first run!<br><BR><BR> <font size=4> Alright, Stop!</font><BR><br><a href="http://members.cox.net/baatsmells/rztime1.JPG" target=mlshots> <img src=" http://members.cox.net/baatsmells/rztime1_thu.JPG" height=" 125" width ="173" border="0"></a></font><font size=5><br><BR> HAMMER TIME!<br><br> </font>Grats to all on the latest Time upgrades, as we managed to make great progress on our first run and had one heck of a good time!!

We have a lot of work to do to learn Time well enough to reap the rewards, but we'll get there!  Learning it all will just take time  <img src ="http://forums.mythlords.com/images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">
<br><br>
P1 drops are rotting already!!  We discovered last night that our crew of about 30 people can do phase 1 in the hour alloted! Technically we were about a minute short, not bad for a trial run  <img src ="http://forums.mythlords.com/images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <img src ="http://forums.mythlords.com/images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <img src ="http://forums.mythlords.com/images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">

With lots of help, We have finished 2 of the 4 parts that Myth Lords needs for access to Ikkinz raids.  Ikkinz raids will be easy Time+ loot for us but everyone will need the KT flag, so get those Tipt runs done!
<br><br>
We have not forgotten about epics.  Everyone needs to get their epics done.  We are backflagging this week.  After backflags are done, we'll get back to doing epic raids again.  So get the easy parts of your epics done!
<br><br>
We found that Battlemaster and Hulcror in OOW are easy kills for us and drop Time+ loot, so we'll be hitting those in our *spare time* <img src ="http://forums.mythlords.com/images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif">
<br><br>
All those dreary days spent farming Fire and the many hours we spent turning into prunes in Water are about to pay off!
<br><br>
Great work Myth Lords, we come a long way and have a TON of new content to play in now!  This is an exciting time for us, we are going to have a blast messing around in all this new scenery!!!   <img src ="http://forums.mythlords.com/images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <img src ="http://forums.mythlords.com/images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <img src ="http://forums.mythlords.com/images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <img src ="http://forums.mythlords.com/images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">
