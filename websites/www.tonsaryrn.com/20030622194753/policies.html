        We are a large group of friends that are working towards being able to
            do big things together. We are supportive of each other and put effort
            into helping each other so we grow as a guild. We are a 'nice' guild.
            We do not kill steal. We do not train on purpose. We do not harass.
            We can be trusted in trades and things such as holding gear for someone.
            Stealing kills or camps, scamming, ninja looting or deliberate training
      are all grounds for suspension from ToN.</font></p>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><img src="images/o.gif" width="26" height="26"><font size="3">ur Dream</font></strong><br>
  Our dream is simple. We dream of being able to stand on the cold dead necks
      of every big mob in the game, and look around to see a room full of friends
      grinning back (alive if possible). </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We are at heart a very large
          group of friends. Unfortunately, like in all social groupings, the
          group is comprised of dynamics that don&#8217;t
        always promote unity. This means that conflicts will arise. Some of those
        conflicts will arise in regards to the leadership. All our policies are
        publicly posted. If you don&#8217;t agree with our policies, don&#8217;t
        apply for membership. Don&#8217;t expect that if you join us you can
        change us to meet your expectations.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One thing that is necessary
          is that the membership believes in and supports the officer core. If
          you can&#8217;t do this, then this is not the guild
        for you. The Guild Leader and the Officers will decide the day to day
        efforts of the guild. Voice your opinion, discuss it but when the decision
        is made - pull with your guildmates and support the Officers. </font><br>
      </p>
      <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font size="3"><img src="images/p.gif" width="27" height="29">articipation</font></strong><br>
        This is simple. Participate or Level or Leave. Travelers are working
            hard on achieving the best that Everquest has to offer. We are going
            new places, seeing new things, and improving our gear and raid skills.
            You need to be 60, and you need to participate in guild activities.
            Therefore if you are a member of or hope to be a member of ToN, you
            will participate in activities, or level your buns to at least 60,
            or decide that ToN's not right for you.</font></p>

        Items gained from guild raids or activities will be awarded to the membership 
        or guest attendant at the raid via DKP or /random.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If the item 
        is dropable and there is no interest, item will be held in the guild bank 
        to be used by members not present at the raid or to be sold for guild 
        funds. Items that are no drop will be destroyed or opened to the zone 
        as the raid leader requests.<br>
        </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
          <strong><img src="images/h.gif" width="28" height="23">ydras</strong><br>
        Members running multiple accounts can expect to see their hydras rewarded,
        but not at the same rate as main characters. You will not be required
        to bring multiple characters on raids, but many of our raids are strengthened
        by our members who hydra and their participation will be rewarded.<br>
      </font></p>

          when with an allied guild</strong><br>
        We split it approximately down the middle, they get to decide how to
        distribute theirs, and we distribute ours according to our loot rules.<br>
      </font></p>
      <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>

        loot with multiples and with non-guild</strong><br>
        Typically, non-guild will be present on raids because they are interested 
        in learning more about ToN, and getting to know us. Usually these will 
        be players applying or considering applying to ToN as members. They are 
        not eligible for loot that main characters, hydras, alts, or probationary 
        members want. This means that although there is some possibility of loot 
        for non-guild on our raids, it's limited. If you are inviting someone 
        to a raid, ensure they are aware of this, and ensure you've cleared their 
        presence with the raid leader. <br>

      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><img src="images/r.gif" width="39" height="30">egular Raids</strong><br>
        Our Events forum lists the schedule for our regularly planned raids.
      Every member of ToN is required to check the forums at least weekly. </font></p>
      <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><img src="images/m.gif" width="34" height="28">embership</strong><br>
        As our requirements are constantly changing, please find our current
            requirements <a href="http://pub65.ezboard.com/ftravelersofnorrath98954frm4" target="_blank">here</a>.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">New members have approximately a 1 month trial during which time they
        and we can find out how well they fit in. New sponsorships can be done
        through the forum. They will remain on the board for a full week to allow
        people to have the chance to say yeah or nay before they are added or
        dismissed. Comments should be accompanied by sound reasons. </font></p>

          <strong><img src="images/s.gif" width="25" height="24">ponsors:</strong><br>
        Any guild member in good standing may be primary sponsor for ONE person
        per month. Any number of seconding. Sponsors are required to insure that
        the person they sponsor meets all the requirements and make sure that
        they learn all those little details that we take for granted. Sponsoring
        someone is a serious responsibility. </font></p>

      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><img src="images/t.gif" width="29" height="26">rial Period</strong><br>
        1 month long during which you may not sponsor anyone else. This is a
            time to get to know the guild and see how well you fit in with us.
            Secondary will not be guilded in during this time, but upon achieving
            full member status every character is welcome. New members are required
            to attend at least 3 major guild raids during the trial month. <br>

        Travelers of Norrath are primarily on Giant and Dwarf faction. If you 
        are unwilling to be KOS to CoV you will be better off in another guild. 
        There will be no avoiding guild raids because of being on a different 
        faction tree than the guild. Having some chars different is fine as long 
        as main is same as us. <br>

        The use of /anon is strongly discouraged. Please use /role if you need
      to hide your class. Wear your ToN tag proudly. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If for some 
        reason you feel the need to remove your guild tag for something that requires 
        it (i.e.: GM event, helping a friend temporarily establish 10 members 
        for a new guild, etc), you must tell an officer ahead of time, via tells 
        or email. You will have to reapply if you choose to detag under any other 
        circumstances, as would any other non-member wanting in, and all accumulated 
        DKP will be lost. The Guild Leader may choose to allow you to retag without 
        reapplication if you request it within 24 hours, but all DKP will still 
        be lost. Do not remove your tag lightly, sleep on it if you're upset and 
        then discuss issues with an officer before detagging over a concern. <br>
        </font></p>

        These are benefits of being in a guild. Do not abuse the people that can 
        do these things as they too have characters to play. Those that can do 
        such things, if you're available please do so, and don't be afraid to 
        say no if you're not available. There is to be no charging guild members 
        for these services. Understand that no guildmate &quot;owes&quot; you 
        a port, rez, or summons and be courteous. <br>

        If you have something to donate to the guild, we have a mule to hold
        this stuff. If you have something that you really want money for, please
        don't auction it in guild channel. You of course can tell the guild you've
        got item x you need money cause you're saving for item y. But do not
        put everything you have to sell up in guild channel or do it repeatedly.
        Keep it simple as the guild channel is not an auction channel. It would
        be best if we could keep it to giving in the guild, but that is not always
        feasible. Please don't sell stuff off that you know people need if you
        can help it. If you receive an item from the guild you may use it as
        part of a trade for an upgrade, but otherwise when you upgrade it the
        guild would like it back to give to someone else that needs. There is
        provision for awarding DKP for gear donated back to the guild. Selling
      raid loot? We can't stop you, but we frown upon it. </font></p>

        Keep it clean, we have some young players and we have people with all 
        sorts of different tastes. What's funny to you may be offensive to someone 
        else. Complaining. Whining. Bitching. Arguing. Threatening. Sniveling. 
        Rudeness. Blatant sexual commentary towards individuals. Grossness. All 
        other forms of socially questionable behavior are NOT permitted in open 
        channel. If someone asks you to stop, stop. Greed, envy, jealousy are 
        things that have no place amongst friends. If you have issues, please 
        take them up in a constructive manner with individuals or the officers 
        in direct tells. Make sure that you have sorted out in your head what 
        your issues are, and that you can present them in a coherent manner. We 
        will do our best to address them with you. When someone gets an item please 
        be HAPPY for them, your turn will come. If you feel that something was 
        a mistake or forgotten, please send a direct tell to the person distributing 
        the loot (we make mistakes, it's no crime to make sure that we are aware 
        of everything...and we'll be happy to take a minute when we can to explain 
        a decision to you).</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Personal attacks 
        upon guildmates will not be tolerated in guildchat and will be grounds 
        for a three-day suspension. Again, if you're asked to stop, stop. Expressing 
        unchecked aggression publicly towards another guildmate will be grounds 
        for an immediate 3-day suspension. The third such suspension will be your 
        last, as you will be detagged permanently and unwelcome to reapply. <br>

        This is an event that happens at the discretion of those that wish to
            do it. If a higher level character wishes to do some power leveling
            of a lower level character, the lower is welcome to accept or not
            as they wish. Lower level characters however do not request power
            leveling. Everyone has their characters to play and there's no reason
            why a person that has achieved a high level should be forced to help
      someone else to get there faster just because they can. </font></p>
