    <description>I don't know.  If the gm's set the events, why should they  not be responsible for handing out the loot?  I have seen events where a person has validly won a roll but the raid leader refuses to give said person the loot because the raid leader doesn't think they should have it.  If a GM was the one dealing with the loot, said situation would not happen.   I personally think that as it is a GM event the GM should handle the playout and the loot distribution.</description>

      <title>GM Event LOOT arguments - NOTE TO GMs</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Stormhammer&amp;message.id=554#M554</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;ONLY GMs can solve the GM Event loot distribution arguments and HERE IS HOW:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Make all loot no-drop or don't hand out loot at all.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Since no loot at all would not be as fun, and we all pay a premium monthly price to have&amp;nbsp;events with some loot,&amp;nbsp;that leaves MAKE ALL LOOT NO-DROP by using the TREASURE CHEST method that has been used in recent weeks.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;People can say "all gm events should be NBG", but some people roll on the items they know they wont wear or weild and then rush to bazaar to sell them 2 seconds later and despite the best of intentions, even NBG ends up as a class-specific FFA.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;People can say "all gm events should be FFA", but then people get mad when a caster wins a haste item, etc.&amp;nbsp; even though all agreed to let it be handled by lotto and results in a similar "run to sell in the bazaar" situation.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;People will say that "gms dont handle no-drop drops and that causes arguments on drops as the raid is trying to move".&amp;nbsp; Yes, this is a new problem since the policy change and yes it brings out the ninja-looter in the jerks on that raid.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;People can say that no-drop is less fun (and I would say that those who&amp;nbsp;think that are probably not there to have fun in the first place and are not attempting to enhance the characters they brought on the raid, but rather are trying to increase their bank account or twink other chars).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Then its the droppable loot itself.&amp;nbsp; It is almost always a CoF or a Fungi.&amp;nbsp; Mr./Ms. GM, if you are going to put a droppable item on a mob, then please pick something that all classes can use and not constantly exclude a few classes - especially items KNOWN to cause loot arguments.&amp;nbsp; CoF and Fungi tunic dropping should STOP RIGHT NOW.&amp;nbsp; It's old, its boring, its unfair, and it shows how unimaginative the GM running that particular event is on that given day.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I swear there must be a "put a CoF on this mob and a Fungi tunic on the very next mob" hotkey that GMs use.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Simply put, even one jerk on a raid will RUIN&amp;nbsp;a fun 3 hour event when it comes time to distribute droppable loot.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;GMs, please use the more recent tactic of TREASURE CHEST style of loot that is OVERALL BETTER FOR THE EVENT, rather than the "drop and fungi so I as the GM can get out of the raid while the players are left to fight off loot whores, latecomers, and plain rude behavior from other players".&amp;nbsp; Whenever the "treasure chest opened by the GM resulting in no-drop items" method is used, there are no loot problems and it enhances the fun of the event (since its the GM awarding the prizes).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Don't let great events be ruined by the last 5 minutes of loot issues over droppable loot, YOU CAN SOLVE IT for the players and make everyone happier!&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;DEAD SERIOUS HERE.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;REMOVE ALL DROPPABLE LOOT&amp;nbsp;ON GM EVENTS, &amp;nbsp;MAKE IT NO-DROP STARTING TODAY!!!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>Oh, yes, by all means, let the casters have a shot at things.&lt;br&gt;Just don't give them priority over it. If you only get ahold of ONE of a certain item (again, example is a blade of rallos zek), then the people who can use it (warriors) get priority on it. If there's more than one, sure, give the casters a shot at one.&lt;br&gt;The thing is there's no way to tell what you're going to need to give out until you see the group, and if they tailored to the group and judged by what they already have, everybody could get something appropriate for them. That may be a little too much work for the guides, though.</description>

If you're gonna do nbg you do it the way it was meant to be done, the classes who can use it can roll for it.  While warriors are seen as the most deserving of them, I know plenty of bards and SK's who would love to have one.  Just remember you can't play favorites like that.  In a guild it's one thing, but in an open raid, if you're going to do NBG it has to be FAIR nbg.</description>

      <description>I was just using it as an example. I'm not really sure of all who CAN use it, though I do know warriors can use it (Because I'm a warrior). I wouldn't mind bards and company rolling on such a thing.&lt;br&gt;My real point was that people should roll on things that they can use, and priority should go to them (not neccessarily one class on the weapon, mind.).</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV align=left&gt;I personally agree with the starter of the thread.&amp;nbsp; All NO DROP items would eliminate the NBG/FFA problem.&amp;nbsp; Events should be fun, and should offer a chance at upgrades for you charachter.&amp;nbsp; I'm really not pleased that I pay $40 a month to listen to a bunch of people fight about loot that they want to sell in the bazaar.&amp;nbsp; To anyone that says you can't please everyone... I leave you with this..&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The happiest group of players I've ever seen after an event was on a 30-40 event in splitpaw.&amp;nbsp; The actor made a list of everyone in the raid at the beginning of the event.&amp;nbsp; After succesfully completing the task at hand, every single person was allowed to choose between 2 of their SS quest armors.&amp;nbsp; Everyone gets nice NO DROP reward.&amp;nbsp; Everyone is happy to continue paying $40 a month for the chance of it happening again.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV align=left&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>You know, I've been looking through this thread, and having been around since the earlier days of Legends, I'm wondering...&lt;br&gt;What's all the bickering about over items? Back in my first few events, we were given no-drop coins that we would take to a certain individual in town, and we would get what would appear to be a randomized item, though it may depend on the coin you get. As I recall, I have an earring from such an event. Moving along to the 'dividing the loot thing'.&lt;br&gt;Uh.&lt;br&gt;While I'm all for fair play and all..&lt;br&gt;WHY?&lt;br&gt;I figure that everyone should get something, and loot probably should not be divided according to rolling unless someone can only get one item, and then have to stop participating. At which point I would hope that there would be enough rewards to cover everybody participating, which is how it was last I recall this sort of thing happening.&lt;br&gt;Personally, I get upset when I see say, a caster, rolling on a weapon for warriors. Why? I'm a warrior, and more than likely I could use that weapon more than the caster, who is going to go sell it in the bazaar for more than I'm going to be able to afford to begin with, and I wouldn't blame other classes for getting upset if the same thing happened to them.&lt;br&gt;Likewise, I would not roll on a caster-exclusive-use item because I know I can't use it, and while I could SELL it, I would also be depriving another player of a well-deserved item.&lt;br&gt;This is just an example.&lt;br&gt;'Need before greed' can't be applied very easily, but when it's blindingly obvious (A caster rolling on a well-known, high-end warrior weapon)...&lt;br&gt;Well, you see my point.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;nbg is nice, in a group with friends or guildies etc.. an open event though where there are 20 to 100 people, I say rolling is the only way to go.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;so what if that chanter got a BoC, yeah, there are lots of warriors there that would of liked it.. but that caster earned it just as much as anyone else at the event,&amp;nbsp;they run to bazaar and sell it...thats their choice with the items they won/earned.&amp;nbsp; Alot of peoples goals in this game is to accumulate as much riches as they possbily can, use that money on alts, themselves or just look at it :)&amp;nbsp; Everyone has their own goals in the game.&amp;nbsp; And with open events, everyone should have an equal right to all the loot dropped.&amp;nbsp; The events are fun to do, but it is nice to know that you may have a chance at an item in the end.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Well this is my 2 cents worth.....&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I left stormhammer over the gm events - period.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Why ?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;They were terribly unfair.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; After doing many many raids I&amp;nbsp;got some potions and one ring that to my lvl sucked BIG TIME and 2 aa.&amp;nbsp;Thats it! &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;the only 2 events i saw anything worthwhile 1.&amp;nbsp; was in the arena it dropped great&amp;nbsp; stuff and i was there for the whole fight but no one would let me in a group so no i couldnt roll.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I saw a druid get a mana +2 ring for healing the&amp;nbsp;event host&amp;nbsp;(I couldnt have possible win it cause im a mage)&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;2.&amp;nbsp; I did the second part of a two parter (I had to work the first part) .&amp;nbsp; It was a long fight and took twice as much time as the first part.&amp;nbsp; Well great stuff did get given away to the people but not to me cause I wasnt there for both.&amp;nbsp; I got nothing.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Thats the night i put my notice in to be transfered back and left stormhammer.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Who cares? no one but me -&amp;nbsp;every time i play eq i remember these things and it makes me feel bad.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;I strongly support no drop stuff (my ring was)&amp;nbsp; and i strongly support giving stuff to all that earned it even if you have to do it twice in a 2 part or 3 times in a 3 part everyone one should be treated fair!&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;As for the rest I dont even care about loot - I have been playing EQ for 5 years - But I do care about fair.&amp;nbsp; Loot becomes obsolete over time...&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; whats great today will be useless tomorrow.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Heres an Idea&amp;nbsp;- Why not let&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;the classes roll before finding out whats on the table and a special item made up for the winners of that roll - maybe something that they could use?&amp;nbsp; Maybe something unique?&amp;nbsp; Thats what i though it was when i first came to stormhammer....&amp;nbsp; But thats to simple having casters roll and finding a mage with a terrible robe and wow a brand new with a few nicer stats?&amp;nbsp; &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;the conversation would go like this - &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Gm - and proud as the winner of the roll for casters what item would best suit you.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Proud - well my rings are kinda low would you have anything better than this (&lt;FONT color=#6633ff&gt;jade earring&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;Gm - ah yes try this (&amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT color=#cc00ff&gt;electified earing of the tempest&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;) on u might find it nicer!&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;Proud -&amp;nbsp; Wow thanks GM this is something i can really wear.&amp;nbsp; Thanks all to the raid it was very fun!&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Grr I hate to see something like the events run so poorly! When they can be so much fun.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Well Humper, I hear ya. I left SH too, both for the long LFGs and events. I actually won a roll for a spell. However I had all of my spells as a ranger level 60, a fairly easy task.&amp;nbsp;So I asked for a higher level spell.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Mind you, the event became very difficult due to a major train brought by an unrelated guild. Lots of deaths. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So, because it was taking time to sort out and the raid party was waiting for other rolls, I told the GM to deal with this after all other items were distributed since he/she refused to give me a higher level spell or a comparable item.&amp;nbsp;Long story short, I got NOTHING out of that roll. I moved out that weekend and am still bitter.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Greets,&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I've skipped the last few days events not for being upset just been sick irl.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;However,&amp;nbsp; the majority of events I've been to lately... all the gm loot for the events has been no drop.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Actual drops on mobs that we've passed out have just been as normal.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I also took some time off because it got a bit petty over the no drops last few events I was at.&amp;nbsp; Either people weren't happy, mostly because they wanted the item.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;One time people showed up at almost the end of the event and caused major greif over loot which they hadn't earned a right to.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Just goes to show you most peoples motives I guess.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I've also seen people discussing no groups here and in pok etc... Personally I've had groups every day I've been on this server.&amp;nbsp; Either with my now 62 beastlord... or being requested to drop down to my low 50's monk for ldon's.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I'm mostly grouped with the same people tho its about 12 of them in total.&amp;nbsp; Only real problem I've had on storm hammer is noone I've met plans to stay here.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;/wave&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;"You rolled on an item and won but wanted something better. When you didn't get your way you left the server. Good riddance one less whiny child at GM events who get mad when they don't get their way."&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;First, I had already planned to leave. Second, you don't have to get offensive. Third, you are just perpetuating the attitude that some (but thankfully not all) SH players have.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I made friends in SH at the end. It is not about getting my way; is about followup. The GM never got back to me.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Anyhow, have a great day buddy. Do cut on the caffeine tho.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think the issue with that is it requires spending a programmer's time to code new tools and more data to be stored on a per-character basis.  Dpending on how the data is stored it may require a re-build of every character's data file on stormhammer, cause issues with moving characters to and from stormhammer, and would take a lot of time to wirte the tools in the first place and QA them and push them live.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You could work around this pretty easily with the LDoN system:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Create an LDON Adventure merchant on SH only. At the end of a GM event, the GM could AE summon an item with a set # of LDoN point value, which could be scaled depending on the level, difficulty and time the event took.&lt;br&gt;This item could then be sold to this new merchant only, like an augment, and the points used to buy GM event loot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I guess such a system could be used on normal servers too, their merchant could just have different items.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Good message:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;After my SH experience, I&amp;nbsp;agree all&amp;nbsp;event loot should be&amp;nbsp;NO DROP. And this is coming from a non-65er.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Making at least the most attractive loot&amp;nbsp;NO DROP&amp;nbsp;will automatically turn rolls into an NGB situation and &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;prevent twikage. However, a little more thought should be placed in the distribution of loot as well. GMs (should) have tools to determine the server population breakdown. If there are a large percentage of rangers, pallies, clerics, or any other class, tune loot accordingly. Same loot gets old fast and agree on the COF, Fungus comment.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;BTW, still yet to see a non-raid, non-event&amp;nbsp;MGB.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

A lot of the time when one person mgb's something a whole bunch of people jump in and mgb too so that all those who were around end up with full raid buffs.  I guess you just have to be in pok at the right time.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Have to agree with Nanyea.&amp;nbsp; Its not the job of the GMs to handle the loot.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>I don't know.  If the gm's set the events, why should they  not be responsible for handing out the loot?  I have seen events where a person has validly won a roll but the raid leader refuses to give said person the loot because the raid leader doesn't think they should have it.  If a GM was the one dealing with the loot, said situation would not happen.   I personally think that as it is a GM event the GM should handle the playout and the loot distribution.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;NBG would be nice but it simply can not be done fairly on this server. First we have no idea what everyone owns or are even wearing. Second alot of those under geared people are here for a month just to get better gear and leave so it plays right into their hands, and last it's not real fair when the gms insist on staying with the 51+ level range on events. Obviously the lower levels are going to "need" things worse but in alot of cases those people may be alts compared to other people's mains plus you just automatically elimanate alot of people from every having a chance at anything. And no one stops the level 50s from rolling on some really nice gear that would actually be an upgrade for almost everyone.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
