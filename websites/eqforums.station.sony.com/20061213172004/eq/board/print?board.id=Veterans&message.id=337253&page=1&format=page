<UL>
<LI>Group/RL came with GoD expansion, if I am not mistaken. (This one could be extended quite easily with some nice additions so I will agree with you on those.</LI>
<LI>Evolving items are a good idea, however it requires a single evolvable item to be tuned and developed as if a single item (so 3 items per evolving entity). Demonstrations of current itemisation means that they are unwilling and/or unable to do a good job on it, so best just to work on 1 item, instead of splitting it into 3.</LI>
<LI>MPG Trials are just that, trials. Trials for Mata Muram for his legion. The lore in latter expansions do not have this as a central theme, so they don't have any. Groupable gear is Qvicish standard, with occasional Tacvi standard items here and there, but you have to work for them.</LI>
<LI>Cursor loot was loot on a silver platter. I am glad they have done away with it.<BR></LI></UL>

<P>I'm not sure if you're referring to the raids or the single-group trials.</P>
<P>As someone mentioned earlier, "trials" wouldn't necessarily make sense in every expansion because the lore doesn't always&nbsp;center around an individual that poses challenges&nbsp;to those who wish to prove themselves.&nbsp; That said, we do&nbsp;have scripted raid encounters every expansion with mechanics that aren't dissimilar to the MPG raids.&nbsp; The difference between Hatchet the Torturer and the Trial of Adaptation is primarily lore. <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0></P>
<P>I liked <EM>almost</EM> everything about the single-group&nbsp;MPG trials.&nbsp; They were challenging, hand-crafted, unique events that required careful and sometimes unusual tactics.&nbsp; My problem with them was that the rewards were substantial... maybe a little too substantial.&nbsp; High level spells, a permanent increase to the resistances hardcap and some incredibly good gear.&nbsp; And I suspect this spike in itemization is one of the main reasons why they were so fondly remembered.&nbsp; Ask yourself, and be completely honest, if the events would have been so popular if the rewards were a shade or two less powerful.</P>

				Of course, the loot was good, the AA was very nice, and there was a shot at a spell.&nbsp; These are all solid reasons to do them.&nbsp; That said as a raidier I never looted any items from them, cause I didnt need them.&nbsp; I got all my spells elsewhere as well.&nbsp; I however have done them all several times.&nbsp; They are excellent, reliable, events that you can/could do altho the lockouts could be annoying for the ones you werent doing hehe.<br><div></div>

<P>I'm not sure if you're referring to the raids or the single-group trials.</P>
<P>As someone mentioned earlier, "trials" wouldn't necessarily make sense in every expansion because the lore doesn't always&nbsp;center around an individual that poses challenges&nbsp;to those who wish to prove themselves.&nbsp; That said, we do&nbsp;have scripted raid encounters every expansion with mechanics that aren't dissimilar to the MPG raids.&nbsp; The difference between Hatchet the Torturer and the Trial of Adaptation is primarily lore. <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0></P>
<P>I liked <EM>almost</EM> everything about the single-group&nbsp;MPG trials.&nbsp; They were challenging, hand-crafted, unique events that required careful and sometimes unusual tactics.&nbsp; My problem with them was that the rewards were substantial... maybe a little too substantial.&nbsp; High level spells, a permanent increase to the resistances hardcap and some incredibly good gear.&nbsp; And I suspect this spike in itemization is one of the main reasons why they were so fondly remembered.&nbsp; Ask yourself, and be completely honest, if the events would have been so popular if the rewards were a shade or two less powerful.</P><BR>
<HR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>However, the beauty lied in that the gear was one of the draws, and imho, not completely out of line with the difficulty. The gear was also only three items per trial, and didn't have massive mods or anything. I thought they were exceptionally well thought out and would love to see ideas like this continue.</P>
<P>I've completed all six individual trials, and probably the only one which I felt needed to be more difficult at the time was destruction.&nbsp;The raid trials are.. well, Hatred is too easy, simply put. Considering it drops the best visible slot (legs) its considerably easier than all the other trials (with the possible exception of Foresight if your raid pays attention easily, or specialization if you have a bunch of good group healers).</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Of course, i'm biased, since oow is my favourite expansion =p</P>

				<DIV>&gt;&nbsp; High level spells, a permanent increase to the resistances hardcap </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>This is why I bothered doing those trials.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&gt; and some incredibly good gear.&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I wouldn't call loot that was on par with 2 year old raid loot "incredible". The loot in the trials were not upgrades to me or anyone else I did them with, except on rare occassion someone could upgrade their worst loot with 10-20hp. Considering transportation/clearing/lockout time, the fact that most times all loot rot, and most times no spell rune dropped, I really don't think the rewards from these trials was anywhere near excessive.</DIV>

<HR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>I think the trials were popular for the fact they were each unique, they dropped really good gear for the era, and they were instances, which meant they were always up when you wanted them (assuming timers were down).</P>
<P>Personally, the "upgrade" to this that comes to my mind was the freeport arena challenge. Admittedly, it is longer, but it has the similar characteristics of always being ready to go, and yielding a really good result.</P>
<P>In contrast, the random spawn with a possible named, who then drops the item you want (or a mold), can be irritating to some, because of the chance of a bad RNG streak, leading to hours of nothing.</P>
<P>Admittedly, even the trials can drop an item you don't need, but at least you get runes. And you get to see an item, even if nobody needs it.</P>
<P>The dod missions were similar, in that they were instances, however, while the loot was kind of close to the quality of PG trial loot, it was several expansions later, and therefore weaker by comparison. Cursor loot was overkill quantity, and imo should rarely be used, if ever.</P>
<P>While I would not think every expansion would need a full set of "trials" a few really high quality items, from a few instances, popped in here and there (like freeport arena) would be nice.</P>
<P>In fact, I honestly would suggest adding one or two to TSS, that drop weapon upgrades for single groups. Despair is still one of the top groupable weapons, several years later. A 25 dmg, 21 dly 1h and about a 72dmg 38 dly 2h seem like they would be a good level for modern eq groupable top end items.</P>
<P>Of course, the events would have to be as hard now, as PG group trials were when OOW came out.</P><p>Message Edited by Treeslayer on <span class=date_text>12-12-2006</span> <span class=time_text>11:10 PM</span>
