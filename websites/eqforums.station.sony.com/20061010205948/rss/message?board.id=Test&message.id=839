      <title>A few questions, from a Test Server newbie..</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Test&amp;message.id=827#M827</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Hi All,&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;So, long time EQ player, newbie on test server. I recently came back to play after quiting back when Plane of Fear raiding and Dragon killing were the uber passtimes. You old timers know what I am talking about...anyways after facing the realization that my gear is sorely out of date and that I don't know anyone anymore on my home server I decided to try Test.&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Wow..alot has changed. A REAL tutorial? If your old enough you remeber the original EQ tutorial? LOL...anyway I was impressed. Some things seemed to not work though, and that brings me to my first question:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=red&gt;Do I just use /bug to report problems on Test, is /bug even a command anymore?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The find command is a godsend. I read somewhere that we have access to all expansions, which brings me to my second question:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=red&gt;I used /testbuff but I cannot get my Adventure Stone so I can use the LDON Magus' is this a known issue? &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Again, I will /bug it if that is what needs to be done. I appreciate any responses. Btw, my name on Test is Lorkorle, I play an Iksar Necro.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>/bug and or /feedback&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I use /bug when I am confident I am looking at a bug.&amp;nbsp; I use /feedback when I express my opion that something may not be as intended.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just keep in mind that they change things on Test Server to see how it will work.&amp;nbsp; This may make one or more things seem to be buged when in fact they are working as intended.&amp;nbsp; That is not to say dont send the /bug and or /feedback.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am unaware of any reason you can not get an adveture stone.&amp;nbsp; Did you talk to the person that talked to you?&amp;nbsp; As in oh say going to Rath Mtns at the Gypsie Camp near the Entrance to Lake Rathetear.&amp;nbsp; You need to talk to one of those people before you can get a adventure stone&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Thanks for the reply.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I guess I should have phrased my question regarding LDON&amp;nbsp;differently, I don't own that expansion.&amp;nbsp; I ran an LDON last night though, and I can interact with all the NPCs.&amp;nbsp; But I never got a message (I hear you are supposed to receive a message that tells you to go talk to someone), so I went the Rathe and the NPC there told me that she cannot help me to go to my hometown.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So I did, when I got there I found the NPC by luck (I did not know the exact name), he says "Information" which is the first keyword to the quest, but when I try to get him to respond, nothing.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I rolled two other characters to see if I had the same issue and I do.&amp;nbsp; It must be the fact that I dont own LDON, but you would think that if we have access to all expansions on Test that this would be part of it....anyway.&amp;nbsp; I appreciate the response :)&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;Lately they have been shutting down expansions to test for the new progression server.You might just go exp for a week then try again,Using the magus's help but the chances of ya finding a group for LDoN I'd estimate at about 2000 to 1 odds :smileytongue:</description>

&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;All of that work has pretty much been moved to the new Combine Beta Server that came online about a week ago.&amp;nbsp; The down zones you see over the last several days are day to day typical issues with Test.&amp;nbsp; Its a reoccuring problem that we hope is fixed soon.&amp;nbsp; I am hoping they add some sort of check that can auto reboot a down zone, if it has been down for more then 10 minutes.&amp;nbsp; It is a real bummer when POK goes down on a Friday night, and does not comeback online until Sunday or Monday.&amp;nbsp; Or the Guild Lobby for that matter.&amp;nbsp; With the new 8th Vet reward being&amp;nbsp; a port directly to guild lobby once an hour, thats a death sentence to you're online playtime when it goes down.</description>
