<P>I can't really begin to express how much I agree with this person.</P>
<P>The charm slot has been so bastardized from its original purpose already (the PoP charm was a travesty) and it's sickening to see it slide downhill farther with the raid-dropped charms. The very original charm concept that was shown was a charm&nbsp;whose stats were affected by how much cloth armor you wore. The LoY charms (where the slot was introduced) held decently to the principle of non-constant stats that were awarded based on some gimmick. The PoP charm gave constant stats based on how much raiding you did, and ruined the charm slot for probably 2 or 3 years. DoD did a fairly nice job of presenting some neat charms (like the random stats one from Undershore) but unfortunately also introduced powerful raider charms.</P>
<P>The augment slot in the charms was filled at first with the LDoN augment, then later with the Slipgear's Gem and the new Wanderlust augment. The Slipgear and Wanderlust augments provide an easy-out for people too lazy to spend months in Lost Dungeons, but also yield worse maximum stats, which is fine. Allowing a greater shortcut via raid-dropped augments (essentially hand-feeding the sheep herds even more heavily) should be avoided. Let them graze for some things like the rest of us.</P>
<P>Enok</P>
<P>Edit: Uhh, this came out harsher than intended. I just don't believe charm augments should be a raider thing; they should be for everybody, and something we can relate on, to help us associate more strongly with one another, rather than broadening the gap between non-raiders and raiders.</P><p>Message Edited by Enokhaon-Innoruuk on <span class=date_text>12-11-2006</span> <span class=time_text>08:44 PM</span>

				As far as "original purpose" most of the Charms I have seen still are non-constant.&nbsp; Whether they are based on Gear worn, Weight Carried, Time in a Zone or the most constant Languages Known they all seem very clearly in the same family as "how much cloth armor you wore".&nbsp;&nbsp; While these all have higher potentials than the original I dont think they "bastardize" the original concept at all.<br><br>As far as augments for the slot, the reason people dont want to spend "months in Loast Dungeons" might be because they dont enjoy it and its old.&nbsp; New content, new rewards, not a new concept.&nbsp; Theoretically, if they could code it, theres no reason the Charm Slot Augs couldnt use the same mechanic, a variable based upon some condition.&nbsp; The original Poster is only concerened with theoretical potentials.&nbsp; I doubt he(she) would turn away from a charm with a potential equal to a non charm aug's stats but based on a charm's cariable mechanic of its own.<br><br>The most amusing thing here is really your tone.&nbsp; You obviously loathe raid content and the people who enjoy it, hence the name calling.&nbsp; I'm not sure why you think raiding is a shortcut, but as far as I can see, its no shorter than LDoN would be assuming they didnt place the augs on the first raid level mobs within the content.&nbsp; My guild raids 6 days a week 5ish hours a day, I could finish many LDoNs in this time if thats what I thought was fun.&nbsp; However, I dont enjoy them, I enjoy raiding new content with scripts that make the events seem odd compared to me joining some people and mass slaughtering 100 mobs in a dungeon repeatedly.&nbsp; That just doesnt amuse me after doing the few in each area that I have done.<br><br>In the end the OP simply posted their opinion that the Devs add more powerful augment options via raiding like they have for pretty much every other item slot in the game.&nbsp; I am happy with my DoDH charm aug, but I wouldnt refuse the ability to raid for better augs either.&nbsp; I personally think the Charm slot should be given over to the Tradeskillers, with each different skill making a different style of Charm, and the "best" Charms be aquired via people making attunable items and selling them<br><br><br><div></div>

before that - pre-DoD maybe.<br>

I guess you could make a (weakish) case for Wanderlust being better

<P>Well, the skill based charms are what I consider to be in the constant family since they never get worse (since you can't lose skill); yes there were a couple from the start, but the others, faction based, gear based, time based, all fluctuate. People don't like the ones that fluctuate; I have guildmates who take lesser stat charms with consistent stats over ones that have higher potential, but aren't consistent.</P>
<P>I like raid content, and the more complicated encounters, but I do not like being insignificant in any given fight. When you're fighting alongside two dozen+ other people, you're insignificant unless you're the MT, MA or raid leader.</P>
<P>Which is why I want the gap closed more; so I can continue doing harder and harder old raid content with a single group, since interesting new single-group stuff is few and far between.</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>Yeah, I did say that somewhere (I remember saying it, just not sure where =p). And yeah, it was more of a theoretical "everything gets upgraded eventually" than a definitive. Though, when we do phase out the LDoN augment, I'd rather it be from a quested/single group source than a raid source. You raiders don't do enough non-raid content in the game in my opinion.

<P>i know it would be a mother hucker to do buy some kind of&nbsp; unglody quest that links all the expansions together would be so good, like a bic type quest where the more flags your toon has the more the augment would grow, say like hanign in the augs from dodh,&nbsp; pop, ldon, etc if completed&nbsp; would form an aug slightly better then bic if totally maxed out and alow it to grwo a small amount per expansion</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>kind of like an epic aug if you will</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>add a sub quest that allows you to attach a focus to it thats class specfic</P>

<P><BR>Then you should not be producing interesting content for "non raiders" only, I only have to point to the new augs that are dropping in the hot zones... Slot 7 only....

				Actually charm slot augs across the board would be kinda kewl. Let's face it, there's pretty much 3 that 85 percent of the population have, ldon which if you weren't around for when it was released you prolly aren't gonna max now, The slipgears which took no skill to get and was upgraded to, The wanderlust, which also required little skill. I didn't know about the dod raid ones.<br><br><br>Having some more that actually took effort to get would be nice. Raid and group/quest wise.<br><br><div></div>
