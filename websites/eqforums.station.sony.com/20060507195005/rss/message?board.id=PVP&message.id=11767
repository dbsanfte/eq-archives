    <title>pvp in EQ</title>
    <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=PVP&amp;message.id=11767</link>
    <description>ok so i just finaly came to EQ, and im liking it so far, granted im only a lvl 6 shaman, but im talking about game mechanics. why it took me so long to come to EQ was because i heard that the PvP wasn't good at all in EQ, and EQ is all about PvE. I personaly think PvP is a huge part of any MMO, and im a hardcore PvPer myself. So im just wondering how it is from the people who would know that best, the people that do it. Maybe compare it to WoW, or DAOC, if u know those games, so i can get a decent view of it. Thanks much.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;eq pvp is extremely unbalanced right now, and is not very fun, unless your a monk or ranger etc.</description>

      <description>Low level pvp will be a bit harsh for a new player. You will find a lot of twinks running around that will be **SMURF** near unkillable at your level. As you progress in levels it will start to get better as you will be able to actually dish out the damage it take to kill these twinks. At 70 sadly, its all about gear and less about skill.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm trying to think about how to compare it to WoW and DAoC but I haven't played these games extensively like I have EQ.Â  At the high end levels of pvp melee's shine and spell casters are falling behind in capasity to actually kill people due to extremely high resist that the high-end raider will have so its hard to actually land spell where as a melee is not restricted by that. The only advise I can give is stick with it as long as you are having fun and don't get frustrated by constant pvp deaths, because they WILL happen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
