&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So my last post really got folks talking (some are yelling) and that's a good thing.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Getting folks discussing things is one of the goals I have for this little section.&amp;nbsp; To any who took offense, I apologize as that was most certainly not my intention.&amp;nbsp; Rather it was to stir up some discussion and for many of you it did just that.&amp;nbsp; To clarify one little point, I do understand immersion and I love a truly immersive world.&amp;nbsp; However, immersion should never come at the expense of fun.&amp;nbsp; The first few times you run across an expansive virtual world is a wondrous experience.&amp;nbsp; By the 5th, 6th or 7th time, it starts to become tedium.&amp;nbsp; We have to avoid tedium in a game such as this.&amp;nbsp; People have to be able to get to the fun fast.&amp;nbsp; We also have to maintain that immersion for those folks who do enjoy running across the world, and in most cases we have.&amp;nbsp; The boats are gone for now, and yes even I miss them at times.&amp;nbsp; I remember riding them and exchanging languages or just socializing but when new transport methods were added, I gladly moved on to those and left our old friend the boats behind.&amp;nbsp; Would it be nice to occasionally jump on one and take a trip through the Ocean of Tears?&amp;nbsp; Possibly, on occasion, but that choice is gone and maybe that is why there has been so much talk over some of the changes.&amp;nbsp; That the choice was removed.&amp;nbsp; Like the arena in the bazaar.&amp;nbsp; I think we can all admit that it was seldom used, but the choice was there to use it if you wanted.&amp;nbsp; Something else to discuss I guess.&amp;nbsp; So have at it!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So on to the real topic Du Jour.&amp;nbsp; When commuting to work (no not another bad analogy so put down the pitchforks) I have a lot of time to think.&amp;nbsp; This morning while driving in, which only took 25 minutes Yay!, I thought back to all the times over the last 5 years that I have met you folks in person and in particular over this last year that I have been the Community Manager (or in the words of one member&amp;nbsp;of our community, the Court Jester) and many of you fine folk tell me how I must have the best job in the world.&amp;nbsp; While I do have a great job and I enjoy what I do immensely, there are times that it is not so great.&amp;nbsp; They are small things and do not take wholly diminish the overall joy I take in this position, however they deserved mention none the less.&amp;nbsp; So I now present to you the top 10 reasons why being the EQ Community Manager is not the best job in the world.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;#10 - Sharing an office with overly caffeinated Halflings:&amp;nbsp; The Brenlettes (as Lord Pfister calls Ashlanne and Kytherea) are a great asset to the team.&amp;nbsp; They are hard working, dedicated, fun and fond of coffee.&amp;nbsp; It is this fondness that leads to the 10th reason I do not have the best job in the world.&amp;nbsp; When caffeinated these two become a force of nature filled with silliness and creating rampant havoc in my normal daily routine.&amp;nbsp; Whether it be Ashlanne dancing with my chair or Kytherea throwing candy at me, it creates an atmosphere non-conducive to my routine of normality.&amp;nbsp; Now I am certain that these two will now tell that I am far from normal and that I too have a goofy streak but do not believe it for it is just the coffee talking.&amp;nbsp; By the way, Kytherea just made more coffee.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;#9 - Free Donuts and Bagels on Friday:&amp;nbsp; I know, I know you are thinking what the heck is wrong with Brenlo (and not just because of this list) Donuts, or Doughnuts should be seen as a&amp;nbsp;boon.&amp;nbsp; An enjoyment.&amp;nbsp; A pleasant perk to brighten your day.&amp;nbsp; Each Friday should be relished, even cherished for the grandeur that these pastries bring your morning.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Chocolate covered, jelly filled, maple bars the list goes on and on.&amp;nbsp; Sprinkled, covered in peanuts, old fashioned glazed, how I love the doughnut.&amp;nbsp; However . . . I am on a low carb diet and viewing these tempting and tasty tidbits of carb filled passion and tenderness makes Fridays a&amp;nbsp;little less bright.&amp;nbsp; In a moment of weakness I will even succumb to the sultry and tasty call of the bagel but alas, the Jalapeno bagel is already taken.&amp;nbsp; ARGH!!!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Look for the countdown to continue tomorrow.&amp;nbsp; And you mongoose conspirators, I am slowly unraveling your secrets.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Dragons is&amp;nbsp;doing well so far.&amp;nbsp; No major issues and people seem to be having&amp;nbsp;fun with it.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;You&amp;nbsp;folks are still saying&amp;nbsp;good things and we are very happy that you are enjoying it as&amp;nbsp;much as you are.&amp;nbsp; A lot of hours, thought, passion and heart go into these expansions and it is good to see them&amp;nbsp;well recieved (other than some folks have reservations and concerns over the new Bazaar)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I am putting up two new threads today that I would encourage you folks to participate in, the first is what do you like most about &lt;A href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Live&amp;amp;message.id=3616" target=_blank&gt;Dragons and Why&lt;/A&gt;,&amp;nbsp; and of course the second is what you enjoy least about &lt;A href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Live&amp;amp;message.id=3617" target=_blank&gt;Dragons and why&lt;/A&gt;.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So enough of that stuff.&amp;nbsp; The office is quiet for the moment as Kytherea has not made coffee yet and Ashlanne comes in a little later, so I have quiet.&amp;nbsp; Sweet beautiful silence.&amp;nbsp; Even the fish are being quiet for the moment.&amp;nbsp; There are several bettas scattered throughout the office.&amp;nbsp; Kytherea has 2, Ashlanne has 2 and I have one.&amp;nbsp; Kytherea named her fish Mudge and Angel. Not bad, you can tell some thought went into their naming.&amp;nbsp; Ashlanne named her fish Blue and Purple.&amp;nbsp; Bet you can't guess what color they are.&amp;nbsp; Umm yeah.&amp;nbsp; My fish is named Sushi.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Outside of&amp;nbsp;our office is quiet too. Many members of the team are taking some much deserved time off after their hectic launch schedule.&amp;nbsp; These guys work 12+ hour days, 7 days a week for a month of more leading up to the launch.&amp;nbsp; Now they get to unwind a bit.&amp;nbsp; So things are rather relaxed right now.&amp;nbsp; Except for Maddoc who never relaxes.&amp;nbsp; I am not sure he sleeps either, perhaps he is a Design Bot 2000 in reality.&amp;nbsp; I will be really worried if he starts to call me Dave.&amp;nbsp; Those who are here are working on bugs that you folks are pointing out, posting on these forums or working hard to add to my already fragile sanity state.&amp;nbsp; Curse you Zarillius!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Anywho I imagine you came to see number 7 and 8 or perhaps to see if Brenlo has finally lost it?&amp;nbsp; I assure you I lost it long ago. . .&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;8 - Acronyms:&amp;nbsp; Acronyms in EQ have gone crazy.&amp;nbsp; You folks are acronym masters, creating abreviated versions of phrases, spells, skills, zones, games, companies, our expansions and some even overlap.&amp;nbsp; SOE Nerfed SOE!&amp;nbsp; Huh?&amp;nbsp; FBM, IBTL, IIRC, CIHYS, SOW, SSoY, POK, XYZ PDQ!&amp;nbsp; Soon you will all be speaking in acronyms and have to use accents to determine which version of the acronym you mean,&amp;nbsp;"Dang! SOE' really should reevalute S'OE."&amp;nbsp; I know typing is teh loss, but all of these acronyms are enough to make a short halfling take a long walk of a deep water pier (don't dare me I will, but I know a secret. . .&amp;nbsp; I can swim)&amp;nbsp; We need an acronym to English dictionary in here some days as the three of us look at each in other in confusion ( not our normal confused Halfling looks as we ponder where to get our next&amp;nbsp;installment of Mocha Pie but real confusion like&amp;nbsp;the kind a man gets when he has to change a diaper for the first time)&amp;nbsp;and wonder what Skippy the Ranger was trying to say in 18 letters or less.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;7&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;The&amp;nbsp;Incredible Disappearing&amp;nbsp;Pfister:&amp;nbsp; Our Executive Producer&amp;nbsp;is a lot of fun to work for and with.&amp;nbsp; He&amp;nbsp;leads&amp;nbsp;and treats us&amp;nbsp;well and I would&amp;nbsp;dare to say that we all have a fondness for the man.&amp;nbsp; However,&amp;nbsp;I think&amp;nbsp;he is a super hero&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;perhaps the world's greatest magician in his off hours (which are few as he is usually the first one here and the last to leave, with the exception of Maddoc who never leaves).&amp;nbsp; He has the power to vanish.&amp;nbsp; Right into thin air.&amp;nbsp; He has even&amp;nbsp;done it in front of me mid sentence.&amp;nbsp; Houdini, Svengali,&amp;nbsp;Lance Burton have nothing on Robert.&amp;nbsp; He&amp;nbsp;doesn't even need a cabinet to&amp;nbsp;vanish like some of these so called prestigitators.&amp;nbsp; He disappears like&amp;nbsp;the wind, leaving only his laughter behind.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; It is truly an amazing sight to behold.&amp;nbsp; Perhaps he has a secret invisibility formula or moves faster than the eye can see.&amp;nbsp; Who knows!&amp;nbsp; Someday I will unravel his secrets though, that's a promise.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; At least we know he's not a Cleric.&amp;nbsp; (Sorry Clerics, I couldn't resist.)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Look for reasons 6 and 5 soon.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;What a good start to a day.&amp;nbsp; Ashlanne intervened and made sure that I got the jalapeno bagel!&amp;nbsp; Yes!&amp;nbsp; I finally got my spicy, tasty, chewy morning snack.&amp;nbsp; Mmmmm.&amp;nbsp; Now if only I had my jalapeno jelly to put on it.&amp;nbsp; I make my own and I am especially careful to keep my foot hair out of the canning process.&amp;nbsp; If you have not tried jalapeno jelly, I suggest you do.&amp;nbsp; Put some over some cream cheese and serve with crackers.&amp;nbsp; Very tasty and for those of you afraid of a little spice, it actually does not have much of a kick, just a lot of flavor.&amp;nbsp; I think that Tunare had me in mind when she created jalapenos.&amp;nbsp; I love those things.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Thursdays and Fridays are not so bad to begin with.&amp;nbsp; I carpool on those days so the occasionally long tedium becomes a lot more enjoyable.&amp;nbsp; Today's commute was pretty quick which was good, as I started Ashlanne with a cup of coffee when she picked me up and a halfling on caffeine talks faster than a Californian drives.&amp;nbsp; Of course today she bragged that she has now pulled way ahead of me in quests in EQ2.&amp;nbsp; I have not been playing much as I have been engrossed in DoN and that show on Sci Fi, the 4400.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; So I will let her have her brief shining moment of superiority and then I will crush her.&amp;nbsp; I wonder if the GMs can add completed quests to my total?&amp;nbsp; Just kidding.&amp;nbsp; (No really, any EQ2 GMs that read this give me a call.&amp;nbsp; I have some jalapeno jelly with your name on it.&amp;nbsp;) &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Ashlanne is consuming her third cup of coffee this morning.&amp;nbsp; Not a standard mug mind you but travel mugs.&amp;nbsp; The day may have started well but is about to get a little wild.&amp;nbsp; Batten down those hatches folks, a caffeine storm is on the way.&amp;nbsp; If they are already battened down, batten them down again, we'll teach those hatches.&amp;nbsp; (gotta love Bugs Bunny)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So onto the continuing drama that is the top 10 reasons I don't have the best job in the world.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;6 - Halfling Envy:&amp;nbsp; All Halflings know how great we are.&amp;nbsp; It is engrained within us from our earliest days in Rivervale.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Halflings are the best at nearly everything.&amp;nbsp; The only thing that springs to mind that we are not best at is being ugly.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Trolls have that one tied up forever I should think.&amp;nbsp; So we know we are the bestest and so do the rest of you.&amp;nbsp; That's why you have to make so many halfling jokes to boost your own inferior egos.&amp;nbsp; We are smarter, cuter, faster, more agile, better public speakers, have better foot hair, romantic, great bakers, the best cooks, lovers and life and you are all just jealous.&amp;nbsp; It's okay to be jealous but please stop the lashing out.&amp;nbsp; You only do yourselves a disservice by insulting us.&amp;nbsp; You cannot dent our perfect personas with your feeble attempts at insultery, such as "Halflings taste good with ketchup"&amp;nbsp; Come now, even baby halflings can do better than that.&amp;nbsp; Even the term @$$ling is tainted with your envy of our fine posteriors.&amp;nbsp; Yes, each time you scream that term at us, we are reminded of how great we fill out our breeches.&amp;nbsp; Do yourselves a favor and accept that we are the bomb.&amp;nbsp; Halflings are Teh Win.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;5 - Lucy:&amp;nbsp; Not Lucille Ball, she is great.&amp;nbsp; "Oh Ricky!"&amp;nbsp; Her and the candy on the conveyor belt.&amp;nbsp; Classic comedy (Yes Halflings know comedy).&amp;nbsp; I mean that program that reports any change made to the game the minute it shows up on Test.&amp;nbsp; I cannot tell you how many times (I use that phrase alot) someone has complained to me about a spell/aa/discipline they saw on Lucy, that never makes it live, yet they tell me they were nerfed.&amp;nbsp; How can you be nerfed when the spell/aa/discipline never existed outside of Lucy?&amp;nbsp; Nerf implies taking functionality away that you had.&amp;nbsp; In the case of many changes on Lucy they never existed.&amp;nbsp; One of the worst cases of Lucymania is when an expansion is in beta and the first round of potential spells is sniffed out.&amp;nbsp; Oh the complaints begin in great volume over spells that are still being tweaked and modified.&amp;nbsp; They are &amp;nbsp;torn apart, parced, compared, evaluated and dismissed before they ever see the light of day.&amp;nbsp; Sending valuable feedback is one thing, we appreciate it and value it.&amp;nbsp; Many things are changed due to your feedback believe it or not.&amp;nbsp; However, &lt;EM&gt;this spell sucks &lt;/EM&gt;does little to help us.&amp;nbsp; Now we really do enjoy that people go to all the trouble to make tools like this.&amp;nbsp; It shows the passion they have for this little world we all share, all I ask is to keep the information in context please.&amp;nbsp; Pretty please?&amp;nbsp; With jalapeno jelly on top?&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So I will end this all with a quick note on passion.&amp;nbsp; We know you love this game and this world.&amp;nbsp; We know that you have inexhaustible amounts of passionate feelings for the game and its creators.&amp;nbsp; I love to see that passion when I talk with you about this game and our company.&amp;nbsp; It reminds me of why I am here.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Remember that we are equally as passionate about the game.&amp;nbsp; This is not some hamburger that we fry, dress, wrap up and toss to the customer.&amp;nbsp; This is a labor of passion.&amp;nbsp; Nearly everyone on this team came to the company because of this game.&amp;nbsp; We were all players first.&amp;nbsp; We make a game that we want to play too.&amp;nbsp; We are proud of what we do even when we make mistakes and sometimes we do.&amp;nbsp; When you talk to us, remember that we share your passion.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Our passion simply takes a different form.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;Wow.&amp;nbsp; Anyway I bet you cannot guess who I was listening to on my drive in today?&amp;nbsp; So for the hour it took to get to work this morning, I listened to U2 and I got to thinking about The Edge.&amp;nbsp; How cool is that to be called The Edge all your professional career?&amp;nbsp; Urban legend has it that the band called him that as they felt he gave them an edge over other bands.&amp;nbsp; I wonder if it ever gave him a big head?&amp;nbsp; I think perhaps we should tag some of our folks with names likes this, maybe some of our Lead Designers like Jason "Sticky Buns" Mash cause he holds it all together or John "The Calculator" Troy cause he is a master of number crunching?&amp;nbsp; Oooh what about Chris "Rock Solid" Lena&amp;nbsp; for his tight schedules or Cory "Animaster" Rohlfs for his character work?&amp;nbsp; U2 will be here in concert soon and unfortunately I will not be going, they are sold out.&amp;nbsp; It's sad really, I was hoping to pick their minds for some other cool names for our team.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So on to numbers 4 and 3&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;4 - Children:&amp;nbsp; Now I know what you are thinking.&amp;nbsp; That Brenlo hates kids and that is far from the truth.&amp;nbsp; I love the way kids see the world before all of us cynics open them up to the realities of life.&amp;nbsp; Kids are great, magical little creatures that we could all learn a great deal from; how to share without concern, how to love without boundaries.&amp;nbsp; The world needs more kids.&amp;nbsp; No, I am talking about all of my red-headed step children.&amp;nbsp; Apparently I have thousands and possibly millions.&amp;nbsp; Rangers, Druids, Magicians, each class has claimed to be my red headed step child at least once.&amp;nbsp; Pvpers, roleplayers, newbies, raiders, casuals in fact some of you are linked to me as step children through several different relationships.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;As a ranger, pvper, casual player does that make you three times my stepchild? &amp;nbsp; I do find it statistically impossible that all of you have red hair.&amp;nbsp; I am also quite sure that I have never harmed any of you although I am quite often accused of smacking you.&amp;nbsp; I must admit that I am a bit overwhelmed to have so many step children dependant upon me.&amp;nbsp; How am I going to feed you all?&amp;nbsp; I refuse to do TV commercials,"Please send your generous donation to Feed Brenlo's Step Children."&amp;nbsp; The Class you save could be the one you play next."&amp;nbsp; While I stand&amp;nbsp;casually by eating&amp;nbsp;a pork chop sandwich.&amp;nbsp; (Go Joe).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Just remember that Papa Brenlo loves all his step children equally and no you cannot borrow the car this weekend.&amp;nbsp; Get your own.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;3 - San Diego Traffic:&amp;nbsp; Living in San Diego has many perks.&amp;nbsp; Beaches nearby, mountains nearby, Disneyland, Seaworld.&amp;nbsp; You almost always know what the weather will be like.&amp;nbsp; Not much smog.&amp;nbsp; Lots to see and do.&amp;nbsp; And unfortunately lots of traffic. I know I have touched on this before and you know all about my daily traffic woes.&amp;nbsp; Let me share some more with you.&amp;nbsp; This morning it took me 30 minutes, to travel 3 miles to get ON the freeway.&amp;nbsp; No accidents, no mishaps no construction (other than the seemingly endless road construction that has been underway since I moved here 5 years ago) Just lots and lots and lots and lots of people.&amp;nbsp; Did I mention there were lots of people?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Going to lunch each day usually means traffic.&amp;nbsp; Have to go to the airport?&amp;nbsp; Add 45 minutes to your travel time.&amp;nbsp; I suppose that I should just add more time to everything I plan to do that involved using the roadways, like going out to dinner or seeing a movie.&amp;nbsp; But NOOOO. . . Each time I am caught offguard again by traffic.&amp;nbsp; The movie starts in 30 minutes, the theater is less than 5 miles away.&amp;nbsp; Plenty of time!&amp;nbsp; Not in San Diego. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Anyway see you again soon with more of my shenanigans.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;Today started with birds singing, the sun shining and Zek players moving.&amp;nbsp; The Bazaar is a little better place, the Sol Ro encounter no longer has problems, Maddoc got to sleep in a little later than usual.&amp;nbsp; I played last night and died only once.&amp;nbsp; The coffee cup was nearly full, so the &lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;coffee index &lt;/SPAN&gt;is good.&amp;nbsp; Almost all is right in the world . . .&lt;xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" &gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;Unless you are an EverQuest tailor.&amp;nbsp; Tailors are bit ticked after some recent changes to some of their recipes and rightfully so, I have talked with Maddoc about these changes and he assures me that this is part of a larger, better change that will soon show up on Test server.&amp;nbsp; Normally Maddoc telling me he has a plan is enough to strike terror into my cholesterol choked Halfling heart and start a series of palpations which registers on the local Richter scale like a San Andreas Quake, but this time he had a twinkle in his eye that relayed a knowing, mischievous thought.&amp;nbsp; Similar to what you might have when you watch someone else open a present you bought them for Christmas and you just know they are going to enjoy it.&amp;nbsp; So watch the boards and Test for details on what that change might be.&amp;nbsp; I hope it involves making me some new pants.&amp;nbsp; I could use a decent pair of pants.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;People seem bewildered by our Halfling fascination with coffee.&amp;nbsp; One overzealous fan from Casters Realm, we'll call him "JewelJumper",even asked me, "What's with all the coffee comments?"&amp;nbsp; He obviously doesn't get it.&amp;nbsp; Well "JewelJumper" I recommend that you begin the process of acclimating yourself to the sweet nectar of the coffee bean.&amp;nbsp; Now don't use your smoothie machine.&amp;nbsp; You cannot beat this juice free from it's shell.&amp;nbsp; Once you have massaged the bean into its relaxed state, you must bathe it in hot clear spring water, letting it soak and coercing it to release its bold and strong liquid energy.&amp;nbsp; Take your foo foo smoothies somewhere else "JewelJumper", obviously Erudites have no culinary taste, leave the real drinks to&amp;nbsp;we Halflings.&amp;nbsp;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;Now onto the countdown;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
