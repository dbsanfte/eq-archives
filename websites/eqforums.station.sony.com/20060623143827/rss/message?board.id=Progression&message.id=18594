    <title>So can a dark elf hated in Neriak get in good again?</title>
    <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Progression&amp;message.id=18594</link>
    <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I have played mostly high elves. I am always hated by Tunare in the end. I like to kill things that move. Sisters, bears, treants, anything. Plane of Growth? Great place to raid. Won't catch me avoiding killing anything!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So can a dark elf who has killed things which make him hated at home kill things to make him accepted at home again? Can that faction be moved both ways, whatever faction it is?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I can't use the home command or the faithstone on my high elf. Would be nice if a dark elf cleric could. Even after killing all the dark elf loved NPC in the game a few times. Should be a way to get in good again, ya?&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;It always made me laugh watching the people who like to run around killing anything and everything that moves...then whine when they figure out that they can't get their epic because their faction has been trashed.&amp;nbsp; Just like in the real world there are and should be consequences for your actions...it takes more than just swinging a sword at everything you see to really play the game.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;A part of the game is moving factions around. I personally don't like factions which can only be moved in one direction, such as Tunare. I never whined about being unable to use a soulstone or use the home function because my high elf cleric is KOS to his own guild masters.&amp;nbsp;In fact, this is my answer instead of complaining about the fact the high elf faction cannot be fixed.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I think it's silly that anyone should think a game should be like life, but that's a different discussion. I'm not here to make suggestions&amp;nbsp;for changes.&amp;nbsp;I will just pick another race, this time, rather than bother with being precluded from using some facets of the characters abilities. I just want to know if dark elf will be the right choice.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>Well as a darkelf there's nothing you can kill&amp;nbsp; that will be a&#xD;
one-shot huge faction ruining hit (Like killing Tunare for good elves&#xD;
is). Basicly don't murder your fellow darkelfs and you'll be fine. Is&#xD;
that so hard? Or play an Iksar(When available) and just kill anyone you&#xD;
want. Because everyone hates you anyway..&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
I love faction. I love raising it, lowering it and working on it. Usually I live by a simple rule. &lt;br&gt;&#xD;
1: If it likes me, leave it alone&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
2: If it doesn't like me, there's usually no harm in killing it.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
And shame on any highelf who dares strike Tunare. The only "God" in the&#xD;
game that doesn't try and murder her followers, and you wack her.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Actually, I've spent most of my EQ life playing a human necromancer, and I kill everything and anything, and go on any raid on any target. I take faction hits and enjoy em all! Then I go find what I need to do to change it, if I feel like getting better with some faction or other. It actually adds a lot of interest to the game, for me. I don't really recall now how I managed to make my faction with the Freeport necromancer guild better, but I do remember I found a way. I used to help people with raids on the Qeynos necromancer guild, then go faction back up so they liked me again. I found that fun and interesting.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;With the new changes in Freeport I've had to work on faction again, since the guild hall is rather oddly placed now. &lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>Some of the factions are just impossible to get back it seems. The necro guild is on "The Dead" faction which I haven't found any decent way to raise. The cleric guild I can't remember what their faction is called, but I don't think there is a way for you to raise it if you ruin it. the red wine quest will fix your guard factions for the most part. I forget the best method for fixing indigo brotherhood. its pretty easy to just avoid them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Pretty sure you can raise "The Dead" faction by killing the high elf casters to the East of the Wizard Spires in Nektulos.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Granted it's not a great way to faction, but it's still faction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;The High Elf casters, as was said, is the only way I ever knew of to raise The Dead faction. Some Neriak factions are a bit easier, like handing in greater lightstones to the gypsys in North Karana to raise one of the Dreadguard factions (not sure which) Are the High Elf casters still there since Nektulos was redesigned? The real question here, though, is how are your factions with the "good" caster guilds?? Once you start killing those casters, you will pretty much screw your factions with the casters guilds in Felwithe, AkAnon, Erudin, Qeynos and Freeport, but since you are a dark elf, you are most likely going to be KOS with them anyway unless you worked hard to faction up with them at some point. I think you can kill Rephas in Qeynos Hills and get faction with the evil casters guilds, not sure if the one in Neriak is in there, but I know you get faction with the evil Opal Darkbriar in the Freeport Shadowknight/Necro guild for doing him in, so you may get some Neriak factions killing him, too. Go check out allakhazams. They have a whole section devoted to mobs you can kill or quests you can do to raise your factions. &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
