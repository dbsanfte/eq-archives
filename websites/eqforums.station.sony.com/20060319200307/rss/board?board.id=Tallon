      <description>Now that all servers are merging, ive decided to make a site for everyone to talk instead of having to check multiple forums to see whats happening after merger. Feel free to check out everquestpvp.com. Its a work in progress and hoping to grow along with the merger.</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;After a lengthy discussion between the main powers and the mid end powers of both Tallon Zek and Vallon Zek, Both agreed that it would be in each others interest for a server merger to take place. So we are holding a meeting this coming Sunday on Tallon Zek in the Nexus and all are welcome to attend, the time it will start is 15:00 EST. Please come along and have your say on your Servers Future.&lt;BR&gt;We believe a Sony Rep will also attend, but this has to be confirmed, this is a player inniative solely with our guests there to view and report, we hope.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;We are going to have a joint website which further infomation can be viewed and you are welcome to post there, the website is www.discordiatheguild.org&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This meeting has the solid commitment of Pandamonium, Discordia, Xanadu, Knights of the White Rose, Crystal Shard, plus other smaller guilds of Tallon Zek.&lt;BR&gt;Defiant Order, Ancient Dawn, And two others which the names elude me, and I apologise for that (please post them for me). From Vallon Zek which will also attend.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Channels have been set up for you all to join and voice your views, these will be given on the day, the meeting is hope to last for roughly 30 minutes, but this depends. Further Infomation will be given at the meeting on what we would like to happen and the chances that we have and so that you can also put forward your thoughts. It IS going to be a peaceful meeting and we expect a good outcome, and any rudeness to the Sony Rep will not be tolarated. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Friends from Vallon, you can either make a alt and come on by, or join a channel, though we would prefer to see you in person, so new people can be meet.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;So please tell your friends and join us, The more people we have there, the better chances Sony will hear our cries 0)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Be safe&lt;BR&gt;Prymuz&lt;BR&gt;Officer of Xanadu &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Ok, where has everyone gone? Tallon Zek was around before Vallon Zek, yet we have 34 posts and they have in the hundreds? Thats just not right, our board looks pathetic, we need more peaple posting here to keep it alive. Tallon Zek has got to be better than Vallon Zek. I dunno im just saying the same thing over and over again, just try and post more peaple.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>-=Tallon Zek: Flames Of Hatred Guild Props, Appreciation And Thanks=-</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Tallon&amp;message.id=31#M31</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Hey my character went from being level 19 with no money and some poor equip and now I'm finally level 20, I got new equipment and I had lots of money untill i bought some equip....&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Thanks to my guild "Flames of Hatred"... I have never ever played with a guild that has been so helpful and has always had my back. I can't stress this enough I had someone in my guild help me level to level 20 and gave me 86 plats and a new weapon better than a Dark Reaver and gave me a better mask as well and all this for &lt;U&gt;FREE&lt;/U&gt;. His name is Blahkurzer and he's a level 26 Beserker dwarf and he actually took an hour of his ingame time JUST to help me out. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Also our guild's trader helped me out with a free pair of gaulets in return for 2 cheap items and 35 plats (it was worth WAAAY more). My guild's trader is a troll by the name of Hundredplat! My man! &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I just have to say if you are in Tallon Zek and you feel that you need help and be in a guild I have to say join us "Flames Of Hatred" This is a guild I am highly grateful to be in. We're like a huge brotherhood and everyone on there has to be one of the coolest people alive today in the world of Norrath. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;This props goes out to Blahkurzer,Hundredplat, and the rest of the FLAMES OF HATRED!!!!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;U guys rule! \m/! &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If you guys ever join teh Tallon Zek server be sure to give me a /tell (Jervaz)...&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <title>My suggestions for Tallon Zek as it goes for PvP.  Would love any feed back be good or bad.</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Tallon&amp;message.id=18#M18</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;K.. I'm thinking I should contribute a few suggestions, and then everyone can tear them up and down as need. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;1&amp;gt; For team servers (i.e. Tallon Zek) Hard code it please. Sullon Zek is already like this and TZ needs to be the same along with others. Even if you just make it Light vs Dark, That would be fine. Teams is the whole reason we joined a server like this. If we wanted guild vs guild we would go to Rallos where it is a free for all.&amp;nbsp; Give Rangers and Bards (maybe druids too) to what is considered the dark races. This way if you do hard code it they can have tracking and a decent forage. 50 on an Iksar for foraging is stupid.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;2&amp;gt; Give a 1 hour safe time.&amp;nbsp; This will prevent CCing.&amp;nbsp; After you are killed you have 1 hour to get your corpse and noone can PK you.&amp;nbsp; This will help for people who use wolf illusions when running (hard to tell they aren't wearing any equipment then).&amp;nbsp; It will also give people a chance to loot and thier assassin can't just sit there and keep killing just because they want to be a jerk.&amp;nbsp; Allow for the time to be broken if the victem decides to start another fight.&amp;nbsp; This is fine.&amp;nbsp; But atleast then it is at his own choosing.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;3&amp;gt; Exp gain (though small) and loss for PvP. This encourages PvP but also makes a fear out of it by the potential loss. Fighting in an Arena would be considered recreational and not have these rules. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;4&amp;gt; Daily resets for Plains Only. As I have seen on some servers 1 huge guild gets access to PoT and PoE and then kills any raid that tries to come through and basically keeps it for themselves. This is bad as it limits other guilds from having a fair advantage to the high end items. Kicking people from the zones at say 2am would allow time for a new guild to forge their way in and get some items thus allowing them to compete. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;5&amp;gt; 1 huge disadvantage to guild vs guild. On servers where there is already a dominate guild (i.e. Pande on TZ) switching to these rules only helps them and ruins small guilds that are just forming or don't want to get large like that. Why join a new or small guild when you can just join a feeder and eventually get into Pande?? Sounds like communissim to me. 1 guild will eventually rule all this way. Hard code into teams on servers that want it and this can't happen. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;6&amp;gt; Bounty system. Granted each guild could do this on their own. But I have always loved killing in PvP and if there was a bounty on my head I was happier the larger it was. If there is a way to say for every kill your bounty goes up 50pp, And then the one who kills you get an ear to turn in and get the bounty. This would be a good way to promote PvP plus reward it. It also creates some competition as people try to see who can have the highest bounty. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;7&amp;gt; Final one, I promise. Fix the resists issue. As many try to complain that there is a huge imbalance in PvP, the only one I have ever seen is in the resists. I have an Enchanter, Shadowknight, Rogue, Beastlord, and Necromancer all on a PvP server. Fact of the matter is, if you know how to play your character you can PvP well at any level and versus most other classes without problems. Resists are the big issue though. As the Enchanter is my main I have killed a fair amount but have trouble with people in Time Gear. This is because of the high resists. If with the Tashanian list of spells, It isn't enough to knock down their resists and get some good spells off. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Those are just my suggestions. I'm hoping you could TRY them on the beta server and go from there. As is the great saying "There's no harm in trying." There's also no harm in me asking. So have at it. Support me, ridicule me. It's Just my ideas. Have fun. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3&gt;I look at all the other servers and see massive activity on their message boards. Does everyone really hate each other that much that they cant even&amp;nbsp; communicate openly about their experiences on the message board. Come on guys pull together show some Server Support. I know a PVP server isnt always the most productive but hey its fun right. WOOT !!! And remember Squeeler ROCKS!!&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
