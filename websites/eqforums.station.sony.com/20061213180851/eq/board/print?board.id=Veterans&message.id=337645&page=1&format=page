<div>Kinda silly, no way is a mage pet ever going to outtank even a casual tank. Mage pets don't have 23k hp it's closer to 11-12k unbuffed. They don't have mitigation/avoidace aa or shielding on gear (both obtainable without much effort even as a casual 75). A 75 knight even in weak gear, at 2200-2500ac buffed with shield block/defensives is gonna be getting ~40% accuracy and 6ADI on the high end, and have mitigation aa/shielding to lower DB. Willing to bet the pet is going to tank significantly worse then that and not have enough HP above a casual tank who buffed to 12-13k at 75 to make any realistic difference. It would essentially be a really mana sponge tank that could only tank in a pure caster group.</div><br><hr></blockquote>1. Casual-focused magician air pet with HP AAs is already over 11 K, so 12 K to 13 K unbuffed with pet gear, earth pet has more, and thats the weakest foci.<br>2. Pets *do* have avoidance AAs if you're&nbsp; a mage, they just suck, as well as some shielding on pet gear.<br><br><br>Does the pet tank better than all tanks? Nope. Does the pet tank better than a crappily-geared/AA'ed tank? Prolly. Overall a pet is an effective option depending on the content level.<br></div>
