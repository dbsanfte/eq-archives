    <description>&lt;DIV&gt;This has been bothering me for a while now and Id like to get other peoples view on it.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Back a bit now they fixxed it so when you die you can loot all your items and your body doesnt poof and you lose exp, until the timer runs out or you get a rezz ext ext...&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So why have they not added a Loot All button on your corpse, it just seems like a pain that doesnt need to exist any longer the clicking of each item to return it to your body.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;How about a small push in that direction.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Make it so...&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I'd love to have a loot all button when I'm recoverying from a death as well.&amp;nbsp; My guess for why we don't have it is that the loot window for all corpses is the same, check out the default UI and you'll see that there's only one "Lootwindow" file, &amp;nbsp;whether it's yours or a mob that's been killed, and putting the "loot all" button in would effect them all.&amp;nbsp; While this isn't a major issue in most cases it makes it pretty easy for someone to inadvertently, or intentionally, clean out a raid corpse with a couple mouse clicks.&amp;nbsp; I'm sure this could be overcome with some code changes but it's probably not at the top of&amp;nbsp;the priorities list.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Great idea in concept, I've been thinking the same thing for months, just not sure how difficult it would be to implement.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I think they have resisted this because the ability to loot everything fast has the potential to effect raid mechanics on some encounters ,and make a zerg &amp;amp; rez approach more viable.&amp;nbsp; However, providing a loot-all with an inbuilt delay (say .5 seconds per item?) seems sensible and also would even up the playing field between people with low and high latency somewhat.&amp;nbsp; I'd vote for it too.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;However ... most raid encounters.. are designed with&amp;nbsp;XX people in mind .. and that no one ever dies and the event is pulled off perfectly... &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;in events were people are intended to die there are already death peneltys such as .. skellies during Vish&amp;nbsp; and the ghost things during uqua. &lt;/P&gt;</description>

Raids like Vish and Uqua are designed so it's quite possible to do without death.  The others do not have the death penalty adds because it is far more likely for people to die, or the encounter is not made to be that difficult.  Without the death adds Vish and Uqua would be VERY easy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm not sure where this "x amount of people" started.  With PoP it always seemed like the players could choose to bring however many people they wanted, with the events tuned for a minimum number of people.  Now it seems like they are tuned for an EXACT number of people rather than a minimum number.  There are some in between ones of course.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think a "timer" for looting the corpse with the loot all button would be fine.  Maybe a timer before a corpse could be rezzed could also encompass some extra time to account for looting the corpse also if they wanted to let rezz autoloot, though that seems a bit too powerful perhaps.&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Zunnoab-Stromm on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;06-16-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;02:03 AM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;I think a single click loot all would be good, provided there was some delay mechanism, such as a half to one second delay between looting each item. Basically it makes the old click method the faster one, but a more wrist friendly method availble as well. Such a system should wonly work on your own corpse however.</description>

&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I agree. I have no problem with it taking just as long. Just find it annoying to do all those clicks.</description>

      <description>&lt;font size="2"&gt;Oh, I could hear the ninja looting cries from a mile away on this one.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
(I ment to click link all not loot all !!!)&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Yeah I've thought about how it would be convienient sure, but it can&#xD;
have negative aspects.&amp;nbsp; And really I agreee with it being part of&#xD;
the penalty process and even though it is annoying to loot all&amp;nbsp; 30&#xD;
item slots, there is nothing game destrying about it.&amp;nbsp; A better&#xD;
thing to look at is the lag that errupts when you're looting your&#xD;
corpse and you ahve to click and item 5 or more times just to get the&#xD;
thing looted.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

      <description>That's a good point.  Just flag loot all to NEVER loot nodrop items unless it's from the player's own corpse.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I don't think it's that simple. &lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
What should it do if you already equipped some new items and you hit&#xD;
the button? What if you foraged something?&amp;nbsp; What does it do if&#xD;
there is not enough room?&amp;nbsp; Obviously the simple solution would be&#xD;
to equip any items that you had on you before, if possible, then put&#xD;
any bags or top level items in your inv that you had before, if&#xD;
possible, then fill open bag spaces with stuff left over, if possible,&#xD;
then leave the rest on the corpse.&amp;nbsp; Still, there are more pressing&#xD;
matters I'm sure that they are working on and the possibility for item&#xD;
poofing bugs etc seems to always be there with stuff like this so while&#xD;
they have said they would like to do it (I think) it's not something&#xD;
they can just implement instantly.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
The "penalty" aspect could easily be kept by simply making a cast timer that varies based on how many items are on the corpse.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;So why have they not added a Loot All button on your corpse&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;

&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;There are several threads on this already.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;You can not loot all your items at once because the time and effort it takes to re-equip yourself is part of the penalty of death. It is one of the few remaining aspects of realism I think we should keep.&lt;/P&gt;</description>
