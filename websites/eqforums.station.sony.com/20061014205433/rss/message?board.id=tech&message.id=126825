    <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Hello,&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;A little history: I have not been able to use my ingame email since it was introduced (DoN expansion, I think). I sent a few petitions and emails to support. I have searched any and all forums, try'd knowledge base and have done everything that has been asked of me by the support staff. It has never been fixed. My email icon in game continues to be highlited in red and everytime I attempt to send a message I get "The Universal Chat Service is unavailable, your message has not been sent". It was annoying but never really a big deal, when people said they would email me. I told them it wasnt working and we found alternative ways to communicate.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Since yesterdays patch: Now it appears the chat channels have been connected to or associated with the Universal Chat Service. This for me means goodbye to all chat channels. Now this is an issue. I cannot join any chat channels. I get the message of "Please wait while we connect you to the Universal Chat Service, please wait while we reconnect" It never connects. I need to know how or what I can do to fix this.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Anaylsis: This is a huge deal for me now and may be the end of EQ for me. I had 9 chat channels and love to chat w/ the people in them. Aside from not being able to chat and have fun, I cant join any app channels if I wish to app to a guild. I cannot read any raid channels, hell I may not be able to get in the /rs channel, (havent tried that yet). I cannot join any class channels etc etc. You get the point.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I have tried everything that support has suggested but nothing has helped an nothing seems to be relevant to my problem, but I try them anyway. I will gladly try anything support has to offer, just would be nice to have somebody try to help me rather than just getting a canned answer of "try a complete file check". Can anybody help or point me in the direction for some help or let me know that this is an issue for others? I will gladly post more specific info but I beleive others have had this problem or somebody knows what is happening. Thanks for any feedback. This is very frustrating.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;Great, just got back from a week's vacation, and ran into this problem. I have cablevision of NY, and they too block ports 9875-9876, etc.... Other ISPs are not an option currently, so no more EQ for me if this isn't fixed. I realize that it's not Sony's fault the port is misued by some virus/trojans, however, given that ISPs do block port 9875, 9876, it wouldn't be unreasonable to request a simple change of the port number to another random port such as 19875, etc...&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;Okay, I escalated this at Cablevision, and they claim they do not block ports except incoming port 25. I have no access to any chat channels, although everything else works. I have verified the nat translations on my firewall, and the port isn't blocked. Any ideas?</description>

&lt;P&gt;I am still unable to connect the cross-server chat (chat channels) or the Universal chat services. Everytime I /afk, /join, /list, or any similar command I get the Universal chat error, but it does show me as AFK.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I called Suscom and they state that port 9875 was unblocked on Thursday(06/15). I uninstalled Anti-virus and the Firewall, went straight from the&amp;nbsp;computer to the modem (skipping router) and have no chat on either PC. The old one patched and had no ohter issues. The new one I reformatted after fighting DirectX 9.0c for 3 days, so they do not have identical files.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Can there be any other cause for this other than a blocked port by ISP? Was the port changed from 9875? How can I fix this?&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;I hate to bump, but I still can not use the chat services. I saw 1 Suscom user say theirs is working and Suscom says they have unblocked the port.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Can anyone give me an idea on what I could do to fix not being able to join chat channels? It worked fine until the the 6/20 patch. 1 pc had a /format done due to frustrations in downloading&amp;nbsp; Dx9c, the other patched fine. Neither can use chat channels and as posted above, I disconnected the router to eliminate it and&amp;nbsp;uninstalled Antivirus and firewalls.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;My guild has been understanding about my inability to /join channels and perform my duties, but I can not continue to play like this.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Thanks for any help.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>If theirs is working and yours isn't, it's likely due to a firewall or router on your end.  You may try actually uninstalling anything network related that isn't your OS, the game, and your modem.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Thank you for the Reply TSR-JasonC. I have only EQ and Magelo installed on one of the PC's and nothing else. I did disconnect the router, uninstall the firewall and antivirus, and Suscom states the modem is merely a pass-through and couldn't block anything. The modem is an Arris (sp?)&amp;nbsp;cable modem the installation disc for it was simple instructions, "connect the cables" , and no configuration for it.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Are there any settings in the windows/Bios or any EQ files that could affect this? Are any other Suscom users able to use the chat services? Is it possible that locally Suscom has not opened the port?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Thank you for any help.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

But it looks like both of the others do live in the Mississippi area, using Suscom as their ISP.  One had put techsupport on speed dial :).  But Suscom took their info and such, eventually replied that the problem is isolated to the local network but Suscom said they could not give a timeframe on when the problem would be resolved.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But anyone else affected and live in the above area, do not stop your efforts, but also remember to stay calm when speaking with the techs :)</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;I spoke with a tech (Charlene) on Sunday night and&amp;nbsp;she said everything on Suscom end was working and unblocked. After I persisted she had me email the information from doing a "statnet -nt"&amp;nbsp; in the command window and said she would&amp;nbsp;forward&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;the information to the Engineering.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I was logged in until about 5 Pm CST today and chat was still not working. I will relog when I get home in the morning and see if it has changed.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>I had this problem with my Voyager 205 and Pipex (UK ISP). I went into my router and opened port 9875/9876 and now it all works. Cheers!&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Well, I've recently started living on campus at Berry and I am very upset that I can't use chat service OR friends. I havn't put requests in to the Berry IT department yet to have the ports unblocked but will be soon, but not without the expectation of a firm "NO" due to the numerious hazards of port 9875. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have read through this topic and I am also very upset to see Sony's inability to care. Channels and friends lists are a vital part of the game (which used to work), and now I cannot use them. I was hoping to see a solution towards the end of this topic, but all I see is people settling for a sub-par Sony solution (to have your ISP unblock). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Any new information or am I "sol" as everyone else has been bickering about?&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Hello &lt;FONT color=#f8bc04&gt;mistor-andderson&lt;/FONT&gt;, &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I am sorry but the best thing I can suggest from here would&amp;nbsp;be to /feedback not using port 9875 for universal chat, I have less control over policy than you do.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Haun if you still have a problem call and ask for DAVE the manager.&amp;nbsp; He will fix it.&amp;nbsp; He called me later tonight to apoligize for all the trouble and to tell anyone that is still having problems to contact him.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;Thank you for the Reply TSR-JasonC. I have only EQ and Magelo installed on one of the PC's and nothing else. I did disconnect the router, uninstall the firewall and antivirus, and Suscom states the modem is merely a pass-through and couldn't block anything. The modem is an Arris (sp?)&amp;nbsp;cable modem the installation disc for it was simple instructions, "connect the cables" , and no configuration for it.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Are there any settings in the windows/Bios or any EQ files that could affect this? Are any other Suscom users able to use the chat services? Is it possible that locally Suscom has not opened the port?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Thank you for any help.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;there should be a detailed label on the bottom of the modem giving the exact spelling of the manufacturer and the model number can you post that please.</description>
