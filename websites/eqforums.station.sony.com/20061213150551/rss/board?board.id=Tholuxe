&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;Alarius is a Pacific Standard Time raiding guild on the Cazic Thule server. We are currently looking for a few good people that play the following classes: Bards, Clerics, Wizards, Warriors, Rogues, Mages, Beastlords, Bezerkers (do they exist?) and Necromancers. We raid 4 days a week (Sunday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday from 9:00 PST to 12:00 PST.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;Our current focus is GoD/OoW/DoN, with our membership poised to enter Tacvi and Anguish shortly. Due to our short raiding hours we tend to move through content quickly and efficiently. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;If you feel that Alarius might be a fit for you and you with us, visit our message boards at http://www.alariusofbrell.com/portal.php . You may contact Idienie, Bsharyd or Kyeria via an in-game tell or a private message at our board.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>Keepers of the Glade</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Tholuxe&amp;message.id=109#M109</link>
      <description>:smileyhappy:&#xD;
&#xD;
Hey everyone. My name is Lionhearted and I'm an officer at Keepers of the Glade. I just wanted to offer people a chance to become a member of our fine guild. We are radically different from many other guilds on the server: we stress a casual and family atmosphere. Many members are family and friends from real life, others are friends from in the game - but that is definately what our guild stresses above all: forming strong bonds to make the game fun beyond collecting uber loot from AMobofUltimateDestruction_06...&#xD;
&#xD;
Keepers of the Glade is a guild that stresses finding other guildies on guildchat and go grouping with them to lay back and kick some butt. However, that doesn't mean we don't have goals. As a growing guild we have become quite able to tackle many raid targets and soon hope to be in the elemental planes with the help of our friends Reign of the Phoenix and Stellar Intentions. Collectively, we field a full raid force capable of taking out many PoP mobs - so if you like to raid you can still do it here ... without any worry about meeting demands placed on you by most raiding guilds. You won't gear up in time, but like I said, we don't stress the fun in becoming uber... we much prefer our bonds in obtaining our longterm goals. &#xD;
&#xD;
Finally, Keepers of the Glade has one distinction that makes it stand out from all other guilds on our server: our history. We have a long and proud history on Tholuxe Paells, even if its about to become The Rathe. Our guild is one of the first EVER created on the server and likely the oldest active one left. Many of our members have been around for a very long, a few even from the beginning. I wouldn't even consider myself an old guildie despite the fact I've been a Keeper since early 2003. &#xD;
&#xD;
If Keepers of the Glade sounds interesting to any of you, head to www.keepersoftheglade.com and have a second look. Feel free to post to our recruit section of the forums or the general forum and say hello. Contact myself (lionhearted) in game or any other officer (if you need to get in touch with an officer, members will be helpful and tell you whose on that's an officer). We're looking for anyone who thinks this sounds like a good guild, but do have special needs for many of the critical classes such as enchanters, clerics, etc, but there aren't any rules on specific class or AA requirements.</description>

&lt;P&gt;I got&amp;nbsp;a Shiny cog earring&amp;nbsp;yesterday in a Gm scavenger hunt event in steamfont .&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It was cool there was a server wide announcement that the king of ak'anon needed help restocking items for the tinkerers of the city and to show iup in steamfont if you wanted to help. I showed up seeing as i was playing my druid at the time i figured i could port in and at least wsee what was up. then 2 gm played npcs said they were going to give a list of 40 items that the 30 or so of us that showed had to find within the hour. We knowing i couldn't get many as a few were PoI drops, more than half were tinkered items and about 1/8th were random items like HQ metal rings and mana batteries, gears and sprockets found on random trash i got a few of the items and resigned myself to not going to win but went back before the hour was up to see who would. &lt;BR&gt;At the end of the hour they started asking who had found how many and amazingly enough i had gotten enough to get 3rd place and recieve this item. The first place got a new title and the int cog earring the second place got the wisdom cog earring but hey this one works for me for now. The gms went on to say that a celebration would be help at ak'anon and made a server wide announcement but only 3 of us stuck around and no one else showed so they gave out food alcohol and decent bobby prizes for those of us who stuck around. &lt;BR&gt;Just want to let everyone know my good fortune and thank the Gm and Guides for their hard work. It is always nice to see they still have an interest in us and that players still have an interest in playing. By the way first place was a Iksar named Branwack (maybe spelled wrong sorry if it is) and second was Gadjett a gnome.&lt;/P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT size=1&gt;&lt;SPAN class=sm&gt;----------------------------&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;Ulysis Ironoak, 55 BST of the Tribunal &lt;BR&gt;Braken Ironoak, 51 Druid of Karana &lt;BR&gt;Vzinn, 46 Necro of Cazic-Thule the Faceless&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Hey All&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; A Bard by the name of &lt;SPAN class=postbody&gt;Mariachi trained us 3 times, he trains people all over OOW.&amp;nbsp; Having grouped with him once he is also just about the worst Bard on the server..&amp;nbsp; The player is a total meance to all that cross his path.&amp;nbsp; After getting trained got multiple reports from other guildies about him.&amp;nbsp; One was when he was on an alt and got in an arguement, he abrupty logged his player, logged on his bard and trained a Named on top of the group..&amp;nbsp; He has Alts of &lt;SPAN class=postbody&gt;Lamuerta, Willnever, Redcruz, Chuta.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN class=postbody&gt;&lt;SPAN class=postbody&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN class=postbody&gt;&lt;SPAN class=postbody&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; So Please if you see him in the zone and your not able to absorb a train stay clear of him.&amp;nbsp; He has been petitioned multiple times, we have screenshots etc, but SOE still has done nothing about it:(&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <title>Eternal Sovereign - Guild</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Tholuxe&amp;message.id=98#M98</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Eternal Sovereign is looking to add some new members. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The guild is currently looking for more players to join us. Basically we want loyal people who can raid in EST prime time and want to enjoy the game. The Guild is currently raiding Time, KT trials, and have added OOW to the menu. Applicants to open classes should have or be working towards getting vexd/tipt trials &amp;amp; EP/Time flagged in order to join us on raids. ES does have an established Tipt team that is dedicated to getting new members through that trial. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Our usual raid times are 7pm to 12am EST. 5 Days a week. We are looking to add players who can raid most nights during the entire five hour window, or even earlier or later. We are not looking to change the casual nature of the guild, but we want to get the most we can out of the Elemental Planes, GoD, and OOW. To do this, we need a few more active raiders. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;We are a casual raid guild. That means we do not have a mandatory raid requirement like most high end guilds. All we ask is that you remain relatively active in the guild and try your best to attend raids. Most of our members have significant real life commitments, be they work, school or family, and we understand real life can kick you around sometimes. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;We are not power gamers, nor do we want to be. But, we are a guild of skilled players whose goals are still to have fun and continue to progress through the toughest mobs in game. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Recruiters: Sonami, Kethra or any officer &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Please see the website for specifics: &amp;nbsp;http://eternalsovereign.com/&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>I had a virus hit my windows system directory (only) and I have finally been able to recover all the rest of the information.  the EQ directory is intact, but the .exe can't find the dll's since the registry is clean of installation info.  is there a way I can just get the registry info started so that the files can go on their own (and I assume the the patcher will put all files up to current.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reinstalling from cd would be major pita.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks,&lt;br&gt;Jason/Rey</description>

      <title>Any casual player guild on TP?</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Tholuxe&amp;message.id=84#M84</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I've tried a few guilds but my play time ability wasn't up to their standards.&amp;nbsp; I can only play about 8 to 10 hours a week and mostly on the weekends.&amp;nbsp; I see a lot of other players looking for groups and it seems that only Uber players are allowed into guilds anymore.&amp;nbsp; I like to do dungeon dives, exploritory adventures and a little farming.&amp;nbsp; Life is too short to be sitting on my butt waiting for a camping spot to play 100 hours for a rare spawn's rare drop.&amp;nbsp; Was wondering if there were any casual guilds where players of the "I'm pretty cool to play with,&amp;nbsp; not anally attached to leveling and into experiencing the game for its unique landscapes and friendly players" hang out?&amp;nbsp; I'm also on a west coast time slot (seems many of the guilds believe time stops at the ozarks).&amp;nbsp; Have a 57 Mage, 40 Ranger, 30 Necro and usually have a good time whenever I'm in a group.&amp;nbsp; I think raiding guilds are like pyramid scams, seems like a good idea for everyone, but only a few seem to profit by them.&amp;nbsp; Oh well! Will check back to see if I get and answer.:smileyvery-happy:&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
