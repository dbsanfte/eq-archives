      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;BB even with a uncapped shield and a avoid disc we would still be &amp;quot;secondary&amp;quot; I could have a 90 second defensive just like yours and still be secondary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem is you don't understand &amp;quot;secondary&amp;quot;. Secondary systems are back up systems that can carry the full load of the primary for short periods. Back up generators, back up pumps, back up shields. Most weapons systems in todays military have primary and secondary systems add noseum to increase survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are not &amp;quot;secondary&amp;quot; like an afterthought. Being able to rez like paladins is nice but not relavant to tanking, FD is nice excape tool and I can certainly pull occastionally with it but again it isn't relavant to tanking. Niether rezing or FD increase a paladin's or sk's tanking ability. All they are is an woops you died here I can rez you or a woops I agroed half the town better FD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I MA in the pit generally and I'm one of the add tanks in the Hanvor fight. The point I was makeing is that you seem more concered about a knight..a tank class....tanking even a short period than a monk, rogue or ranger. 30 seconds uncaped wouldn't kill your slot becuse it can't trump 3 mins uncaped. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If the mob slowed can be tanked without defensive then I could tank it anyway. Is that it? Your worrid the 30 seconds would be enough time to establish slow?  I doubt any guild would have any knight tank those mobs reguardless even if they had 30 seconds because 3 mins is 6 times more leeway. The only Time I am Tank in those situations is if the warriors are all dead. That's only if I am nearby and not messing with adds. The Harrier fight I never even see the boss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As it is, they will upgrade the thing. Things like spells or this vie defensive are set for a certain level and when we advanced passed it then they upgrade for the next level. Next time it might be 45 seconds with 20k cap or 60 seconds with a 30k cap. Those would scale downward.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Why are you whining about 2 expansion old farm mobs Frod, you should be tanking some of the mobs in PoR that are 10K hitters. You know, the most brutal of battles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>How would soul shield being uncapped or knights having an avoidance disc in any way make warriors not the most surviveable class? Even if knights had both  they are dwarfed by your discs,&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Knights are secondary hybrid tanks/casters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How would me being able top FD/pet pull with 90% of your effectiveness be broken? You'd still have a lead in the ability.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;OR How would me being able to 88% res, buff like a level 66 Paladin be baaroken? 70 Paladins would still have a lead on me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Uning ONLY Warrior intended greater survivability to compare classes again sir?&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>The simple reality is that warriors understand the power of avoidance abilities. They understand the advantage that having them gives warriors over knights. They recognize that at times you can gimp content simply by being a warrior. Tipt was the biggest slap in the face representation of that, 68.3 comes pretty darn close. The fact that an 8k/1.9k unbuffed warrior was able to tank 68.3 while at nearly 11khp and 2500 ac unbuffed it took me 3 tries to get through it and only the 3rd time because I had a boatload of nuker DPS and DI fired, is pretty disgusting. While I can now at 12k/3100 unbuffed tank it with little problems I'm required to get over geared to do what a warrior can do simply for being a warrior.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Soul Shield isn't useless at all, it's nice to use when you have it, but it supplies the warriors with ammunition of saying you already have a tank disc and denying knights from getting what we need and are entitled to.  No beastlords don't have an avoidance disc, but they do have a short term mitigation disc that is powerful enough to carry you through those emergency situations. Soul Shield falls short of that most of the time, if you otherwise would of died you still probably will unless you were just barely on that line. Knights being the only classes to face that shortcoming is not warranted at all, nor worthy for 2 of 3 true tank classes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;30 seconds uncapped wouldn't make us &amp;quot;raid tanks&amp;quot; It might mean we can finish a mob off but we wouldn't be the first to go against it. Besides Frodlin you rather have a raid boss finished off with a knight tanking it..an actual tank class..or a rogue?, beastlord?, monk?  Several have different avoidance abilities. Rangers out last knights in Tacvi because 24 seconds of no damage is 24 seconds. String three rangers together and you have a min for the mages and wizards to finish the mob off. We did that in Fire only had 4 rangers so had almost 90 seconds plus.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Once your entire guild is mostly anguish geared, just about anyone in your guild can tank Keld once he is slowed... whats your point. Monks, Wizards, Chanters etc.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You're so close yet so far...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think how a 30 second 25% disc with no HP cap on it would be different when he's in full unslowed undebuffed mode compared with one with the cap, insofar as determing who's doing the tanking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>To be honest no it doesn't matter one bit. If 30 seconds of 25% mitigation disc is going to mean the difference between a knight MTing something or not MTing it then your guild just has some serious issues. For the most part the only raidbosses knights are tanking, they aren't MTing you are just having all your tanks agro the mob with the hopes that one of your tanks will get agro and assist healing (mobs like Zi-Thuuli or Vule with hatelist clearing abilities). If that's the case all of your tanks can probably tank it just fine without discing anything. If the mob doesn't have any memblurring effects then there is literally no benefit to having a knight tank it whether they could soul shield for a full 30 seconds or not, a warrior would still do like 180% better job.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An avoidance disc would likewise not make knights a MT choice on any mob they weren't already going to be tanking. It would give a knight an increased ability to pull a mob and tank it for a bit when all the warriors went down to allow you to rez a warrior or camp a cleric, but warriors already make like 1000% better secondary MTs because of the glory of AE taunt so again who really cares?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It would help knights on groups like the before mentioned missions and it would effectively remove that gimp warrior edge from the game. If you can justify a gimp warrior tanking something then you can't really justify a gimp knight not being able to tank it too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Not much, considering the difference on kth is unlikely more than 5-10 seconds more disced tanking.&amp;nbsp; A guild that's new to anguish isn't killing the first 5 adds in 30 seconds, either.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;i&gt;"It only takes 3 to slow him... 5 cuts down his ramp"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Sorry, I'm usually too busy down in the pit to notice exactly what's going on with keld.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I checked my log- on monday, it took us 1:09 to kill 3 pit mobs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tell me again, what does a 10k capped mitigation disc that fades in 20-25 sec vs an uncapped mitigation disc that fades in 30 seconds have to do with a knight tanking keldovan (especially when that knight is better suited to other roles in the encounter)?&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I agree that knights are better used elsewhere, that's almost always the case, but what I'm pointing out is why the thing is capped... it's mobs like that.  I'm not saying it's a travesty or anything, just pointing out why the limit is there, something which you've completely agreed with me on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, it takes us less than 30 seconds to hose the 3rd named, it's just a matter of how you do allocate resources.   That fight's pretty darned fast.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I know why the cap is there.&amp;nbsp; I'm just pointing out it makes very, very little difference in the tank of choice for that particular mob.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It may take you &amp;lt; 30 seconds, but you're also equipped well beyond anguish, making 5-10 seconds of a difference disced a moot point.&amp;nbsp; 1:09 is a raid of about 45 mostly qvic and tacvi geared.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
