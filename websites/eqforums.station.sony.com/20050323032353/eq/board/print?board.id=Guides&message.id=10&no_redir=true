<P><STRONG>Faction FAQ 4.5<BR></STRONG><FONT color=#006600>*****************************************</FONT><BR><STRONG>What is faction?</STRONG><BR>In essence, faction is how much a specific group (faction) likes or dislikes you based on your Race/Class/Religion and what actions you have accomplished.<BR>Every NPC/Monster has some sort of faction some can not be changed (Centaurs in South Karana), some are all by themselves (Lady Shae on FelGuard faction in Freeport Inn), and still others are part of a group of factions (Iksar Monks are on the Swifttail Faction).<BR>Every player is considered to be on the faction of their guild (make an Iksar Monk you are a Swifttail), but Players are always indifferent to other Players. Faction is only relevant to NPC’s.<BR>Every NPC will view you favorably, angrily, or all points in between depending upon where you stand in regard to their faction. Example: Iksars are automatically hated by all the races, but are tolerated by some of the more shady/evil religions/classes. A Paladin of Freeport may be loved by the citizens of Freeport, yet hated by the Shadow Knights of Freeport.<BR><FONT color=#006600>*****************************************</FONT><BR><STRONG>Why do I need to be concerned with faction?<BR></STRONG>1st -- The obvious answer is – if your faction is bad enough, NPCs will attack you on site. Really annoying if you are at a merchant selling and a wandering guard is KOS (Kill on Sight) to you and whacks you dead, before you even realize you are being attacked.<BR>2nd -- If you want to buy/sell with merchants, you will have to raise your faction if you are dubious, since merchants will not buy and sell unless you are viewed Apprehensive or better. (NOTE: Sneak Skill makes you automatically Indifferent to a merchant when you are behind them).<BR>3rd – Better faction will make for better prices when buying/selling from a merchant (but Charisma has a greater affect in this area).<BR>4th – Many quests require you to be at a certain faction before you can do these Quests. (My Iksar Monk had to kill enough Orcs in Commonlands to go from “Ready to attack” to “Amiable” before I could do the Human Monk Belt Quests and I had to get to Indifferent before they would even train me).<BR>5th – Having many places where you can bank is a good thing, but being able to reach the bank may require you to cross the path of many other factions.<BR><FONT color=#006600>*****************************************<BR></FONT><STRONG>What are the Faction standings?</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG></STRONG><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Ally = +4 1450 to 2500<BR>Warmly = +3 1100 to 1450<BR>Kindly = +2 750 to 1100<BR>Amiable = +1 150 to 750<BR>Indifferent = 0 0 to 150<BR>Apprehensive = -1 0 to -150<BR>Dubious = -2 -150 to -750<BR>Threateningly = -3 -750 to -1100<BR>Ready to Attack = -4 -1100 to -2500 </P>
<P>Easily put your standings from the point of Indifference are explained above: <BR>Each faction step up to a specific faction equals a 1 grade increase to how NPCs on that faction view you. The same works for losing faction standing with a group. The last column of numbers are roughly the amount of faction hits it takes to go up or down a level. These numbers are based on “Old parsing data” and have been subject to disagreement. Use them as a guide and not the end all be all.<BR><FONT color=#006600>*****************************************<BR></FONT><EM>NOTE:</EM> Creatures that con Threateningly or Ready to Attack – may attack you if you get too close to them (or within their agro range) and Merchants who are Dubious to you will not sell to you. 
<P>Also At both Ally and Ready to Attack you can continue taking faction hits to a point (roughly that point at 2500 faction hits from 0) until it reaches the point “where you faction can no longer get any better/worse. If you reach this point you are max/lowest faction standing with that group, but you still remain Ally/Ready to Attack. <BR><FONT color=#006600>*****************************************</FONT><BR><STRONG>Is there a point to continue to raising my faction when I hit the low tier of Ally to max Ally?</STRONG><BR>With certain quests you have to be at the higher end of a faction level, before you will be offered it. When I first reached Amiable with the human monks they wouldn’t offer me the human monk belt quest. I killed many more orcs, went back and was still Amiable yet now they offered me the quests for the belt. I needed to be High Amiable to be offered the quest, which lends itself to the theory that quests require the Player to have reached a specific point value in the faction standing. So then +200 Amiable on the above faction list is different than +500 Amiable.<BR><FONT color=#006600>*****************************************</FONT><BR><STRONG>How can I raise/lower my faction rating with a group?<BR></STRONG>Generally, killing NPCs or completing quests will raise/lower factions, but you must always be aware that similar creatures may offer different faction adjustments depending upon what zone you are in. 
<P><EM>Example 1:</EM> Killing an Orc in East Commonlands will lower your faction with the Deathfist Orcs (Those orcs in and around the Commonlands) But raise your faction with the Warriors of Rivervale, the Paladins of Freeport, the Monks of Freeport, and the Citizens of the Commonlands. Killing the Orcs in Crushbone, will alter your faction with a variety of Elf factions in the Faydark zones. Also killing the orcs in HighPassHold will alter factions related to that zone. Not all orcs are allied to or against the same set of factions. 
<P>Also, two NPCs have the name Opal Darkbriar: Head of the Casters Guild in W Freeport and Head of the Evil Clerics in E Freeport. Yet the faction of Opal Darkbriar refers only to the Evil Cleric (The caster being on Arcane Scientist faction).<BR><BR><EM>Example 2:</EM> If I turn in (for Quest) an Orc Scalp (off a Shralok Orc or Crushbone Orc) to Captain Ashlan in HighPassHold I will get Faction Increases with 5 Various factions (Guards and Merchants of HPH, Freeport Militia, CorruptQeynosGuards, and the Head of HighHoldKeep) with no faction decreases. 
<P>Depending upon what the quest does, or for which group the quest is for, may determine which factions are raised or lowered. Do a quest for one group that is hated by another group and your faction standing may go up for the quest giver and down for the opposing faction. Same for killing creatures: The Deathfist orcs give good factions with those groups that are in direct contention with it (monks, paladins, citizens and Halfling Warriors). 
<P>Be aware that some factions can not be raised once lowered. Kill a fairy in Faydark and you will begin to ruin your faction for all of those fairies with no known way to raise it back up.<BR><FONT color=#006600>*****************************************</FONT><BR><STRONG>How do I know point wise where I am on the faction table?</STRONG><BR>There really isn’t any guaranteed way to know, but if you do a quest or kill a mob to the point that your faction changes, you can be pretty sure you are at the lowest tier of that faction. 
<P>The only you can find you standing is to “con” a creature. From a distance, target an NPC and hit the ‘c’ key on your keyboard. This will return a message in a color. The color refers to the relative danger/level of the mob in order of difficulty: Red (most deadly), Yellow, White (even to your level, but generally too dangerous to solo), Dark Blue, Light Blue (easy, and will still give experience), Green (easiest and will not give experience). The message will mention the faction standing (Ally, Indifferent, Ready to Attack, etc…)<BR><FONT color=#006600>*****************************************</FONT><BR><EM>Note:</EM> not all quests or mobs give the same faction change. <BR>Killing a Kobold in the Warrens gives you about a 1 point towards raising your factions with the guards of Erud. Killing a named Kobold (Cook, Prince, King) gives you about a 5 point increase with Guards of Erud. Killing the Heretic Elial Brooks in Toxxulia Forest gives you about a 20 point faction increase with the Casters of Erud; however, killing the Heretic Elial Brooks lowers your faction with the Heretics by about 25 points. Heretic faction can be fixed by slaughtering many Kobolds, but it drops faster than the caster faction raises. Generally bad faction changes are larger than good faction changes. 
<P>Also, the Inert Potion Quest in Erud Palace raises five hard to raise factions, but not equally. So when questing or killing and many different factions raise/lower –they may not raise all the same rate and generally will lower factions faster than raising them.<BR><FONT color=#006600>*****************************************</FONT><BR><STRONG>Are there faction caps?</STRONG><BR>Yes, depending upon your Race/Class/Religion will depend upon how high you can go with other factions. My Iksar Monk (Evil Race/neutral class/evil religion) with most “Good” factions can get up to Kindly and then get no better, with most “Evil” group I can get up to Warmly before I can get no better, and with many “neutral” groups I can get up to ally. There are exceptions, but too many to be concerned with here. 
<P>There is also a sort of faction cap going the other way with all groups on a “Merchant” faction. (Remember, not all folks who sell items are on a “Merchant” faction). The faction will cap at “Dubious”, but the point standing will continue to drop until you hit the negative 2500 point value. 
<P><EM>Example:</EM> My Iksar Monk cons “Ready to Attack” to the banker of Kelethin, but dubious to the Merchants. They are both on the same faction. I raise my Merchant faction enough points and find that I am now Dubious to the Banker yet I am still Dubious to the Merchants. That is because of the downside cap to merchant faction.<BR><FONT color=#006600>*****************************************<BR></FONT>Okay – you want to know what quests are available or creatures to kill to get in good with specific factions, or just want to know what factions are in which area. There are many online guides and sites that offer tips, but in reality only one site is needed to garner about all the info you want. (Check Illia’s Bestiary for faction info)<BR>http://everquest.allakhazam.com/<BR>And if they don’t have the answer you want, they will have a link to a site that does. </P></DIV>
