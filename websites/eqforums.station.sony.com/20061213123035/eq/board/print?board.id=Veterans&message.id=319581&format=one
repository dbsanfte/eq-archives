...you know, others have said it, but wth?&nbsp; "oh i used to solo just fine there before OOC regen, but now i cant use OOC regen there and it sucks!"<BR><BR>dang people, stop whining just for the sake of whining!<BR>

<P>There is nothing logical about that.&nbsp; I mean if they had increased mana regen rates in every exp zone but poh you wouldnt go "oh clearly your still just as good to go to poh".&nbsp; If they had removed HP from every mob in the game but those of PoH you wouldnt tell us how PoH was still just as good.&nbsp; How about this if one day you logged in and it was harder to get mana back in PoH than every other exp zone in the game you wouldnt say PoH was still just as good would you?&nbsp; Thats pretty much what happened...</P>
<P>Its relative.&nbsp; When you retune the ENTIRE exp game and leave off one zone that some people liked to use for some what arbitrary and imprecisely applied reasons you do in fact change plane of hate by virtue of leaving it "old school" while every other zone got "easier small group and solo mode".&nbsp; In the end an inefficient play zone is detirmined by its peers and not by itself.&nbsp; By themselves each zone is perfectly tuned.&nbsp; Relative to others is where they get screwed.</P>
