&lt;DIV&gt;Honestly I like to have all my gear mean something, if I'm only going to use 6k mana why bother having the other 4k or so?&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Well then I guess ALL my gear is meaningless.&amp;nbsp; SInce I rarely go below 90% mana (of 10k) even in RSS I guess I only need 1k mana and since I have 2k without any gear at all I guess I can go nekkid :smileyvery-happy:....Yeah right, whatever.&amp;nbsp; (joking btw)&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The point is that in most &lt;U&gt;group&lt;/U&gt; situations you do not&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;U&gt;absolutely need&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;to med to full mana in order to continue XPing.&amp;nbsp; As I said, I will typically get to 30% and then med along the way using Yaulp and sitting when I can, and normally within ten minutes I am back to 90%+.&amp;nbsp; Anyone can do this you just have to be "mana efficient": use cheal whenever possible and use your other tools (DvA and epic 1.52.0&amp;nbsp;[if you have it], CR and EB) liberally.&amp;nbsp; If you don't have these other tools, then yes you probably do need to med up more than I do, but again, unless your group is sucking you dry, you should never&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;U&gt;have&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; to med to full before continuing after a death.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Soloing is a different matter.&amp;nbsp; When I solo I never go below 50% mana (unless I die). When I hit 50% I know it's time to sit and med to full.&amp;nbsp; My reasoning is simple:&amp;nbsp; If I go to 0% mana and then med and a wandering mob walks in, the best I can do is run away.&amp;nbsp; If in this same situation I am at 50% mana I can and do take on that mob and then sit and med again.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Anyway, I think this deserves a thread of it's own. At any rate, especially at the high end with 9k+ pools the&amp;nbsp; downtime is rediculous. So here are my thoughts:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;1. An aa that allows for sitting mana regeneration while sitting, or sharply increases the percentage per tick. Like increase mana regeneration 5%/10%/15% ect.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;2. Raise med skill post 65.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;3. Raise mana preservation from 20% to 25% and 30%.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;4. Increase current FT cap post 65 to 20 innately, while allowing the AA to take it to 25. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;5. Reconfigure Meditation skill instead of a specific amount of mana regeneration per tick, it goes to&amp;nbsp; a percentile of mana per tick based on skill. This way the ability scales with mana pool.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Getting back on subject now:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I believe the best option is to configure mana regen to work like health regen - the longer you sit the better regen you get.&amp;nbsp; However the second you stand up the process starts again.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

It will probably be the route they go eventually since the Health version of it has worked well; it will just take a few more months of convincing them to get to that point.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;the other trick is combat med rate vs non-combat med rate.... non-combat should have a significant bonus applied to it, since its pure dead time, while combat is an endurance test, so the minimum rates apply.&amp;nbsp; Thats why I suggested a non-combat rate bonus instead of a sitting rate bonus.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I can only speak from subjective experience, so I have no mathmatical proof. But Yaulping for me appears to regen faster mana, as I said before it is rare to go under 80% mana in a fast pulling Don Creator mission. And this is casting Pious elixer every mob, doing spot heals on group members, recasting debuffed Conviction&amp;nbsp;and somettimes topping off tank with CH. My VIE usually needs to be recast about every 3rd to 4th pull and I do see a damage taken difference on the MA with and without Panalopy of VIie.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;And I am far from being an uber cleric, but I am a very experienced cleric from&amp;nbsp;playing this char for 6 years on and off.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;With the 'expansive mind' AAs you can reach an FT cap of 20. With elixer of greater concentration (if you can afford them) this raises FT to 23.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I only have a 5300 mana pool, I am doing DoN Creator missions to get that up with Augments. I can keep a full group of level 65 to 70s (Im a 67) healed easily and can keep a 9.5 HP and 1700 AC tank up with Pious of Elixer and Panolpy of VIE and still be at 80% mana the whole mission. If the tank is geared better I use less mana. The 80% figure includes keeping the nuke happy wizard healed, the puller healed and the too quick to slow shaman or enchanter healed. And redoing conviction when it is debuffed.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;But I never sit down, I cast yaulp V throughout the entire mission and I always have a Clairvoyance on me from my Bot Enchanter. Casting Yaulp is tedious, but it keeps me at a minimum at 80% mana. If I find I am getting below 80m frequently then there is something seriously wrong with the groups abilities.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Currently I am at FT18. As the previous posters said a higher FT cap would be nice. I doubt at the raid level I could keep up with a 5300 mana pool.&amp;nbsp; I do not use a mount and I find my YaulpV mana regen is better standing than the sitting regen. My examples given are all from DoNs.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>Slight derail here, but curiousity is getting the better of me from the previous poster's comments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Strictly by the numbers, Sitting regen is higher than Yaulp standing regen, all else being equal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In reality however, does this hold up? (Lets leave mounts out of the equation for the moment since they have their own issues)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you are yaulping, you are getting the Yaulp standing regen almost constantly; unless you sit down it is going 100% of the time (save for times when you have to swap spells, or have to quick heal enough that you can't squeeze a yaulp in between and it fades in that period). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you are sitting/standing to cast, then depending on how you are healing, you may end up on your feet as often as you are sitting, in which case you are getting a total regen somewhere between sitting regen and standing regen without yaulp. Definitely less than sitting regen in any case, unless you can afford to stay seated the entire fight. Even if you are just CHealing, you are going to get 1 or 2 ticks of standing regen per cast no matter what. Even if you factor in mounts, you would be knocked to standing regen rates while casting; and I personally, only feel comfortable using mounts in a constant group where I know I can reliably heal and don't have to change my spell quickly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think what I'm trying to say here is the following:&lt;br&gt;In a fairly constant group (ie one with few pauses between mobs), does Yaulping throughout give you a better total mana regen rate than the sitting method?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My gut feeling is that this does tend to be the case, but I'm not positive of it.

&lt;P&gt;Yaulp VII seems to give about the same mana regen for me as doing the sit/stand cast method. While you get 5 more per tick while sitting, you lose it every time you stand to cast.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;However, casting from horseback works better than either of those, in situations where it is possible.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Oh, and with regards to the OP's post. I'd prefer option 4, only raise it to where the base cap at 70 is 25, and you can raise it to 30 with AA, or maybe even to 35. Then I would have reason to pay attention to my mana regen items, as right now I have +30 worn mana regen, and that's only because I have taken some off.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Actually Saroc you are correct.&amp;nbsp; A guildmate of mine did the math a while back and YES, overall Yaulp 7 is better mana regen than sitting/mounted.&amp;nbsp; You hit it right on the head that when using yaulp that 10-14 per tick remains constant where the 19 from sitting or mounted&amp;nbsp;drops to 1&amp;nbsp;when you are casting.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;To Demostarte: I will use myself as the example.&amp;nbsp;lets say I am doing the sitting/mounted thing and each fight is 1 minute long and I am casting,1 mark of the blameless, 1 reproach, 2 cheals and 1 pious remedy per fight. MotB is a normal cast time of 3 (2.7 with Spell haste buff), reproach is a normal cast time of 6 (5.4 w/spell haste), 2 cheals are 20 secs and PR is 1.8 (spell haste does not effect anything below 2.0), so all told I am casting just about 30 seconds (20+2.7+5.4+1.8=29.9) of a 1 minute fight so that's 50/50 medding/casting.&amp;nbsp; That means my average regen rate is 10/tick&amp;nbsp;(19+1=20/2=10).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Now lets assume worst case scenario: cleric with yaulp 5 and no mana preservation or buff extention.&amp;nbsp; so Yaulp 5 costs 10 to cast and regens 10/tick over four ticks.&amp;nbsp; So, the first tick counters the casting cost so over four ticks this cleric get 8.5/tick (40-10 = 30/4 = 8.5).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Now lets assume a best case scenario: cleric wih yaulp 7, 30% mana pres, and 70% buff extention (that's me BTW). So yaulp costs 7 to cast and regens 14/tick.&amp;nbsp; So the first HALF tick counters the casting cost over seven ticks I get 13/tick (14 x 7 = 98 -7 = 91/7 = 13)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;In BOTH yaulp cases amount of casting is meaningless to how much you regen since you regen the same amount all the time.&amp;nbsp; Now the two examples above also assume "perfect" recast (new yaulp lands right when the old one fades.&amp;nbsp; If you overlap by one tick the worst case you go down to 30-10 = 20/3 = 6.667 (significant), but the best case is 14x6 = 84 - 7 = 77/6 = 12.833 (marginal and still better).&amp;nbsp; And I will bet that there are a few "worst case" clerics out there to those individuals sit and med between casts, to the rest use yaulp and (I just can't help myself :smileysurprised:)) get in there and add melee and proc DPS, you'll be amazed at how much damage you do with a Delightful Orb of Forgotten Magic (LDoN - everfrost).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;P.S.: dont let this degenerate into a battle cleric vs pure healer cleric flame vest.&amp;nbsp; I put in that last comment because that's EXACTLY how I became the battle cleric I am today; I was using yaulp V in LDoN to avoid sit agro and decided to add what DPS I could since I was standing anyway.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;The problem isn't horses, its just that mana pools have outgrown mana regeneration. Personally, #5 fits the bill the best since it scales with you. &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>#5 fits the best, but I have the feeling we are not likely to see much more in the way of percentage based anything added in the future; without caps, percentage increases or decreases tend to balloon out of control as numbers increase or they have to be so small to be virtually nonexistant to prevent the ballooning. Percentages also tend to make it harder to provide upgrades in the future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Realistically, I hope to see some sort of progressive regen added at some point (tick 1 regen X, tick 2 regen X+5, tick 3 regen x+10, tick 4 regen x+15, etc, for some constant rate), combined with increases to the FT caps and regen rates in general.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;It really depends on how to pull it off, % has the best scaling and if the med rate doesn't raise up then it would be the best way to go.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Otherwise if they intend for future skill raises, then more skill points and better scaling of the skill for higher level.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;five minute medding, using the same rules developed for health regen:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;1. you must not be on any hate lists.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;2. the effect ends if you cast a detrimental spell.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;3. your current mana regen with buffs, ft, aa, etc is doubled every minute, compounding.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;so, if your standing around with low buffs, etc, and your regen is only 40ish... minute 2 its now 80, minute 3 its now 160, minute 4 its now 320.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;your on a drogmor, full raid buffs... minute 1 its 108, minute 2 its now 216, minute 3 its now 432, etc.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;next, do the same for health, except times 3 or 4 if needed to make sure even those guys with 15k health get to full in 5 minutes or less.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;that reduces down times, including death, to minimal levels of wait.&amp;nbsp; you can even do something similer for endurance.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

And this would really be quite difficult to exploit in groups/raids, especially during combat - and safeguards could easily be implemented to make it impossible.  Reducing the "excessive downtime" which occurs between combat when a high-end caster is OOM, down to "tolerable downtime", is a VERY good idea for game enjoyment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Heck, if you want abusive mana regen, just get a BST to PoS (80/tick) you in the guildhall where it will not wear off, that will FM a caster in NO time, compared with any other mana regen.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;So, you have a 6K cleric that can heal fine on a zone.&amp;nbsp; Cleric gets to 12K and they have to med to 12K before continueing?&amp;nbsp; I'm confused, why do you have to be fm to get off your butt?&amp;nbsp; Is there a problem with mana regen or a problem with the way we have taught ourselves to be overly concerned with % of mana as opposed to amount of mana?&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;if you have to med, then you have to med. I might as well spend the time getting to full mana, without interruption and have the slack if i need it, than med to half.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; if im bleeding mana slowly, its going to be faster my way, even if the downtime chunk is longer, the uptime is longer and with less interruptions.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;The response to the "sit on yer arse after ress" part.&amp;nbsp; I don't need FM after rezzing in most cases and I don't have 12K mana.&amp;nbsp; It is unusual for me to be "bleeding" mana these days as the increased regen rates already available already give me man to burn in most zones&amp;nbsp;- RS and the Nest excluded.&amp;nbsp; I just lay off the pitiful nukes for a few mobs and I'm gaining mana on each fight.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;RS and the Nest are the same with a 12 to 15K, full defensive AAed&amp;nbsp;tank, however I have only been fortunate enough to get a 12K plus tank one time for either of these zone.&amp;nbsp; WIth the 10K buffed tank I struggle though the nest with when we feel like committing suicide....pfft I would have to have insane mana regen not to be hurting.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
