<P>Whether or not an NPC is a raid NPC is based on the original intent of the content.&nbsp; The planes were raid zones originally and therefore the NPCs in there are considered raid NPCs for the purposes of regen.&nbsp; That you can solo there now is irrelevant.&nbsp; That's due to the&nbsp;progress and advancement of your character in relation to the content.&nbsp; At worst, the&nbsp;5 minute timer just ensures that raid content remains at least slightly more difficult than equivalent non-raid content even as time marches on.</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>Then increase the xp! It's original eq, there is no justifiable reason, after 12 expansions and 25 levels increased,&nbsp;to still consider this a raid zone, as it hasn't been such past the first few expansions which made it obsolete, with the exception of a few epic raids. Prior to the con/xp change, the trash mobs gave MORE xp than equivalent non-raid mobs, than they do now and with no penalty, puting in the penalty while&nbsp;lessoning their xp, yet still considering them raid content,&nbsp;is just obtuse.
