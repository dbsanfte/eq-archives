&lt;P&gt;Ezedriel the only flaw I see in your argument is that if a guild progresses so fast they're the ones to do all the unlocking, it means 50-100 people get to do what they want to and the rest are SOL.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Hopefully there will be lots of competition, and many guilds will play a part in it all.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>Hey! What're we doing? Don't make this server "progressive," just leave it exactly how it is after launch. I read somewhere that it'd be technologically impossible for us to bring EQ back to it's original state, but why not leave it close? C'mon, let's get some input on this. Anyone other than me miss having to walk from city to city? What about taking the boat with more than one person on it? Hell, what about WAITING for the boat, with three other people? Remember those insane CRs, where your corpse would be directly under Dvinn? Someone's gotta know what I'm talking about.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;More posts like this will only drive the progressive-minded folks to unlock the expansions even sooner.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Original EQ was great but you can only farm Guk for so long.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;You know what irritates me? People that want to hold the server back. People that want to sit in stale content for months, seeing the same stuff over and over. It would be sooo much fun to farm FBSS and GEBs for years! SIGN ME UP. Get a grip. Maddoc said he doubted the time restraints would likely never be an issue, which tells me they expect the expansions to open a couple months at a time. Muar said something like "do you enjoy being the first to do stuff". I ask you, do you enjoy messing around in Unrest for months? Do you like that? If you answered yes, here's what you should do. Go on any of the servers available right now and sit in Unrest (or whatever your favorite dungeon is to bring back those nostalgic memories is) and play there till your heart's content. Theres not a **HALFLING** thing stopping you from doing so. Thats what you ENJOY. I ENJOY being the first to do stuff on a server.&amp;nbsp; Calling me selfish because that's what I want to do, would be like me telling you not to ruin my fun.* /sarcasm on* I mean, hey, you will be taking my pulls in the beginning and slowing down my progression the first couple of weeks.

I know this is a progression server, but what&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;people don't want to see is this server progressing &lt;b&gt;too fast &lt;/b&gt;which is what your intending.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;You seem to have no reguard for the players what want the "classic" EQ feeling to last more then 2 seconds.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;So i say you need to either get off your high horse or go play on a non-progression server.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;To each their own.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;For those who want to take it slow, this will be the place to do it as there will be a low and midlevel game here that is far healthier than what is on current live servers.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;For those who want to push the advancement that is an entirely legitimate way to approach this server.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I just hope they make the unlocking conditions for each expansion so vast and difficult to accomplish that it represents serverwide advancement, not just the advancement of one guild, as that would be pretty lame.&amp;nbsp; The advancement of the player base should dictate the pace of progression, not one single guild of players.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Kirtar it don't matter bro. Don't be so upset about all this. Everyone here is free to do/think/say whatever they want.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Honestly I don't care how fast Kunark opens up cause it's a great expansion. Velious? Lol clearing VP will take a lot longer than people think.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;You can want to progress, and try your heart out to progress. I'll laugh for days when AoW is a requirement for opening Luclin. It's *possible* to kill pre-Luclin, so IMO it should be a req.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;At that point the casuals can catch up, or at least have more time to. The powergamers can gear up, and the feeling of accomplishment will be huge when it's done. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I guess only time will tell the req's and how fast we can accomplish them, but I wouldn't worry about it either way.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;I don't know how to say this without being somewhat of a personal attack... but if you enjoy spending 6 hours just to travel from place to place in a game over and over again then you seriously need to step and side and take a big long look at your life.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;On the other hand there is nothing really stoping you from taking 6 hours going from bb to FD just used gnome to go to OOT and then mess around there then drown urself then go back do it again but find your corpse then find your way back to island with magus and go on to FP.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I hear the point there, but not really a fair statement in my opinion, because EQ is a game and has no point what so ever.&amp;nbsp; It's solely for entertainment.&amp;nbsp; Someone could easily reverse this statement and say if you're trying to muscle your way through EQ thinking that there's some prize at the end, "then you seriously need to step and side and take a big long look at your life."&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;There's no right or wrong way to play EQ, or that one way is for "losers" and the other way is for "people with lives".&amp;nbsp; It's a video game for burning free time, and to have fun.&amp;nbsp; It ultimately servers no other purpose, and people are entertained by different things.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;It's been said in this thread that if "classic" players want to relive old memories, they can just hang out in old zones on any server.&amp;nbsp; That's true, but the point is to be able to do that with other people.&amp;nbsp; You do it now, and these zones are deserted.&amp;nbsp; Might and well just play a classic single player game.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Classic players worry about the expansions being opened up too fast because mass migration to the new zones will happen as everyone tries to keep up with the pace.&amp;nbsp; No one likes the feeling of being left behind.&amp;nbsp; So classic players want a little extra time to stop and take a breathe and enjoy the old EQ world for a bit.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;On the issue of travel, you hear so many people saying how they liked riding on boats, etc.&amp;nbsp; This sounds ridiculous at first, as the quote above describes.&amp;nbsp; But someone addressed the issue perfectly (I forget who).&amp;nbsp; They said what if there was a "book" in front of Mordor?&amp;nbsp; I think that statement summed the sentiment up well.&amp;nbsp; If there was a book in front of Mordor, you'd lose the sense of adventure.&amp;nbsp; Traveling in game gives a sense of distance, and a sense that you're actually going somewhere -- an illusion we're trying to experience by playing a fantasy game.&amp;nbsp; If that's incomprehensible to some, then first person shooters might be more to your tastes.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;A fantasy adventure game isn't suppose to be about instant satisfaction.&amp;nbsp; You don't just click on something and magically appear outside of where you want to go.&amp;nbsp; Might as well get rid of zones all together then and just have PoK surrounded by hundreds of different "instanced" zones.&amp;nbsp; And give yourselves guns instead of swords and spells.&amp;nbsp; Why waste time when you can just blow away stuff with a high powered piece of military hardware?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Classic people just want their adventure back.&amp;nbsp; They don't want a first person shooter in "fantasy clothing".&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Well there is no true end to the game but that isn't because there isn't a end to the game it is because new expansions are added. You can beat DoN by killing vish and finishing your progression, you can beat oow by killing OMM and finishing your 2.0. That is beating the expansion, however there are new expansion added. It is the same thing with any other game. You beat the one wing angel and finish FF7. The game is done and over with, however if they ever decided to add a FF7-2 then that is no different then adding velius after kunark. The game keeps going and you can beat it again or you can decide not to play it. I have still not bought PoR it looks like crap to me and hte only thing of intrest i have seen is cleric group heal. Maybe when my guild finishes demiplane i may buy it maybe not. We get to decide our own end in this game.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;It really simple you don't see me yelling for a server with all but por... I don't like por i don't buy it i don't go there. Same goes for classic people you don't like luclin+ then don'y buy them or don't go there. Its easy problem solved.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Cloud_Stromm on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;06-12-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;08:38 PM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;so you are telling me that i don't enjoy racing through the game. Go search on google and look at what alot of people find fun. aka beating old school games as fast as possible. Its where i get my fun. I love hitting old school targets see how few people it takes to kill them in anguish gear+ etc. I am sick of people like you telling people like me that they can't enjoy the way they enjoy the game.&lt;BR&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I don't much like Cloud, but, in his rather poorly phrased way, he has a much better point than you.&amp;nbsp; He plans to play the server in a way that it is, to a certain extent, intended to be played.&amp;nbsp; It's a "progression" server, and he plans to progress.&amp;nbsp; There is nothing wrong with that.&amp;nbsp; You say he "could care less about everyone else's fun", but then, in your suggestion he should not try and race through progression, you are showing that you don't care about other peoples fun, unless it is the same idea of fun you have.&amp;nbsp; When sone one has a different idea of fun, you condemn them.&amp;nbsp; The word for this attitude is hypocracy.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;You say people who race through content will have a terrible reputation, and they will for a certain circle of people, but certainly not with everyone, or even most.&amp;nbsp; &lt;STRONG&gt;You&lt;/STRONG&gt; want slow progression, in fact alot do, but some want fast progression, some want fast up to a point, then slow, some wnat no progression.&amp;nbsp; Claiming that, because you don't like something, everyone is going to condemn it, is kinda silly.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;You then take this really condescending(and wrong) attitude, telling people for whom this server is specifically designed that they should not play there(cuz you don't want them to), that the game was designed to be played the way you want to play it(hint, it wasn't, in fact, one of the things that makes EQ great is it was designed to support lots of different playstyles), and then tell people that they should play the game as you play it, even tho that way is not any more preferred, or better, than any other way to play.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Just so you understand, I am not going to be part of opening any expansion, I simply don't have the time to commit to be a part of it.&amp;nbsp; I plan to play here just to relax, and start over, and meet new people.&amp;nbsp; I won't be throwing a fit because other people come onto the server with different plans than I, nor tell them that their playstyle is wrong, nor that I am going to hate them for having fun in EQ.&amp;nbsp; The high end players will have little effect on my gameplay, as we simply won't intersect much.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>If they dont release a pvp progression server along with this&#xD;
progression server, my guild will all go red and our goal will be to&#xD;
unlock things as fast as possible.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; So if anyone wants to&#xD;
prevent us from doing it, they will have to turn red as well.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
If sony doesn't want to give us our pvp server, we will make one ourselves :D&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Great for you. That's exactly what you PVPers need to do to show SoE you're serious about your server. Your post is also far and away above the majority of posts from the pro-PVP crowd thus far.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;But as for unlocking all the content fast, good luck getting enough members to do it. I doubt a PVP guild will do much unlocking on this server, since most seem content to just complain instead of actively doing something about it.&lt;/P&gt;</description>
