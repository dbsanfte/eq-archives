<P>Kytherea-</P>
<P>I've posted a similiar message like this one in a couple other posts...honestly didn't think a community relations person would be so narrow minded. Those of us that want to rush to the next expansion get as much enjoyment out of doing so as you would hanging out with your friends in Paw or Unrest for weeks. Giving a sarcastic remark like the one you did, "There must be a prize at the end." would be like me saying "Boy do I wish I had taken 6 months to get through old world content...that sounds like FUN FUN FUN." I wouldn't think a "Community Relations Manager" such as yourself would make such an inflammatory comment. </P>

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>I assume the best wizard will have about 3500hps with buffs. How do you plan to keep all these wizards alive when Trakanon casts poison breath: AE 1200 damage and Trakanon touch&nbsp;that the casting increases&nbsp;with the amount of people you have so the more you have the more that will be teleported away from the fight. Then his nice little 1500 instant life tap. I predict the tank being teleported and 6 wizards out of 10 dying to his aggro and not to mention the AE killing them all anyways because no one will be able to resist it. However this is just from my point of view, I would never lead a raid to were my guild members would be on a nice long CR. I am not one of those people who's like: " Hey we failed 10 times but finally beat him.!" Ha ha least beat him the first time!

<P>Actually Cougra, when we get done with Luclin I'll likely get bored of the flagging process and quit MMOs again. Last I checked when a new expansion opens up, it doesn't make you unable to use the older expansions. The problem you and many others like you seem to have, is you want to both be able to&nbsp;level at your own rate AND not be far behind in the raiding process. Alot of people will disagree with that, but I think you're fooling yourselves.&nbsp; I'm still going to enjoy going through Unrest, Paw, Lguk again. Raiding the old planes again will be a blast I can't wait for. I just have no desire to do that for months. There will be a&nbsp;handful of guilds that are "endgame" but there will be a TON of people that are totally casual. Luclin was really the first&nbsp;expansion to make the older zones barren, and that will take a good&nbsp;4 months or more IMO. There's no reason a casual player can't hit 60 in that time.&nbsp;The only reason I'm playing on this server is to compete to be the best. That's what I like to do. The fact is, people WANT to be able to raid, and servers that are years into the raiding process make it much harder to play catch up. I hate cliches but this is a classic case of wanting to "have your cake and eat it too". You WANT to be able to take&nbsp;6 months to hit 50, and you WANT everyone else to do it your way. That's not going to happen. </P>
<P>Kytherea, I suppose "inflammatory" was the wrong word...even kinda felt like it when I posted the first time. But I suppose its easy to say "Take it however you want to take it". You made it clear which side of the fence you were on, and I would think someone in the community relations field would attempt to be as unbiased as possible, thats what I was trying to get across. </P>

<P>And here I was thinking the whole idea behind the progression server was because ppl didn't want to play in the new expansions because of all the mud-flation... yet... everywhere I read... how can we open up content... what can we kill to get to the new expansions.... lets go lets go... lol</P>
<P>Hmm... oops.... Soandso's guild opened up Luclin, That expansion ruined the game, someone make me another server!</P>
<P>I'm curious to see how long this server is viable, when it catches the rest in a year or 2, will they make you another?</P>

				<div></div>&nbsp;The reason this server is even going to come into being is because of the high demand of a server with no expansions to bring back the old crowd. No one said you have to play like casual players, but the casual players sure don't have to play your way either.<br><br>&nbsp;It seems you want it *your* way as well and you don't give a flip about anyone elses thoughts or opinions. You even try to get mad at Kytherea because you think their comment isn't "on your side of the fence."&nbsp; Thats the only reason why i could see you taking that comment the wrong way.<br><br>&nbsp;Oh and btw, sorry in advance if you take my opinion in a negative way. <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-tongue.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0><br><div></div>
