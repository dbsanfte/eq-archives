    <title>Theft of Thought PROC</title>

    <description>&lt;div&gt;I just thought I'd post this to try and help people with possible mana pool issues.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The DoD mission &amp;quot;Sabotage!&amp;quot;, when completed with a group level average 63-67, can yield a Voodoo Wand; a nice priest/caster useable weapon that procs Theft of Thought. Now, if you could get this piece to proc only once a minute, that alone would be 40 mana regen per tick (400 a minute). I'm not sure what it's actual proc rate is, but if it were even twice a minute, it would be very nice indeed.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Of course, there are issues to consider if you want to melee a mob for procs... damage shields, attacking from behind to avoid ripostes, etc... but many might consider the pros to outweigh the cons in a lot of cases.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Mind you, the group level must be 63-67 on COMPLETION... you could just do the mission with a higher group, then have one or two people disband and /taskadd a couple of other, lower level people, and complete it. The Wand is Attuneable (so it's droppable), so I'd guess it's a chest drop at the end, and not the only possible one... but some people may want to look into getting one to bandolier in during LoM moments.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I'm sure there'd be plenty to discuss about it. I just wanted to bring it to the community's attention.&lt;/div&gt;</description>
