				<DIV><STRONG>VP at the time was one of the least used zones in the game. You definitely could go into VP and kill all of the dragons solo. Once one group did that zone every week or maybe every week and a half, there was no other zone usage of the zone. I wanted more out of the zone - I wanted it to be a place that's used more. And for a good while after the revamp (I'd say up until Omens or so) the zone usage from the reports I saw showed that it was used more after the revamp than before.</STRONG></DIV>
<DIV><STRONG></STRONG>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Why not add code to restrict players levels to 60 or 62 (banish anyone higher level aggroed to dragons in vp)&nbsp;to fall more in line with what you did when people were 1 grouping or soloing&nbsp;nagafen?</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Then in addition add a seperate zone Veeshans B or something, that required the shade key to enter for higher level players?</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Or simply send any player over 62 into Veeshans b instead of Veeshans old upon entry.</DIV>
