				<DIV></DIV>CLASS: Monk
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>HP: (nice, but don't bother, we aren't really used as a tank class so we don't need tons of HP to stand around with a mob and wait on a heal)<BR>Mana: (don't have any so don't bother)<BR>Endurance: 250 (Need Upped quite a bit as that we have no time to med and regain since we are pulling)<BR>AC: 70 (Need Upped quite a bit to prevent being hit as often while pulling)</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>HP Regen: (nice, but don't bother, we need healed in spurts and sitting around waiting on HP isn't something we are really wanting to do or going to do when we have healer watching over us, give it to necros who are trying to counter a side affect)<BR>Mana Regen: (umm... don't bother, again don't have any, don't want any)<BR>Endurance Regen: +4 or +5 (need serious attention in monks who spend our days serving up mobs to people sitting on their butts)</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Strength: 15 (nice for hitting mobs, not so nice for equipment weight, maybe add in a calculation to add a little tolerance to a monks weight restrictions)<BR>Stamina: (Same as HP)<BR>Agility: 20 (the higher the better, need items that concentrate primarily here and Dex)<BR>Dexterity: 20 (the higher the better, need items that concentrate primarily here and Agi)<BR>Charisma: (nice, but don't bother, isn't it part of a class description to be a hermit and not be good with people, vow of poverty, etc...)<BR>Intelligence: (don't bother)<BR>Wisdom: (don't bother)</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Cold Resist: +20 (Higher the better nothing sucks worse then being nuked in the back by a mob)<BR>Disease Resist: +20 (Higher the better nothing sucks worse then being nuked in the back by a mob)<BR>Poison Resist: +20 (Higher the better nothing sucks worse then being nuked in the back by a mob)<BR>Magic Resist: +20 (Higher the better nothing sucks worse then being nuked in the back by a mob)<BR>Fire Resist: +20 (Higher the better nothing sucks worse then being nuked in the back by a mob)<BR></DIV>
<DIV>Attack: +25 (we don't get as much time to DPS as everyone else a lot of the time so might as well make our hits count)<BR>Delay: 5 (need to lower this for the same reasons as above, not to mention we were always suppose to be fast)<BR>Damage: 55 (might be good to give us a bit more to give us more bang for our buck for when we do get a chance to DPS)<BR>Range: 250 is good, gives me a good head start as it always seems that the mobs are faster than me</DIV>
<DIV>Haste: 60% (have you ever thought about letting this stack for a monk)</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Combat Effects: +25 (nice, as I have stated it would be nice to do the same amount of damage as everyone else, since I get so little time)<BR>Shielding: +25 (not nice getting smacked in the back of the head while looking for your group during a pull)<BR>Stun Resist: +25 (nice and great for pulling)<BR>Strikethrough: +25 (I think this ability was made for a monk)<BR>Spell Shield: +25 (not nice getting nuked in the back by a mob)<BR>Avoidance: +25 (yup, I'm not meant to take a hit, I'm just not suppose to get hit at all)<BR>Accuracy: +25 (sure, but I swear all these new abilities are so low in how many points we can get off a piece of armor then why bother)<BR>DOT Shielding: +25 (yikes, ya, need it, second most likely to be DoTTed (tank first), since we are the first to say high to a mob, just ask the undead in Arcstone... first dot, then follow is their golden rule)</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Skill Mods: (to me this is for lower level equipment only and should be more promenant then say stats on lower level equipment and definitely should be found on all low level monk equipment as we have lots of skills that need to be worked on)<BR>Click Effects: (nope, already have a lot going on)<BR>Proc Effects: (yup, this is the way to go with my busy schedule)<BR>Worn Effects: (yup, always nice to have perma-see invis or perma-breath underwater just incase I FD while pulling through a mud puddle)<BR>Focus Effects: (nope, not a caster)<BR></DIV>
