    <title>My problem with PvP.</title>

    <description>OK, before everyone starts in on me, I will admit, I have never played on any zek servers.  My problem is with the Arena areas.  The main Arena itself, easy to get to, in a neutral area so toons of certain factions won't get KoS along the way as small arenas in  the cities, but it's biggest problem (at least on the tribunal server, which I frequent) is the fact that uber-twinked 70's like to camp there and if anyone a little bit less powerful comes in, even if they don't engage these people, all of a sudden, boom, boom, boom, dead.  How much fun is that, honestly?  I like to get together with my guildmates and friends, and go in and maybe do a 3 on 3 or something, and not neessarily to the death.  I agree that it should either be made an instanced zone, or make it so that you can only target toons within a 5 level difference from you either way, or even maybe putting an arena inside of the guild halls for friendly combat.  It's pummeling like this that made me quit playing other games because I would start up with a new or semi-new character and try to play, then boom!  Whomped from behind, no warning, just dead.  I don't actually see what satisfaction a 70th level toon gets from slaughtering a 50 something....it's pathetic, really.  Well, there's my 2 cents for the day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Good point.  Same thing I don't like on bluebie server pvp.  To solve it, just grab a few guildies and you will be roflmaoing :p&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;be really cruel and try to trap him in arena with no escape :D&lt;/div&gt;</description>
