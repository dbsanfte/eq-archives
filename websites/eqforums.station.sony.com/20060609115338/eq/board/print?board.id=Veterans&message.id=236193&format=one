but the mission did not take a rocket scientist. Add the ease of
getting there, the massive amount of people in the zone during 2x
weekends make getting a group a guarentee unless ya were a complete
idiot, but there were always fresh meat <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0>, and the short amount of
time it could be completed coupled with the exp earned.<br><hr></blockquote>Oh I understand fully why it was popular. I'm just talking about players who say "You nerfed <b>monster missions</b>" when what they are talking about is changes to just that one mission.<br><div></div>
