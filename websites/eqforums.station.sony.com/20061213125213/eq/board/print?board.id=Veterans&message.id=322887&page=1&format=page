				<div></div><div></div><div></div>Just thought I'd put this up here for anyone who wanted a sneak peak at
the first Frostcrypt raid instance.&nbsp; I think we have a sampling of the
mobs, bosses, and a few unique things you'll encounter here.&nbsp; You'll
even get to see one of the most killer trains in existance due to the
lovely trash ago "feature"- I've never seen a raid wipe so fast (just
fyi the trash can quad/flurry for up to 5-6k).&nbsp; <br>

<br>

I think overall (despite some bugs and tuning issues) this is one of
the most interesting/fun raiding experiences in the game to date.&nbsp; The
encounters are mostly fun and sometimes downright clever as they
introduce some new mechanics and re-use some old ones.&nbsp; If anyone is
curious, Frostcrypt #2 continues those traits mentioned, and with a
little nudging, you may see another video of it soon.&nbsp; The entire
Valdeholme/Frostcrypt side of progression and raiding has been a
combination of frustration to bugs, delight at the scripts, excitement
at winning, and some of the most intense rushes I've experienced in the
game (Redfang, Performer, and Mayong came close, but not near our
Odeen, Grenwald, and Harfange kills).&nbsp; <br>
<br>
To understand it a bit better, there are 2 major bosses in the first instance -
Hearol the Tactician and Lorekeeper Grenwald.&nbsp; You're seeing parts
of their scripts (and they're lengthy and have multiple parts), and
you're also seeing the various aug mini scripts.&nbsp; The aug minis
are full blown scripts (15-30min in length), and while they're longer
than what we are used to (ie not single guys just appearing for no
reason after meeting certain criterea) they're a big improvement
imo.&nbsp; I'm not going to give away any lore here, but suffice to say
that if you enjoy that sort of thing, its all there.&nbsp; The entire
giant arc lore/background is very well done, makes sense, and ties into
events long in Norrath's past that isn't just *inserted* in for this
expansion.&nbsp; We're about to defeat the Shade King himself soon in
the 2nd instance, and I'm looking forward to seeing the story finish up.<br>

<br>

Props goto Quarken who put the video together and did a great job on the music sync (Victory Strikes Again by Andrew WK).<br>

<br>

The video is kid/work safe.&nbsp; The website frontpage is probably
borderline (language).&nbsp; It's .wmv now and weighs in at 38mb zipped, its
about 2:10 in length.<br>

				Yea we had one or two people report that problem.&nbsp; I have some
pretty hefty codecs installed on my computer because I'm an A/V-type,
so I'm not sure exactly which to recommend and I'm not sure what Q
used.&nbsp; I'll try and find out tomorrow for you, or in the meantime
if someone knows for sure (Ned I know you had this problem).<br>

<DIV>on a side note, why cannt we get music like that for all raid zones instead of the crapola&nbsp; we get, i see all these videos with great music attached to them and always makes me wish the actual zones for raids had that kind of music, heh.</DIV>

"Overwhelming Numbers" event with the waves of zombies. How did you
like that event? I thought it was the most fun event to implement and
hopefully you guys like it.<br><div></div><br><hr></blockquote><br>
You have no idea how much we liked the concept behind every event
(Shades of Calm is sorta the exception- we've sorta seen it
before).&nbsp; The tuning and time requirements for certain events -
thats a seperate discussion, but several are good, several are a bit
too long.<br>
<br>
Overwhelming Numbers - it took us a few to figure this out.&nbsp; New
mechanic we'd never really seen, and frankly, it was pretty **SMURF**
cool.&nbsp; I actually sorta stumled on it in the middle of one
run.&nbsp; The zombies were great - I think the entire guild got a big
kick out of all of it.&nbsp; It's tuned just fine btw.<br>
<br>
Hearol the Tactician - Great concept, really is, just needs tuning - I
would love to see an entire end-zone based around a similar concept.
(easier than the aug minis atm tho).<br>
<br>
Shades of Calm - This we've seen the mechanics for, so just sorta
ho-hum.&nbsp; I liked the "thought" behind it, because it fits the
theme of the zone - chalk it up as a flavor event.&nbsp; This is just a
bit too long imo (25min if I recall, I think 15 is a sweet spot for
these type of events).&nbsp; We liked the Maestro loot btw =P.<br>
<br>
Doppleganger event (forget name) - Seeing dopplegangers never gets
old.&nbsp; The great part is that your coding to duplicate npcs has
improved.&nbsp; The npcs all being monks btw was sorta funny (seeing
clerics and mages and wizzies doing flying kicks).&nbsp; This event -
it sorta has too high of a clearing requirement, but the actual event
is fine imo, has some fun mechanics that make it an engaging event for
everyone.<br>
<br>
Hufdan - It's nothing terribly complex, but we enjoyed it.&nbsp; It's got a good mix imo.<br>
<br>
Lorekeeper Grenwald - This event is the hardest in the first
instance.&nbsp; We really liked the concept behind it.&nbsp; The
various parts of the event were pretty cool also.&nbsp; I can't really
talk more about it other than to say that I think its tuned well, but
needed more debug time.<br>
<br>
Zone trash - The agro is simply insane here.&nbsp; That train of 40
mobs - is entirely due to how the mobs all agro.&nbsp; I guess its
great in that us monks get some work, but its also a bit...insane at
times.&nbsp; Heres an example - agro 1 roamer at the very entrance, if
its in the right spot, you can chain agro the ENTIRE front statue room,
and all 4 of the left and right side rooms.&nbsp; That's about 60 mobs
in total.&nbsp; The mob difficulty is appropriate though imo, but
density is a tiny bit too high (same as regular FC).&nbsp; It's
especially bad for the Doppleganger event, since it requires clearing 5
rooms and it's not on the way to either of the major named (I'd be fine
with the rest of the zone staying the same, but removing alot of mobs
from the Doppleganger's area would be nice).&nbsp; It's nice to have to
be concerned about zone trash though...<br>
<br>
The 2nd instance - it's also got some great concepts and mechanics we
found very enjoyable, but also suffers from some of the same problems
(tuning and a bug).&nbsp; It's not anything that detracts much from it
though.<br>
<br>
Overall though, you have no idea how much we've enjoyed this
stuff.&nbsp; Nodyin, did you do any events here?&nbsp; I was under the
impression that Celrak did all of them, but I like giving props to
everyone involved.&nbsp; The valdeholme stuff even - Merloc's Captain
event (wtb huge huge huge event like that), King Odeen was very clever
even if it had some bugs to start (Zajeer if I recall), Lorekeeper
Udengar was also pretty **SMURF** neat (no clue who did that) - I liked how
you tied that and Kangur together, and the entire script was just well
done.&nbsp; We didn't beta any of this and each new event was a nice
suprise for us.&nbsp; I hope the guilds doing it after us enjoy it just
as much, and feel the same thrill of accomplishment as we did beating
each new boss (and hell even the event minis).<br>

It's not too hard, even with low dps imo, its all about tactics.&nbsp;
We found that each aug event was like that.&nbsp; Every single one of
them we were thinking was too hard when we first did them, it wasn't
until the 2nd or 3rd time that we adjusted tactics, and found them to
be just fine.&nbsp; I'd say that Shades of Calm is a bit too long (you
know what I'm talking about here), and I'd say that The Sleepless Guard
is a bit too difficult (unless you consider his location and what he
unlocks) - once his respawn gets fixed (the lockout doesnt work, hes up
everytime).&nbsp; Doppleganger as I said above, isn't on the way to
anything, and requires a bit too much clearing, but his event is fine
once you adjust tactics.&nbsp; Overall, if nothing changed on all of
the aug minis - I wouldn't be upset.&nbsp; I'm just nitpicking on them,
as its really only very minor things to pick about.<br>
<br>
I really love how you made them mini-events.&nbsp; It really is a
better mechanism than a randomly popping named tied to a trigger or
specific boss being dead.<br><div></div>

Good stuff!&nbsp; I'll pm you with some detailed thoughts that would
give away the events.&nbsp; And here I was giving all the credit to
Celrak, jesus you were busy this expansion.<br>

The dopplegangers were great, would be neat if you could combine some
coding similar to the MPG Corruption Raid Trial for their AI (with some
updates) and send it out to groups.&nbsp; Although the monk versions
made us laugh =P.<br><div></div>

I think I can confidently say that everything in FC#1, except maybe
Shades of Calm, caters to either guild setup.&nbsp; By that I mean,
guilds with low dps should have more support, and vise versa- and that
events are winnable each way.&nbsp; The heavier support should cope
with the various mechanisms better than ours, but your fights will last
longer.&nbsp; I'm a bit concerned about Shades of Calm for a support
guild, because the gain from having more support may not be enough to
overcome low dps - but I know Nodyin is the type to tweak things.&nbsp;
Also, if you just go in with low numbers all around - yea, youre
probably going to have alot more trouble.&nbsp; In most cases though,
they're still winnable with some very good strats.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Of course, this is assuming your guild can develop decent strats, and
just doesn't try the same things over and over.&nbsp; If you go in with
**SMURF**ty strats, you're going to have trouble no matter what you have in
your raid.<br>
<br>
FC#2 - We don't have enough run-throughs on the scripts to say for sure.<br>
<br>
Believe it or not, we have major fears every new expansion because
theres really no other high-dps built guild at this level.&nbsp; I
guess one or two come close, but most of you have alot more
healing/tanks than we do.&nbsp; Theres definatly been points where
we've felt severely disadvantaged, but its all overcomeable (PoR was
even worse for that though- we were stuck for awhile).<br><div></div>
