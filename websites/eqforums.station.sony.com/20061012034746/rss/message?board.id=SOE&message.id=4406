    <description>&lt;span class="postbody"&gt;The Universal Chat system will replace the old&#xD;
Channel Server for all channel operations. All player-owned channels&#xD;
will be moved over automatically and using channels in the new system&#xD;
is the same as before, so you should not notice any difference. One of&#xD;
the primary benefits of this change is that channels now support&#xD;
cross-server and cross-game functionality. EQIM will no longer work&#xD;
with this change however we do intend to remedy this situation if&#xD;
possible in the future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This REALLY needs to be fixed. Everyone I know uses eqim and breaking it is simply shooting yourself in the foot. This should have been handled before ever implementing this. There have been a lot of positive changes to the game over the past year but this is deffinately a step back to the same old sony, different day of implementing things that break EQ and maybe dealing with fixing them 6 months or a year later.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I sit on IM chatting with people before school, then after school waiting for my friends to log in. Then when they do I log in. Many others do the same. Breaking this just means people will have to be logged in waiting for friends to show up. There's gonna be lots that simply don't bother because they don't want EQ up while they browse the web or whatever RL things they are doing while waiting. As people log in less they'll decide paying for something they aren't using much isn't worth it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stupid. Completely stupid.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Super idea there.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Let's take old and busted, but semi-functional and make it new and busted but non-functional...and make them pay for it!"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yeah, great idea.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why&#xD;
is it we have to pay for a 'lite' client that doesn't take up all of a&#xD;
system's resources when all we want to do is chat with people?&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
Where is the logic in that?&amp;nbsp; Ok, the logic is bilk the customer, I&#xD;
see that.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Makes for great business sense in a now&#xD;
over-crowded online gaming market.&amp;nbsp; But hey, we're dumb enough to&#xD;
have continued paying to this point, why would we stop paying?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wouldn't&#xD;
it be easier to leave it 'unsupported' so you didn't have to listen to&#xD;
people complain when it's broken?&amp;nbsp; Oh yeah, you don't listen when&#xD;
your paying customers complain already.&amp;nbsp; No change there I suppose.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I am a roleplayer&amp;nbsp; on FV with 8 alt accounts, at any one time 4 or 5 of them will be up.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Eqim is broken?&amp;nbsp; Expect me to box 5 accounts?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; No.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I box two, no more.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ANd hell, we only have one rp server with one character&amp;nbsp; (grrrrrr)) alllowed.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So guess what?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; htis month i have only two accounts alive, and may not even bother continuing shortly.&amp;nbsp; Expecially when cross server channels arent working properly still.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I cannot see my own chat, nor get the channel lists for a cross server channel, says '0'&amp;nbsp; members.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I have ...had.. now it looks like.. a rollplayer i chatted with on occasion that had her main computer go down.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; She was using an alt computer that didnt have the capablities to run eq on it.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Well, the stupid decison to go to the new chat system has blocked her from continuing in eq totally.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;And I can remeber those days where i had been continously spamed by the 'universal system is now up.... universal chat system is down...&amp;nbsp; ect, ect the whole friggin day.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The former chat system worked.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This one is annoying and has me now looking at other games.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Its not a brilliant idea to consolidate things if you are&amp;nbsp; not going to take into consideration ALL factiors before you make a change.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;P.S.&amp;nbsp; Limiting a roleplayer to ONE world and ONE character per account is one reason so many roleplayer left eq 1.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; EQIM being broken may end up being another.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Wow. If that wasnt flame bait....&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;People were giving their ideas in a constructive manner.&amp;nbsp; some people would hapilly pay for the option.&amp;nbsp; I personally dont know if i would..&amp;nbsp; then again, if i could pay for the chat client and not the game with it, i'd probably pay the 2 bucks to have the chat and drop the game client..&amp;nbsp; i use the game as a chat client for the most part.&amp;nbsp; If you remember, the patch said they're trying to get it back and working, and this isnt just a quick day's fix if you want to do it CORRECTLY ( i.e. not make the im client crash the whole network, which is very possible).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; If you want something quick and dirty, go analize the [encrypted] packets and figure out the protocol, like others are trying to do.&amp;nbsp; How do you think they got the tEQIM plugin for trillian? I'm trying, but i'm fairly new at packet analyzation so i dont know quite what i'm looking for yet, and school takes up too much time. but if someone gives me the protocol specs, a quick and dirty chat client won't be too far behind.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>While it would be trivial to reverse engineer the datastream and make a&#xD;
functional UCS EQIM client, I'm not ready to get banned for it yet.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Someone wants to make an 'official' post that says it's ok to not worry&#xD;
about the DCMA clauses and lawsuits and bannings, I'll see about&#xD;
rolling one out.&amp;nbsp; Until then, I'll continue to be bitter about an&#xD;
'upgrade' that was not necessary...assuming we ever get even that far.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

      <description>So it's been a week, and nothing said about any changes to EQIM.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Does this mean it is just more of the customary SoE smoke 'n mirrors,&#xD;
and my original post was correct and this is now a dead service? &lt;br&gt;&#xD;

      <description>Officially, EQIM was dead 5-ish years ago.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That said, some Dev's have said they will look into doing the change over.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;BUT, it also looks like many of the Dev's have been busy dealing with patch issues and such and they may not have had time to examine it. Plus, except in some rare situations (usually when SOE's looking for feedback from us on the changes, like the pathing change and taunt changes), we rarely get intirim reports about projects SOE has on-going. So we're unlikely to hear anything about EQIM until a Dev says "We've looked at it, and it can't be done." or EQIM becomes fixed to work with the new system (or its replacement is launched on EQPlayers or with the SOE Launchpad or whatever the web guys are working on). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(And yes the Dev's do want to get EQIM to work again; I suspect they are probably one of the most consistant users of it.)</description>

      <description>Well - anybody wondering if it may be possible they will (or had the intention for a longer time yet) implement some kind of chatsystem via webbrowser like in eq2?&lt;br&gt;Of course - this would done by using a "to-pay-for"-service included in eqplayers like as it is in eq2players yet i think.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Come on Kyth. You've been modding the boards long enough to know that the pitchforks and bonfires come out regardless of what you say, don't say, and what happens or doesn't happen. :P&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyways, I hope the Launchpad service will allow this sort of thing. They seemed to have big plans for it, but not much has come out since then about the progress on it.</description>

      <description>Via a webpage would be yet another in a long line of stupid desicions. Webpages are still the easiest expliotable medium available. Not to mention that the moment someone visits using a browser without functionality there's gonna be issues.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;EQIM worked fine. There was no reason to break it, especially not with a pile of trash like the universal chat system. Why on earth would you want to&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. Break&amp;nbsp; a utiltiy programs many used.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. remove complete ability for some people to use chans (some ISPs block the ports the ucs uses)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3. port over to a system with a long history of issues.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4. remove functionality many used. (Many raids used order in chat for different things, the universal piece of trash doesn't hold chan order).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hell the stupid thing crashed earlier today.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Are we seeing a return to Sony pre GoD days? If so all the customers you have picked back up over the past 6-8 months will walk again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Unfortunately, the EQIM service was unsupported once SOE had realized that they weren't going to be able to charge people for it. Remember it was originally a free 'sampler' and it was going to cost a monthly fee to use. Supposedly there was either an overwhelming amount of people using it or not many people using it that SOE had decided to offer it up for free. It was pretty much then that it became unsupported (though, no officially for a little bit of time after). It is very unfortunate that this occured, it was a great tool for things such as going link dead and sending a quick message back to your raid/group, finding a friend to ask whats going on, or to even log in to socialize while at work or in time sensitive situtations where patching and login in aren't the best option. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hopefully the devs will consider updating the software or make information pertaining to UCS open source or something similar so that teqim (the best plugin for trillian, ever!) can be updated. If it comes down to them needing to rewrite it themselves (and actually doing it) the ability to access your guild chat would be a great addition. Now I know there has been no talk of anything such as this officially, though it would be something very nice to see if the developer's realize how many people actually used this piece of software.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Floydian/Phloydian&lt;br&gt;EQRankings.com, Graffe.com&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The move to UCS is the excuse SoE has been looking for to&#xD;
politically kill off EQIM.&amp;nbsp; Perhaps they feared a backlash if it&#xD;
was just taken away, and no explanation offered in return.&amp;nbsp; By&#xD;
moving everything to UCS, they have their explanation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In all&#xD;
honesty, it would maybe take a day's work to get the service back up&#xD;
and operational (if that?).&amp;nbsp; All the 'old' chat servers are still&#xD;
up and operational, so the hardware hasn't gone anywhere.&amp;nbsp; The&#xD;
regular EQ client can obviously use UCS channels/services, the packets&#xD;
still go across the wire.&amp;nbsp; The only thing I can see as a problem&#xD;
is the authentication to the new UCS method.&amp;nbsp; That's where the day&#xD;
comes in, to write something new to hook the existing IM infrastructure&#xD;
to the world servers to get authentication.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If by some chance&#xD;
they do decide to fix it, they will likely try to implement some kind&#xD;
of security to ensure that only their branded client will operate with&#xD;
the service.&amp;nbsp; This additional security layer will cause the&#xD;
service to break frequently and not work as intended as it will be&#xD;
bypassed within the first week of operation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;umm the program went unsupported years ago, they made a few patches to it when the server numbers changed but that was it, there was no additional development on the package and the actual link to download was removed from the board.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Given that fact it is dealing with your actual account name and password which is core to your everquest account and all your other ones if you subscribe to station access I do hope they build in the same level of security, encryption and SSL technology that is tighter then what the banks/cc companies and other finacial institutions &amp;nbsp;use for their systems. In addition I hope they retain the proprietary code required for the chat client to work correctly and come down hard legally on any 3rd party company that reverse engineeers it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</description>
