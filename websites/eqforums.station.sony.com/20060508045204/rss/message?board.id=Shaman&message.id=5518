    <title>Comparison of DoTs and Debuffs</title>
    <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Shaman&amp;message.id=5518</link>
    <description>Samanna.net is now presenting a writeup, prepared mostly by Giac and Macnair, of DoTs and Debuffs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://samanna.net/sham.issues/debuffs.jan06.shtml" target=_blank&gt;http://samanna.net/sham.issues/debuffs.jan06.shtml&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Feedback is welcome. Please note that we are only comparing these aspects of gameplay; we know that the classes compared (including Shaman) are frequently doing other things as well, but this paper only considers DoTs and Debuffs.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;I do alot of both grouping and soloing.  I would like to see some kind of change in our spell line up so that we have a resist modifier on our spells.  It seems a tad unfair when looking at that chart. &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Very nice write up.  This has all been said before to the Devs, but not as well thought out into 1 comparison chart like that.   There is not 1 thing that I can think of that is not already on there.  </description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Supposedly the Time cleric hammer(Theoretically all Cleric &amp;quot;gods&amp;quot; hammers) has a proc rate mod of 630%, and Panther has a proc rate mod of 400% to give you an idea as to how often that fires.  So if I can drop 1475 mana on three dual weilding melee, and get even one proc per dual weilder per tick, I'm doing 1200 Chromatic -300 DPS from Panther.  With DoTs, I'm spending 1648 for 1121 DR/PR/MR -0  damage per tick.  DoT's aren't even the most efficient shaman DPS anymore.  To be perfectly honest, I'd rather have Panther cleared to work on pets than to have the DoT's repaired.  I'm getting more and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;more efficient&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;DPS from one spell cast repeatedly at zero agro than having 4 or 5 up so I can debuff and cast less than 200 DPS of DoTs in an age with melee putting out 1000 DPS.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>The innately coded proc level only modifies the rate of innate procs, not buff procs.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Uh... yeah but the buff proc has an innately coded 400 rate mod.  So it goes off about a 2/3 as often as a cleric hammer.  And as a warrior who tanked a lot of Sebilis I'm acutely aware of how often those things go off and how much I'd kill being able to swing two of them :p  But that was the point I was getting at.  Panther fires off about 2/3 as often as a cleric hammer and those things are always going off.  That the chance of each melee being able to get at least one proc per tick, let alone one proc per round was inherently high and likely.  So even &amp;quot;worst case&amp;quot; the DPS from 3 casts of Panther was more effective and more efficient than stacking our three highest level DoT's.&lt;/div&gt;</description>
