      <title>server merger, and renaming file</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Morden&amp;message.id=658#M658</link>
      <description>From http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Crier&amp;message.id=100 Brenlo said:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Q: If I am from server A and move to Server B, will my user interface settings (viewport, bag location, hotkeys) and saved tradeskill recipes be saved to server B automatically, or will I have to change my server name to B in the userdata folder or somewhere else?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A: You will need to manually change your file name.  Details on how to do so will be posted here shortly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;well I'm tired of waiting for shortly to come so I have a question for anyone that might know.  I hate to have to remap all of this, and I know there are just a few files to be renamed, problem is I'm not sure which files all need to be renamed.&lt;br&gt;* I know UI_charname_morden.ini controls the skin layout (including transperencies and everything) so rename it to UI_charname_povar.ini&lt;br&gt;* I believe hotkey maps are in charname_morden.ini, so simply renaming that takes care of that aswell.&lt;br&gt;now catch is If I search the eq directory for any files containing the word morden there are just over 100 hits..I'm not renaming 100 files (i wasn't to keen on renaming 2 for each toon to start with)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;so instead i am likely going to write a batch file(or do it in C++ is i get adventureous) to do it, but I'm going to write it general so that I can post it here and anyone whos lazy like me can run it and save some work...so I have 2 questions:&lt;br&gt;1) does anyone know what files need to be renamed (if not then I'll just do them all)&lt;br&gt;2) does anyone know the min/max character name lengths (i want to say 4-12 but I'm not 100% sure).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks</description>

      <title>Older Guild Reforming on Povar</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Morden&amp;message.id=653#M653</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I would like to take this chance to welcome all from Morden Rasp to Povar. A few of us from the guild Zero Hour have decided to rebuild our guild. We are a family-type guild, who has always tried to help newer players advance their toons however they have chosen. Many have gone on to top guilds on the server. We would now like to get ourselves advanced as a whole, into PoP &amp;amp; beyond. We are very friendly to new players, work/military schedules, &amp;amp; oretty much all that happens IRL. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;We are currently looking for players of all classes/levels/playing experience. We are hoping to build our numbers up to casually raid (3-4x a week) in the future. We need players that have the desire to help the guild progress from the ground up. We are trying to focus on getting into higher game content, but will always welcome newer players as well.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Please feel free to visit us at: www.eqzerohour.net. Feel free to visit our forums &amp;amp; say hello. You can also send tells to Tikno, Lumy, Rhiannonmae, or Frojer for more info.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <title>Morden Rasp merging...</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Morden&amp;message.id=642#M642</link>
      <description>I am very disappointed in the decision by SOE to disband Morden Rasp and merge it with another server.  I did a great deal of research before starting to play EQ and chose MR specificallly because it was a preferred server, had fewer players, and was supposedly not scheduled for merge. In fact, I only play on MR (have no alternates on other servers). Every time I think about my carefully-chosen character names with an "X" behind them, I get annoyed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In recent weeks I have had increasing problems with players (transplants from other servers, I suspect) conducting themselves badly which I never experienced before. Perhaps it is just the tendencies of certain server populations to behave a certain way, but players on MR (in my experience) have always been courteous and easy to deal with.  This increase in competition and population is likely to make things even more heated.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although I really enjoy playing EQ, I have been considering other games and seriously wondering whether I should investigate my options there.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I suppose it is too late to reverse this decision, and honestly I am not sure anyone reads these anyway, but that's my two coppers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- T</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;Hi All,&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I am posting our charter here so everyone can enjoy its content. If you are interested in the guild dont hesistate to post after this post or /join futureguild in game. Any questions let me know&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;http://www.guildportal.com/Guild.aspx?GuildID=29888&amp;amp;TabID=267917&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Charter&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Guild Purpose:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/B&gt;Ancient Echoes was created to experience what we feel are the best parts of Everquest;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;the original game, Kunark, and Velious. We plan to begin by levelling, grouping, and getting to know one another. Eventually we will begin to raid content within each era of the game, step by step. Once we feel that we have experienced those area's to their fullest, we will move on to the next expansion. It is almost certain that there will be times when we are raiding content in the three different time periods at the same time, which will be familiar to experienced players. We will accomplish our goals without twinking, powerlevelling or powergaming. You will not be allowed to maintain guild access if you are suspected of the aforementioned game determents.The founders of this guild are very familiar with and firmly in favor of earned rewards and the sense of accomplishment obtained. If the Gods nod in our favor and we are able to best the beasts of Velious, we will continue our adventures into Luclin and beyond. If this sounds as if it would quench your thirst for adventure, apply within.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;U&gt;Zones:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/B&gt;As a member of Ancient Echoes, you are allowed to be within any of the first three era's zones (old world, Kunark, and Velious). We debated long and hard about the PoK, Nexus and Bazaar and in the end we have decided to allow access to those zones as well, but with limitations. Read each section below for those details. All other zones within Everquest are off limits until the appropriate expansion is opened to the guild.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;U&gt;Plane of Knowledge:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/B&gt;Access to this zone is for travel purposes only. We originally wanted to disallow this zone, but the wizards and druids we spoke to said that they did not care about losing their travel agent roles. Do not stop to get buffs unless they are buffs within the first three era's. All tradeskill items from this zone are allowed if the item made is either a general Everquest item or of the appropriate era.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;U&gt;Nexus:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/B&gt;This zone is simple. You can be here and use anything within this zone.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;U&gt;Bazaar:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/B&gt;Access to the Bazaar is allowed with the following stipulations. You cannot purchase any item here that is not from the first three era's and must be obtainable at your current level either solo, group or raid by Ancient Echoes. You may sell your wares here at your leisure.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;U&gt;Newbie Armor, Weapon and Tutorial Charm:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/B&gt;All of these items are allowed and encouraged to be completed. They are a good source of starting items for the amount of time we spend doing them.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;U&gt;Off-Limit Items:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/B&gt;LDoN Wayfarer Stones, Leadership XP, and AA points.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;U&gt;Casual versus Raiding guild:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/B&gt;Once we achieve the numbers we want for membership we will evaluate our raiding schedule. For the time being, we will be a mix of encouraging character advancement and having fun mini-raids in between. With enough interest, we have very capable and experienced leaders that enjoy guild advancement.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;U&gt;Levels:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/B&gt;Our current recruitment focus are characters from level 1 to 25. The level ranges of our recruitment focus will obviously adjust according to guild level.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Once the guild reaches 75% of all active members between level's 46 to 52, we will open the guild to advance to level 60. So currently, guild advancement is capped at level 52. This is to allow us to do some raiding on the illustrious Nagafen and Vox.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;U&gt;Twinking:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/B&gt;We do not allow twinking. If you cannot obtain said item solo, grouped or in a raid run by Ancient Echoes, then the item is considered to be a twink item. You cannot accept gifts from others at all unless it is a fellow guild member and they acquired the item following our guidelines.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;U&gt;Races and Classes:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/B&gt;All races are allowed within the guild. All classes are allowed within the guild.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;U&gt;Anon and Roleplay:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/B&gt;These modes of play are not allowed.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;Tradeskill Items:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Only tradeskill items from the first 3 era's may be used. If it was not introduced during one of those 3 era's it is off limits. For example all the LDoN made armor is off limits.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;Multi-Boxing and Alt's:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;The focus of this guild will be one character for each person. We will not be equipping multiple characters. If you choose to play an alt to pass time that is your business but they wont be receiving any equipment from the guild.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Co-Leader Scrump&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>"Play Nice" policy on MR?</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Morden&amp;message.id=640#M640</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I love the game everquest.&amp;nbsp; Ive been playing for almost two years now, and I consider MR to be my home.&amp;nbsp; All my friends are here and we have a great guild, one that perscribes and does its best to promote what we percieve as "The Play Nice" policy in EQ.&amp;nbsp; After all, we live here we want it to be a nice place for everyone.&amp;nbsp; However, something happened last night that really upset me and Id like an explination from the people who charge my credit card each and every month like clockwork.&amp;nbsp; After two years, I think this is not unreasonable.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I wont mention names in the hopes that this will open a discussion with the people who run this game.&amp;nbsp; Our guild has experienced two incidents where someone clearly and blatantly violated The Play Nice policy and we took the steps they tell us to take to resolve the issue.&amp;nbsp; In niether case was the issue resolved in anything resembling a fair and equatable manner.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;In the first, a toon was deguilded after running a 2 box during a raid.&amp;nbsp; One was on autofollow (in our raid soaking up DKP) and the other was in GE PLing another toon.&amp;nbsp; When asked about it, he was surprized that we would even take notice.&amp;nbsp; He was deguilded shortly after.&amp;nbsp; He immediately proceeded to the guild hall with an alt we were not aware of&amp;nbsp;and shouted taunts at us while striping our bank.&amp;nbsp; He then took his ill gotten booty, told us his friends the GMs would not answer our request for help in the matter and /auctioned off as much as he could as fast as he could.&amp;nbsp; When a GM finally answered our request for help days later, we were able to recover about half of the gear he had stole and I still was recieving nasty tells from him on a daily basis from alts I couldnt block fast enough.&amp;nbsp; Obviously, there was no repercusion for this behavior from SOE.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The second happened last night.&amp;nbsp; We invited along a new player on a raid to Kael and the AoW.&amp;nbsp; This mob was a challenge for our growing guild, one we had failed on a few times and it was an important kill for the moral of the guild.&amp;nbsp; We did manage to take him and were rewarded with not one but 3 BoCs.&amp;nbsp; The mob was locked down while we resolved the issue of loots with an allied guild that was present on the raid.&amp;nbsp; New players had asked about loots and it had been explained in GREAT DETAIL how our DKP works PRIOR TO the mob being even attempted.&amp;nbsp; When the issue was resolved, our guild leader unlocked the mob so that the three blades could be taken by 3 different officers for DKP biding and the allied guild.&amp;nbsp; The moment he released the mob, this new character ninja looted one of the BoCs.&amp;nbsp; When confronted and given the oppurtunity (Stupid us, we felt he deserved a chance to give it back) to return it, he ran and banked the BoC, logged an alt and attempted to sell it in the bazaar.&amp;nbsp; Needless to say, about 30 petitions for assistance were sent and about an hour later a GM showed up.&amp;nbsp; The toon in question stated that he thought it was "Roll" for loots.&amp;nbsp; Every other person on that raid knew the deal and made no attempt to take it.&amp;nbsp; After about an hour of debate, the GM proceeded to roll for the blade and awarded it to our guild for distribution after we won the roll.&amp;nbsp; How is that fair?&amp;nbsp; Certainly, its great that we got the blade back, but what if we hadnt?&amp;nbsp; Too bad, so sorry, some tard can snake your hard earned loots and get away with it at any time is the message I received.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Given these experineces, I have to come to the conclusion that SOE no longer cares about The Play Nice Policy.&amp;nbsp; Our guild no longer can count on SOE, the makers of this game, to help us out when there is clear violation of this much needed policy in the game.&amp;nbsp; We have to run our raids and guild like a hawk, watching everything and never trusting anyone.&amp;nbsp; Gee, what fun.&amp;nbsp; In the past,&amp;nbsp;I have seen players given 3 day vacations and more for such behavior, but I guess they are worried they will go play another game if they do that.&amp;nbsp; Meanwhile, the rest of us loose out.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Id really like to see a response from SOE other than deleting this post.&amp;nbsp; It might give me back some of the faith I used to have in you.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Speaking for myself alone not the guild I am a member of,&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Hi&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Does anyone know what the concequenses are of the upcoming server merges concerning guilds?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I am in particular interested in what we as guild needs to do before the merge and what we need to do after the merge&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;What exactly is SoE doing concerning guild assets, members etc during the merge?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Are they handling the merge for guilds completely - meaning that the guild is operational form day one on the new server or are there items, members and things that we as guild need to be aware of and plan to do?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Anyone know?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Ill be posting this on as many guild sites as possible also&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Our server dies on the 11th and we become Povar. This makes me very sad, after all i started Eaedyin on the day the server went live and have been playing him since.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So to mourn Morden and get us in the mood for the new challenges Povar will bring us lets have a massive blowout on the 10 of april starting at midnight and lasting until they kick us off to tear down our home.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Lets help each other get that spell we need or that we want etc. See if we can raise alchol tolerance to 255 or whatever.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>looking for a guild</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Morden&amp;message.id=631#M631</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;My husband &amp;amp; I are looking for a more classic EQ experience and are sort of burned out on all the newer highend ways that have come about since introduction of Plane of Knowledge. Is there any family oriented guilds out there that wouldn't mind having 2 workday evening players? We also play on weekends, but we don't play as intensely as some folks do, since we also like to persue interests outside the computer world.&amp;nbsp; We have just created our characters on this server (all of our higher level twinkies are on another older server). Anyone know of a good place to have friends and have fun? Please let me know!&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Paying 250 per Blue Diamond. Thats more then you would get from a merchant, yet less then on bazaar. If you have a bunch, give me a tell in game, or perhaps I will setup a buyer :)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <title>Zek'ers looking for a home.</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Morden&amp;message.id=623#M623</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Hi.&amp;nbsp; I'm a 70 shd with 440+ aa's, my real life friend plays a 70 shaman with 450+ aa's.&amp;nbsp; We're currently on the Zek pvp server and looking to move off it to another server.&amp;nbsp; We had decided to go to Firiona Vie, but at the last minute SoE changed their minds about allowing people to move to this server, so now we need to make new plans.&amp;nbsp; My friend can't stay on Zek primarily for real-life reasons -- he has a job and wife and kids and thus limited play time, which he doesn't want entirely taken up with getting pk'd or trained or on a corpse run.&amp;nbsp; Also, he can need to go afk unexpectedly to take care of the baby -- not something fun to do on a pvp server.&amp;nbsp; I'd like to continue to hang out with him, so I will probably also move to wherever he goes.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;We're looking for a guild that farms time, qvic, mpg, rss, and is working towards txevu, tacvi, and anguish.&amp;nbsp; I'm flagged for time, qvic, and txevu.&amp;nbsp; We're both flagged for the elemental planes and for kod'taz.&amp;nbsp; We're looking for a guild that doesn't have a ton of shadowknights or shaman in it already, but rather has a shortage of them that we can fill.&amp;nbsp; We'd like a guild that has between 50 and 90 people on at peak times and that almost always has 20 people on.&amp;nbsp; We'd prefer to raid in the evenings US time, but I mostly am playing during the day us times while I'm between jobs.&amp;nbsp; I'll most likely be doing DoN missions or quests or tradeskills during the day and raiding in the evenings until I get another job, at which point it'll be mostly just raiding.&amp;nbsp; My friend doesn't play at all on Sunday, he spends that day with his family, but I can box him (or he can box me) as needed.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;We'd like a guild that has either a bid dkp system or a similar other type of system that elimitates the chances of favoritism or bias from loot distribution (i.e. not a "merit" system) and something where the first person to get an item pays a premium over someone who gets the same item a year later (i.e. not a fixed cost dkp system).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;We currently have mostly elemental planes &amp;amp; vex thal gear with some quest gear worked in.&amp;nbsp; Neither of us have any loot from time or qvic or MPG raids/trials or RSS raids, but the gear we do have is about the best obtainalbe pre-plane of time.&amp;nbsp; We stayed loyal for many years to a guild that farmed VT &amp;amp; the EP's but never quite made it to plane of time.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;We each have some alts -- he has a level 65 ranger and I have a level 52 wizard and a level 11 rogue.&amp;nbsp; We have a friend that has a level 67 cleric that would most likely go with us wherever we go.&amp;nbsp; He doesn't play much any more, but I'd box the cleric to help him get levels and aa's and to have someone to buff, heal, and rez the group.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;We don't want to move to a server that doesn't have any raiding guilds going on.&amp;nbsp; We don't want to spend 3 months as an applicant somewhere,&amp;nbsp;we'd prefer a shorter application time -- we have played for over five years, we're not new to the game and we are the original owners of the account, not people that bought the accounts on e-bay and don't know the classes.&amp;nbsp; We're each in our 30's and married in real life, so we're not immature kids that will cause problems for a guild if they do invite us to be members in an expedited fashion.&amp;nbsp; We'd prefer to be in a guild with primarily mature adults running it.&amp;nbsp; Role-playing server would have been our first preference for this reason, but Sony has decided not to allow transfers there, so we'll try to find something else.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If you'd recommend Morden Rasp as a server for us, please let us know why.&amp;nbsp; Also let us know what the guilds on Morden Rasp are like -- guilds in time?&amp;nbsp; guilds in qvic?&amp;nbsp; guilds in tacvi?&amp;nbsp; guilds in anguish?&amp;nbsp; Is there a guild here that people would recommend as a new home for us?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Thanks,&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Bolas&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>Days of old (old school guild)Recruiting!</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Morden&amp;message.id=622#M622</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Days of old, the new "old school" guild on Morden rasp is up and running and doing very very well. We are all having fun doing quests, raiding the old world content and gearing up for more of it. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Currently we are doing a recruiting spreee before we raise the guild max level. We want a chance for otherso get in on the great fun without having to worry about catching up very far. And we will help those that come aboard catch up to us.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If you are even remotely interested in the old world style of play that is fully thought and planned out, then check out our web site at: http://DaysofOld.guildportal.com! Read our charter on the left as it explains all that we play by and then use the recruiting link to learn how to join us!&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;You can also come into Morden Rasp and /join BOR to chat with us, get to know us and ask all the questions you need!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So if the game has become stale and boring, tired of the upper end grind or you just want to check out the game as it used to be (as close as we can get it anyhow) then c'mon and check us out and get in on the great fun!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;See you all there!&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
