    <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I was thinking while I was vendor diving before the servers went down.&amp;nbsp; Would it be possible to set up the npc vendors to always keep items that have a tradeskill useable flag on them at the top when they get stuff sold to them?&amp;nbsp; That way all the stuff that is not useable in tradeskills would always be the first things to be lost to the vendors display limit.&amp;nbsp; Also I suppose you could stick them at the top of the list as they get bought so that the ones that have been on the list the longest are the first to go instead of the last.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;I hate all merchants who only sell their original stock of items. Anything a player sells to them goes into a black hole someplace because it never appears for sale again once the merchant has paid for it. Does it make any sense at all that a merchant would buy something then destroy it? No. A real merchant would try to resell it at a profit or he would soon be out of business.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;A partial fix would be searchable/sortable vendors.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If they can sort items buy name they can obviously be able to sort them by types in a drop down window (IE show only TS items) or at the very least have a search field on the vendor window to match names.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I mean come on the Vendors can ask me if I want to buy useless piece of junk X but I cant tell them what I am looking for? :p&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Not a comprehensive fix but would help some.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;A comprehensive fix imho would be be linking the vendor code to the barter code globally.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Where a merchant buying item X would automatically sell it to player Y in bartermode offerring the best price.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;That would likely be a lot of code though and also more than likely unpopular with folks that successfully vendor dive now ;)&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>Alternately, when you sell an item used in tailoring to a brewing vendor, make it appear on a tailoring vendor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Means instead of each vendor having 2-3 of each tradeskill item, 2-3 vendors will have stacks, and less slots used up. consider it a coalition of the POK traders.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I do A LOT of vendor mining.&amp;nbsp; But no, I don't want only tradeskill or quest items to be kept.&amp;nbsp; Someone was asking what people did buy off of vendors that wasn't in those categories, here's some of the things I buy&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Spells&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Items for Tribute&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Armor/Weapon Upgrades (you know, not everyone is level 70 and full of no drop gear, I get quite a lot of stuff from NPCs)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Pet Weapons&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Food and Drink that is made by tradeskills but not used by tradeskills themselves&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I can probably think of more things, but that is pretty good for less than 30 seconds of thinking.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>Still think it would be easier and better to de-pop and re-pop the NPC vendors every X days.  Can reset many vendors manually this way by killing them, but many other vendors are not killable (eg PoK, PoT).</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;This was suggested on the EQ Traders boards as well.&amp;nbsp; Not everything that people vendor mine for is a tradeskill item.&amp;nbsp; So while this may partially solve one problem, it creates a whole new one.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Actually what was suggested on EQ traders was that only the items with Tradeskill flags on them be kept at all.&amp;nbsp; What I proposed, they would just be kept when it came between them and something not tradeskill tagged being added.&amp;nbsp; So vendor diving for non tradeskill items would still be completely doable.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Besides there aren't a huge number of droppable quest items that aren't either fairly common or Tradeskill tagged.&amp;nbsp; Also Questers only have to go farm it once, Tradeskillers have to go farm stuff consistantly. &lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Xianzu_Monk_Tunare on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;12-15-2005&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;10:58 AM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;And those items will still have pretty much the same chance of them being on the vendor still as they do now.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
and still not all tradeskill items have a tradeskill tag either&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;What ones pretell?&amp;nbsp; After all if there are items like you suggest that are used in Tradeskill associated combines but don't have the TS flag then you need to let the Dev's know or at the very least /bug it so that it can be fixed.&amp;nbsp; I myself have not seen any like this.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
And why should tradeskiller be treated on a prefferential basis compared to other vendor miners ....&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;What exactly do you vendor mine that isn't either a tradeskill item or a quest item?&amp;nbsp; Quest items tend to be off of certain mobs in a certain place and you generally only need 1-4 of them.&amp;nbsp; Generally if a hard to get item gets sold to an npc vendor it would be cheaper to just go to the bazaar and buy it off of people there, unless it is a quest item that is flagged to sell for like 1cp or some other fairly low price.&amp;nbsp; So really what else is there to Vendor mine?&amp;nbsp; Tribute items?&amp;nbsp; Tribute amounts are linked to NPC vendor buying amounts so that's not worth while.&amp;nbsp; Rechargeable items?&amp;nbsp; Again you can usually find the same item a lot cheaper in the Bazaar fully charged than you can off an npc vendor.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;In other words Tradeskillers are the vendor miners.&amp;nbsp; For that matter the majority of npc vendors wouldn't be loosing all that much stuff sold to them.&amp;nbsp; Only a few that are used regularly by a large percentage of the server would ever be innidated with TS items (merchants near banks, at the LDoN and DoN camps, and in the Guild Lobby and Hall), and only when the servers had been up for an extended period of time.&amp;nbsp; Most will have a number of them but far more non TS items.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
etc etc&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A solution has to be more than a quick fix, as quick fixes have been known to cause their own set of issues&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;They don't do solutions, they do do quick fixes.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>1) If merchants clutter their stock with tardeskill items over non tradeskill items, the non tradeskill items will have less chance to be on the vendor. They have limited amounts of sace and then will destroy the items sold that are non tradeskill flagged to keep to 80 visible items&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2)At least one item in dodh isn;t tardeskill flagged yet. The stuff does get reported and corrected but that takes time. It ain;t exacly on top priority&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3)I vendor min eplenty of non trdeskill stuff, both for bazaar selling and for quests. It even paid for some tradeskilling. Vendor mining isn;t the prerogative and playground of tradeskillers only. If anything tradeskillers are notoriously bad clutterers of merchants by buying crap stuff at merchant 1 (from unlimited stock) and reselling it across loads of other vendors, taking up the available slots. They don't need fixing over others as they are as much part of the problem &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4)sounds judgemental and sounds like you insist on looking at one side of the coin only. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In short, you shot your own credibility cause you propose something and defend it cause it will benefit you, even when it potentially will impact others negatively.

&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;There are far far less tradeskill items than there are non tradeskill items.&amp;nbsp; It will be very rare for any merchant to ever be completely full of tradeskill useable items unless someone goes out of their way to make it such.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;See above.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The only stuff worth buying to be sold in the bazaar is some Quest stuff, and generally what gets sold to the vendors in that reguard is so common it's worthless.&amp;nbsp; Maybe more people know what stuff is for on my server who knows.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Actually that is RARELY a tradeskiller doing that. &amp;nbsp;That is someone going and buying a bunch of items to do a combine with 0 skill for a quest or such, and then after they succeed they&amp;nbsp;sell the components back at whatever vendor is the nearest.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
4)sounds judgemental and sounds like you insist on looking at one side of the coin only. &#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Nope, I just don't see a good reason for vendor trash to be saved above items that will actually be bought.&amp;nbsp; If you want to go and buy it to try to sell to some stupid guy in the bazaar you'll still be able to just not as often.&amp;nbsp; There are far far fewer people who vendor farm for non-tradeskill items than there are that farm for tradeskill items.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
In short, you shot your own credibility cause you propose something and defend it cause it will benefit you, even when it potentially will impact others negatively. A quick fix like you propose would work out in my advantage but would not be a fair solution.&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Nope, I'm not defending it cause it would benefit me, in fact I don't vendor mine unless as was the case before when the servers are going down soon and I don't have time to do anything else.&amp;nbsp; I might look thru the inventory of a vendor I sell to, but I don't vendor farm&amp;nbsp;as much as you apparently do.&amp;nbsp; Also the only people it would really impact negatively would be the people who vastly overprice tradeskill items in the bazaar.&amp;nbsp; As I've said repeatedly it would take actual intent to fill any&amp;nbsp;npc vendor with ALL tradeskill items.&amp;nbsp; It is far from as easy to do as you're trying to make it out to be.&amp;nbsp; Add in the fact that people will buy out various TS items they do need when they see them that will make more room on the whole for other worthless items to be on the merchants for you to buy.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
A much better "quick fix" is the reguylar repop of vendors in the non combat zones (pok/potranq/bazaar and guildlobby). other vendors youc an reset by killing them&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Actually this will result in the loss of more useable items then it would the use of them in anything. &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;I do not see how.&amp;nbsp; People will continue to sell the exact same things to them as they did before.&amp;nbsp; It's just that it won't be perma-locked with junk after all the good stuff is purchased off.&amp;nbsp; This will just give us all more opportunities to buy the good stuff before they get locked-up again with junk.&amp;nbsp; A regular repop will allow this cycle to repeat between patches.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;A simple question would be:&amp;nbsp; Do you prefer to vendor dive the week or two after a patch or one month+ later?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Yes you still can find stuff later, but it's much more rare in a zone that hasn't been repopped or on vendors that have not been killed and reset.&amp;nbsp; Usually the pok vendor npc's are very locked after a couple weeks and I don't even bother checking them.&amp;nbsp; I'd rather have the hopes I have of finding some good stuff for that ~week after a patch every week, not just once per patch.&amp;nbsp; A random repop of 7 days +/- 1 day would be great, imo.&amp;nbsp; Even if it was *only* in non-combat zones (pok, pot, etc) and on non-attackable mobs, I'd be ok with that.&amp;nbsp; We have ways of reseting the other npc's. &amp;gt;=)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Making all combatable vendors lvl 1 would be extra cool =D&amp;nbsp; Faction needs to stay, obviously.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Since Xianzu is apparently ignoring my previous post, here's a list of some of the items I vendor mine that are not used for tradeskills:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Spells&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Items for Tribute&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Armor/Weapon Upgrades (you know, not everyone is level 70 and full of no drop gear, I get quite a lot of stuff from NPCs,)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Pet Weapons&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Food and Drink that is made by tradeskills but not used by tradeskills themselves&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

Tons and tons of good stuff can be found on them, much cheaper than players sell it in The Bazaar. It's far and away the most economical way to bootstrap yourself up on a new server.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I can't begin to see why tradeskillers should have preference over any other shopper.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;What you all fail to realize is that Tradeskill items will be bought and removed from the lists.  The non tradeskill items get to sit there until the vendors are full of them and never change till the server reset or a zone crash.</description>

Not as good as having a complete vendor reset and wastes a little cash, but better than nothing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another, similar, method that works for common items is to seed vendors. For example, when I was skilling up Poison Making I needed a ton of Phosporous Powder and Golden Ember Powder. Phosporous was as common as dirt but Golden Ember was considerably more difficult. In order to increase the chance of mining Golden Ember I sold a single piece of the powder to all the major vendors in PoK. I checked back once/twice a day and bought all the extra powder (save one). Works great but certainly not possible with more expensive components.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;/cheer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vendor mine trick minus one is an easy solution to keep merchant seeded. I use it extensively. Alas other miners aren't as thoughtfull about it and sometimes buy out the stock. In some cases it is worth reseeding, in others not. It is a form of playercontrol over merchant stock- same as killing a merchant to reset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yes the nitpicking got to a high level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Items i vendor mined (non tradeskill flagged)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Mask of obteneration;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Iksar illusion mask&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Various quest pieces like dansk blossom/Dansk branch/Kyv bowstring which sell for decent amounts of pp&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- High tribute items with relatively low merchant value (look at the lists that float around)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- various spells in the lvl 50-60 range for my cleric and wizard&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About unflagged items: When notified they get fixed (eventually) so what wasn't flagged 3 months or 6 months ago can very well be flagged now.  Most people that encounter a recipe which needs an unflagged item will keep this relatively quiet to facilitate vendor mining. Eventually these filter out though and then get corrected&lt;/p&gt;</description>
