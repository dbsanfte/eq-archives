&lt;P&gt;Beastlord&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; DPS&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;DPS evaluation for all classes has begun and will be the focus of part #2 of the class Re-Envision process&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: COLOR: #cccccc; **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: Roman?? New ?Times 12pt;&gt;&lt;BR line-break? **SMURF**?mso-special-character:&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;You know we have issues with it and we know you are working on it.&amp;nbsp; This is just here as a little reminder in case either side forgets.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;While looking at DPS though please keep burst DPS in mind as well as sustained DPS.&amp;nbsp; At the heart of almost all beastlord issues is our division of power and burst DPS is no different.&amp;nbsp; Most classes can use a disc to drastically raise their DPS or mana dump Beastlords can do neither.&amp;nbsp; Our nukes are tied to a 30 second refresh; our disc only raises our melee DPS which is about 1/3rd of our total DPS. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Possible solutions:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; There are actually a lot of ways to go about fixing our DPS, but we have to be careful that in fixing our DPS we do not create even more problems.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Adjust some of our current AAs.&amp;nbsp; Right now Beastlords have a ton of AAs that give very small returns.&amp;nbsp; Some of our class AAs such as feral swipe and bestial alignment give extremely small boosts and have other issues.&amp;nbsp; Tweaking these AAs so they actually better fit Beastlords and give more of a return could help. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Itemization also plays a big part in how a beastlord performs.&amp;nbsp; We see Beastlords having to gain a lot of different effects and focuses and some simply aren't there or are too rare.&amp;nbsp; There are some Beastlords in Anguish still wearing time loot just for a certain focus effect.&amp;nbsp; Also when it comes to weapons please understand how a beastlord works and give us some other options.&amp;nbsp; The beastlord only 2h from MPG trials is a great example of a weapon that just doesn't fit Beastlords.&amp;nbsp; Lots of classes look at the weapon and think how great it is, but most Beastlords realize that it isn't even an upgrade for them.&amp;nbsp; Again we are not asking for "better" items, but rather better "beastlord items". &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Finally, please keep in mind just how much time/effort a beastlord has to put into the game to reach their max potential.&amp;nbsp; A beastlord needs more items/effects and more AA than almost everyone to reach their potential on DPS.&amp;nbsp; There are several passive changes that could easily be made at this point that would help with our DPS issues.&amp;nbsp; Please do not try to solve this issue by having us grind out another 200AA or raid/farm another half dozen items.&amp;nbsp; Time/effort verse reward is a huge beastlord issue already and we'd hate to see a fix to something like our DPS just make it worse.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;Level 60 -&amp;nbsp; +25 sta, +100 atk, +50 resist all for 450 mana&lt;BR&gt;Level 65 -&amp;nbsp; +40 sta, +150 atk, +65 resist all for 600 mana&lt;BR&gt;Level 70 -&amp;nbsp; +52 sta, +187 atk, +65 resist all for 750 mana&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Also going from the 60 to the 65 version we lost the Peridot requirement and the refresh went down from 3 minutes to 2 minutes. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The line clearly was designed as a mana intensive buff that granted both a defensive boost (HPs via stamina and resists) and an offensive boost (via the large amount of raw attack).&amp;nbsp; However, the level 70 version falls very short.&amp;nbsp; The extra 12 stamina does absolutely nothing in most cases as people are stamina capped.&amp;nbsp; The resists didn’t move at all.&amp;nbsp; That leaves us with an upgrade that costs 150 more mana to grant an extra 37 atk for a 6.5 minutes base duration.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Possible solutions:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; Add some effects to the buff to help make the buff useful and desired again.&amp;nbsp; An effect to increase proc rate is one of the most popular choices as this would again make the buff desirable to both tanks (more agro procs) and DPS (more damage procs).&amp;nbsp; There are lots of possibilities though and we welcome the chance to discuss and test possible adjustments to this spell.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;3) &lt;STRONG&gt;Beastlord warder graphics: &lt;FONT color=#3366ff&gt;&lt;SPAN red; ?Century Gothic?? **SMURF**?COLOR: mso-bidi-font-family:&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

This was identified as a known bug a long time ago, but still remains unfixed. Beastlords would really like some communication on when we might see a fix for this, or if perhaps a model change is in order similiar to what trolls recent saw to address the long standing graphic issues their warder had.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- Troll beastlords overall are unhappy with the new graphic of their warders. Some do like it, but there's been a big outcry on various boards by those that simply don't like the new model and want their croc back(or atleast a new croc). &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Possible solutions: The beastlord community as a whole welcomes some communication in fixing both of these issues. If the coding is too difficult or time consuming to repair the old models, then please let us know that. Perhaps polls could be done on the boards, or even in-game to let players vote on which model they would prefer for their warder.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;4)&amp;nbsp; AA cost/benefit &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being evaluated&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;This is a large issue that pretty much goes back to our division of power.&amp;nbsp; Although this isn't just a beastlord issue it does seem to hit Beastlords the hardest of all.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;For AAs we see Beastlords paying just as much for an AA that gives us a much smaller return for the AAs than other classes that can buy it.&amp;nbsp; For example we see Beastlords paying the same number of AA for crit nukes that wizards do, then paying just as much for crit dots as necros and shaman do and finally shelling out just as many AA as monks and rogues do for melee crits. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Please understand that we aren't asking to nuke like wizards or dot like necros.&amp;nbsp; What we are saying though is don't make us pay for what we aren't getting.&amp;nbsp; This situation reminds me a lot of the old hybrid exp penalty.&amp;nbsp; If we are getting 1/3rd or less in some cases from these AAs as others then please don't make us pay as much for them.&amp;nbsp; I know some will say not every AA can be great or something to that effect.&amp;nbsp; The bottom line though is that in many cases we simply don't have another choice.&amp;nbsp; Beastlords have very few class specific AAs and many of them (i.e. feral swipe, see below) are very poor. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Possible solutions:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; Add some combination AAs that reflect our division of power.&amp;nbsp; These AAs could help our melee and our pet DPS; help our nuking and our healing, or any number of other options.&amp;nbsp; Also consider cheaper versions of some AAs to reflect our lower return on them.&amp;nbsp; Theft of life verse healing gift is a good example of this. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;5)&amp;nbsp; Gear options &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being evaluated&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This is actually a two fold issue.&amp;nbsp; First is the issue that we are very limited in some options such as healing focus, beneficial spell haste, and several other effects.&amp;nbsp; Also, similar to the issue to #4 Beastlords get a smaller return on most items than any other class and we also have more items that we have to acquire in order to achieve our full potential.&amp;nbsp; Again this isn't just a beastlord issue as some other classes can relate I'm sure, but this is the beastlord top 10.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;As an example lets say a beastlord wants to progress their DPS.&amp;nbsp; First they have to get their melee effects such as a haste item, worn atk, some accuracy, a couple good weapons, a cleave item, etc.&amp;nbsp; Then they have to get some items to help their casting side of DPS.&amp;nbsp; This means grabbing nuke focus, dot focus, mana pres, and some flowing thought.&amp;nbsp; Also we can't forget our warders so top it all off with a pet focus item. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;None of that touches on the other aspects of being a beastlord such as tanking, healing, or buffing.&amp;nbsp; Simply put for a beastlord to progress by a certain amount they need to get far more items than others do.&amp;nbsp; Like with issue 4 we aren’t asking for more than any other class we simply ask that we stop having to work twice as hard to get half as much. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Possible solutions:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; Add focus effects that touch on multiple parts of what a beastlord does.&amp;nbsp; This is similar to the AAs mentioned above, but give us some focus effects that help our nukes and our heals.&amp;nbsp; Perhaps add some focus effects that boost our nuke and dot DPS.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Also please look at focus effect itemization, especially at the high-end.&amp;nbsp; Currently Beastlords have a very hard time getting beneficial spell haste, and healing focus.&amp;nbsp; Meanwhile, there are over a dozen items that have +cold dmg or +fire dmg on them.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Finally, and most importantly when making beastlord items please remember the class they are for.&amp;nbsp; There are a lot of items that would be totally over the top on some classes that a beastlord wouldn't even wear or consider an upgrade.&amp;nbsp; The 2h blunt from MPG trials is a great example of an item lots of people think is great for Beastlords, but most Beastlords at that point in progression would lose DPS by equipping.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;6)&amp;nbsp; Feral swipe &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being evaluated&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I think the biggest problem people have with this AA is how much potential it has.&amp;nbsp; This is one of a limited number of beastlord only AAs, but it unfortunately has so many issues that many Beastlords either haven't bought it or don’t use it; even after reaching 700+ AA in some cases. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Possible solutions:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; Please increase the range on the AA first and foremost.&amp;nbsp; There are numerous times where you will be in melee with a mob and trying to avoid AE ramp, but still be out of feral swipes range.&amp;nbsp; Also please look into the damage/refresh/uhhh everything on this AA lol.&amp;nbsp; Right now this AA does less damage over time than kick does.&amp;nbsp; This is one of our few class specific AAs and it currently is quite poor in terms of AA spent to DPS gained.&amp;nbsp; We have lots of ideas for changes to this AA and again welcome any chance to discuss/test/tune this AA further.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;7)&amp;nbsp; Dots &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being evaluated&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Dots for Beastlords are another one of those things that look ok on paper, but in actual application don’t quite measure up.&amp;nbsp; There are several issues that really lower the viability of our dots.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; One of the biggest issues is the lack of a resist mod on them.&amp;nbsp; SK, rng, nec, dru, etc all have resist mods built into their dots.&amp;nbsp; Most Beastlords think that our dots don’t have a resist mod because they are balanced like shaman dots.&amp;nbsp; Shaman though have a big resist debuff that can always be used to help them better land their dots. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The second issue with dots is that focus effects and AA for dots skews the numbers more than many seem to realize.&amp;nbsp; There are over a dozen items with +cold focus damage on them, but almost no items that give Beastlords a similar boost to their poi/dis dot damage.&amp;nbsp; Also with how AAs are set up Beastlords will get SCF to help their nukes long before they get crit affliction to help their dots.&amp;nbsp; I know many Beastlords that even at around 500 AA still don’t have crit affliction.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;With all of these factors added up suddenly that extra efficiency that dots have on paper quickly dwindles away.&amp;nbsp; The recent changes to dots went a long way toward making them more useable and for many classes the changes were sufficient, but in order for many Beastlords to give a spell slot to these spells some other tweaks need to be made.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Possibly solutions:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; Add a resist mod to our dots.&amp;nbsp; They are on most of the other dots in the game and it just seems like they are MIA on the beastlord dots.&amp;nbsp; If there is a balance or tuning reason why Beastlords should have a much harder time landing a dot than an SK or a RNG or various other classes then please let us know as we simply don’t understand and again welcome the communication.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Also please look at how focus effects and AA impact dots for us.&amp;nbsp; This was partially covered by a couple of the other issues on the list, but the almost total lack of dot focus effects for Beastlords and the extremely high cost of our dot crit AA really hinder the current viability of dots in a Beastlord’s&amp;nbsp; spell lineup.&amp;nbsp; Making it so that some of our existing effects (such as the focus on the 1.5/2.0 epics) increase not only our nuke dmg, but also our dot dmg would help a lot.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;8} AE rampage &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being evaluated&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This gets brought up quite a bit, but one of the biggest issues with pet survivability on raids in AE rampage.&amp;nbsp; We understand that you don’t want having a pet to be mindless, but AE ramp is a bit much in some cases.&amp;nbsp; Having trash mobs do it in some places is a real pain(no pun intended).&amp;nbsp; Also you have to understand what our options are.&amp;nbsp; At the summit we were told that you would look into which models AE&lt;BR&gt;ramp so we’d have some warning and could hold our pets back.&amp;nbsp; That makes sense for a mage or necro who is standing back and blasting the mob, but what about the beastlord who is up there melee’n the mob?&amp;nbsp; I mean by not having our pets attacking we are already losing DPS; we can’t be expected to not melee the mob at all and just drop nukes right? &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Also understand that people are losing pets even when paying attention and doing what they can.&amp;nbsp; There are times where you have your pet set up right and they are pounding away outside AE ramp range, but they keep trying to sneak up because of how pet coding is.&amp;nbsp; I don’t know how many times (going back to earth B warlord) I’ve been doing good, doing good, poof there goes fluffy.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Things like pets putting themselves into AE ramp without us having time to fix it, pets pathing so poorly that they run into AE ramp sometimes while positioning them, pets being slow to move and respond so even when we back them off and try to make them run and hide they still buy it, etc all make it very difficult for a beastlord to keep their pets up in many cases even when they are paying attention and doing what they should. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Possible solutions:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; Make pets immune to AE rampage.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I know some will think this is a bit extreme, but with all the issues stacked against pet control and avoiding/surviving AE rampage this seems to be the easiest solution. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;If making pets immune is just too much then please put a check so that if the pet isn’t on top of the hate list then the damage they take from AE rampage is greatly lowered. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;9)&amp;nbsp; Pet buff control &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The ability to now see pet buff timers is a nice change, but pet classes are still wondering if changes will be made that allow us to manage our pet’s buffs like we do our own. There are many stacking issues, ninja buffing happens and especially with pet affinity it's very common to have a buff on your pet that you don't want for whatever reason.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Proposed solution:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; Please allow us to selectively remove buffs from our pets.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;10)&amp;nbsp; Raid utility &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being evaluated&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;I don’t like how this sounds, but I honestly don’t know another way to say it.&amp;nbsp; What exactly is the point of a beastlord past the first on a raid currently?&amp;nbsp; We don’t expect raids to need as many Beastlords as clerics, or be as desired as rogues.&amp;nbsp; One beastlord can SA a whole raid, perfection does far, far less now than paragon did then, slow clickies and better slow spells are all over, level 70 fero is a top 10 issue, etc. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Possible solutions:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; Please reconsider perfection of spirit.&amp;nbsp; We understand that you have to keep mana regen in line for various tuning reasons, but perfection of spirit isn’t just a HoT to us, but rather the main thing we brought to raids.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Please look at ferocity of irionu.&amp;nbsp; Yes it is already on the list, but I can go weeks without getting a request for the buff anymore.&amp;nbsp; The spell should be something that people want and that multiple Beastlords are able to do thus allowing us to stack better at a raid.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Content is another issue that can impact a Beastlords utility on a raid.&amp;nbsp; In plane of time for instance when groups got split up people that are second and third best at various things got a chance to step up and use those abilities.&amp;nbsp; In a time trial being a jack of all trades was actually useful at times as you could off tank a mob, re-haste a raider that died, possibly be the main slower for that trial, etc.&amp;nbsp; When you have a raid of 54(ish) people together though and several of the best class at something then classes that are second and third best simply don’t get to use their skills.&amp;nbsp; Not every raid/zone can involve splitting up, but there are many other ways to actually &lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; DPS&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;DPS evaluation for all classes has begun and will be the focus of part #2 of the class Re-Envision process&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: COLOR: #cccccc; **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: Roman?? New ?Times 12pt;&gt;&lt;BR **SMURF**?mso-special-character: line-break?&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;You know we have issues with it and we know you are working on it.&amp;nbsp; This is just here as a little reminder in case either side forgets.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;While looking at DPS though please keep burst DPS in mind as well as sustained DPS.&amp;nbsp; At the heart of almost all beastlord issues is our division of power and burst DPS is no different.&amp;nbsp; Most classes can use a disc to drastically raise their DPS or mana dump Beastlords can do neither.&amp;nbsp; Our nukes are tied to a 30 second refresh; our disc only raises our melee DPS which is about 1/3rd of our total DPS. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Possible solutions:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; There are actually a lot of ways to go about fixing our DPS, but we have to be careful that in fixing our DPS we do not create even more problems.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Adjust some of our current AAs.&amp;nbsp; Right now Beastlords have a ton of AAs that give very small returns.&amp;nbsp; Some of our class AAs such as feral swipe and bestial alignment give extremely small boosts and have other issues.&amp;nbsp; Tweaking these AAs so they actually better fit Beastlords and give more of a return could help. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Itemization also plays a big part in how a beastlord performs.&amp;nbsp; We see Beastlords having to gain a lot of different effects and focuses and some simply aren't there or are too rare.&amp;nbsp; There are some Beastlords in Anguish still wearing time loot just for a certain focus effect.&amp;nbsp; Also when it comes to weapons please understand how a beastlord works and give us some other options.&amp;nbsp; The beastlord only 2h from MPG trials is a great example of a weapon that just doesn't fit Beastlords.&amp;nbsp; Lots of classes look at the weapon and think how great it is, but most Beastlords realize that it isn't even an upgrade for them.&amp;nbsp; Again we are not asking for "better" items, but rather better "beastlord items". &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Finally, please keep in mind just how much time/effort a beastlord has to put into the game to reach their max potential.&amp;nbsp; A beastlord needs more items/effects and more AA than almost everyone to reach their potential on DPS.&amp;nbsp; There are several passive changes that could easily be made at this point that would help with our DPS issues.&amp;nbsp; Please do not try to solve this issue by having us grind out another 200AA or raid/farm another half dozen items.&amp;nbsp; Time/effort verse reward is a huge beastlord issue already and we'd hate to see a fix to something like our DPS just make it worse.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;As an example lets say a beastlord wants to progress their DPS.&amp;nbsp; First they have to get their melee effects such as a haste item, worn atk, some accuracy, a couple good weapons, a cleave item, etc.&amp;nbsp; Then they have to get some items to help their casting side of DPS.&amp;nbsp; This means grabbing nuke focus, dot focus, mana pres, and some flowing thought.&amp;nbsp; Also we can't forget our warders so top it all off with a pet focus item. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;None of that touches on the other aspects of being a beastlord such as tanking, healing, or buffing.&amp;nbsp; Simply put for a beastlord to progress by a certain amount they need to get far more items than others do.&amp;nbsp; Like with issue 4 we aren’t asking for more than any other class we simply ask that we stop having to work twice as hard to get half as much. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Possible solutions:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; Add focus effects that touch on multiple parts of what a beastlord does.&amp;nbsp; This is similar to the AAs mentioned above, but give us some focus effects that help our nukes and our heals.&amp;nbsp; Perhaps add some focus effects that boost our nuke and dot DPS.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Also please look at focus effect itemization, especially at the high-end.&amp;nbsp; Currently Beastlords have a very hard time getting beneficial spell haste, and healing focus.&amp;nbsp; Meanwhile, there are over a dozen items that have +cold dmg or +fire dmg on them.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Finally, and most importantly when making beastlord items please remember the class they are for.&amp;nbsp; There are a lot of items that would be totally over the top on some classes that a beastlord wouldn't even wear or consider an upgrade.&amp;nbsp; The 2h blunt from MPG trials is a great example of an item lots of people think is great for Beastlords, but most Beastlords at that point in progression would lose DPS by equipping.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;6)&amp;nbsp; Feral swipe &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being evaluated&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I think the biggest problem people have with this AA is how much potential it has.&amp;nbsp; This is one of a limited number of beastlord only AAs, but it unfortunately has so many issues that many Beastlords either haven't bought it or don’t use it; even after reaching 700+ AA in some cases. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Possible solutions:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; Please increase the range on the AA first and foremost.&amp;nbsp; There are numerous times where you will be in melee with a mob and trying to avoid AE ramp, but still be out of feral swipes range.&amp;nbsp; Also please look into the damage/refresh/uhhh everything on this AA lol.&amp;nbsp; Right now this AA does less damage over time than kick does.&amp;nbsp; This is one of our few class specific AAs and it currently is quite poor in terms of AA spent to DPS gained.&amp;nbsp; We have lots of ideas for changes to this AA and again welcome any chance to discuss/test/tune this AA further.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;7)&amp;nbsp; Dots &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being evaluated&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Dots for Beastlords are another one of those things that look ok on paper, but in actual application don’t quite measure up.&amp;nbsp; There are several issues that really lower the viability of our dots.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; One of the biggest issues is the lack of a resist mod on them.&amp;nbsp; SK, rng, nec, dru, etc all have resist mods built into their dots.&amp;nbsp; Most Beastlords think that our dots don’t have a resist mod because they are balanced like shaman dots.&amp;nbsp; Shaman though have a big resist debuff that can always be used to help them better land their dots. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The second issue with dots is that focus effects and AA for dots skews the numbers more than many seem to realize.&amp;nbsp; There are over a dozen items with +cold focus damage on them, but almost no items that give Beastlords a similar boost to their poi/dis dot damage.&amp;nbsp; Also with how AAs are set up Beastlords will get SCF to help their nukes long before they get crit affliction to help their dots.&amp;nbsp; I know many Beastlords that even at around 500 AA still don’t have crit affliction.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;With all of these factors added up suddenly that extra efficiency that dots have on paper quickly dwindles away.&amp;nbsp; The recent changes to dots went a long way toward making them more useable and for many classes the changes were sufficient, but in order for many Beastlords to give a spell slot to these spells some other tweaks need to be made.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Possibly solutions:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; Add a resist mod to our dots.&amp;nbsp; They are on most of the other dots in the game and it just seems like they are MIA on the beastlord dots.&amp;nbsp; If there is a balance or tuning reason why Beastlords should have a much harder time landing a dot than an SK or a RNG or various other classes then please let us know as we simply don’t understand and again welcome the communication.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Also please look at how focus effects and AA impact dots for us.&amp;nbsp; This was partially covered by a couple of the other issues on the list, but the almost total lack of dot focus effects for Beastlords and the extremely high cost of our dot crit AA really hinder the current viability of dots in a Beastlord’s&amp;nbsp; spell lineup.&amp;nbsp; Making it so that some of our existing effects (such as the focus on the 1.5/2.0 epics) increase not only our nuke dmg, but also our dot dmg would help a lot.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;8} AE rampage &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being evaluated&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This gets brought up quite a bit, but one of the biggest issues with pet survivability on raids in AE rampage.&amp;nbsp; We understand that you don’t want having a pet to be mindless, but AE ramp is a bit much in some cases.&amp;nbsp; Having trash mobs do it in some places is a real pain(no pun intended).&amp;nbsp; Also you have to understand what our options are.&amp;nbsp; At the summit we were told that you would look into which models AE&lt;BR&gt;ramp so we’d have some warning and could hold our pets back.&amp;nbsp; That makes sense for a mage or necro who is standing back and blasting the mob, but what about the beastlord who is up there melee’n the mob?&amp;nbsp; I mean by not having our pets attacking we are already losing DPS; we can’t be expected to not melee the mob at all and just drop nukes right? &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Also understand that people are losing pets even when paying attention and doing what they can.&amp;nbsp; There are times where you have your pet set up right and they are pounding away outside AE ramp range, but they keep trying to sneak up because of how pet coding is.&amp;nbsp; I don’t know how many times (going back to earth B warlord) I’ve been doing good, doing good, poof there goes fluffy.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Things like pets putting themselves into AE ramp without us having time to fix it, pets pathing so poorly that they run into AE ramp sometimes while positioning them, pets being slow to move and respond so even when we back them off and try to make them run and hide they still buy it, etc all make it very difficult for a beastlord to keep their pets up in many cases even when they are paying attention and doing what they should. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Possible solutions:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; Make pets immune to AE rampage.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I know some will think this is a bit extreme, but with all the issues stacked against pet control and avoiding/surviving AE rampage this seems to be the easiest solution. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;If making pets immune is just too much then please put a check so that if the pet isn’t on top of the hate list then the damage they take from AE rampage is greatly lowered. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;9)&amp;nbsp; Pet buff control &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The ability to now see pet buff timers is a nice change, but pet classes are still wondering if changes will be made that allow us to manage our pet’s buffs like we do our own. There are many stacking issues, ninja buffing happens and especially with pet affinity it's very common to have a buff on your pet that you don't want for whatever reason.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Proposed solution:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; Please allow us to selectively remove buffs from our pets.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;10)&amp;nbsp; Raid utility &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being evaluated&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;I don’t like how this sounds, but I honestly don’t know another way to say it.&amp;nbsp; What exactly is the point of a beastlord past the first on a raid currently?&amp;nbsp; We don’t expect raids to need as many Beastlords as clerics, or be as desired as rogues.&amp;nbsp; One beastlord can SA a whole raid, perfection does far, far less now than paragon did then, slow clickies and better slow spells are all over, level 70 fero is a top 10 issue, etc. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Possible solutions:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; Please reconsider perfection of spirit.&amp;nbsp; We understand that you have to keep mana regen in line for various tuning reasons, but perfection of spirit isn’t just a HoT to us, but rather the main thing we brought to raids.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Please look at ferocity of irionu.&amp;nbsp; Yes it is already on the list, but I can go weeks without getting a request for the buff anymore.&amp;nbsp; The spell should be something that people want and that multiple Beastlords are able to do thus allowing us to stack better at a raid.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Content is another issue that can impact a Beastlords utility on a raid.&amp;nbsp; In plane of time for instance when groups got split up people that are second and third best at various things got a chance to step up and use those abilities.&amp;nbsp; In a time trial being a jack of all trades was actually useful at times as you could off tank a mob, re-haste a raider that died, possibly be the main slower for that trial, etc.&amp;nbsp; When you have a raid of 54(ish) people together though and several of the best class at something then classes that are second and third best simply don’t get to use their skills.&amp;nbsp; Not every raid/zone can involve splitting up, but there are many other ways to actually allow classes to use some of their skills that they don’t usually get to and thus take the focus off of max DPS.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff00ff&gt;Beastlord List Update scheduled for&amp;nbsp;09/02/05 (Posted 9/6/05) No changes at this time&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; DPS&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;DPS evaluation for all classes has begun and will be the focus of part #2 of the class Re-Envision process&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: COLOR: #cccccc; **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: Roman?? New ?Times 12pt;&gt;&lt;BR line-break? **SMURF**?mso-special-character:&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;You know we have issues with it and we know you are working on it.&amp;nbsp; This is just here as a little reminder in case either side forgets.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;While looking at DPS though please keep burst DPS in mind as well as sustained DPS.&amp;nbsp; At the heart of almost all beastlord issues is our division of power and burst DPS is no different.&amp;nbsp; Most classes can use a disc to drastically raise their DPS or mana dump Beastlords can do neither.&amp;nbsp; Our nukes are tied to a 30 second refresh; our disc only raises our melee DPS which is about 1/3rd of our total DPS. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Possible solutions:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; There are actually a lot of ways to go about fixing our DPS, but we have to be careful that in fixing our DPS we do not create even more problems.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Adjust some of our current AAs.&amp;nbsp; Right now Beastlords have a ton of AAs that give very small returns.&amp;nbsp; Some of our class AAs such as feral swipe and bestial alignment give extremely small boosts and have other issues.&amp;nbsp; Tweaking these AAs so they actually better fit Beastlords and give more of a return could help. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Itemization also plays a big part in how a beastlord performs.&amp;nbsp; We see Beastlords having to gain a lot of different effects and focuses and some simply aren't there or are too rare.&amp;nbsp; There are some Beastlords in Anguish still wearing time loot just for a certain focus effect.&amp;nbsp; Also when it comes to weapons please understand how a beastlord works and give us some other options.&amp;nbsp; The beastlord only 2h from MPG trials is a great example of a weapon that just doesn't fit Beastlords.&amp;nbsp; Lots of classes look at the weapon and think how great it is, but most Beastlords realize that it isn't even an upgrade for them.&amp;nbsp; Again we are not asking for "better" items, but rather better "beastlord items". &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Finally, please keep in mind just how much time/effort a beastlord has to put into the game to reach their max potential.&amp;nbsp; A beastlord needs more items/effects and more AA than almost everyone to reach their potential on DPS.&amp;nbsp; There are several passive changes that could easily be made at this point that would help with our DPS issues.&amp;nbsp; Please do not try to solve this issue by having us grind out another 200AA or raid/farm another half dozen items.&amp;nbsp; Time/effort verse reward is a huge beastlord issue already and we'd hate to see a fix to something like our DPS just make it worse.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2)&amp;nbsp; Ferocity of Irionu&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;SPAN red; ?Century Gothic?? mso-bidi-font-family: **SMURF**?COLOR:&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;To put it simply this is an extremely weak upgrade to one of the only class things a beastlord has.&amp;nbsp; The line went:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Level 60 -&amp;nbsp; +25 sta, +100 atk, +50 resist all for 450 mana&lt;BR&gt;Level 65 -&amp;nbsp; +40 sta, +150 atk, +65 resist all for 600 mana&lt;BR&gt;Level 70 -&amp;nbsp; +52 sta, +187 atk, +65 resist all for 750 mana&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Also going from the 60 to the 65 version we lost the Peridot requirement and the refresh went down from 3 minutes to 2 minutes. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The line clearly was designed as a mana intensive buff that granted both a defensive boost (HPs via stamina and resists) and an offensive boost (via the large amount of raw attack).&amp;nbsp; However, the level 70 version falls very short.&amp;nbsp; The extra 12 stamina does absolutely nothing in most cases as people are stamina capped.&amp;nbsp; The resists didn’t move at all.&amp;nbsp; That leaves us with an upgrade that costs 150 more mana to grant an extra 37 atk for a 6.5 minutes base duration.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Possible solutions:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; Add some effects to the buff to help make the buff useful and desired again.&amp;nbsp; An effect to increase proc rate is one of the most popular choices as this would again make the buff desirable to both tanks (more agro procs) and DPS (more damage procs).&amp;nbsp; There are lots of possibilities though and we welcome the chance to discuss and test possible adjustments to this spell.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;3)&amp;nbsp; Spell Casting Reinforcement Mastery &lt;SPAN red; ?Century Gothic?? mso-bidi-font-family: **SMURF**?COLOR:&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Beastlords were a buffing class from the day they went live.&amp;nbsp; Hmmmm ok not the day we went live, but after the first couple rounds of fixes lol.&amp;nbsp; Fact is Beastlords overall have a very large number of buffs: stats regen, haste, etc.&amp;nbsp; Even though overall our buffing has fallen off some in the past few years we still have several buffs that we cast and this AA seems like a very obvious choice for us.&amp;nbsp; Many wondered why we didn't get it back in Luclin as part of our class AAs when others who buffed way less got it.&amp;nbsp; It just makes sense for our class and is long overdue in many Beastlord’s eyes.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Possible solutions:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; Grant us access to this AA.&amp;nbsp; Most would like to see this added in our class tab, but even as part of the next expansion if we have to wait a bit longer.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;4)&amp;nbsp; AA cost/benefit &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;No development feedback at this time&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This is a large issue that pretty much goes back to our division of power.&amp;nbsp; Although this isn't just a beastlord issue it does seem to hit Beastlords the hardest of all.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;For AAs we see Beastlords paying just as much for an AA that gives us a much smaller return for the AAs than other classes that can buy it.&amp;nbsp; For example we see Beastlords paying the same number of AA for crit nukes that wizards do, then paying just as much for crit dots as necros and shaman do and finally shelling out just as many AA as monks and rogues do for melee crits. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Please understand that we aren't asking to nuke like wizards or dot like necros.&amp;nbsp; What we are saying though is don't make us pay for what we aren't getting.&amp;nbsp; This situation reminds me a lot of the old hybrid exp penalty.&amp;nbsp; If we are getting 1/3rd or less in some cases from these AAs as others then please don't make us pay as much for them.&amp;nbsp; I know some will say not every AA can be great or something to that effect.&amp;nbsp; The bottom line though is that in many cases we simply don't have another choice.&amp;nbsp; Beastlords have very few class specific AAs and many of them (i.e. feral swipe, see below) are very poor. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Possible solutions:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; Add some combination AAs that reflect our division of power.&amp;nbsp; These AAs could help our melee and our pet DPS; help our nuking and our healing, or any number of other options.&amp;nbsp; Also consider cheaper versions of some AAs to reflect our lower return on them.&amp;nbsp; Theft of life verse healing gift is a good example of this. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;5)&amp;nbsp; Gear options &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;No development feedback at this time&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This is actually a two fold issue.&amp;nbsp; First is the issue that we are very limited in some options such as healing focus, beneficial spell haste, and several other effects.&amp;nbsp; Also, similar to the issue to #4 Beastlords get a smaller return on most items than any other class and we also have more items that we have to acquire in order to achieve our full potential.&amp;nbsp; Again this isn't just a beastlord issue as some other classes can relate I'm sure, but this is the beastlord top 10.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;Also understand that people are losing pets even when paying attention and doing what they can.&amp;nbsp; There are times where you have your pet set up right and they are pounding away outside AE ramp range, but they keep trying to sneak up because of how pet coding is.&amp;nbsp; I don’t know how many times (going back to earth B warlord) I’ve been doing good, doing good, poof there goes fluffy.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Things like pets putting themselves into AE ramp without us having time to fix it, pets pathing so poorly that they run into AE ramp sometimes while positioning them, pets being slow to move and respond so even when we back them off and try to make them run and hide they still buy it, etc all make it very difficult for a beastlord to keep their pets up in many cases even when they are paying attention and doing what they should. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Possible solutions:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; Make pets immune to AE rampage.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I know some will think this is a bit extreme, but with all the issues stacked against pet control and avoiding/surviving AE rampage this seems to be the easiest solution. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;If making pets immune is just too much then please put a check so that if the pet isn’t on top of the hate list then the damage they take from AE rampage is greatly lowered. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff00ff&gt;Beastlord Top 10 list for 08/05/05 - No changes at this time&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; DPS&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;DPS evaluation for all classes has begun and will be the focus of part #2 of the class Re-Envision process&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: #cccccc; COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: ?Times New Roman?? 12pt;&gt;&lt;BR line-break? **SMURF**?mso-special-character:&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;You know we have issues with it and we know you are working on it.&amp;nbsp; This is just here as a little reminder in case either side forgets.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;While looking at DPS though please keep burst DPS in mind as well as sustained DPS.&amp;nbsp; At the heart of almost all beastlord issues is our division of power and burst DPS is no different.&amp;nbsp; Most classes can use a disc to drastically raise their DPS or mana dump Beastlords can do neither.&amp;nbsp; Our nukes are tied to a 30 second refresh; our disc only raises our melee DPS which is about 1/3rd of our total DPS. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Possible solutions:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; There are actually a lot of ways to go about fixing our DPS, but we have to be careful that in fixing our DPS we do not create even more problems.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Adjust some of our current AAs.&amp;nbsp; Right now Beastlords have a ton of AAs that give very small returns.&amp;nbsp; Some of our class AAs such as feral swipe and bestial alignment give extremely small boosts and have other issues.&amp;nbsp; Tweaking these AAs so they actually better fit Beastlords and give more of a return could help. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Itemization also plays a big part in how a beastlord performs.&amp;nbsp; We see Beastlords having to gain a lot of different effects and focuses and some simply aren't there or are too rare.&amp;nbsp; There are some Beastlords in Anguish still wearing time loot just for a certain focus effect.&amp;nbsp; Also when it comes to weapons please understand how a beastlord works and give us some other options.&amp;nbsp; The beastlord only 2h from MPG trials is a great example of a weapon that just doesn't fit Beastlords.&amp;nbsp; Lots of classes look at the weapon and think how great it is, but most Beastlords realize that it isn't even an upgrade for them.&amp;nbsp; Again we are not asking for "better" items, but rather better "beastlord items". &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Finally, please keep in mind just how much time/effort a beastlord has to put into the game to reach their max potential.&amp;nbsp; A beastlord needs more items/effects and more AA than almost everyone to reach their potential on DPS.&amp;nbsp; There are several passive changes that could easily be made at this point that would help with our DPS issues.&amp;nbsp; Please do not try to solve this issue by having us grind out another 200AA or raid/farm another half dozen items.&amp;nbsp; Time/effort verse reward is a huge beastlord issue already and we'd hate to see a fix to something like our DPS just make it worse.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2)&amp;nbsp; Ferocity of Irionu&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;SPAN red; ?Century Gothic?? **SMURF**?COLOR: mso-bidi-font-family:&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;To put it simply this is an extremely weak upgrade to one of the only class things a beastlord has.&amp;nbsp; The line went:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Level 60 -&amp;nbsp; +25 sta, +100 atk, +50 resist all for 450 mana&lt;BR&gt;Level 65 -&amp;nbsp; +40 sta, +150 atk, +65 resist all for 600 mana&lt;BR&gt;Level 70 -&amp;nbsp; +52 sta, +187 atk, +65 resist all for 750 mana&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Also going from the 60 to the 65 version we lost the Peridot requirement and the refresh went down from 3 minutes to 2 minutes. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The line clearly was designed as a mana intensive buff that granted both a defensive boost (HPs via stamina and resists) and an offensive boost (via the large amount of raw attack).&amp;nbsp; However, the level 70 version falls very short.&amp;nbsp; The extra 12 stamina does absolutely nothing in most cases as people are stamina capped.&amp;nbsp; The resists didn’t move at all.&amp;nbsp; That leaves us with an upgrade that costs 150 more mana to grant an extra 37 atk for a 6.5 minutes base duration.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Possible solutions:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; Add some effects to the buff to help make the buff useful and desired again.&amp;nbsp; An effect to increase proc rate is one of the most popular choices as this would again make the buff desirable to both tanks (more agro procs) and DPS (more damage procs).&amp;nbsp; There are lots of possibilities though and we welcome the chance to discuss and test possible adjustments to this spell.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;3)&amp;nbsp; Spell Casting Reinforcement Mastery &lt;SPAN red; ?Century Gothic?? **SMURF**?COLOR: mso-bidi-font-family:&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Beastlords were a buffing class from the day they went live.&amp;nbsp; Hmmmm ok not the day we went live, but after the first couple rounds of fixes lol.&amp;nbsp; Fact is Beastlords overall have a very large number of buffs: stats regen, haste, etc.&amp;nbsp; Even though overall our buffing has fallen off some in the past few years we still have several buffs that we cast and this AA seems like a very obvious choice for us.&amp;nbsp; Many wondered why we didn't get it back in Luclin as part of our class AAs when others who buffed way less got it.&amp;nbsp; It just makes sense for our class and is long overdue in many Beastlord’s eyes.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Possible solutions:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; Grant us access to this AA.&amp;nbsp; Most would like to see this added in our class tab, but even as part of the next expansion if we have to wait a bit longer.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;4)&amp;nbsp; AA cost/benefit &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;NEW&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This is a large issue that pretty much goes back to our division of power.&amp;nbsp; Although this isn't just a beastlord issue it does seem to hit Beastlords the hardest of all.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;For AAs we see Beastlords paying just as much for an AA that gives us a much smaller return for the AAs than other classes that can buy it.&amp;nbsp; For example we see Beastlords paying the same number of AA for crit nukes that wizards do, then paying just as much for crit dots as necros and shaman do and finally shelling out just as many AA as monks and rogues do for melee crits. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Please understand that we aren't asking to nuke like wizards or dot like necros.&amp;nbsp; What we are saying though is don't make us pay for what we aren't getting.&amp;nbsp; This situation reminds me a lot of the old hybrid exp penalty.&amp;nbsp; If we are getting 1/3rd or less in some cases from these AAs as others then please don't make us pay as much for them.&amp;nbsp; I know some will say not every AA can be great or something to that effect.&amp;nbsp; The bottom line though is that in many cases we simply don't have another choice.&amp;nbsp; Beastlords have very few class specific AAs and many of them (i.e. feral swipe, see below) are very poor. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Possible solutions:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; Add some combination AAs that reflect our division of power.&amp;nbsp; These AAs could help our melee and our pet DPS; help our nuking and our healing, or any number of other options.&amp;nbsp; Also consider cheaper versions of some AAs to reflect our lower return on them.&amp;nbsp; Theft of life verse healing gift is a good example of this. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;5)&amp;nbsp; Gear options &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;NEW&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This is actually a two fold issue.&amp;nbsp; First is the issue that we are very limited in some options such as healing focus, beneficial spell haste, and several other effects.&amp;nbsp; Also, similar to the issue to #4 Beastlords get a smaller return on most items than any other class and we also have more items that we have to acquire in order to achieve our full potential.&amp;nbsp; Again this isn't just a beastlord issue as some other classes can relate I'm sure, but this is the beastlord top 10.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;As an example lets say a beastlord wants to progress their DPS.&amp;nbsp; First they have to get their melee effects such as a haste item, worn atk, some accuracy, a couple good weapons, a cleave item, etc.&amp;nbsp; Then they have to get some items to help their casting side of DPS.&amp;nbsp; This means grabbing nuke focus, dot focus, mana pres, and some flowing thought.&amp;nbsp; Also we can't forget our warders so top it all off with a pet focus item. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;None of that touches on the other aspects of being a beastlord such as tanking, healing, or buffing.&amp;nbsp; Simply put for a beastlord to progress by a certain amount they need to get far more items than others do.&amp;nbsp; Like with issue 4 we aren’t asking for more than any other class we simply ask that we stop having to work twice as hard to get half as much. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Possible solutions:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; Add focus effects that touch on multiple parts of what a beastlord does.&amp;nbsp; This is similar to the AAs mentioned above, but give us some focus effects that help our nukes and our heals.&amp;nbsp; Perhaps add some focus effects that boost our nuke and dot DPS.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Also please look at focus effect itemization, especially at the high-end.&amp;nbsp; Currently Beastlords have a very hard time getting beneficial spell haste, and healing focus.&amp;nbsp; Meanwhile, there are over a dozen items that have +cold dmg or +fire dmg on them.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Finally, and most importantly when making beastlord items please remember the class they are for.&amp;nbsp; There are a lot of items that would be totally over the top on some classes that a beastlord wouldn't even wear or consider an upgrade.&amp;nbsp; The 2h blunt from MPG trials is a great example of an item lots of people think is great for Beastlords, but most Beastlords at that point in progression would lose DPS by equipping.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;6)&amp;nbsp; Feral swipe &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;NEW&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I think the biggest problem people have with this AA is how much potential it has.&amp;nbsp; This is one of a limited number of beastlord only AAs, but it unfortunately has so many issues that many Beastlords either haven't bought it or don’t use it; even after reaching 700+ AA in some cases. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Possible solutions:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; Please increase the range on the AA first and foremost.&amp;nbsp; There are numerous times where you will be in melee with a mob and trying to avoid AE ramp, but still be out of feral swipes range.&amp;nbsp; Also please look into the damage/refresh/uhhh everything on this AA lol.&amp;nbsp; Right now this AA does less damage over time than kick does.&amp;nbsp; This is one of our few class specific AAs and it currently is quite poor in terms of AA spent to DPS gained.&amp;nbsp; We have lots of ideas for changes to this AA and again welcome any chance to discuss/test/tune this AA further.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;7)&amp;nbsp; Dots &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;NEW&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Dots for Beastlords are another one of those things that look ok on paper, but in actual application don’t quite measure up.&amp;nbsp; There are several issues that really lower the viability of our dots.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; One of the biggest issues is the lack of a resist mod on them.&amp;nbsp; SK, rng, nec, dru, etc all have resist mods built into their dots.&amp;nbsp; Most Beastlords think that our dots don’t have a resist mod because they are balanced like shaman dots.&amp;nbsp; Shaman though have a big resist debuff that can always be used to help them better land their dots. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The second issue with dots is that focus effects and AA for dots skews the numbers more than many seem to realize.&amp;nbsp; There are over a dozen items with +cold focus damage on them, but almost no items that give Beastlords a similar boost to their poi/dis dot damage.&amp;nbsp; Also with how AAs are set up Beastlords will get SCF to help their nukes long before they get crit affliction to help their dots.&amp;nbsp; I know many Beastlords that even at around 500 AA still don’t have crit affliction.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;With all of these factors added up suddenly that extra efficiency that dots have on paper quickly dwindles away.&amp;nbsp; The recent changes to dots went a long way toward making them more useable and for many classes the changes were sufficient, but in order for many Beastlords to give a spell slot to these spells some other tweaks need to be made.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Possibly solutions:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; Add a resist mod to our dots.&amp;nbsp; They are on most of the other dots in the game and it just seems like they are MIA on the beastlord dots.&amp;nbsp; If there is a balance or tuning reason why Beastlords should have a much harder time landing a dot than an SK or a RNG or various other classes then please let us know as we simply don’t understand and again welcome the communication.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Also please look at how focus effects and AA impact dots for us.&amp;nbsp; This was partially covered by a couple of the other issues on the list, but the almost total lack of dot focus effects for Beastlords and the extremely high cost of our dot crit AA really hinder the current viability of dots in a Beastlord’s&amp;nbsp; spell lineup.&amp;nbsp; Making it so that some of our existing effects (such as the focus on the 1.5/2.0 epics) increase not only our nuke dmg, but also our dot dmg would help a lot.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Possible solutions:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; There are actually a lot of ways to go about fixing our DPS, but we have to be careful that in fixing our DPS we do not create even more problems.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Adjust some of our current AAs.&amp;nbsp; Right now Beastlords have a ton of AAs that give very small returns.&amp;nbsp; Some of our class AAs such as feral swipe and bestial alignment give extremely small boosts and have other issues.&amp;nbsp; Tweaking these AAs so they actually better fit Beastlords and give more of a return could help. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Itemization also plays a big part in how a beastlord performs.&amp;nbsp; We see Beastlords having to gain a lot of different effects and focuses and some simply aren't there or are too rare.&amp;nbsp; There are some Beastlords in Anguish still wearing time loot just for a certain focus effect.&amp;nbsp; Also when it comes to weapons please understand how a beastlord works and give us some other options.&amp;nbsp; The beastlord only 2h from MPG trials is a great example of a weapon that just doesn't fit Beastlords.&amp;nbsp; Lots of classes look at the weapon and think how great it is, but most Beastlords realize that it isn't even an upgrade for them.&amp;nbsp; Again we are not asking for "better" items, but rather better "beastlord items". &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Finally, please keep in mind just how much time/effort a beastlord has to put into the game to reach their max potential.&amp;nbsp; A beastlord needs more items/effects and more AA than almost everyone to reach their potential on DPS.&amp;nbsp; There are several passive changes that could easily be made at this point that would help with our DPS issues.&amp;nbsp; Please do not try to solve this issue by having us grind out another 200AA or raid/farm another half dozen items.&amp;nbsp; Time/effort verse reward is a huge beastlord issue already and we'd hate to see a fix to something like our DPS just make it worse.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2)&amp;nbsp; Ferocity of Irionu&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;SPAN red; ?Century Gothic?? mso-bidi-font-family: **SMURF**?COLOR:&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;To put it simply this is an extremely weak upgrade to one of the only class things a beastlord has.&amp;nbsp; The line went:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Level 60 -&amp;nbsp; +25 sta, +100 atk, +50 resist all for 450 mana&lt;BR&gt;Level 65 -&amp;nbsp; +40 sta, +150 atk, +65 resist all for 600 mana&lt;BR&gt;Level 70 -&amp;nbsp; +52 sta, +187 atk, +65 resist all for 750 mana&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Also going from the 60 to the 65 version we lost the Peridot requirement and the refresh went down from 3 minutes to 2 minutes. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The line clearly was designed as a mana intensive buff that granted both a defensive boost (HPs via stamina and resists) and an offensive boost (via the large amount of raw attack).&amp;nbsp; However, the level 70 version falls very short.&amp;nbsp; The extra 12 stamina does absolutely nothing in most cases as people are stamina capped.&amp;nbsp; The resists didn’t move at all.&amp;nbsp; That leaves us with an upgrade that costs 150 more mana to grant an extra 37 atk for a 6.5 minutes base duration.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Possible solutions:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; Add some effects to the buff to help make the buff useful and desired again.&amp;nbsp; An effect to increase proc rate is one of the most popular choices as this would again make the buff desirable to both tanks (more agro procs) and DPS (more damage procs).&amp;nbsp; There are lots of possibilities though and we welcome the chance to discuss and test possible adjustments to this spell.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;3)&amp;nbsp; Spell Casting Reinforcement Mastery &lt;SPAN red; ?Century Gothic?? mso-bidi-font-family: **SMURF**?COLOR:&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Beastlords were a buffing class from the day they went live.&amp;nbsp; Hmmmm ok not the day we went live, but after the first couple rounds of fixes lol.&amp;nbsp; Fact is Beastlords overall have a very large number of buffs: stats regen, haste, etc.&amp;nbsp; Even though overall our buffing has fallen off some in the past few years we still have several buffs that we cast and this AA seems like a very obvious choice for us.&amp;nbsp; Many wondered why we didn't get it back in Luclin as part of our class AAs when others who buffed way less got it.&amp;nbsp; It just makes sense for our class and is long overdue in many Beastlord’s eyes.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Possible solutions:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; Grant us access to this AA.&amp;nbsp; Most would like to see this added in our class tab, but even as part of the next expansion if we have to wait a bit longer.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;4)&amp;nbsp; AA cost/benefit &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;NEW&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This is a large issue that pretty much goes back to our division of power.&amp;nbsp; Although this isn't just a beastlord issue it does seem to hit Beastlords the hardest of all.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;For AAs we see Beastlords paying just as much for an AA that gives us a much smaller return for the AAs than other classes that can buy it.&amp;nbsp; For example we see Beastlords paying the same number of AA for crit nukes that wizards do, then paying just as much for crit dots as necros and shaman do and finally shelling out just as many AA as monks and rogues do for melee crits. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Please understand that we aren't asking to nuke like wizards or dot like necros.&amp;nbsp; What we are saying though is don't make us pay for what we aren't getting.&amp;nbsp; This situation reminds me a lot of the old hybrid exp penalty.&amp;nbsp; If we are getting 1/3rd or less in some cases from these AAs as others then please don't make us pay as much for them.&amp;nbsp; I know some will say not every AA can be great or something to that effect.&amp;nbsp; The bottom line though is that in many cases we simply don't have another choice.&amp;nbsp; Beastlords have very few class specific AAs and many of them (i.e. feral swipe, see below) are very poor. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Possible solutions:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; Add some combination AAs that reflect our division of power.&amp;nbsp; These AAs could help our melee and our pet DPS; help our nuking and our healing, or any number of other options.&amp;nbsp; Also consider cheaper versions of some AAs to reflect our lower return on them.&amp;nbsp; Theft of life verse healing gift is a good example of this. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;5)&amp;nbsp; Gear options &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;NEW&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This is actually a two fold issue.&amp;nbsp; First is the issue that we are very limited in some options such as healing focus, beneficial spell haste, and several other effects.&amp;nbsp; Also, similar to the issue to #4 Beastlords get a smaller return on most items than any other class and we also have more items that we have to acquire in order to achieve our full potential.&amp;nbsp; Again this isn't just a beastlord issue as some other classes can relate I'm sure, but this is the beastlord top 10.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;As an example lets say a beastlord wants to progress their DPS.&amp;nbsp; First they have to get their melee effects such as a haste item, worn atk, some accuracy, a couple good weapons, a cleave item, etc.&amp;nbsp; Then they have to get some items to help their casting side of DPS.&amp;nbsp; This means grabbing nuke focus, dot focus, mana pres, and some flowing thought.&amp;nbsp; Also we can't forget our warders so top it all off with a pet focus item. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;None of that touches on the other aspects of being a beastlord such as tanking, healing, or buffing.&amp;nbsp; Simply put for a beastlord to progress by a certain amount they need to get far more items than others do.&amp;nbsp; Like with issue 4 we aren’t asking for more than any other class we simply ask that we stop having to work twice as hard to get half as much. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Possible solutions:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; Add focus effects that touch on multiple parts of what a beastlord does.&amp;nbsp; This is similar to the AAs mentioned above, but give us some focus effects that help our nukes and our heals.&amp;nbsp; Perhaps add some focus effects that boost our nuke and dot DPS.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Also please look at focus effect itemization, especially at the high-end.&amp;nbsp; Currently Beastlords have a very hard time getting beneficial spell haste, and healing focus.&amp;nbsp; Meanwhile, there are over a dozen items that have +cold dmg or +fire dmg on them.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Finally, and most importantly when making beastlord items please remember the class they are for.&amp;nbsp; There are a lot of items that would be totally over the top on some classes that a beastlord wouldn't even wear or consider an upgrade.&amp;nbsp; The 2h blunt from MPG trials is a great example of an item lots of people think is great for Beastlords, but most Beastlords at that point in progression would lose DPS by equipping.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;6)&amp;nbsp; Feral swipe &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;NEW&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I think the biggest problem people have with this AA is how much potential it has.&amp;nbsp; This is one of a limited number of beastlord only AAs, but it unfortunately has so many issues that many Beastlords either haven't bought it or don’t use it; even after reaching 700+ AA in some cases. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Possible solutions:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; Please increase the range on the AA first and foremost.&amp;nbsp; There are numerous times where you will be in melee with a mob and trying to avoid AE ramp, but still be out of feral swipes range.&amp;nbsp; Also please look into the damage/refresh/uhhh everything on this AA lol.&amp;nbsp; Right now this AA does less damage over time than kick does.&amp;nbsp; This is one of our few class specific AAs and it currently is quite poor in terms of AA spent to DPS gained.&amp;nbsp; We have lots of ideas for changes to this AA and again welcome any chance to discuss/test/tune this AA further.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;7)&amp;nbsp; Dots &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;NEW&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Dots for Beastlords are another one of those things that look ok on paper, but in actual application don’t quite measure up.&amp;nbsp; There are several issues that really lower the viability of our dots.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; One of the biggest issues is the lack of a resist mod on them.&amp;nbsp; SK, rng, nec, dru, etc all have resist mods built into their dots.&amp;nbsp; Most Beastlords think that our dots don’t have a resist mod because they are balanced like shaman dots.&amp;nbsp; Shaman though have a big resist debuff that can always be used to help them better land their dots. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The second issue with dots is that focus effects and AA for dots skews the numbers more than many seem to realize.&amp;nbsp; There are over a dozen items with +cold focus damage on them, but almost no items that give Beastlords a similar boost to their poi/dis dot damage.&amp;nbsp; Also with how AAs are set up Beastlords will get SCF to help their nukes long before they get crit affliction to help their dots.&amp;nbsp; I know many Beastlords that even at around 500 AA still don’t have crit affliction.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;With all of these factors added up suddenly that extra efficiency that dots have on paper quickly dwindles away.&amp;nbsp; The recent changes to dots went a long way toward making them more useable and for many classes the changes were sufficient, but in order for many Beastlords to give a spell slot to these spells some other tweaks need to be made.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Possibly solutions:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; Add a resist mod to our dots.&amp;nbsp; They are on most of the other dots in the game and it just seems like they are MIA on the beastlord dots.&amp;nbsp; If there is a balance or tuning reason why Beastlords should have a much harder time landing a dot than an SK or a RNG or various other classes then please let us know as we simply don’t understand and again welcome the communication.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Also please look at how focus effects and AA impact dots for us.&amp;nbsp; This was partially covered by a couple of the other issues on the list, but the almost total lack of dot focus effects for Beastlords and the extremely high cost of our dot crit AA really hinder the current viability of dots in a Beastlord’s&amp;nbsp; spell lineup.&amp;nbsp; Making it so that some of our existing effects (such as the focus on the 1.5/2.0 epics) increase not only our nuke dmg, but also our dot dmg would help a lot.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;8} AE rampage &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;NEW&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This gets brought up quite a bit, but one of the biggest issues with pet survivability on raids in AE rampage.&amp;nbsp; We understand that you don’t want having a pet to be mindless, but AE ramp is a bit much in some cases.&amp;nbsp; Having trash mobs do it in some places is a real pain(no pun intended).&amp;nbsp; Also you have to understand what our options are.&amp;nbsp; At the summit we were told that you would look into which models AE&lt;BR&gt;ramp so we’d have some warning and could hold our pets back.&amp;nbsp; That makes sense for a mage or necro who is standing back and blasting the mob, but what about the beastlord who is up there melee’n the mob?&amp;nbsp; I mean by not having our pets attacking we are already losing DPS; we can’t be expected to not melee the mob at all and just drop nukes right? &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Also understand that people are losing pets even when paying attention and doing what they can.&amp;nbsp; There are times where you have your pet set up right and they are pounding away outside AE ramp range, but they keep trying to sneak up because of how pet coding is.&amp;nbsp; I don’t know how many times (going back to earth B warlord) I’ve been doing good, doing good, poof there goes fluffy.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Things like pets putting themselves into AE ramp without us having time to fix it, pets pathing so poorly that they run into AE ramp sometimes while positioning them, pets being slow to move and respond so even when we back them off and try to make them run and hide they still buy it, etc all make it very difficult for a beastlord to keep their pets up in many cases even when they are paying attention and doing what they should. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Possible solutions:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; Make pets immune to AE rampage.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I know some will think this is a bit extreme, but with all the issues stacked against pet control and avoiding/surviving AE rampage this seems to be the easiest solution. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;If making pets immune is just too much then please put a check so that if the pet isn’t on top of the hate list then the damage they take from AE rampage is greatly lowered. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;9)&amp;nbsp; Pet buff control &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The ability to now see pet buff timers is a nice change, but pet classes are still wondering if changes will be made that allow us to manage our pet’s buffs like we do our own. There are many stacking issues, ninja buffing happens and especially with pet affinity it's very common to have a buff on your pet that you don't want for whatever reason.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Proposed solution:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; Please allow us to selectively remove buffs from our pets.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;10)&amp;nbsp; Raid utility &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;NEW&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;I don’t like how this sounds, but I honestly don’t know another way to say it.&amp;nbsp; What exactly is the point of a beastlord past the first on a raid currently?&amp;nbsp; We don’t expect raids to need as many Beastlords as clerics, or be as desired as rogues.&amp;nbsp; One beastlord can SA a whole raid, perfection does far, far less now than paragon did then, slow clickies and better slow spells are all over, level 70 fero is a top 10 issue, etc. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Possible solutions:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; Please reconsider perfection of spirit.&amp;nbsp; We understand that you have to keep mana regen in line for various tuning reasons, but perfection of spirit isn’t just a HoT to us, but rather the main thing we brought to raids.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Please look at ferocity of irionu.&amp;nbsp; Yes it is already on the list, but I can go weeks without getting a request for the buff anymore.&amp;nbsp; The spell should be something that people want and that multiple Beastlords are able to do thus allowing us to stack better at a raid.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Content is another issue that can impact a Beastlords utility on a raid.&amp;nbsp; In plane of time for instance when groups got split up people that are second and third best at various things got a chance to step up and use those abilities.&amp;nbsp; In a time trial being a jack of all trades was actually useful at times as you could off tank a mob, re-haste a raider that died, possibly be the main slower for that trial, etc.&amp;nbsp; When you have a raid of 54(ish) people together though and several of the best class at something then classes that are second and third best simply don’t get to use their skills.&amp;nbsp; Not every raid/zone can involve splitting up, but there are many other ways to actually allow classes to use some of their skills that they don’t usually get to and thus take the focus off of max DPS.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff00ff&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Beastlord Top 10 list for 06/03/05&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1) Beastlord slowing: &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;This is being considered as part of round #1 of the class Re-Envision process.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Beastlords currently are unable to perform the role of main slower in a group to a reasonable level in an increasing number of zones. The problem with our slow isn't the % it does, but rather the resist rate on the spell and as a result of the high resist rates the streaks of resists we see. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Proposed solution:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; Add a new slow spell for beastlords in our omens spell line that has a -30 resist mod on it.. This will allow beastlords to better land slows and function as main slower for groups without having the beastlord actually debuff the mob or affect how other classes or even other beastlord spells are landing. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2) Beastlord sustained dps: &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;DPS evaluation for all classes has begun and will be the focus of part #2 of the class Re-Envision process&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN #cccccc; COLOR: FONT-FAMILY: 12pt; ?Times New Roman?? **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE:&gt;&lt;BR **SMURF**?mso-special-character: line-break?&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;This is an issue that comes about because of progression. Since beastlord dps is divided up among melee, proc, pet, and non-melee beastlords simply gain less % wise from a weapon upgrade than other classes do. If you take a class like monk or warrior and give them a weapon that is 10% better than what they are using they will see almost a 10% boost to their overall dps. However, a beastlord getting that same 10% weapon upgrade will see closer to a 3% boost to their overall dps. Weapons have had a major tendency to improve in terms of dmg/del ratio, but stay the same in terms of proc damage. This causes a lot of problems for beastlords because we rely so heavily on proc dps. An example of this would be the ED from time that only has a 16/22 ratio, but out performs a SotA that has a 23/20 ratio. Weapon ratios have gone way up, but with few exceptions proc dps has stagnated for awhile. With the GoD expansion and now omens all of those smaller % gains have added up to beastlords at the higher end doing less sustained dps than they should be. Please note that this is a problem that comes about because of progression, itemization and a few other factors. Beastlord sustained dps is nice up through about the plane of time level of the game. However, after that things start to fall off and beastlords dps simply doesn't scale up as well as it should resulting in beastlords doing less sustained dps than they should be.&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" &gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT face="Century Gothic" color=#000000 size=2&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;3) Beastlord "burst" dps:&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;DPS evaluation for all classes has begun and will be the focus of part #2 of the class Re-Envision process&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;This is a similar issue to #2 in that it comes about largely because of the beastlord division of power. Most other classes are able to "burst" by using a disc to raise their damage or mana dumping. A beastlord, however, can't mana dump because our nukes are on a 30sec refresh timer. Also our discipline only affects the melee portion of our damage. That means that while other classes can disc and almost double their damage for the duration of the disc a beastlord only doubles their melee damage. This leaves their warder damage, proc damage, and non-melee damage at the same level as before. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Proposed solution: &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;The easiest way to fix this issue is to make it so that beastlord burst disc and AAs boost more than just the melee portion of a beastlords damage. Bestial alignment is a GoD AA for beastlords that raises just our melee damage currently and has roughly double the reuse time of most burst disciplines. Lowering the reuse time on this AA to be inline with other burst disc type of skills and having it give our pet a buff would help raise our burst dps. Another thing to consider would be adding an effect to it that raises our non-melee damage well the effect is going. Again it's an issue of the division of power and beastlords need some way to "burst" the other aspects of their damage and not only their melee damage if they are expected to stay inline. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;4) Beastlord aggro issues: &lt;SPAN red; **SMURF**?COLOR: mso-bidi-font-family: Gothic?? ?Century&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I know it seems kind of funny to talk about aggro problems right after talking about how beastlords aren't doing enough dps in various cases, but that's just how it goes. The fact is beastlords generate far too much aggro for the damage they are doing. In fact, part of the reason many people think beastlord damage is higher than it really is currently is because beastlords are generating so much more aggro than they should. The main cause of this is because of how much aggro is associated with non-melee damage and the fact that beastlords have to be close and melee'n while doing their non-melee damage. Please note that beastlords are ok with getting aggro well slowing or doing other things that generate aggro, but doing 100+dps less than another class and still pulling aggro off the MT isn't right. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The largest cause of aggro problems currently for beastlords is poison dots. Many beastlords simply can't use these in a group or raid setting because the aggro they generate is so much higher for the damage done than other forms of damage. Initial aggro tests done showed the level 61 poison dot having roughly double the aggro to damage ratio of our nukes. Add in the fact that extra damage from crits/focus don't raise nuke aggro, but tests have shown extra damage from crits/focus to raise dot aggro and things just get worse. Actually things get worse even without factoring in focus/crits because the level 66 beastlord poison dot has 80% more poison counters on it than scorpion venom had. This spell should be a proc on an uber warrior weapon, not a spell for a dps class that has no reliable means of actively lowering aggro. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;5) Spell casting reinforcement mastery (SCRM)&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN red; **SMURF**?COLOR: mso-bidi-font-family: Gothic?? ?Century&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Beastlords are a buffing class and this AA seems to fit us well.&amp;nbsp; This AA would help a beastlord in group sustaining short duration buffs such as haste, regen and fero.&amp;nbsp; Also this AA would finally make it so that a beastlord could have their SD line of spells last as long as the refresh timer on MGB.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Proposed solution:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Grant beastlords access to this AA.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;6) Ferocity of Irionu - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN red; **SMURF**?COLOR: mso-bidi-font-family: Gothic?? ?Century&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;This spell simply costs too much mana for the small boost it gives over the level 65 version.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Proposed solution:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; Increase the benefit of this spell in relation to the previous version.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&#xD;

The beastlord omens spell line up is weak to begin with and this spell + stat cap mod would be a nice addition to it.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Proposed solution&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Add in a group infusion of spirit spell at level 66 that breaks the stat cap.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN red; **SMURF**?COLOR: mso-bidi-font-family: Gothic?? ?Century&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;8) Pet buff box: &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The ability to now see pet buff timers is a nice change, but pet classes are still wondering if changes will be made that allow us to manage our pet’s buffs like we do our own. There are many stacking issues, ninja buffing happens and especially with pet affinity it's very common to have a buff on your pet that you don't want for whatever reason. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Proposed solution: &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Allow us to click off or somehow selectively remove the buffs we want from our pet. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;9) &amp;nbsp;Omens utility issues&lt;/STRONG&gt;: &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;This will most likely be considered as part of the class Re-Envision process.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Beastlords have always been a DPS class with group utility in the form of slow and buffs. Slow was mentioned above, but buffs also need to be mentioned now. Especially with omens beastlord buffing could some adjustments. The main problems are lack of useful buffs, marginal increases to buffs we do use and the tediousness of maintaining buffs.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Proposed solution:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Change Focus of Alladnu to be a group hp buff. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Change Spiritual Ascendance to give +11/11 instead of the +10/10 it currently gives. The spell line for Beastlords has followed the same progression from level 44 up to now. Even by keeping the same constant +2/2 boost the % gain we see is still diminishing.&amp;nbsp; Please remember that unlike many of the other mana regen buffs that also receive upgrades to the HPs or wis/int they give SD is only a regen buff with the mana being by far the most important part of it.\ &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Increase the duration on the entire spiritual line of hp/mana regen. Currently a beastlord even with maxed SCR AA can't sustain MGB'n SD because the spell has such a low base duration. Beastlords aren't asking for 2+ hour base duration, but would like to see at least a base duration of 1:12 like our hp/atk buff line of buffs has.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;10) Beastlord pet heals: &lt;SPAN red; **SMURF**?COLOR: mso-bidi-font-family: Gothic?? ?Century&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Changes to Pet heals went live in the May 11thudpate.&amp;nbsp; Has there been sufficient improvement to Beastlord Pet healing since the May 11thupdate?&amp;nbsp; If yes lets remove this if not perhaps this issue should be reworded a bit to reflect the changes already made.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Pet healing is one of the main things the beastlord class was built on. We had hands down the best pet heals in the game. In fact, our heals for our pet were comparable to cleric heals. However, since PoP beastlord pet healing has fallen off a lot. Both our level 61 and our level 66 pet heal spells have a 9 second base casting time. That is simply too long for the heal to be useful. Beastlords are a melee class and in most cases the 9 second pet heal simply isn't practical. Many high level beastlords don't even keep a pet heal spell mem'd anymore and instead find themselves relying on the exact same tools every other pet class uses (pet mend, pet regen, PoC, etc)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff00ff&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Beastlord Top 10 list for 05/06/05&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1) Beastlord slowing: &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;This is being considered as part of round #1 of the class Re-Envision process.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Beastlords currently are unable to perform the role of main slower in a group to a reasonable level in an increasing number of zones. The problem with our slow isn't the % it does, but rather the resist rate on the spell and as a result of the high resist rates the streaks of resists we see. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Proposed solution:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; Add a new slow spell for beastlords in our omens spell line that has a -30 resist mod on it.. This will allow beastlords to better land slows and function as main slower for groups without having the beastlord actually debuff the mob or affect how other classes or even other beastlord spells are landing. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2) Beastlord sustained dps: &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;DPS evaluation for all classes has begun and will be the focus of part #2 of the class Re-Envision process&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: COLOR: #cccccc; **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: Roman?? New ?Times 12pt;&gt;&lt;BR line-break? **SMURF**?mso-special-character:&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;This is an issue that comes about because of progression. Since beastlord dps is divided up among melee, proc, pet, and non-melee beastlords simply gain less % wise from a weapon upgrade than other classes do. If you take a class like monk or warrior and give them a weapon that is 10% better than what they are using they will see almost a 10% boost to their overall dps. However, a beastlord getting that same 10% weapon upgrade will see closer to a 3% boost to their overall dps. Weapons have had a major tendency to improve in terms of dmg/del ratio, but stay the same in terms of proc damage. This causes a lot of problems for beastlords because we rely so heavily on proc dps. An example of this would be the ED from time that only has a 16/22 ratio, but out performs a SotA that has a 23/20 ratio. Weapon ratios have gone way up, but with few exceptions proc dps has stagnated for awhile. With the GoD expansion and now omens all of those smaller % gains have added up to beastlords at the higher end doing less sustained dps than they should be. Please note that this is a problem that comes about because of progression, itemization and a few other factors. Beastlord sustained dps is nice up through about the plane of time level of the game. However, after that things start to fall off and beastlords dps simply doesn't scale up as well as it should resulting in beastlords doing less sustained dps than they should be.&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" &gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT face="Century Gothic" color=#000000 size=2&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;3) Beastlord "burst" dps:&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;DPS evaluation for all classes has begun and will be the focus of part #2 of the class Re-Envision process&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;This is a similar issue to #2 in that it comes about largely because of the beastlord division of power. Most other classes are able to "burst" by using a disc to raise their damage or mana dumping. A beastlord, however, can't mana dump because our nukes are on a 30sec refresh timer. Also our discipline only affects the melee portion of our damage. That means that while other classes can disc and almost double their damage for the duration of the disc a beastlord only doubles their melee damage. This leaves their warder damage, proc damage, and non-melee damage at the same level as before. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Proposed solution: &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;The easiest way to fix this issue is to make it so that beastlord burst disc and AAs boost more than just the melee portion of a beastlords damage. Bestial alignment is a GoD AA for beastlords that raises just our melee damage currently and has roughly double the reuse time of most burst disciplines. Lowering the reuse time on this AA to be inline with other burst disc type of skills and having it give our pet a buff would help raise our burst dps. Another thing to consider would be adding an effect to it that raises our non-melee damage well the effect is going. Again it's an issue of the division of power and beastlords need some way to "burst" the other aspects of their damage and not only their melee damage if they are expected to stay inline. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;4) Beastlord aggro issues: &lt;SPAN red; ?Century Gothic?? **SMURF**?COLOR: mso-bidi-font-family:&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I know it seems kind of funny to talk about aggro problems right after talking about how beastlords aren't doing enough dps in various cases, but that's just how it goes. The fact is beastlords generate far too much aggro for the damage they are doing. In fact, part of the reason many people think beastlord damage is higher than it really is currently is because beastlords are generating so much more aggro than they should. The main cause of this is because of how much aggro is associated with non-melee damage and the fact that beastlords have to be close and melee'n while doing their non-melee damage. Please note that beastlords are ok with getting aggro well slowing or doing other things that generate aggro, but doing 100+dps less than another class and still pulling aggro off the MT isn't right. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The largest cause of aggro problems currently for beastlords is poison dots. Many beastlords simply can't use these in a group or raid setting because the aggro they generate is so much higher for the damage done than other forms of damage. Initial aggro tests done showed the level 61 poison dot having roughly double the aggro to damage ratio of our nukes. Add in the fact that extra damage from crits/focus don't raise nuke aggro, but tests have shown extra damage from crits/focus to raise dot aggro and things just get worse. Actually things get worse even without factoring in focus/crits because the level 66 beastlord poison dot has 80% more poison counters on it than scorpion venom had. This spell should be a proc on an uber warrior weapon, not a spell for a dps class that has no reliable means of actively lowering aggro. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;5) Spell casting reinforcement mastery (SCRM)&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN red; ?Century Gothic?? **SMURF**?COLOR: mso-bidi-font-family:&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Beastlords are a buffing class and this AA seems to fit us well.&amp;nbsp; This AA would help a beastlord in group sustaining short duration buffs such as haste, regen and fero.&amp;nbsp; Also this AA would finally make it so that a beastlord could have their SD line of spells last as long as the refresh timer on MGB.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Proposed solution:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Grant beastlords access to this AA.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;6) Ferocity of Irionu - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN red; ?Century Gothic?? **SMURF**?COLOR: mso-bidi-font-family:&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;This spell simply costs too much mana for the small boost it gives over the level 65 version.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Proposed solution:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; Increase the benefit of this spell in relation to the previous version.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;7) Add a group version of Infusion of spirit - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN red; ?Century Gothic?? **SMURF**?COLOR: mso-bidi-font-family:&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;This spell didn't fit well with our GoD spell lineup because of where it dropped.

There are many stacking issues, ninja buffing happens and especially with pet affinity it's very common to have a buff on your pet that you don't want for whatever reason. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Proposed solution: &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Allow us to click off or somehow selectively remove the buffs we want from our pet. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;9) &amp;nbsp;Omens utility issues&lt;/STRONG&gt;: &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;This will most likely be considered as part of the class Re-Envision process.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Beastlords have always been a DPS class with group utility in the form of slow and buffs. Slow was mentioned above, but buffs also need to be mentioned now. Especially with omens beastlord buffing could some adjustments. The main problems are lack of useful buffs, marginal increases to buffs we do use and the tediousness of maintaining buffs.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Proposed solution:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Change Focus of Alladnu to be a group hp buff. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Change Spiritual Ascendance to give +11/11 instead of the +10/10 it currently gives. The spell line for Beastlords has followed the same progression from level 44 up to now. Even by keeping the same constant +2/2 boost the % gain we see is still diminishing.&amp;nbsp; Please remember that unlike many of the other mana regen buffs that also receive upgrades to the HPs or wis/int they give SD is only a regen buff with the mana being by far the most important part of it.\ &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Increase the duration on the entire spiritual line of hp/mana regen. Currently a beastlord even with maxed SCR AA can't sustain MGB'n SD because the spell has such a low base duration. Beastlords aren't asking for 2+ hour base duration, but would like to see at least a base duration of 1:12 like our hp/atk buff line of buffs has.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;10) Beastlord pet heals: &lt;SPAN red; **SMURF**?COLOR: mso-bidi-font-family: Gothic?? ?Century&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being evaluated&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Pet healing is one of the main things the beastlord class was built on. We had hands down the best pet heals in the game. In fact, our heals for our pet were comparable to cleric heals. However, since PoP beastlord pet healing has fallen off a lot. Both our level 61 and our level 66 pet heal spells have a 9 second base casting time. That is simply too long for the heal to be useful. Beastlords are a melee class and in most cases the 9 second pet heal simply isn't practical. Many high level beastlords don't even keep a pet heal spell mem'd anymore and instead find themselves relying on the exact same tools every other pet class uses (pet mend, pet regen, PoC, etc)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff00ff&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Beastlord Top 10 list for 03/04/05&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff00ff&gt;Items 2, 4, 6,&amp;nbsp;and 10 have mulitple "Proposed solutions," please see post above for detail.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1) Beastlord slowing: &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;This will most likely be considered as part of the class Re-Envision process.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Beastlords currently are unable to perform the role of main slower in a group to a reasonable level in an increasing number of zones. The problem with our slow isn't the % it does, but rather the resist rate on the spell and as a result of the high resist rates the streaks of resists we see. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Proposed solution:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; Add a new slow spell for beastlords in our omens spell line that has a -30 resist mod on it.. This will allow beastlords to better land slows and function as main slower for groups without having the beastlord actually debuff the mob or affect how other classes or even other beastlord spells are landing. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2) Beastlord sustained dps: &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;DPS for all classes to be evaluated with the class Re-Envision process&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: Roman?? New ?Times #cccccc; 12pt;&gt;&lt;BR line-break? **SMURF**?mso-special-character:&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;This is an issue that comes about because of progression. Since beastlord dps is divided up among melee, proc, pet, and non-melee beastlords simply gain less % wise from a weapon upgrade than other classes do. If you take a class like monk or warrior and give them a weapon that is 10% better than what they are using they will see almost a 10% boost to their overall dps. However, a beastlord getting that same 10% weapon upgrade will see closer to a 3% boost to their overall dps. Weapons have had a major tendency to improve in terms of dmg/del ratio, but stay the same in terms of proc damage. This causes a lot of problems for beastlords because we rely so heavily on proc dps. An example of this would be the ED from time that only has a 16/22 ratio, but out performs a SotA that has a 23/20 ratio. Weapon ratios have gone way up, but with few exceptions proc dps has stagnated for awhile. With the GoD expansion and now omens all of those smaller % gains have added up to beastlords at the higher end doing less sustained dps than they should be. Please note that this is a problem that comes about because of progression, itemization and a few other factors. Beastlord sustained dps is nice up through about the plane of time level of the game. However, after that things start to fall off and beastlords dps simply doesn't scale up as well as it should resulting in beastlords doing less sustained dps than they should be.&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" &gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT face="Century Gothic" color=#000000 size=2&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;3) Beastlord "burst" dps:&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;DPS for all classes to be evaluated with the class Re-Envision process&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: Roman?? New ?Times #cccccc; 12pt;&gt;&lt;BR line-break? **SMURF**?mso-special-character:&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;This is a similar issue to #2 in that it comes about largely because of the beastlord division of power. Most other classes are able to "burst" by using a disc to raise their damage or mana dumping. A beastlord, however, can't mana dump because our nukes are on a 30sec refresh timer. Also our discipline only affects the melee portion of our damage. That means that while other classes can disc and almost double their damage for the duration of the disc a beastlord only doubles their melee damage. This leaves their warder damage, proc damage, and non-melee damage at the same level as before. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Proposed solution: &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;The easiest way to fix this issue is to make it so that beastlord burst disc and AAs boost more than just the melee portion of a beastlords damage. Bestial alignment is a GoD AA for beastlords that raises just our melee damage currently and has roughly double the reuse time of most burst disciplines. Lowering the reuse time on this AA to be inline with other burst disc type of skills and having it give our pet a buff would help raise our burst dps. Another thing to consider would be adding an effect to it that raises our non-melee damage well the effect is going. Again it's an issue of the division of power and beastlords need some way to "burst" the other aspects of their damage and not only their melee damage if they are expected to stay inline. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;4) Beastlord aggro issues: &lt;SPAN ?Century Gothic?? red; mso-bidi-font-family: **SMURF**?COLOR:&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I know it seems kind of funny to talk about aggro problems right after talking about how beastlords aren't doing enough dps in various cases, but that's just how it goes. The fact is beastlords generate far too much aggro for the damage they are doing. In fact, part of the reason many people think beastlord damage is higher than it really is currently is because beastlords are generating so much more aggro than they should. The main cause of this is because of how much aggro is associated with non-melee damage and the fact that beastlords have to be close and melee'n while doing their non-melee damage. Please note that beastlords are ok with getting aggro well slowing or doing other things that generate aggro, but doing 100+dps less than another class and still pulling aggro off the MT isn't right. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The largest cause of aggro problems currently for beastlords is poison dots. Many beastlords simply can't use these in a group or raid setting because the aggro they generate is so much higher for the damage done than other forms of damage. Initial aggro tests done showed the level 61 poison dot having roughly double the aggro to damage ratio of our nukes. Add in the fact that extra damage from crits/focus don't raise nuke aggro, but tests have shown extra damage from crits/focus to raise dot aggro and things just get worse. Actually things get worse even without factoring in focus/crits because the level 66 beastlord poison dot has 80% more poison counters on it than scorpion venom had. This spell should be a proc on an uber warrior weapon, not a spell for a dps class that has no reliable means of actively lowering aggro. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;5) Spell casting reinforcement mastery (SCRM)&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN ?Century Gothic?? red; mso-bidi-font-family: **SMURF**?COLOR:&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Beastlords are a buffing class and this AA seems to fit us well.&amp;nbsp; This AA would help a beastlord in group sustaining short duration buffs such as haste, regen and fero.&amp;nbsp; Also this AA would finally make it so that a beastlord could have their SD line of spells last as long as the refresh timer on MGB.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Proposed solution:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Grant beastlords access to this AA.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;6) Ferocity of Irionu - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN ?Century Gothic?? red; mso-bidi-font-family: **SMURF**?COLOR:&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;This spell simply costs too much mana for the small boost it gives over the level 65 version.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Proposed solution:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; Increase the benefit of this spell in relation to the previous version.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;7) Add a group version of Infusion of spirit - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN ?Century Gothic?? red; mso-bidi-font-family: **SMURF**?COLOR:&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;This spell didn't fit well with our GoD spell lineup because of where it dropped. With omens out now though and 66 runes being tradeable it seems like a good place to add this spell in for beastlords. The beastlord omens spell line up is weak to begin with and this spell + stat cap mod would be a nice addition to it.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Proposed solution&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Add in a group infusion of spirit spell at level 66 that breaks the stat cap.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

There are many stacking issues, ninja buffing happens and especially with pet affinity it's very common to have a buff on your pet that you don't want for whatever reason. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Proposed solution: &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Allow us to click off or somehow selectively remove the buffs we want from our pet. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;9) &amp;nbsp;Omens utility issues&lt;/STRONG&gt;: &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;This will most likely be considered as part of the class Re-Envision process.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Beastlords have always been a DPS class with group utility in the form of slow and buffs. Slow was mentioned above, but buffs also need to be mentioned now. Especially with omens beastlord buffing could some adjustments. The main problems are lack of useful buffs, marginal increases to buffs we do use and the tediousness of maintaining buffs.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Proposed solution:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Change Focus of Alladnu to be a group hp buff. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Change Spiritual Ascendance to give +11/11 instead of the +10/10 it currently gives. The spell line for Beastlords has followed the same progression from level 44 up to now. Even by keeping the same constant +2/2 boost the % gain we see is still diminishing.&amp;nbsp; Please remember that unlike many of the other mana regen buffs that also receive upgrades to the HPs or wis/int they give SD is only a regen buff with the mana being by far the most important part of it.\ &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Increase the duration on the entire spiritual line of hp/mana regen. Currently a beastlord even with maxed SCR AA can't sustain MGB'n SD because the spell has such a low base duration. Beastlords aren't asking for 2+ hour base duration, but would like to see at least a base duration of 1:12 like our hp/atk buff line of buffs has.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;10) Beastlord pet heals: &lt;SPAN red; **SMURF**?COLOR: Gothic?? ?Century mso-bidi-font-family:&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being evaluated&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Pet healing is one of the main things the beastlord class was built on. We had hands down the best pet heals in the game. In fact, our heals for our pet were comparable to cleric heals. However, since PoP beastlord pet healing has fallen off a lot. Both our level 61 and our level 66 pet heal spells have a 9 second base casting time. That is simply too long for the heal to be useful. Beastlords are a melee class and in most cases the 9 second pet heal simply isn't practical. Many high level beastlords don't even keep a pet heal spell mem'd anymore and instead find themselves relying on the exact same tools every other pet class uses (pet mend, pet regen, PoC, etc)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff00ff&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Beastlord Top 10 list for 01/07/05&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff00ff&gt;Items 2, 4, 6,&amp;nbsp;and 10 have mulitple "Proposed solutions," please see post above for detail.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1) Beastlord slowing: &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;This will most likely be considered as part of the class Re-Envision process.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Beastlords currently are unable to perform the role of main slower in a group to a reasonable level in an increasing number of zones. The problem with our slow isn't the % it does, but rather the resist rate on the spell and as a result of the high resist rates the streaks of resists we see. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Proposed solution:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; Add a new slow spell for beastlords in our omens spell line that has a -30 resist mod on it.. This will allow beastlords to better land slows and function as main slower for groups without having the beastlord actually debuff the mob or affect how other classes or even other beastlord spells are landing. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2) Beastlord sustained dps: &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;DPS for all classes to be evaluated with the class Re-Envision process&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: COLOR: #cccccc; **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: New ?Times 12pt; Roman??&gt;&lt;BR line-break? **SMURF**?mso-special-character:&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;This is an issue that comes about because of progression. Since beastlord dps is divided up among melee, proc, pet, and non-melee beastlords simply gain less % wise from a weapon upgrade than other classes do. If you take a class like monk or warrior and give them a weapon that is 10% better than what they are using they will see almost a 10% boost to their overall dps. However, a beastlord getting that same 10% weapon upgrade will see closer to a 3% boost to their overall dps. Weapons have had a major tendency to improve in terms of dmg/del ratio, but stay the same in terms of proc damage. This causes a lot of problems for beastlords because we rely so heavily on proc dps. An example of this would be the ED from time that only has a 16/22 ratio, but out performs a SotA that has a 23/20 ratio. Weapon ratios have gone way up, but with few exceptions proc dps has stagnated for awhile. With the GoD expansion and now omens all of those smaller % gains have added up to beastlords at the higher end doing less sustained dps than they should be. Please note that this is a problem that comes about because of progression, itemization and a few other factors. Beastlord sustained dps is nice up through about the plane of time level of the game. However, after that things start to fall off and beastlords dps simply doesn't scale up as well as it should resulting in beastlords doing less sustained dps than they should be.&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" &gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT face="Century Gothic" color=#000000 size=2&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;3) Beastlord "burst" dps:&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;DPS for all classes to be evaluated with the class Re-Envision process&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: COLOR: #cccccc; **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: New ?Times 12pt; Roman??&gt;&lt;BR line-break? **SMURF**?mso-special-character:&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;This is a similar issue to #2 in that it comes about largely because of the beastlord division of power. Most other classes are able to "burst" by using a disc to raise their damage or mana dumping. A beastlord, however, can't mana dump because our nukes are on a 30sec refresh timer. Also our discipline only affects the melee portion of our damage. That means that while other classes can disc and almost double their damage for the duration of the disc a beastlord only doubles their melee damage. This leaves their warder damage, proc damage, and non-melee damage at the same level as before. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Proposed solution: &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;The easiest way to fix this issue is to make it so that beastlord burst disc and AAs boost more than just the melee portion of a beastlords damage. Bestial alignment is a GoD AA for beastlords that raises just our melee damage currently and has roughly double the reuse time of most burst disciplines. Lowering the reuse time on this AA to be inline with other burst disc type of skills and having it give our pet a buff would help raise our burst dps. Another thing to consider would be adding an effect to it that raises our non-melee damage well the effect is going. Again it's an issue of the division of power and beastlords need some way to "burst" the other aspects of their damage and not only their melee damage if they are expected to stay inline. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;4) Beastlord aggro issues: &lt;SPAN red; **SMURF**?COLOR: Gothic?? ?Century mso-bidi-font-family:&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I know it seems kind of funny to talk about aggro problems right after talking about how beastlords aren't doing enough dps in various cases, but that's just how it goes. The fact is beastlords generate far too much aggro for the damage they are doing. In fact, part of the reason many people think beastlord damage is higher than it really is currently is because beastlords are generating so much more aggro than they should. The main cause of this is because of how much aggro is associated with non-melee damage and the fact that beastlords have to be close and melee'n while doing their non-melee damage. Please note that beastlords are ok with getting aggro well slowing or doing other things that generate aggro, but doing 100+dps less than another class and still pulling aggro off the MT isn't right. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The largest cause of aggro problems currently for beastlords is poison dots. Many beastlords simply can't use these in a group or raid setting because the aggro they generate is so much higher for the damage done than other forms of damage. Initial aggro tests done showed the level 61 poison dot having roughly double the aggro to damage ratio of our nukes. Add in the fact that extra damage from crits/focus don't raise nuke aggro, but tests have shown extra damage from crits/focus to raise dot aggro and things just get worse. Actually things get worse even without factoring in focus/crits because the level 66 beastlord poison dot has 80% more poison counters on it than scorpion venom had. This spell should be a proc on an uber warrior weapon, not a spell for a dps class that has no reliable means of actively lowering aggro. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;5) Spell casting reinforcement mastery (SCRM)&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;This item used to be part of #9 but it's important enough that it is being placed on the list as it's own issue.&amp;nbsp; We currently do not have any development feedback on this issue&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Beastlords are a buffing class and this AA seems to fit us well.&amp;nbsp; This AA would help a beastlord in group sustaining short duration buffs such as haste, regen and fero.&amp;nbsp; Also this AA would finally make it so that a beastlord could have their SD line of spells last as long as the refresh timer on MGB.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Proposed solution:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Grant beastlords access to this AA.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;6) Ferocity of Irionu - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;This item used to be part of #9 but it's important enough that it is being placed on the list as it's own issue.&amp;nbsp; We currently do not have any development feedback on this issue&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;This spell simply costs too much mana for the small boost it gives over the level 65 version.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Proposed solution:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; Increase the benefit of this spell in relation to the previous version.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;7) Add a group version of Infusion of spirit - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;This item used to be part of #9 but it's important enough that it is being placed on the list as it's own issue.&amp;nbsp; We currently do not have any development feedback on this issue&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;This spell didn't fit well with our GoD spell lineup because of where it dropped. With omens out now though and 66 runes being tradeable it seems like a good place to add this spell in for beastlords. The beastlord omens spell line up is weak to begin with and this spell + stat cap mod would be a nice addition to it.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Proposed solution&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Add in a group infusion of spirit spell at level 66 that breaks the stat cap.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

There are many stacking issues, ninja buffing happens and especially with pet affinity it's very common to have a buff on your pet that you don't want for whatever reason. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Proposed solution: &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Allow us to click off or somehow selectively remove the buffs we want from our pet. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;9) &amp;nbsp;Omens utility issues&lt;/STRONG&gt;: &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;This is a new item added with the update on 10/22/04 we currently do not have any development feedback on this issue.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Beastlords have always been a DPS class with group utility in the form of slow and buffs. Slow was mentioned above, but buffs also need to be mentioned now. Especially with omens beastlord buffing could some adjustments. The main problems are lack of useful buffs, marginal increases to buffs we do use and the tediousness of maintaining buffs.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Proposed solution:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Change Focus of Alladnu to be a group hp buff. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Change Spiritual Ascendance to give +11/11 instead of the +10/10 it currently gives. The spell line for Beastlords has followed the same progression from level 44 up to now. Even by keeping the same constant +2/2 boost the % gain we see is still diminishing.&amp;nbsp; Please remember that unlike many of the other mana regen buffs that also receive upgrades to the HPs or wis/int they give SD is only a regen buff with the mana being by far the most important part of it.\ &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Increase the duration on the entire spiritual line of hp/mana regen. Currently a beastlord even with maxed SCR AA can't sustain MGB'n SD because the spell has such a low base duration. Beastlords aren't asking for 2+ hour base duration, but would like to see at least a base duration of 1:12 like our hp/atk buff line of buffs has.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;10) Beastlord pet heals: &lt;SPAN ?Century Gothic?? red; mso-bidi-font-family: **SMURF**?COLOR:&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being evaluated&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Pet healing is one of the main things the beastlord class was built on. We had hands down the best pet heals in the game. In fact, our heals for our pet were comparable to cleric heals. However, since PoP beastlord pet healing has fallen off a lot. Both our level 61 and our level 66 pet heal spells have a 9 second base casting time. That is simply too long for the heal to be useful. Beastlords are a melee class and in most cases the 9 second pet heal simply isn't practical. Many high level beastlords don't even keep a pet heal spell mem'd anymore and instead find themselves relying on the exact same tools every other pet class uses (pet mend, pet regen, PoC, etc).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff00ff&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Beastlord Top 10 list for 12/03/04&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff00ff&gt;Items 2, 4, 6,&amp;nbsp;and 10 have mulitple "Proposed solutions, please see post below for details.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1) Beastlord slowing: &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;This is a new item added with the update on 10/22/04 we currently do not have any development feedback on this issue.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Beastlords currently are unable to perform the role of main slower in a group to a reasonable level in an increasing number of zones. The problem with our slow isn't the % it does, but rather the resist rate on the spell and as a result of the high resist rates the streaks of resists we see. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Proposed solution:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; Add a new slow spell for beastlords in our omens spell line that has a -30 resist mod on it.. This will allow beastlords to better land slows and function as main slower for groups without having the beastlord actually debuff the mob or affect how other classes or even other beastlord spells are landing. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2) Beastlord sustained dps: &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;DPS for all classes to be re-evaluated in the future&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN COLOR: FONT-FAMILY: #cccccc; **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: New ?Times 12pt; Roman??&gt;&lt;BR line-break? **SMURF**?mso-special-character:&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;This is an issue that comes about because of progression. Since beastlord dps is divided up among melee, proc, pet, and non-melee beastlords simply gain less % wise from a weapon upgrade than other classes do. If you take a class like monk or warrior and give them a weapon that is 10% better than what they are using they will see almost a 10% boost to their overall dps. However, a beastlord getting that same 10% weapon upgrade will see closer to a 3% boost to their overall dps. Weapons have had a major tendency to improve in terms of dmg/del ratio, but stay the same in terms of proc damage. This causes a lot of problems for beastlords because we rely so heavily on proc dps. An example of this would be the ED from time that only has a 16/22 ratio, but out performs a SotA that has a 23/20 ratio. Weapon ratios have gone way up, but with few exceptions proc dps has stagnated for awhile. With the GoD expansion and now omens all of those smaller % gains have added up to beastlords at the higher end doing less sustained dps than they should be. Please note that this is a problem that comes about because of progression, itemization and a few other factors. Beastlord sustained dps is nice up through about the plane of time level of the game. However, after that things start to fall off and beastlords dps simply doesn't scale up as well as it should resulting in beastlords doing less sustained dps than they should be.&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" &gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT face="Century Gothic" color=#000000 size=2&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;3) Beastlord "burst" dps:&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;DPS for all classes to be re-evaluated in the future&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN COLOR: FONT-FAMILY: #cccccc; **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: New ?Times 12pt; Roman??&gt;&lt;BR line-break? **SMURF**?mso-special-character:&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;This is a similar issue to #2 in that it comes about largely because of the beastlord division of power. Most other classes are able to "burst" by using a disc to raise their damage or mana dumping. A beastlord, however, can't mana dump because our nukes are on a 30sec refresh timer. Also our discipline only affects the melee portion of our damage. That means that while other classes can disc and almost double their damage for the duration of the disc a beastlord only doubles their melee damage. This leaves their warder damage, proc damage, and non-melee damage at the same level as before. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Proposed solution: &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;The easiest way to fix this issue is to make it so that beastlord burst disc and AAs boost more than just the melee portion of a beastlords damage. Bestial alignment is a GoD AA for beastlords that raises just our melee damage currently and has roughly double the reuse time of most burst disciplines. Lowering the reuse time on this AA to be inline with other burst disc type of skills and having it give our pet a buff would help raise our burst dps. Another thing to consider would be adding an effect to it that raises our non-melee damage well the effect is going. Again it's an issue of the division of power and beastlords need some way to "burst" the other aspects of their damage and not only their melee damage if they are expected to stay inline. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;4) Beastlord aggro issues: &lt;SPAN red; **SMURF**?COLOR: mso-bidi-font-family: Gothic?? ?Century&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I know it seems kind of funny to talk about aggro problems right after talking about how beastlords aren't doing enough dps in various cases, but that's just how it goes. The fact is beastlords generate far too much aggro for the damage they are doing. In fact, part of the reason many people think beastlord damage is higher than it really is currently is because beastlords are generating so much more aggro than they should. The main cause of this is because of how much aggro is associated with non-melee damage and the fact that beastlords have to be close and melee'n while doing their non-melee damage. Please note that beastlords are ok with getting aggro well slowing or doing other things that generate aggro, but doing 100+dps less than another class and still pulling aggro off the MT isn't right. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The largest cause of aggro problems currently for beastlords is poison dots. Many beastlords simply can't use these in a group or raid setting because the aggro they generate is so much higher for the damage done than other forms of damage. Initial aggro tests done showed the level 61 poison dot having roughly double the aggro to damage ratio of our nukes. Add in the fact that extra damage from crits/focus don't raise nuke aggro, but tests have shown extra damage from crits/focus to raise dot aggro and things just get worse. Actually things get worse even without factoring in focus/crits because the level 66 beastlord poison dot has 80% more poison counters on it than scorpion venom had. This spell should be a proc on an uber warrior weapon, not a spell for a dps class that has no reliable means of actively lowering aggro. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;5) Spell casting reinforcement mastery (SCRM)&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;This item used to be part of #9 but it's important enough that it is being placed on the list as it's own issue.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Beastlords are a buffing class and this AA seems to fit us well.&amp;nbsp; This AA would help a beastlord in group sustaining short duration buffs such as haste, regen and fero.&amp;nbsp; Also this AA would finally make it so that a beastlord could have their SD line of spells last as long as the refresh timer on MGB.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Proposed solution:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Grant beastlords access to this AA.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;6) Epic 1.5 effect:&amp;nbsp; &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;A fix for this issue will be making it's way to Test server soon.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;The effect is bugged and doesn't play nice with our spirit of xxx line of buffs. Whichever buff is higher on the pets buff list is the proc that will actually fire. If epic 1.5 falls below rellic/irionu/etc then the proc won't fire. If it comes first in the buff list then the pet gains the epic proc, but loses their stun proc. We were told code would be going in to fix this with the 13th patch, but those changes never even went to test. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;7) Hobble of spirits:&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Notes from Rashere - I’ll be changing Hobble to stack.&amp;nbsp; I believe that multiple procs on a pet doesn’t work currently, though, so until that is changed, whether it stacks or not won’t matter much.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Hobble of spirits is a beastlord only AA that grants our pets an extremely unreliable snare. As it stands the AA is largely a waste of points because it doesn't stack with our current spirit of xxx pet proc buffs, and the duration of the snare is random. Beastlords have been asking for adjustments to this AA almost since it went live. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Proposed solution:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; Please consider changing this AA so that it stacks with our spirit of xxx proc buffs. That way beastlords wouldn't lose a lot of damage and their stun proc just to gain the unreliable snare proc. This would make the AA much more useful, but wouldn't actually change a beastlord's ability to snare. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;SPAN red; **SMURF**?COLOR: mso-bidi-font-family: Gothic?? ?Century&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;8) Pet buff box: &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;This items was revised item added with the update on 10/22/04 we currently do not have any development feedback on this issue&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The ability to now see pet buff timers is a nice change, but pet classes are still wondering if changes will be made that allow us to manage our pet’s buffs like we do our own.

&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Proposed solution:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Add a new effect to Ferocity of Irionu. The main suggestions are adding a +proc rate mod or +double attack mod to the spell. The spell originally raised hps/dmg/resists. Stamina is easily capped, the resists didn't improve and the small boost in ATK just isn't enough. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Change Ferocity of Irionu to be a group spell. This would make it less tedious to main the buff on people in a group and also add a bit of raid functionality to the spell as well. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Change Focus of Alladnu to be a group hp buff. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Change Spiritual Ascendance to give +11/11 instead of the +10/10 it currently gives. The spell line for Beastlords has followed the same progression from level 44 up to now. Even by keeping the same constant +2/2 boost the % gain we see is still diminishing.&amp;nbsp; Please remember that unlike many of the other mana regen buffs that also receive upgrades to the HPs or wis/int they give SD is only a regen buff with the mana being by far the most important part of it.\ &#xD;

Beastlords aren't asking for 2+ hour base duration, but would like to see at least a base duration of 1:12 like our hp/atk buff line of buffs has.&amp;nbsp; &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Add a group infusion of spirit spell at level 66 that breaks the stat cap. Beastlords got group infusion of spirit as a level 65 spell with Gates, but for the expansion and where it dropped the spell simply didn't fit. Now with omens out and the stat cap going up more casual Beastlords can use such a spell and having the spell break the stat cap allows it to be useful to all Beastlords.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;10) Beastlord pet heals: &lt;SPAN red; **SMURF**?COLOR: mso-bidi-font-family: Gothic?? ?Century&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being evaluated&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Pet healing is one of the main things the beastlord class was built on. We had hands down the best pet heals in the game. In fact, our heals for our pet were comparable to cleric heals. However, since PoP beastlord pet healing has fallen off a lot.

We were told code would be going in to fix this with the 13th patch, but those changes never even went to test. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;7) Hobble of spirits: &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Notes from Rashere - I’ll be changing Hobble to stack.&amp;nbsp; I believe that multiple procs on a pet doesn’t work currently, though, so until that is changed, whether it stacks or not won’t matter much.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Hobble of spirits is a beastlord only AA that grants our pets an extremely unreliable snare. As it stands the AA is largely a waste of points because it doesn't stack with our current spirit of xxx pet proc buffs, and the duration of the snare is random. Beastlords have been asking for adjustments to this AA almost since it went live. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Proposed solution:&lt;/EM&gt; Please consider changing this AA so that it stacks with our spirit of xxx proc buffs. That way beastlords wouldn't lose a lot of damage and their stun proc just to gain the unreliable snare proc. This would make the AA much more useful, but wouldn't actually change a beastlord's ability to snare. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN ?Century Gothic?? red; **SMURF**?COLOR: mso-bidi-font-family:&gt;8) Pet buff box: &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;This items was revised item added with the update on 10/22/04 we currently do not have any development feedback on this issue&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;The ability to now see pet buff timers is a nice change, but pet classes are still wondering if changes will be made that allow us to manage our pet’s buffs like we do our own. There are many stacking issues, ninja buffing happens and especially with pet affinity it's very common to have a buff on your pet that you don't want for whatever reason. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Proposed solution: &lt;/EM&gt;Allow us to click off or somehow selectively remove the buffs we want from our pet. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;9) &amp;nbsp;Omens utility issues: &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;This is a new item added with the update on 10/22/04 we currently do not have any development feedback on this issue.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Beastlords have always been a DPS class with group utility in the form of slow and buffs. Slow was mentioned above, but buffs also need to be mentioned now. Especially with omens beastlord buffing could some adjustments. The main problems are lack of useful buffs, marginal increases to buffs we do use and the tediousness of maintaining buffs.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Proposed solution:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Add a new effect to Ferocity of Irionu. The main suggestions are adding a +proc rate mod or +double attack mod to the spell. The spell originally raised hps/dmg/resists. Stamina is easily capped, the resists didn't improve and the small boost in ATK just isn't enough. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Change Ferocity of Irionu to be a group spell. This would make it less tedious to main the buff on people in a group and also add a bit of raid functionality to the spell as well. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Change Focus of Alladnu to be a group hp buff. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Change Spiritual Ascendance to give +11/11 instead of the +10/10 it currently gives. The spell line for Beastlords has followed the same progression from level 44 up to now. Even by keeping the same constant +2/2 boost the % gain we see is still diminishing.&amp;nbsp; Please remember that unlike many of the other mana regen buffs that also receive upgrades to the HPs or wis/int they give SD is only a regen buff with the mana being by far the most important part of it.\ &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Increase the duration on the entire spiritual line of hp/mana regen. Currently a beastlord even with maxed SCR AA can't sustain MGB'n SD because the spell has such a low base duration. Beastlords aren't asking for 2+ hour base duration, but would like to see at least a base duration of 1:12 like our hp/atk buff line of buffs has.&amp;nbsp; &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Add a group infusion of spirit spell at level 66 that breaks the stat cap. Beastlords got group infusion of spirit as a level 65 spell with Gates, but for the expansion and where it dropped the spell simply didn't fit. Now with omens out and the stat cap going up more casual Beastlords can use such a spell and having the spell break the stat cap allows it to be useful to all Beastlords.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;10) Beastlord pet heals: &lt;SPAN ?Century Gothic?? red; **SMURF**?COLOR: mso-bidi-font-family:&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being evaluated&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Pet healing is one of the main things the beastlord class was built on. We had hands down the best pet heals in the game. In fact, our heals for our pet were comparable to cleric heals. However, since PoP beastlord pet healing has fallen off a lot. Both our level 61 and our level 66 pet heal spells have a 9 second base casting time. That is simply too long for the heal to be useful. Beastlords are a melee class and in most cases the 9 second pet heal simply isn't practical. Many high level beastlords don't even keep a pet heal spell mem'd anymore and instead find themselves relying on the exact same tools every other pet class uses (pet mend, pet regen, PoC, etc). &lt;/P&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Ashlanne on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;11-22-2004&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;05:37 PM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff00ff&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Beastlord Top 10 list for 11/05/04&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff00ff&gt;Items 2, 4, 6, 9 and 10 have mulitple "Propoised solutions, please see post above for details (dated 10/22/04)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1) Beastlord slowing: &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;This is a new item added with the update on 10/22/04 we currently do not have any development feedback on this issue.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Beastlords currently are unable to perform the role of main slower in a group to a reasonable level in an increasing number of zones. The problem with our slow isn't the % it does, but rather the resist rate on the spell and as a result of the high resist rates the streaks of resists we see. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Proposed solution:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; Add a new slow spell for beastlords in our omens spell line that has a -30 resist mod on it.. This will allow beastlords to better land slows and function as main slower for groups without having the beastlord actually debuff the mob or affect how other classes or even other beastlord spells are landing. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2) Beastlord sustained dps: &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;DPS for all classes to be re-evaluated in the future&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN COLOR: FONT-FAMILY: #cccccc; **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: New ?Times 12pt; Roman??&gt;&lt;BR line-break? **SMURF**?mso-special-character:&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;This is an issue that comes about because of progression. Since beastlord dps is divided up among melee, proc, pet, and non-melee beastlords simply gain less % wise from a weapon upgrade than other classes do. If you take a class like monk or warrior and give them a weapon that is 10% better than what they are using they will see almost a 10% boost to their overall dps. However, a beastlord getting that same 10% weapon upgrade will see closer to a 3% boost to their overall dps. Weapons have had a major tendency to improve in terms of dmg/del ratio, but stay the same in terms of proc damage. This causes a lot of problems for beastlords because we rely so heavily on proc dps. An example of this would be the ED from time that only has a 16/22 ratio, but out performs a SotA that has a 23/20 ratio. Weapon ratios have gone way up, but with few exceptions proc dps has stagnated for awhile. With the GoD expansion and now omens all of those smaller % gains have added up to beastlords at the higher end doing less sustained dps than they should be. Please note that this is a problem that comes about because of progression, itemization and a few other factors. Beastlord sustained dps is nice up through about the plane of time level of the game. However, after that things start to fall off and beastlords dps simply doesn't scale up as well as it should resulting in beastlords doing less sustained dps than they should be.&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" &gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT face="Century Gothic" color=#000000 size=2&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;3) Beastlord "burst" dps:&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;DPS for all classes to be re-evaluated in the future&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN COLOR: FONT-FAMILY: #cccccc; **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: New ?Times 12pt; Roman??&gt;&lt;BR line-break? **SMURF**?mso-special-character:&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;This is a similar issue to #2 in that it comes about largely because of the beastlord division of power. Most other classes are able to "burst" by using a disc to raise their damage or mana dumping. A beastlord, however, can't mana dump because our nukes are on a 30sec refresh timer. Also our discipline only affects the melee portion of our damage. That means that while other classes can disc and almost double their damage for the duration of the disc a beastlord only doubles their melee damage. This leaves their warder damage, proc damage, and non-melee damage at the same level as before. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Proposed solution: &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;The easiest way to fix this issue is to make it so that beastlord burst disc and AAs boost more than just the melee portion of a beastlords damage. Bestial alignment is a GoD AA for beastlords that raises just our melee damage currently and has roughly double the reuse time of most burst disciplines. Lowering the reuse time on this AA to be inline with other burst disc type of skills and having it give our pet a buff would help raise our burst dps. Another thing to consider would be adding an effect to it that raises our non-melee damage well the effect is going. Again it's an issue of the division of power and beastlords need some way to "burst" the other aspects of their damage and not only their melee damage if they are expected to stay inline. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;4) Beastlord aggro issues: &lt;SPAN red; ?Century Gothic?? mso-bidi-font-family: **SMURF**?COLOR:&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I know it seems kind of funny to talk about aggro problems right after talking about how beastlords aren't doing enough dps in various cases, but that's just how it goes. The fact is beastlords generate far too much aggro for the damage they are doing. In fact, part of the reason many people think beastlord damage is higher than it really is currently is because beastlords are generating so much more aggro than they should. The main cause of this is because of how much aggro is associated with non-melee damage and the fact that beastlords have to be close and melee'n while doing their non-melee damage. Please note that beastlords are ok with getting aggro well slowing or doing other things that generate aggro, but doing 100+dps less than another class and still pulling aggro off the MT isn't right. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The largest cause of aggro problems currently for beastlords is poison dots. Many beastlords simply can't use these in a group or raid setting because the aggro they generate is so much higher for the damage done than other forms of damage. Initial aggro tests done showed the level 61 poison dot having roughly double the aggro to damage ratio of our nukes. Add in the fact that extra damage from crits/focus don't raise nuke aggro, but tests have shown extra damage from crits/focus to raise dot aggro and things just get worse. Actually things get worse even without factoring in focus/crits because the level 66 beastlord poison dot has 80% more poison counters on it than scorpion venom had. This spell should be a proc on an uber warrior weapon, not a spell for a dps class that has no reliable means of actively lowering aggro. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;5) Perfection of spirit:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;There aren't any plans to change the way this AA functions.&amp;nbsp; Dev notes -&lt;/STRONG&gt; "The ability was changed because it underwent tuning.&amp;nbsp; The initial numbers were exactly that…initial and rough.&amp;nbsp; The ability was tuned to be in line with the upgraded AEs given to the other healing classes, which it is now."&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This is a 3 tiered omens AA that upgrades beastlords existing paragon of spirit AA at a cost of 5AA per rank (15 total). The major problem with this AA is the amount of mana this spell is currently giving. Paragon of spirit was an original beastlord only AA back in luclin. Paragon of spirit gives 200hps and 80mana per tick. That was back in luclin when complete heal (400 mana base) was the main heal being used in CH rots, when most wizards were using sunstrike (450mana) or maybe GSS (540 mana). Back then having paragon give back ~480 mana was a nice boost. Also back then the healing of ~1200hps was a solid amount as well. Now skip ahead through luclin, through PoP, through LDoN, through GoD and into omens and we finally see an upgrade to one of the only unique things a beastlord has. After waiting all this time and spending 15 more AAs a beastlord is now able to heal 267hps a tick and 110mana per tick. For reference in omens a cleric is likely using a 740 or 890 mana heal, and wizards are paying 800mana for a nuke. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Perfection of spirit doesn't give enough to justify the AA's spent or the time spent waiting for an upgrade to this. Paragon used to heal a sizeable number of hps, but hp pools have gone way up and so has AE damage. Beastlords understand that other classes have gained heal over times and most can even deal with the healing portion of paragon lagging behind other classes, but the mana returned is simply too low. Through most of beta this AA was giving twice the boost to mana it currently does at each rank, but then right before omens went live this was changed. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Proposed solution:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; Please raise the amount of mana this spell returns. Most beastlords were ok with paying 5AA per rank for the +20 mana per tick boost the AA originally gave. Changing this AA back to how it was throughout most of beta would make the AA far more worthwhile. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;6) Epic 1.5 effect: &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;New item&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;The effect is bugged and doesn't play nice with our spirit of xxx line of buffs. Whichever buff is higher on the pets buff list is the proc that will actually fire. If epic 1.5 falls below rellic/irionu/etc then the proc won't fire. If it comes first in the buff list then the pet gains the epic proc, but loses their stun proc. We were told code would be going in to fix this with the 13th patch, but those changes never even went to test. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;7) Hobble of spirits:&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;SPAN red; ?Century Gothic?? mso-bidi-font-family: **SMURF**?COLOR:&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being evaluated&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Hobble of spirits is a beastlord only AA that grants our pets an extremely unreliable snare.

That way beastlords wouldn't lose a lot of damage and their stun proc just to gain the unreliable snare proc.

That was back in luclin when complete heal (400 mana base) was the main heal being used in CH rots, when most wizards were using sunstrike (450mana) or maybe GSS (540 mana). Back then having paragon give back ~480 mana was a nice boost. Also back then the healing of ~1200hps was a solid amount as well. Now skip ahead through luclin, through PoP, through LDoN, through GoD and into omens and we finally see an upgrade to one of the only unique things a beastlord has. After waiting all this time and spending 15 more AAs a beastlord is now able to heal 267hps a tick and 110mana per tick. For reference in omens a cleric is likely using a 740 or 890 mana heal, and wizards are paying 800mana for a nuke. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Perfection of spirit doesn't give enough to justify the AA's spent or the time spent waiting for an upgrade to this. Paragon used to heal a sizeable number of hps, but hp pools have gone way up and so has AE damage. Beastlords understand that other classes have gained heal over times and most can even deal with the healing portion of paragon lagging behind other classes, but the mana returned is simply too low. Through most of beta this AA was giving twice the boost to mana it currently does at each rank, but then right before omens went live this was changed. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Proposed solution:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; Please raise the amount of mana this spell returns. Most beastlords were ok with paying 5AA per rank for the +20 mana per tick boost the AA originally gave. Changing this AA back to how it was throughout most of beta would make the AA far more worthwhile. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;6) Epic 1.5 effect: &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;New item&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;The effect is bugged and doesn't play nice with our spirit of xxx line of buffs. Whichever buff is higher on the pets buff list is the proc that will actually fire. If epic 1.5 falls below rellic/irionu/etc then the proc won't fire. If it comes first in the buff list then the pet gains the epic proc, but loses their stun proc. We were told code would be going in to fix this with the 13th patch, but those changes never even went to test. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;7) Hobble of spirits:&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;SPAN ?Century Gothic?? red; mso-bidi-font-family: **SMURF**?COLOR:&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being evaluated&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Hobble of spirits is a beastlord only AA that grants our pets an extremely unreliable snare. As it stands the AA is largely a waste of points because it doesn't stack with our current spirit of xxx pet proc buffs, and the duration of the snare is random. Beastlords have been asking for adjustments to this AA almost since it went live. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Proposed solution:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; Please consider changing this AA so that it stacks with our spirit of xxx proc buffs. That way beastlords wouldn't lose a lot of damage and their stun proc just to gain the unreliable snare proc. This would make the AA much more useful, but wouldn't actually change a beastlord's ability to snare. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;SPAN ?Century Gothic?? red; mso-bidi-font-family: **SMURF**?COLOR:&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;8) Pet buff box: &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Revised item, re-sent&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The ability to now see pet buff timers is a nice change, but pet classes are still wondering if changes will be made that allow us to manage our pet’s buffs like we do our own. There are many stacking issues, ninja buffing happens and especially with pet affinity it's very common to have a buff on your pet that you don't want for whatever reason. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Proposed solution: &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Allow us to click off or somehow selectively remove the buffs we want from our pet. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;9) Omens utility issues: &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;New item&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;Beastlords have always been a dps class with group utility in the form of slow and buffs. Slow was mentioned above, but buffs also need to be mentioned now. Especially with omens beastlord buffing could use some adjustments. The main problems are lack of useful buffs, marginal increases to buffs we do use and the tediousness of maintaining buffs. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;10) Beastlord pet heals: &lt;SPAN ?Century Gothic?? red; mso-bidi-font-family: **SMURF**?COLOR:&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being evaluated&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Pet healing is one of the main things the beastlord class was built on. We had hands down the best pet heals in the game. In fact, our heals for our pet were comparable to cleric heals. However, since PoP beastlord pet healing has fallen off a lot. Both our level 61 and our level 66 pet heal spells have a 9 second base casting time. That is simply too long for the heal to be useful. Beastlords are a melee class and in most cases the 9 second pet heal simply isn't practical. Many high level beastlords don't even keep a pet heal spell mem'd anymore and instead find themselves relying on the exact same tools every other pet class uses (pet mend, pet regen, PoC, etc). &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Beastlord List additions - Darn that 20,000 character limit...&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Proposed solution #2:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; There are actually a lot of changes that could be made to help address this issue, and I think the answer lies in doing a combination of a few different things. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL type=disc&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI class=MsoNormal 0in auto? mso-margin-top-alt: mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; 0pt; COLOR: mso-list: level1 tab-stops: list **SMURF**?MARGIN: lfo2; l1 #818181; .5in;&gt;&lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: 11pt; Arial?&gt;Fix beastlord AAs so that they grant a larger % gain to one part of our damage so that overall the % gain to our dps is on par. PoP gave us BF which was an awesome beastlord only AA that gave a large boost to one aspect of our damage (melee), but the overall boost was less. GoD on the other hand gave us pet AAs that were very overpriced and did relatively little. Feral swipe is another GoD beastlord only AA that does very little damage for its cost. In omens beastlord offensive AAs are limited to a generic nuke crit upgrade AA, a generic melee crit upgrade, and a generic dot crit upgrade. Beastlords are paying 2, 3, and even 4X the AA as some other classes and still not getting the same overall % gain. &lt;xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" &gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL type=disc 0in? **SMURF**?MARGIN-TOP:&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI class=MsoNormal 0in 0pt; l0 COLOR: mso-list: level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in? **SMURF**?MARGIN: #818181;&gt;&lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: 11pt; Arial?&gt;Fix pet focus effects so that they give a better boost to the pets. This idea has a lot of merit because it allows for the boosts to be given where they are really needed. Currently in omens old pet focus effects scale down in usefulness and no new pet focus effects have been found yet. Adding new pet focus effects and upgrading how they improve the pet would allow our pets to see a similar boost as our melee does through upgrades and help beastlords get closer to the overall % gain they should be seeing as they progress. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI class=MsoNormal 0in 0pt; l0 COLOR: mso-list: level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in? **SMURF**?MARGIN: #818181;&gt;&lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: 11pt; Arial?&gt;Add more beastlord only items that help deal with our division of power. The point here isn't to make "better" items, but rather items that fit beastlords better. Adding more items that improve multiple parts of beastlords damage would help address this problem and again allow the upgrades to be put where they should be. Beastlords need more items and weapons that are geared around how the class functions so that we are able to progress as we should.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal 0in 0pt; l0 COLOR: mso-list: level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in? **SMURF**?MARGIN: #818181;&gt;&lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: 11pt; Arial?&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Proposed solution #4: &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Again there are a few options here and I think the solution lies in a doing a combination of things. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL type=disc 0in? **SMURF**?MARGIN-TOP:&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI class=MsoNormal 0in 0pt; l0 mso-list: level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in? **SMURF**?MARGIN:&gt;Look at poison dots, please. The aggro they generate for the damage they do is simply broken. The fact that repeated tests done using various classes have shown the increased aggro from focus/crit on dots is wrong. The number of poison counters should either be adjusted or some -hate needs to be added to these spells like tigir's insects was given because atm almost no beastlord can actually cast these spells as a means of doing damage. &#xD;
&lt;LI class=MsoNormal 0in 0pt; l0 mso-list: level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in? **SMURF**?MARGIN:&gt;Consider giving beastlords some AA/Spell/Skill that lowers aggro in a reliable way. Roar of thunder with omens was a nice start, but the amount of aggro it actually lowers isn't that great and it's only available once every 15 minutes. &#xD;
&lt;LI class=MsoNormal 0in 0pt; l0 mso-list: level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in? **SMURF**?MARGIN:&gt;Look into weapon procs. Beastlords rely more heavily on weapon procs than almost every other class in the game. Weapons like SPF and ED are major dps weapons for beastlords. The major difference between these two weapons though is that the SPF proc adds almost no aggro well the proc of ED has resulted in more beastlord deaths than I can count. Again the idea isn't to give beastlords better weapons or procs, but to give beastlords weapons and procs that better fit them.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal 0in 0pt; l0 mso-list: level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in? **SMURF**?MARGIN:&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Proposed solution #6: &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL type=disc 0in? **SMURF**?MARGIN-TOP:&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI class=MsoNormal 0in 0pt; l0 mso-list: level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in? **SMURF**?MARGIN:&gt;&lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: 11pt; Arial? #818181;&gt;Fix the stacking so that a pet can have both its spirit of xxx proc buff and the epic 1.5 click. Many beastlords simply don't use the epic effect atm because they might lose their stun proc when they don't want to or might fail to gain the epic click when they want to, etc. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI class=MsoNormal 0in 0pt; l0 mso-list: level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in? **SMURF**?MARGIN:&gt;&lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: 11pt; Arial? #818181;&gt;If possible please change the click so that it doesn't target our pet. We have AAs like mend companion and hobble of spirits that don't change our current target to the pet. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI class=MsoNormal 0in 0pt; l0 mso-list: level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in? **SMURF**?MARGIN:&gt;&lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: 11pt; Arial? #818181;&gt;Consider changing who gets the various benefits of the epic click. At the level of play where most beastlords will get this item their warders simply don't tank very much. Many beastlords would much prefer seeing this effect divided up like bond of the wild is so that the pet receives the offensive portion of the buff, well the beastlord gets the defensive portion. This change makes the effect fit better with how beastlords actually play at this level of the game. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI class=MsoNormal 0in 0pt; l0 mso-list: level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in? **SMURF**?MARGIN:&gt;&lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: 11pt; Arial? #818181;&gt;Finally the epic 2.0 effect appears to be mis-marked currently. The effect is currently listed as having a -10 resist mod on it, but since the epic 1.5 has a -50 resist check it seems likely that the effect is meant to have a -100 check on it.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: 11pt; Arial? #818181;&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal 0in 0pt; l0 mso-list: level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in? **SMURF**?MARGIN:&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Proposed solution #9: &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL type=disc 0in? **SMURF**?MARGIN-TOP:&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI class=MsoNormal 0in 0pt; l0 mso-list: level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in? **SMURF**?MARGIN:&gt;&lt;SPAN **SMURF**?COLOR: #818181?&gt;Add a new effect to Ferocity of Irionu. The main suggestions are adding a +proc rate mod or +double attack mod to the spell. The spell originally raised hps/dmg/resists. Stamina is easily capped, the resists didn't improve and the small boost in atk just isn't enough to justify such a huge boost in mana cost. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI class=MsoNormal 0in 0pt; l0 mso-list: level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in? **SMURF**?MARGIN:&gt;&lt;SPAN **SMURF**?COLOR: #818181?&gt;Change Ferocity of Irionu to be a group spell. This would make it less tedious to maintain the buff on people in a group and also add a bit of raid functionality to the spell as well. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI class=MsoNormal 0in 0pt; l0 mso-list: level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in? **SMURF**?MARGIN:&gt;&lt;SPAN **SMURF**?COLOR: #818181?&gt;Change Focus of Alladnu to be a group hp buff. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI class=MsoNormal 0in 0pt; l0 mso-list: level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in? **SMURF**?MARGIN:&gt;&lt;SPAN **SMURF**?COLOR: #818181?&gt;Change Spiritual Ascendance to give +11/11 instead of the +10/10 it currently gives. The spell line for beastlords has followed the same progression from level 44 up to now. Even by keeping the same constant +2/2 boost the % gain we see is still diminishing. Please remember that unlike many of the other mana regen buffs that also receive upgrades to the hps or wis/int they give SD is only a regen buff with the mana being by far the most important part of it. The other popular change suggested is to add some +end regen to the spell. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI class=MsoNormal 0in 0pt; l0 mso-list: level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in? **SMURF**?MARGIN:&gt;&lt;SPAN **SMURF**?COLOR: #818181?&gt;Increase the duration on the entire spiritual line of hp/mana regen. Currently a beastlord even with maxed SCR AA can't sustain MGB'n SD because the spell has such a low base duration. Beastlords aren't asking for 2+ hour base duration, but would like to see at least a base duration of &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" &gt;&lt;st1:time Minute="12" Hour="13"&gt;&lt;SPAN **SMURF**?COLOR: #818181?&gt;1:12&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/st1:time&gt;&lt;SPAN **SMURF**?COLOR: #818181?&gt; like our hp/atk buff line of buffs has. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI class=MsoNormal 0in 0pt; l0 mso-list: level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in? **SMURF**?MARGIN:&gt;&lt;SPAN **SMURF**?COLOR: #818181?&gt;Consider giving beastlords access to the SCRM AA. This AA is from way back in luclin and fits the beastlord class well. Our buffs are already balanced around the benefit they give and giving us access to this AA would greatly help lower the tediousness of buffing a group. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI class=MsoNormal 0in 0pt; l0 mso-list: level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in? **SMURF**?MARGIN:&gt;&lt;SPAN **SMURF**?COLOR: #818181?&gt;Add a group infusion of spirit spell at level 66 that breaks the stat cap. Beastlords got group infusion of spirit as a level 65 spell with GoD, but for the expansion and where it dropped the spell simply didn't fit. Now with omens out and the stat cap going up more casual beastlords can use such a spell and having the spell break the stat cap allows it to be useful to all beastlords&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Proposed solution #10: &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL type=disc 0in? **SMURF**?MARGIN-TOP:&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI class=MsoNormal 0in 0pt; l0 mso-list: level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in? **SMURF**?MARGIN:&gt;&lt;SPAN **SMURF**?COLOR: #818181?&gt;Lower the casting time. This is main problem with these heals as they stand now. Most beastlords are ok with the mana to hp ratio at which they are healing, but the casting time makes the spell unusable in many situations. Currently many beastlords are unable to keep their pet alive against various AEs and encounters and keeping a pet alive on such fights should be something a beastlord excels at. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI class=MsoNormal 0in 0pt; l0 mso-list: level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in? **SMURF**?MARGIN:&gt;&lt;SPAN **SMURF**?COLOR: #818181?&gt;Consider adding more curing to the beastlord pet heals. Again beastlords were always the best pet healers by far, consider adding both poison and curse cure effects to the higher end pet heals. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI class=MsoNormal 0in 0pt; l0 mso-list: level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in? **SMURF**?MARGIN:&gt;&lt;SPAN **SMURF**?COLOR: #818181?&gt;Beastlords have always been a dps class with utility in the forms of buffs and slow. With the last couple of expansions we've seen decreases in our relative dps, our ability to slow and the desirability of our buffs. This list was compiled based upon what beastlords have done in the past and what we as a class believe we are supposed to be doing currently. I have tried very hard to express these issues in terms of the beastlord class and the definition they have appeared to have in the past. There are a few spots that other classes are mentioned, but it isn't in a class envy way, but rather to illustrate a game mechanic or progression issue. Most beastlords don't want to be shaman or monks or any other class. We seek to be what we were; a solid dps class that can function as main slower and offer assorted buffs when other classes aren't present. We have very few class defining abilities and we'd like to see those remain powerful, but reasonable. If anything we have asked for is either unclear or doesn't fit with what the current working definition of the beastlord class is then please let us know that so we can go from there.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P class=MsoNormal 0in 0pt; none? mso-layout-grid-align: **SMURF**?MARGIN:&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;3) Agro issues –&lt;/STRONG&gt; This is a big beastlord issue that a lot of people don't quite understand. Beastlords are ok with getting agro from high agro spells such as slow and incapacitate. Beastlords are also ok with getting agro when they are simply putting out more damage or doing things that obviously should draw the mob's attention. The problems with beastlord agro become clear in raid situations and many grouping situations though. What you'll have is the beastlord operating in a total DPS role. By that I mean the&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal 0in 0pt; none? mso-layout-grid-align: **SMURF**?MARGIN:&gt;&lt;SPAN ?Century Gothic?? **SMURF**?mso-bidi-font-family:&gt;Beastlord isn't on slow duty or de-buffing the mob, but rather is just contributing damage via melee/nukes/dots. In this situation a beastlord is generating far more agro for the damage they are doing than most if not all other classes.&lt;SPAN yes? **SMURF**?mso-spacerun:&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;Again the problem isn't when a beastlord is doing 200dps and they get agro over someone doing 150dps.&lt;SPAN yes? **SMURF**?mso-spacerun:&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;Rather you have situations where a beastlord is actually doing less damage than many other classes; they haven't de-buffed the mob or done anything else to generate agro, yet they are the ones that pull agro off the MT or get summoned and killed first on tank changes. Some would say that the beastlord simply has to do less damage or watch their agro with that tank.&lt;SPAN yes? **SMURF**?mso-spacerun:&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;However, this same tank that can't keep agro off the beastlord doing X damage is successfully keeping agro off the wizard doing X+100 damage or the rogue doing X + 50 damage, etc.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P class=MsoNormal 0in 0pt; none? mso-layout-grid-align: **SMURF**?MARGIN:&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;4) Modify pet heals –&lt;/STRONG&gt; Currently healing of Sorsha (62 beastlord heal) is all but unusable by Beastlords. The spell sees some use as the beastlord levels up, but as the beastlord progresses the spell gets used less and less. The main problem with the heal is its 9 second casting time. In almost any situation a beastlord would find themselves wanting to cast a heal on their pet 9 seconds is just far too long to wait. As such many Beastlords simply don't memorize the spell at all.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal 0in 0pt; none? mso-layout-grid-align: **SMURF**?MARGIN:&gt;&lt;SPAN ?Century Gothic?? red; mso-bidi-font-family: **SMURF**?COLOR:&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being evaluated&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P class=MsoNormal 0in 0pt; none? mso-layout-grid-align: **SMURF**?MARGIN:&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;5) Feral swipe – &lt;/STRONG&gt;Feral swipe is an AA that has a lot of potential, but unfortunately suffers from several issues. The first problem with feral swipe is that its current DPS boost is very minor. In even the best of situations the skill does notably less damage than kick does. The skill being on a one minute refresh is very streaky and it's not unheard of to go 15 minutes without having a single feral swipe land.&lt;SPAN yes? **SMURF**?mso-spacerun:&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;Also the AA still has a small range issue. The range was increased once, but it wasn't quite enough. There are still monsters that you can melee, but you can't land your feral swipes on. Spacing is extremely important in these cases and as such feral swipe becomes completely useless. Finally, feral swipe takes up yet another hot key space that is getting to be in almost as much demand as spell gem spaces. When a beastlord has pet controls, kick, prot spirit, possibly spells and macros along with other AAs in their hot key bank they simply don't have room to add another button. I know several Beastlords that haven't purchased this skill simply because they have no room to actually activate it well playing.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

This would be a non-issue if #2 from above were done, currently though being locked into hobble and losing your other proc for its duration is a problem. Also hobble doesn't stack with relic.

What most of us were wondering is if it's possible to have the pet buffs display their remaining time and to also be able to click off pet buffs like we do our own buffs.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

If it fades during a fight the beastlord will be in a much harder situation. Spell slots are already pretty limited as it is and not everyone has half a dozen egg timers around to keep up with pet haste, fero, haste, regen, etc.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; &#xD;
&lt;LI class=MsoNormal **SMURF**?MARGIN: 0in 0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: l1 lfo2; none; mso-list: level1 tab-stops: list .5in?&gt;&lt;SPAN ?Century Gothic?? **SMURF**?mso-bidi-font-family:&gt;Hobble of spirit and other buffs that once they land on the pet you can't get rid of them or overwrite. When a paladin lands Brells on the pet there is no way to get vigor on the pet for the extra attack outside of waiting for Brells to fade or dispelling the pet down to the buff you are after. &lt;SPAN **SMURF**?mso-spacerun: yes?&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;With all the ninja buffing going on, pet affinity and now pets zoning it's simply become more and more common to find a buff on your pet that you simply don't want or that is blocking something you do want from taking hold.&lt;SPAN **SMURF**?mso-spacerun: yes?&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**?MARGIN: 0in 0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none?&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;3) Agro issues –&lt;/STRONG&gt; This is a big beastlord issue that a lot of people don't quite understand. Beastlords are ok with getting agro from high agro spells such as slow and incapacitate. Beastlords are also ok with getting agro when they are simply putting out more damage or doing things that obviously should draw the mob's attention. The problems with beastlord agro become clear in raid situations and many grouping situations though. What you'll have is the beastlord operating in a total DPS role. By that I mean the&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**?MARGIN: 0in 0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none?&gt;&lt;SPAN ?Century Gothic?? **SMURF**?mso-bidi-font-family:&gt;Beastlord isn't on slow duty or de-buffing the mob, but rather is just contributing damage via melee/nukes/dots. In this situation a beastlord is generating far more agro for the damage they are doing than most if not all other classes.&lt;SPAN **SMURF**?mso-spacerun: yes?&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;Again the problem isn't when a beastlord is doing 200dps and they get agro over someone doing 150dps.&lt;SPAN **SMURF**?mso-spacerun: yes?&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;Rather you have situations where a beastlord is actually doing less damage than many other classes; they haven't de-buffed the mob or done anything else to generate agro, yet they are the ones that pull agro off the MT or get summoned and killed first on tank changes. Some would say that the beastlord simply has to do less damage or watch their agro with that tank.&lt;SPAN **SMURF**?mso-spacerun: yes?&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;However, this same tank that can't keep agro off the beastlord doing X damage is successfully keeping agro off the wizard doing X+100 damage or the rogue doing X + 50 damage, etc.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**?MARGIN: 0in 0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none?&gt;&lt;SPAN red; **SMURF**?COLOR: mso-bidi-font-family: ?Century Gothic??&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**?MARGIN: 0in 0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none?&gt;&lt;SPAN ?Century Gothic?? **SMURF**?mso-bidi-font-family:&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**?MARGIN: 0in 0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none?&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;4) Modify pet heals –&lt;/STRONG&gt; Currently healing of Sorsha (62 beastlord heal) is all but unusable by Beastlords. The spell sees some use as the beastlord levels up, but as the beastlord progresses the spell gets used less and less. The main problem with the heal is its 9 second casting time. In almost any situation a beastlord would find themselves wanting to cast a heal on their pet 9 seconds is just far too long to wait. As such many Beastlords simply don't memorize the spell at all.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**?MARGIN: 0in 0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none?&gt;&lt;SPAN red; **SMURF**?COLOR: mso-bidi-font-family: ?Century Gothic??&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being evaluated&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**?MARGIN: 0in 0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none?&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;5) Feral swipe – &lt;/STRONG&gt;Feral swipe is an AA that has a lot of potential, but unfortunately suffers from several issues. The first problem with feral swipe is that its current DPS boost is very minor. In even the best of situations the skill does notably less damage than kick does. The skill being on a one minute refresh is very streaky and it's not unheard of to go 15 minutes without having a single feral swipe land.&lt;SPAN **SMURF**?mso-spacerun: yes?&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;Also the AA still has a small range issue. The range was increased once, but it wasn't quite enough. There are still monsters that you can melee, but you can't land your feral swipes on. Spacing is extremely important in these cases and as such feral swipe becomes completely useless. Finally, feral swipe takes up yet another hot key space that is getting to be in almost as much demand as spell gem spaces. When a beastlord has pet controls, kick, prot spirit, possibly spells and macros along with other AAs in their hot key bank they simply don't have room to add another button. I know several Beastlords that haven't purchased this skill simply because they have no room to actually activate it well playing.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**?MARGIN: 0in 0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none?&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;6) Pet run speed –&lt;/STRONG&gt; This is mainly an issue indoors, but what happens is you have Beastlords with various ranks of AA run speed and swift journey that leads to the pet simply getting left behind sometimes or taking awhile to catch up.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;SPAN red; **SMURF**?COLOR: mso-bidi-font-family: ?Century Gothic??&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&#xD;

This would be a non-issue if #2 from above were done, currently though being locked into hobble and losing your other proc for its duration is a problem. Also hobble doesn't stack with relic. The beastlord gives up a lot of damage and a stun to get a semi-reliable snare currently.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
