<P>Sorry for not getting to this sooner.</P>
<P>I've gone ahead and checked the spawning of Mujaki and there was indeed a bug with it that in some situations the Shade wouldn't spawn. I've gone ahead and corrected the issue and it should be Live as of tomorrow.</P>
<P>If you have any additional issues after tomorrow (on 12/13 or later), please feel free to PM me with your character name and server, and any reproduction steps that would help in tracking down the bug.</P>
<P>Thanks,<BR></P>

<DIV>Hooray!&nbsp; Thanks for taking care of this, it was pretty annoying and there wasn't a good workaround (other than trying the event repeatedly hoping to get lucky on one of the attempts).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Much appreciated.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>And if this was in response to my petition (submitted in the early hours of 12/11/06, and included links to this thread and others as support), that's amazingly fast response time too.</DIV>
