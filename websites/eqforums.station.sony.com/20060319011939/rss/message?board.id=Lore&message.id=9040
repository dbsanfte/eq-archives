&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Actually the players were played for saps.&amp;nbsp; Venril didnt accept his invitation&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;'How eagerly Venril offered to carry the curse of Shadowspine into the nest. "&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;He told of how he returned to his old home, the city of Sebilis, and into Trakanon's lair after he sent Firiona in search of her missing staff.&amp;nbsp; Using the Lifeguide's crystal, Venril searched Trakanon's memories and discovered what no one had known -- details of the Nest -- where dragons were born and raised.&amp;nbsp; He also learned that the cycle of birth for the next dragons -- a time known as the Brood Dawn -- was rapidly approaching.&amp;nbsp; He chose to prevent the young wyrms from taking their first breaths.&amp;nbsp; That would be his revenge.&lt;BR&gt;Using the knowledge he obtained from Trakanon, Venril began to shape a collage of deception that would have others acting on his behalf so his plan may come to fruition without interference.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; He built and bought distractions, having the Solusek Mining Company dig their way to the Nest with the promise of riches.&amp;nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;Lanys' arrival in the Dreadlands to mount an attack against the city of Firiona Vie was a fortunate coincidence for Venril.&amp;nbsp; When Lanys entered Karnor's Castle and demanded soldiers for her army, Venril recognized that allowing his fallen comrades to fight with her in any battle would be a worthy distraction as he anxiously awaited the opening of the Nest. While a war raged outside his castle walls, Venril became reacquainted with all of necromantic arts he learned from his Shissar masters so many moons ago, to create a most unusual curse -- a very specific curse that would become the coup de grace of his vengeance.&lt;BR&gt;Venril continued to move around his chamber, focusing on the details, while Lanys looked on, fascinated.&amp;nbsp; He said that when he sorted through Trakanon's memories, he learned of two storm dragons that protected the eggs in the Nest that would bring the next generation of Veeshan's children to Norrath.&amp;nbsp; Their names were Yar`Lir and Vishimtar.&amp;nbsp; He learned of their magical bond and the ward they formed together that served to protect the Nest from disruption and corruption.&amp;nbsp; Venril used this knowledge as the stage for his final act.&lt;BR&gt;Venril had managed to create a curse that, once unleashed, would disturb the Brood Dawn and corrupt any egg or creature it touched.&amp;nbsp; He could not release the powerful curse himself as he would undoubtedly be caught in it.&amp;nbsp; It did not take long for Venril to see a perfect solution that would bring horror to the dragons.&lt;BR&gt;While there were no guarantees, he knew that as soon as the Nest was discovered, mortal Norrathians of all races would pour into the area like a grim infestation, just like they did on his own continent of Kunark.&amp;nbsp; He knew they would kill anything and everything should it stand in their way.&lt;BR&gt;Venril reworked the curse and created a unique ward for it.&amp;nbsp; If all went as planned, the curse would unfurl when the strong magical bond between Yar`Lir and Vishimtar was broken and the Nest was left with no magical protection. All this would require is the death of either dragon.&amp;nbsp; Venril felt this was a safe gamble.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Tornicade_IV on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;01-14-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;08:59 PM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;(Lore from the news front page)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;A New God&lt;p&gt;With the final devastating blow, Mayong Mistmoore's blood spread across the enchanted floor of Dreadspire Keep.  In his last breath, the lord of the vampires issued a promise, &amp;quot;My age begins.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally shedding the remains of his mortal coil, centuries of research and experiments culminated into achieving his life's goal -- to ascend and walk among the gods.  With the last act of unleashing Mistmoore's soul, Norrath's mortals released an evil demi-god among the unsuspecting planes of the pantheon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And as Mistmoore's soul completed its metamorphosis, the Demi-Plane of Blood became fully realized as a crimson realm of death and darkness.  Even Ro's shimmer, the great Norrath sun, was lessened as the vampire's plane bled through the pantheon, reeling and reforming in ethereal space. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norrathians thirst for glory and power -- a reality the vampire relied on -- brought Mayong to godhood.  For hundreds of years, Mayong laid the groundwork for his own ascension, carefully and purposefully.  He enshrouded himself in mystery and myth, creating an insatiable curiosity in historians and fame hunters the world over.  Few had ever seen the vampire, but everyone believed in him.  That was crucial to Mayong's designs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most know that the gods of the pantheon are strengthened and empowered by those who revere and believe in them. So, as Norrathians accepted Mayong's invitation to Dreadspire Keep, they unwittingly acknowledged his power and became disciples who fueled the enchantments that surrounded him and his abode. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the last drop of the great vampire's blood trickled to the floor, the enchantments took on life at his death. The awe of his power and pride in his defeat shown by those who revealed him provided the last ingredient to lift his dark soul into godhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, Mayong's cackles resonate through the immortal realm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wise and learned of Norrath share chagrin at this turn of tides in the pantheon, for they suspect what most certainly do not -- Mayong's ascension is but a stepping stone for a larger, more devious plan than any could imagine. Beyond the mortal lands, in a realm of pure magic, a goddess has foreseen a world plunged into darkness and chaos. Worse still, she feels her own kin's suffering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while Norrath's lauded heroes -- Firiona Vie and Lanys T'Vyl -- and their armies remain unfound, the world and its future lie in the hands of those who set the vampire free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>ok so i'm trying to keep up here...basically, ever since Mayong's dissapearence from Norrath...he has basically orchastrated every world changing event! from Venril Sathir's curse from trying to destroy the nest to the recent wars to Mata Muram's legion and Caliav being a traitor?  is it possible that maybe there is a being ...maybe a god from the realm of discord (seeing as it most likely has gods im guessing) that is controling all of this even mayong without him knowing? could this be the ultimate and final stretch of the EQ storyline?(ofcourse theyd find a way to continue it but maybe a new story?)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS: why is Mayong weak to bards my guild isnt in DoD yet so i dunno the details&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PSS can someone explain the shadowspine?&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I would love to know the official explanation on bards too. My assumption has always been that since many bards worship Veeshan and that she gives her devoted followers protection, she is in effect channeling her power through them against Mayong.  Of course, as I said this has always been my assumption, but it is not based on anything I've seen lorewise. Perhaps one of our learned fellow players will clue us in. :smileywink:</description>

&lt;P&gt;Sadly there's not a lot in game that points at it other than Calliav's change when he gets back - the first time I read the story I knew that it had something to do with Calliav gone traitor, but for whatever reason, that story isn't here today, so maybe it's changed, I donno, but as it was, the amulet was a way for Mata to communicate with his agent.&amp;nbsp; Calliav was meant to be a traitor.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Cazic has already played his hand in gaining his children's attention and Venril was played for the fool. My guesstimation is we'll start seeing people pull together. Lucan and the knights working together to protect the one thing they hold dear. Venril Sathir displacing the current Emporer and strengthening his holdings on Kunark against the drachnids. Being the undisputed ruler of Kunark is hard to unseat with infinite resources of the undead and an infinite supply of new potential undead with the iksars and or sarnaks consistently breeding new generations. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Overall Mayong is sitting pretty, he has a drachnid hive in Antonica and Kunark, along with a loyal following of vampires in Faydwar. Also, the Thex is infected with discord whether as an aside or all part of Mayong's plan for dominence. Control the king, control the Tier'dal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>You can say that Mayong's ascension is but a stepping stone for Mayong's own larger, more devious plan, sure. But you can also say that Mayong's ascension is but a stepping stone for an entirely different entity's larger, more devious plan.</description>

&lt;P&gt;Mata Muram &lt;EM&gt;did&lt;/EM&gt; have an interest in their success.&amp;nbsp; That was a part of the original story line which may very well have changed over the ages, but the way it worked was that amulet was going to be the walkie-talkie between Calliav and Mata Muram.&amp;nbsp; Mata Muram set it there, specifically, so Calliav would go out and pick it up, so that he could communicate with his agent who infiltrated the Wayfarers' Brotherhood.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;He knew what was going on on Taelosia through his agent - Calliav.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;obviously the one who sees the future is Druzzel(how do you spell it?) Ro.  the force that mayong is a pawn of would not be her, why would she want to cause something that could cause her and her kin great harm.  i dont think it can be veeshan, although veeshan could show up since mayong hates dragons and has already damaged them greatly.   maybe it will be revealed where she went(i read somewhere that quellious was keeping her in check or something to that extent) and why mayong hates dragons.  i hate to say this but the force that could of made mayong a pawn could be kerafym, specially with the return to old lore.  kerafym hates dragons loyal to veeshan, so it would be in his best interest for mayong to corrupt the nest, which is greatly loyal to veeshan.  and also with discord coming to norrath it could make it easier for the lesser races to wipe each other of the face of norrath making it easier for kerafym to remaked the world in his own image. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;id rather the force be cazic thule making the way for his children the iksar to finally regain their birthright and become the strongest empire in history&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;remember how vahlar said morden and the dark elf had help when they went through GoD to get that amulet, but they did not know it?   i wonder if this being, who is so powerful that mayong mistmoore is a pawn in his game, is responsible for helping morden and the dark elf?  and its sort of ironic after mayong mistmoore has manipulated people into making him a god, he is being manipulated.   i hope mayong doesnt lose all his power, that would be anti climatic.  i also hope they tie in the last couple of expansions into this storyline, like maybe mata muram's hatred at someone and why discord needs slaves, or who they sell the slaves to?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;p.s. did they ever reveal who watched morden take the amulet?&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Mayong is a deity now meaning he has asscended and will not be destroyed any more than we have destroyed any other god. It took alot of combined power&amp;nbsp; to just imprison Zebuxx.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The demi plane of shadow appeared in Darkhollow.&amp;nbsp; this would strongly indicate Luclin Involvement. Just looking at the hatred inspired by mayong by players it would notbe surprising to see Innoruuk contiue to grow in power and while Mayong may not have any friends among the pantheon it would not be too far fetched that a few are involved in this&amp;nbsp; pla..... as the screenshots says there are many&amp;nbsp; who wish to rule norrath. The ascension of an evil god may be just want&amp;nbsp; a few of the demi gods and greater deities needed to tips the scales and throw off the balance.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;As far as Mayongs power jsut take a look at Mithaniel Marr a fairly young god himself. The question we should be asking is who controls the plane of discord.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Eze i wouldnt be advise making alot of assumption regarding Mata Muram. He may have set the bait for the amulet for Calliav to use... which as right now as far as we know he hasnt(unless he used it to port away Lanys And Fironia).&amp;nbsp; The tier dal and the&amp;nbsp; Wood elves and High elves would be considered an ancient alliance in a fashion. considering they are all beleived to have nce been the Eddar elves&amp;nbsp; with the presence of Mistmoore and Luclin (she was never part of the pact nor were Solusek Ro and a few others) its hard telling what direction the storyline is gonna take. We do know that Mata Repotrt to hhigher authorities and that he has a past association with someone&amp;nbsp; from Norrath&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;The Storyline Entry Refers to Druzzil Ros prophecy of the world going black&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; which apparently we are heading to see a manifestation. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;lets take a look at the potential&amp;nbsp; Pantheon wars brewing&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Mayong Mistmoore&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Luclin&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Bertoxxulus&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Terris Thule&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Innoruuk &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Solusek Ro&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Cazuc Thule&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;thats my short list&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aye, it's Shadowspine. Shadowspine being the sentient book of dark magicks that corrupted both Venril Sathir and Emperor Draygun. Because of this, I'm iffy about the idea of Venril mounting an organized opposition against Mayong, since Mayong has apparently been able to control what Venril succumbed to... Shadowspine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wonder if Mayong already being dead had something to do with his success... it sounds like he was already a vampire when he got a hold of Shadowspine, whereas Venril and Draygun were alive when they tried to use it. They and their followers were condemned to undeath, Shadowspine's way of granting them their precious immortailty. What could it do to Mayong?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm interested in seeing how this plays out... I'm no rabid lorehound, but I like the lore in the game in general.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think we are missing some connections here. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, Mayong &amp;quot;was&amp;quot; a demi-god already before he was killed.  Hence the demi-plane of blood and shadowspine (i think they are the same place though but i might be wrong...pulling a lot of thread readding in on this one.)  Thus, since Mayong &amp;quot;was&amp;quot; a demi-plane he was part god and part mortal(well as mortal a vampire can be in norrath...basically he still had a physical body not allowing him to ascend).  When we killed him this allowed him to the status of god and thus he is god Mayong not demi-god mayong.(Correct me if I am wrong here b/c that is what i am readding from the lore posts.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second and third, Mayong was working for someone.  That is to say he was being inspired by another source and that source is going to eclipse what we have seen thus far.  The only thing that might clash is how much power from this person will be sparred against Mayong.  Remember, Mayong is a god now, and doesn't really need his backer's support.  This would make his power's boundaries limittless b/c Mayong is not bound by the compact made at the Pantheon and, due to his ascension, does not need the powers of the &amp;quot;anonymous&amp;quot; diety to do their bidding anymore b/c he has his own ethereal powers now.  What I see is two things here.  1.  The true deceiver that has spun this web will come out.  This person will probably be Sol Ro, but I am not surprised to see him accompanied with others that helped him, such as Terris-Thule, Luclin, Saryrn.  2.  Mayong striking out on his own and out right defiying the Pantheon Compact and those dietie(s) that helped him to ascend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, for every counter there is another that will come to bring balance.  Nothing exists without balance and that is proven even with the gods.  Mayong is prone be hurt by bards a lot.  In fact that has been noted in the lore if i'm not mistaken.  Ayonae Ro would seem to be the perfect diety to be Mayong's match here.  So It would not surprise me if Ayonae would be brought in game to to handle Mayong himslef.  Then there is the battle with the Pantheon itself and those that defied the Pact.  You can turn your head to it, but the war of the Pantheon is coming.  Those that helped Mayong, and I say those b/c I believe it has to be more than one to pull this off completely even if it were minor parts with one main orcestrator, will face the other gods and either be punished, stopped, and/or destroyed.  Too many gods are at risk now due to this.  One especially is Brell Serelis.  He is the original diety of the Underfoot, and now that Mayong has ascended, you can bet he will not like that much.  Not too mention, Tunare and Veeshan whom both have their own creations at risks b/c of these events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is how I see what's about to come.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;According to the official lore at&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/news_article.vm?id=50054"&gt;http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/news_article.vm?id=50054&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Mayong has just ascended to demi-god status with his &amp;quot;death&amp;quot; in the Demi-Plane of Blood. His death as a &amp;quot;mortal&amp;quot; being (being killable and not a godlike being) triggered both his elevation to demi-god status and the completion of the Demi-Plane of Blood as a full realm.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;He was just the Lord of Vampires, dwelling in a near-plane held together by his will and dark magicks. Now, he's a demi-god in a fully realized realm.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;He only seemed like a demi-god before because of all the mystery and legendry he created for himself amongst the various Norrathians and sects of undead. He actually, intentionally and thoroughly, created his own myth to make sure Norrath believed in him as something greater before he actually was. Thus, when he DID become greater, his base of followers and believers was already in place to empower him.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>One thing that I find interesting (and applaud SOE for pulling off mostly without a hitch) is how they've adjusted the story line through the years (or at least the DoN and DoDH and PoR stories) to link them all together and to tie in the human nature element that we the players bring in (namely our 'habit' of storming new lands and wrecking our own brand of havoc within them. :) ).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That was what Venril (and Mayong by way of Venril) was counting on, and it is what Mayong was counting on as well. I suspect people can draw similar linkages throuhg GoD and OoW too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think the next big 'challenge' to do will be to come up with a story line that accounts for that behaviour, yet also doesn't leave the player base seeming like they were played for saps (as Mayong played us for his ascension). (And I don't mean any ill about that term; I just couldn't think of a better way to phrase it.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In any case, even though I'm no where near beating Mayong or Vish or Muram, I just wanted to say thanks for how things have been so interconnected lately, and how well everything has been fitting together even with the random player factor. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now lets go kick Mayong's butt again. :)</description>
