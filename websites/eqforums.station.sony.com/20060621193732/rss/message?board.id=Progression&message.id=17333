      <description>I have been playing EQ for a number of years but have never came close to the highend due to there being nobody to level with.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, the one game I have a lot of highend characters in is WoW (Which is obviously a joke to hit 60 on). The problem there is how elitist guilds are (like for a warrior to raid they need raid gear which they need to raid to get *boggle*)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is the majority of EQ endgame as snobbish or are there some accomplished guilds who aren't the best but are sensible?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I feel it would be a waste to level a character up only to be excluded from content because I'm generally not the kind of person who makes some massive name for himself, other than as a good play (Which somehow seems less important than stupid forum antics, to some)&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Based on your comment the short answer is&amp;nbsp;no... you would never be accepted into an endgame EQ guild. Or the high-end of any other game for that matter.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;If you do not know how to level in the game you're playing.. why do you expect to reach and be able to play the high-end?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;To the thread starter.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I played on karana for a number of years as an officer in one of the top guilds and I only ever witnessed one happening where a guild was just a douche to players.&amp;nbsp; A guild named Night Eternal invited anyone who wanted to join them that was level 65 in the PoP era, and after they had way more then a full roster they started kicking people out that they didn't want, too many of class X, or person Y doesn't play enough.&amp;nbsp; My guild on the other hand Empire, we never really turned down an applicant, some would app for a while, but as long as they kept showing up we'd just invite them, we had trouble telling people who wanted to join us no.&amp;nbsp; The other guilds were pretty friendly too.&amp;nbsp; Guilds are not composed of a bunch of uhh, meanie heads, they are a bunch of people who enjoy each other's company, and who have common interests with in the game.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Attitude is a huge thing. Personally, I won't vote for ((though not saying i'll necessarily vote against)) an applicat that can't take a joke from another member and dish it back out in return. Self-deprecating banter is a HUGE part of our alliance. I'm constantly made fun of for not lasting 20 seconds into the fight and being more mana efficient to rez, our one mage is made fun of for being a furry, our head paladin gets every sexual innuendo and insinuation in the book, our monk crew spends ample time spooning, and we have a druid we frequently have to yell at to stop molesting animals, children, or baby animals.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;If you can't take those kinds of slams, and return fire post haste, I have trouble dealing with that. Not saying there aren't quiet people that I like, but anyone coming in who gets angry at jokes and can't take them I want turned away, and that's why we work. We're a tight knit crew that don't take ourselves overly serious.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Best geared players in the world aren't accomplishing squat if they can't mesh well.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;There are also a few smaller family type guilds that form alliances to do raids, and see a significant part of the content. Ussaly requirments for those guilds are more lax than large raiding guilds, and might be more closly fit to your play style described.</description>

      <description>Personally, I look for playtime, skill, and attitude more than anything.&amp;nbsp; I expect an applicant to have high AA's, anything less than 500 and I pretty much won't take them seriously.&amp;nbsp; I expect gear to be at least up to the level of the best gear you can get w/o a guild.&amp;nbsp; I do not expect any player, even a tank, to have gear that can only be obtained on raids, but if there are big upgrades from single group missions, or even worse, from the bazaar, then I would tell the applicant to take his gear more seriously before apping.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Every guild is different, and different people in the same guild have differing opinions.&amp;nbsp; I don't like to require apps to do anything that they need a guild to do, and I would never encourage an app to use another guild for gear before joining us.&amp;nbsp; I do expect them to do as well as is reasonably possible given their guild status.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;The opportunity the Combine offers is being able to start with a guild from the begining. The risk is chosing a guild that will fail and unfortunately&amp;nbsp;many will,&amp;nbsp;so chose wisely. Take your time, visit some websites, meet some people and then cross your fingers and join one. :)</description>

&lt;P&gt;The most common type of guild in EQ is the casual/family raid guild.&amp;nbsp; Laidback approach, but still raids, some do it once a week, some 4 times a week,&amp;nbsp; but not mandatory in most cases.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The players here are so much more laid back than in WoW.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Most guilds in WoW made you use third party programs (teamspeak/ventrilo) or they wouldnt even let you in, very few guilds in EQ would require nonsense like that.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;WoW guilds aren't really that "elite" they're just 90% immature middle and highschool kids and some even younger than that. On an "aged" Warcraft server basically one with a rather large population and&amp;nbsp;close to a dozen guilds on either side already on C'thun or going into Naxxramus then yes they will be very picky about the gear and talent spec of the people they recruit. but it's also PATHETICALLY easy to get leveled, geared, and do everything fromt he start on a new server when Blizzard adds the **SMURF** things every other week.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Content&amp;nbsp;in WoW is blasted through at such a ridiculous clip starting out on a new server is&amp;nbsp;nothing. On the server I played on my guild steamrolled everything until we quit. Within a month of the server going live we were in Molten Core, 2 weeks later Ragnaros was down, at a server age of 2 months and 2 weeks us and another guild were already halfway through Blackwing Lair.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;On Everquest though content isn't finished as fast and a LOT of the people who still play it are and always were vastly more elitist than most other online games of the type. They see it as a part time job and a&amp;nbsp;way of living out some mafia fantasy because they can bottleneck and dominate other players and a servers community all together&amp;nbsp;. "Win" at all costs is the mantra here.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;"Elite" isn't asking your recruits to have 150 fire resist for an Onyxia raid.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;"Elite" is requiring you to have 750 AA's, play atleast 10 hours a day, raid 6 days a week, and have multiple sponsors in the guild&amp;nbsp;just have an application considered. Then on top of that you might actually have to have an invitation to submit an app in the first place.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>Please do not turn this into "WoW is sissy" because obviously it is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I never called the guilds "elite" either, elitist is the word. I speak about guilds with a little or no BWL done, and no matter what I'll never see that content. I play a on an extremely small server and we're down to I think 4 MC guilds alliance side. It's sad.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;As stated before it really depends on the guild. I started playing just before Kunark came out and most guilds then were more relaxed on the requirements, whereas now with all of the expansions out&amp;nbsp;there is more content, thus more requirements. It is a scaling requirement as more content is released which is why I am looking forward to this server, it&amp;nbsp;will be possible to stay on par with what the server's content is.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;My guild completely gear up any of our apps basically regardless of the gear level.&amp;nbsp; All we ask is that you have your single group keys, make an effort to advance yourself, and have decent AA's.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Heck, I only have 350something.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;Once a rogue gets like 200 AA's, he needs nothing else.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I hate grinding as is, why should I grind for something that won't give me any benefits?&lt;/P&gt;</description>
