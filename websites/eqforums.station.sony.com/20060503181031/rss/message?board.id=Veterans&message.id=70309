    <description>&lt;DIV&gt;There is some good discussion here.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;As someone mentioned, we saw a lot of feedback requesting that&amp;nbsp;faction-related content make a return to EverQuest.&amp;nbsp; Dark Reign and Norrath's Keepers are what we felt was a fair summary of what the community was asking for on a smaller scale.&amp;nbsp; We wanted to make it flexible and balanced and not restrictive.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So, we've been watching feedback and generally&amp;nbsp;reviewing how well this faction direction is&amp;nbsp;liked and then we'll see if it's a style of play that works for the community.&amp;nbsp; So, the more feedback we get around the "fun" and "interest" with factioning on this smaller scale, the better we can see where to take it.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Thanks!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>i'm confused as to the point of don factions.  both seem to sell identical items with different names from the vendors. even the missions i've done so far are the same.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;half my guild mates dont understand the system and refuse to help the other faction thinking it will give them the wrong kind. and i'm tired of taking 15 minutes to explain it to them only to have them still refuse because they still want the positive faction from their own side.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;most of my guild understands the differences at this point. but they all want not only the crystals but the + faction also. and they hold out for missions from their own side. which means unless we have alot of people on it's hard to make groups.  they think any mission where they only get crystals is a waste of time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;it would at least be worth it if the rewards were different. but both sides will be able to buy the same items and both sides will get the same aa's. maybe raid encounters will be different on each side, but both sides will be able to loot the items that drop. so aside from one guild member to get the raids no one else needs to do that side.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;so what exactly is the point of causing so much confusion and grief amungst guilds?  all i see is confusion and frustration.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I think the saddest part of this thread is the number of people claiming that they or their supposed guild 'friends'&amp;nbsp;wouldn't do a quest to help someone else if it didn't directly help them at the same time.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I do good quests with my good friends, and then trade off the crystals... I then ask if any of them want to do an evil quest... and sometimes, they say yes!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;On another note... to those evils complaining about faction work... what were you expecting?&amp;nbsp; Even in LDoN, you noticed that they were practically working out of necessity only... not because they 'really' liked each other.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;For my friends, they will do any mission as will I.&amp;nbsp; Perhaps I was not clear enough if you are referencing my statement.&amp;nbsp; In pick up groups, quite often I have been faced with peeps stating my faction or I take my marbles and go home.&amp;nbsp; That is definitely sad, however it has and does occur.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>This DoN faction system is ridiculous. If you want to add a faction angle, fine...let us all start at the same point and choose our direction from there. Instead, you elected to punish me for a decision I made in 1999 when I made an evil character. Sure, I can waste 40+ hours "repairing" a faction issue that I never actually damaged. As if, at this point in the game, I have not spent enough time working around the faction issues I was aware of when my Ogre Shaman was born, you charitable folks saddle me with another steaming pile to work through. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dragons of Norrath, as well as any future expansions should have NO FACTION STEMMING FROM CLASS/RACE/DIETY CHOICES MADE YEARS AGO. It is that simple.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Our guild is supposed to be evil, but so far not everyone has cared to pay mind to that.&amp;nbsp; It hasn't made a big different yet, because individuals are forming raids for both sides and both sides attend.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I am an Iksar and my husband is a High Elf. I am doing evil; he is doing good.&amp;nbsp; This is actually the first time in four years we have even been in the same guild.&amp;nbsp; For us, it works.&amp;nbsp; hehehe. The content is similar, and even if it wasn't you can get benefits from doing either, so I don't mind it.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;As far as my requests for faction... well, this expansion falls short of what I was asking for.&amp;nbsp; I wanted something meaningful, that involved roleplaying.&amp;nbsp; The only thing I see meaningful about this faction is how the NPC's talk to me.&amp;nbsp; They do sound evil, but why do the same things my High Elven husband is doing for an opposite side?&amp;nbsp; Just seems a little pointless.&amp;nbsp; Velious was nice&amp;nbsp; cause it wasn't really good and evil, but Giants vs Dragons.&amp;nbsp; The faction had a point.&amp;nbsp; It seemed to make sense.&amp;nbsp; This expansion seems to be manufactured faction that means nothing.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I love also the texts for the SK epics.&amp;nbsp; The first one, slaughtering people along the way. being deceived, that is evil!&amp;nbsp; The second one, a cursed sword demanding things of me!!&amp;nbsp; fun!!!!&amp;nbsp; This is not a pointless quest!&amp;nbsp; very cool&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Go kill a rock thing in a zone with your good and evil buddies for evil.. no wait, for good, oo , oh ok I got a teardrop thing, this must be the "good" one doesn't have any content, meaning.&amp;nbsp; It's just fluffy to me.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Raid the home city of the giants because it is too close to the dragons..&amp;nbsp; now that I know as I am doing it, it is for the dragons!&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Being chased out of Felwithe by a high elf, I know that I am playing an evil race iksar!&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Going to a peaceful looking temple like Stillmoon to kill creatures inside...? that must be evil right?&amp;nbsp; wrong, it could be good?&amp;nbsp; I guess we are united in our cause?&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Maybe if someone could come up with a story easy to find to explain this I would be happier.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I have had it with this DoN faction, first let me tell you about me. I am a 68 Gnome Necro, that is in a guild that is working on good side. I have done at least 40solo missions and probably about 15 or 20 grp ones. Last time I went to check my faction I was still Dubious to the Norrath's Keepers. The last few days I have logged on at Wayfarers Camp, and spent 30minutes+ hailing the vah shir lady for Gathering Silk mission, only to be given the Population Control over, and over and over again. It has gotten to the point where I only log him on now if guild wants to do something cause I am so sick of working it for no noticeable gain in faction.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I have read on some boards that people are saying it takes 30 missions or so to get to indiff, in my case that is definately not true. I have even tried killing the Dark Reign Guards and still no change in good side faction.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Your numbers are a little over inflated.&amp;nbsp; At around the 30 mission/task (in any combo) point you will have gotten to the Apprehensive faction point.&amp;nbsp; So either you are doing some of the DR faction solo tasks and not reailizing it (which would nulify your NK faction) or you have actually done about 10-15 solo tasks which does seem like 40 (I know I did them too - Iksar here).&amp;nbsp; Also, if you haven't turned in your crystal for the missions you are not getting any faction hits for that mission.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;How many Radiant Crystals do you have at the moment and have you spent any yet?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;As for the Spider silk one, I ran into the same issue you have.&amp;nbsp; After doing one task so many times the, the quest giver will stop giving you that quest.&amp;nbsp; My suggestion is to go to the alternate NK task giver and get the Dragon Blood task, then go do Grinding the Drakes or the Drake Egg mission and combine the two.&amp;nbsp; (Yes the bloods from the instanced version will work for your task).&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Good Luck&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;"Why would faction_2 want to reward you for doing missions for faction_1? "&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Ever heard of spys;)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;On the faction vs. no faction, I'm undecided on this.&amp;nbsp; If the population of the servers were high enough and there was a relatively even split between good and evil toons in the game, then the factions add a bit to the RP, although I am not a true RPer.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So far, my experience has been that it creates a grouping problem at a time when groups are more difficult to get anyway.&amp;nbsp; All it takes is one key member of the group to attempt to force a certain faction mission and a group that took an hour to finally get together gets to start over:(&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;My personal opinion is that this makes the faction more of a problem that it is a good thing for the game.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>I too have issues with this whole DoN faction, it's not at all comparable to the CoV vs. Giant faction of the Velious era. At least if you were working on CoV faction during Velious, you could kill giants and wolves to your hearts content in GD or Kael to improve it. There are also quests you can do (giant toes and Helms) in SS that will boost your faction with CoV too. Nearly all of these faction improving tasks can be done solo or with a duo.&lt;br&gt;As far as I know, as a level 67 warrior, there are no tasks you can do solo to work on your DoN factions. &lt;br&gt;When I created my wood elf warrior 5 years ago, it made sense to choose Rallos Zek as my deity. It never affected anything I was doing until DoN came out.&lt;br&gt;Imagine my surprise when I entered the DoN tunnels through the good side and was quickly slaughtered by the guards. I couldn't figure it out, why was I, a member of a good race being killed by another good faction? It took several days and posts to figure out that a choice I made 5 years ago was now affecting my ability to enter the DoN tunnels. Little did I know that I was NOT KoS to the evil side, until I figured out why my deity was affecting the faction.&lt;br&gt;So, here I am stuck in the middle of a faction quandry. I have done a few good missions and no bad ones, it seems the faction doesn't move very quickly as I am still KoS to the good side. It seems people are prefering to do the good side missions more than bad.I have no idea why, as it seems that the DoN merchants each have the same items, just with different names.&lt;br&gt;Am I correct in saying that there are no faction tasks that are doable by a level 67 warrior? I tried one where I believe I was to collect spider silks in Lavaspinner's, however just getting past the dervs at the entrance was a real pain and I had to keep zoning out when my invis. would wear off. The mobs were lt. blue to me but seemed to be grossly underconned and seemed to add as well. Needless to say I never collected any silks as I never made it in far enough to find them.&lt;br&gt;If I am missing something here, please let me know.</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;The way I do the spiders is, luckily for me I have a fixed duration invis to get me past the stone dervishes and such. Be careful if you run in invis, there are occasionally some see invis mobs in the way. To get to spiders i just run straight out till I get to first fork, then go right. The spiders arnt too bad, with my 67 pet and me dotting and healing pet occasionally they die pretty fast.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>As I see it, this is not an easy task at all for a warrior to solo. I have Cobalt Greaves that I switch into place for invis., but it seems the invis. wears off too quickly many times. The other problem I encountered is adds, without a snare of some type, invariably the mobs lead you right to another and another. Before you know it you have too many and have to zone. I tried this task at least six times and my invis. wore off prematurely nearly every time and I ended up with 3-4 dervs. on me. After trying to get to the spiders invis. failed, I decided to try and fight my way in 1 mob (derv.) at a time. As soon as I would get one down to 20%, it would begin moving and invariably attract another. Even with over 10k HP buffed, I couldn't do more than two dervs. without a heal. I finally just gave up in frustration.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I think the idea is sound for the factions, but the large amount of work required to enable some to continue the storyline and progression is grossly unjust. It is obvious that many people have to do so much more than others based on a character choice they made years ago.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;While I personally am&amp;nbsp; not against the idea of having to do a bit more work than others, it remains that there are many who are. Therefore, rather than post just a negative message I have a couple suggestions.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;1) There are tons of tasks that came out with OoW. It makes sense for people to raise factions for either DR or KoN from these. I have done a number of these and never get any meaningful faction adjustments.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;2) If a person chose an evil character/deity there should be tasks &lt;STRONG&gt;and&lt;/STRONG&gt; quests in their starting city (makes sense) that will allow them to increase the faction for Dark Reign. (this also applies to good races/deities) *** note *** BUT make them meaningful. If it takes 1500 faction points to get the the next faction level, doing a task or quest should equal more than 2 faction points&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;3) Add tasks that can be done solo. Some classes are always screwed whenever new things are introduced into the game.... see the post form the lvl 70 monk above.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;4) Add tasks that require you to combine (example) 100 spider silks and when you turn them in you get faction adjustments. These turned-in combines are then on the NPC for other players to purchase. This will tie in for tradeskillers and allow them another avenue for obtaining tradeskill drops/or combines they would not usually be able to get on their own.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Just a few ideas. Perhaps others have more.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Why now do NPCs care about faction now?&amp;nbsp; Faction died out with PoP with enlightenment and then buried by LoY/GoD/OoW with all races working together against a greater foe.&amp;nbsp; Was it just a seperate sect of people?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Now we're back with the race and religion mattering?&amp;nbsp; Why the full circle?&amp;nbsp; For the sake of faction?&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;People that wanted faction back I assume is for choices.&amp;nbsp; The only choice people get is a choice of one or the other of what they want their gear to be called.&amp;nbsp; The only advantage of split item database is being able to get two of the same augment procs, one from good, then turning around doing lots of faction, and getting the other from the evil side.&amp;nbsp; The faction adjustment for good NPCs for good aligned and evil NPCs for evil aligned is pointless.&amp;nbsp; With the majority of players good aligned, there is no point to switch camps.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;However, I don't think it is possible to compare this to Velious.&amp;nbsp; Velious rewards were about getting turn-ins from raiding and getting faction.&amp;nbsp; This is about grouping although most likely Velious is groupable or soloable.&amp;nbsp; LDoN had five seperate camps each with their own faction in the sense you have to do those specific camps to get points to unlock rewards.&amp;nbsp; What happened with that grouping situation?&amp;nbsp; Classes ended up being divided in terms of progression (I finished all the points at that camp, I already got the max stats from the charm, etc) and in terms of gear (nothing I want is from there, I need to get this aug, etc).&amp;nbsp; If learning from that, and adding the twist of doing North Ro camps you lower EC camp, it would be disastrous.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Are we wishing on the proverbial monkey paw?&amp;nbsp; Where we wish for a million dollars, someone dies, and we inherit it?&amp;nbsp; Where we wish for faction but the rewards are identical making it serve no purpose of choosing either but for only the popular one where it is possible to get more groups?&amp;nbsp; While this is a roleplaying game, it is still a game.&amp;nbsp; No one is going to choose evil,&amp;nbsp;do evil aligned side specifically, only to be by himself getting invites to good camps.&amp;nbsp; He won't be evil.&amp;nbsp; He would just be that freaky goth kid that was always by himself in high school.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;-----------------&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;A better way to have done this was to somehow have it People vs Dragons.&amp;nbsp; I don't know the lore and stuff so maybe it isn't possible.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Siding with People is more for the beginner high level player that doesn't have +200HP items, not high play time, well whatever - the newbie.&amp;nbsp; The mobs, quests, etc are easier and have their own progression path in terms of how you accumulate things as well as what.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Siding with Dragons is more for the advanced high level player.&amp;nbsp; The faction is a bit harder to raise, you have to fight people and they're harder, the rewards are better, yadda blah.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;It'll be a little bit of everything for everyone.&amp;nbsp; Itemization would be different for each side so items don't rot when they could be upgrades for people.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The end AA result of siding with Dragons will be being able to turn into one and ravage Tokyo.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Just an idea~~&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ffff&gt;If killing King Tormax and Yelinak and Dain gave exactly the same items, and&amp;nbsp;all sets of armour were farmed from exactly the same mobs to give exactly the same stats I dont think Velious would be as well remembered as it is today.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I disagree. The faction work of Velious was the main thing I didn't like. If you were in a guild you really couldn't play any other side other than what your guild was working on. On Dragon faction but your guild wants to do North ToV? What were your options? Either skip the raid or trash your faction to help your guild. Either that or not care about any faction and train mobs through every zone you travel th ough. Although I guess it's amusing seeing half the raid magically going LD just before the mob dies so they don't take faction hits.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ffff&gt;&lt;EM&gt;The only advantage of split item database is being able to get two of the same augment procs, one from good, then turning around doing lots of faction, and getting the other from the evil side.&amp;nbsp; The faction adjustment for good NPCs for good aligned and evil NPCs for evil aligned is pointless.&amp;nbsp; With the majority of players good aligned, there is no point to switch camps.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;We're mostly evil in our guild. There's about two groups worth of people maybe on the good (losing!) side. But hey, regardless of which side we can all raid together. Well that's rather nice...&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;But yeah, how does that equate to 'factions that matter' other than losing the AA if you switch sides. Also, unless they changed it, if you're kos to one side you can still buy items from the merchant. Only the guards attack you.&amp;nbsp;So we arrive at your conclusion of there being no point to switching camps. But why would you want to? It's just a game, roleplay it however you want. I personally don't want faction farming to become 'work' or become a dividing factor amonst guildmates.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>One of the big problems that I see, is that old world diety restrictions came back into play with very harsh response.  I'm a barbarian, so I figured I would be good to start with (as I'm kos in all evil cities including the Overthere.. and starting out I was at the worst dubious in any good city).. Oh how I was wrong.  After running to the zone line being chased by guards I learned I was set to be on the evil side because I follow Rallos Zek.  One of my guildmates got himself beat up and the group's bard killed because he didn't realize that a half-elf wouldn't be welcome in the camp of Firiona because he was RZ diety.  After a half dozen missions or so I'm still at threateningly, and dubious with the evil camp *sigh*&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I love the idea of factions, I wish that Luclin would get "fixed" so that some of the great faction work that was started there would be realized (have more reason to faction with Katta or Seru, finish off the quests, etc).. but it does seem that certain diety/race combinations in DoN are having a harder time dealing with the factioning issue.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I think one of the things that made Vellious faction interesting was the fact that there was an dynamic&amp;nbsp;immerisve quality to the actual cities and npcs you could ally yourself to, and travel through safely, to the next area&amp;nbsp; (or&amp;nbsp;not) I've noticed and many others have noticed the lack of charismatic npc's, legacy of the ykesha had the potential for extra cities npcs etc being added on with content to explore in a vellious tier type system, and I think thats what people miss, having generic gear merchants standing at a camp with polarized factions is not my idea of meaningful factions. it's dull lifeless&amp;nbsp; and leaves me waiting for the next expansion "Accountants of Norrath".&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;There were a number of good steps made to mitigate the effects of seperating the factions with DoN, but for me in the end it was wasted effort - the word I used was quite specific - the factions are "separate" not "meaningful". Having two routes to exactly the same thing doesnt increase your options, and due to the grouping nature of the game it actually reduces them in many cases.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Velious factions can act as almost the opposite of DoN faction - both can be seen to be fairly balanced, but in SoV their were different but roughly equal rewards to each faction decision - for dwarves you could get lower stat but faster/easier&amp;nbsp;to gain armour, and for kael/ss you had roughly equal difficulty, and similar level equipment but with different stats that certain classes might prefer other the opposite set. With the main named there were again various different drops but all balanced to their difficulty.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If killing King Tormax and Yelinak and Dain gave exactly the same items, and&amp;nbsp;all sets of armour were farmed from exactly the same mobs to give exactly the same stats I dont think Velious would be as well remembered as it is today.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Thats not to say DoN was a failure, overall I like it - the rewards are decent and in line with effort for the majority of people, it feels like a grind a lot less than LDoN was, and the mission system is well set up and miles ahead of the LDoN tasks in terms of keeping things interesting. It also has a good mix of group/raid content compared to the raids of LDoN. But for me the faction is easily the biggest mistake in the expansion, there really is no purpose to it except as a failed attempt to put factions back in the game.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>I chose to stay on evil faction even though everyone I group with is on good so I'm constantly behind. I got to indifferent by doing solo quests from the wayfarers camp. Then doing your personal quests gives you some faction. Killed guards for a while but they give extremely small faction hits and they're on 30 min respawn so that is not a viable faction path. The wayfarers don't give solo quests once you hit indifferent so if you can't get evil groups after that you're pretty much screwed and it's going to take a long, long time to catch up to your good friends. There should be a way to trade the good tokens for evil ones. You don't need vice-versa because no good person in their right mind would pick the evil path. :&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Personally, I always liked factioning that allowed my evil character to be able to go places that most evils couldn't. But I see absolutely no point to these factions. The missions, merchant items and rewards are practically identical for both sides.</description>

      <description>I think the faction aspect is just to satisfy the old guard ( of whom I'm a member, perhaps ) who think the factionless aspects of expansions kind of detract from the immersiveness of the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then, add to this that they didn't want one side to have an advantage over the other ( ie, if the good items had "heals" on then, and the evil items had "lifetaps" on them ) or having to balance one side against another ...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Those two reasons, &lt;i&gt;I suppose&lt;/i&gt; are why the items are the same, with different names.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; :)</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;One of the problem with Don group tasks is that if you do good tasks, whole group gets good 'token' to raise the faction regardless of if some members are doing evil progression, which makes good 'token' useless to these people.&amp;nbsp; Why not have a NPC which will accept both type of 'token' and return opposite faction 'token'.&amp;nbsp; This will allow people with opposing faction to do different type of Don group tasks and make it more enjoyable.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;And if you need a RPG reason for why this NPC should exist, you can make this NPC a spy and make up a story line where he will change the 'token' because he wants to gather information about what the opposite side is doing and as proof need the 'token'&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
