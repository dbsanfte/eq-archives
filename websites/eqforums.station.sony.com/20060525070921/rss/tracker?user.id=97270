      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Forgot to mention. Got him our first try after revamp. Have only tried him once so far. Might have just been good luck. In any case, I like the change.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;He was definately too easy... It's not a good thing when half of your raid goes afk to finish a mob off and that was almost literally how that fight was after the adds stop spawning. We tried the revamped version, after seeing this thread I had my doubts - but with some&amp;nbsp;preperation, battle rezzing, and all round good effort we took him down. Granted it was anything but smooth but it certainly is very doable. I might add it is also an interesting fight now ;)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;My conclusion, nice change - keeps the fight interesting.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;They need to do something to let new players level fast and not give up at level 50. It is in our interest as players that they succeed in doing so or the game will suffer a slow death.

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;I have no argument here. Infact this is prossibly one of the smartest changes SoE has ever made to everquest. It solves so many of the problems the game had previously. It makes the game a lot more fun. The exp simply needs to be nurfed in some of the missions, or the missions need to be made harder... There needs to be a ballance for time invested vs exp reward. Some of the missions are just far too easy to complete. The 3-4 aa an hour I get is simply too good to be true.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Alright, heres another reason why they need to nurf them. In the 40 &lt;EM&gt;or so &lt;/EM&gt;days that DoD has come out I have made well over 250 aa running a few monster missions. Thats&amp;nbsp;a little more than&amp;nbsp;6 aa a day average. The thing is I don't do it every day. Infact I do it maybe once or twice a week in maybe 6 or 8 hour incriments. To add to this, I have not only gotten myself this aa, but I have also gotten 5 other people in the group the same aa. Before dod came out it took me nearly 5 months to get the same aa. At this rate I will be max aa in a few months. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;My conclusion, yes it needs to be nerfed. It may not seem apparent now, but it is a big problem and it will only get worse as time goes on. &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;Yes. The answer why is very VERY simple.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;In a monster mission, there is 0 risk. In a high end exp zone there is a lot of risk. Theirfor why would I ever want to xp in a high end exp zone when I can get the same exp in a monster mission with 0 risk involved?&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I thought of this around 4 years ago. I suggested this around 3.9 years ago... I don't know if the dev's overlooked this or if there is a good reason it can't be done, but I still think it would be an insanely awesome feature and hope that they some day impliment it into this wonderful game.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;Yes, they could even introduce the expansions again. I'd even like to see at least part of it be PvP. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Not like Zek is now, just in some areas. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;For example:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Zones where overly large trains can be used to kill opponents, or some of the more challenging zones can be flagged non-pvp. On the other hand - the lesser used, more open zones can be flagged for PvP. Perhaps a twist on this would be to flag some zones at hotspots and add the PvP flag at the same time - bit more risk in hunting in those zones :)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Of course, you will find some who stick to the non-pvp zones, but that's perfectly fine it works out for everyone then. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;On a classic server PoK should be an easy fix - just take the PoK books out of most zones - just leave them in a couple of the core cities - or even better yet, put them in zones that are almost never used and a bit harder to get to...&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Let's see - remove all PoK books, leave the spires and set them to 30 minutes for travel to Luclin. Put PoK books in the Nexus, and maybe 2 per expansion... So 2 in Antonica - Lesser Fay and Erud's Crossing perhaps. 2 In Kunark - Skyfire and Swamp of No Hope - make the books inconvienient and "mystical" if you will. Like - something that actually must be ventured to - keep them away from port in zones!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Add a bit of spice and excitement back to EQ :) You all know it's what made this game so popular from the start - there's no doubt in my mind this game has the potential to endure many more years - even longer than EQ2, if the right twists are added. I'd like to see it survive on it's own. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I can't see where Sony would have a whole lot to loose. Well, I can see their side of it - they go through all the trouble to make the server and everyone plays for 3 months and *poof* everyone's gone. You know - serisouly, I don't see that happening. I started a new toon on a new server with no gear - just to see if I'd like it. Most fun I've had in EQ in a couple years, seriously. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So, of course we can just play the "classic" part of the game now. But it would be cool to see a server like that where everyone's on equal ground.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So if we really want this - just keep posting until they either shut down EQ entirely or give us a new server - using all that hardware laying around from the mergers&amp;nbsp; :smileytongue:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Your missing the entire point. I didn't bother to read your whole post but as for at least the first half. &lt;EM&gt;EQ Classic Server&lt;/EM&gt; means NO pok NO nexus NO anything post velious. its EQ, EQ:Kunark, and EQ:Velious only. Lets assume for a moment we had a time machine. It would be like the server 3 - 4 years ago. Back before luclin and beyond hadn't even been conceived yet. Back when the boats still worked (yeah they may have to fix an old bug with the newer versions of DX screwing up the old content such as boats) but it certainly can be done. Its very doable... so do it!&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;It would obviously be profitable for SoE to create a server like this. What I want to know, is it possible? If so why the heck haven't ya done it yet? It's very clear to me that this would bring in more business. But I suppose it is possible that I am completely oblivious to certain key factors. Maybe it wouldn't be profitable? Maybe it wouldn't be profitable in the long run? I dunno. Some clarity as to why they HAVE NOT created a classic server would be much appreciated by the community however, and perhaps even bring closure to this immortal thread.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;The other paragraph explained to me that task missions &amp;amp; raids are supposed to have a lockout timer, and the fact that I had lockouts&amp;nbsp; was part of the mechanics of limiting how often I could do them.... apparently yet another GM that either doesn't actually read petition text, or isn't english literate, but rather looks for keywords, finds something related, and copy-pastes a response... the raids that i had lockout timers on should have made it obvious that I'd played enough to understand what a lockout timer is..../sigh&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Pretty sure I narrowed down how this occurs. I don't really care if a dev reads this or not, but I wanted to inform the comunity so you can avoid this since I believe it is completely avoidable. Don't complete a DoD task until every player in the group has zoned. For instance if your doing the Way of the Freemind mission, wait til everyone zones out before you hail the Freemind Cypher to complete the quest. If someone is midzone when the task is completed, the person who was zoning gets flagged for a 53 day timer to repeat the task. Hope this helps.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>Small, near insignificant rant...</title>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Servers came down today with nearly no warning. There was the "Servers are coming down immediately, please find a safe location to log out" message followed by an 11 minute count down shortly after, and even then they did the countdown way to fast. That 11 minutes went by in about 7 or 8 by my watch. I was in the game for a while and I did not see any previous warnings, and if it is posted somewhere on the forums or website, I am sorry but I do not troll websites and forums all day. Anyways, there has always been a 3 or more hour warning before the servers actually come down. Why is there not one now? &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;/rant off&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>BUG!</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=tech&amp;message.id=101417#M101417</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;What happens:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;You lose all /command, hotbutton, and zoning capability as well as the ability to reply to others or send others tells. Eventually you are booted to Char Select and forced to relog in. After relogging in your character is rolled back to where you were when you clicked to attempt to zone in.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Cause:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Attempting to zone into an area that you do not meet the requirements to (for instance, trying to zone into anguish when you do not meet the requirements). After attempting to zone in, maybe a few times the bug will eventually occur. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Just a note I haven't completely narrowed down the cause, but that is one instance where this did occur and more than just one time. It occurs with a 100% frequency.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;would also suggest something like:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;"You could have feigned it off but didn't? +50"&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
