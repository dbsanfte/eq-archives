    <description>&lt;div&gt;Hello all. I have been reading alot on the new physics card by Ageia here as of late and it looks like a really great technology that EQ could do alot with. Partical effects, destroyable objects, collision stuff and the like. However i have yet to find one single thread here about it. Anyone know if this is something in EQ's future or if the engine overhauls would be too great. Holding off buying one for a while myself. EQ only game I play and as of right now Ageia physx card does not groove with XP64. Anyway what do yall think / have heard?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Myrdale Forestroamer&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>EQ doesn't use physics, it's just a fancy picture painted over a text engine rpg.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;If you read the reviews, and look at the demos that are out there, you will see the cards are way overhyped not to mentin the additional cost of the extra card is prohibitive, I believe the BFG Tech version is around $300.00 US. They require coding with their supplied SDK to funciton in the game environment also. Be patience, both ATI and Nvidia are also working on incroporating their own gform of this card into their next generation of video cards. I believe ATI's code name is Havoc, but not 100 percent sure, no idea what Nvidia is calling their development of this technology/</description>

      <description>The tech is too new and EQ's engines are likely too old for the game to ever take much advantage of them. If EQ lasts a few years and those cards really catch on they may rebuild parts of the engine to use it, but don't count too much on it.</description>
