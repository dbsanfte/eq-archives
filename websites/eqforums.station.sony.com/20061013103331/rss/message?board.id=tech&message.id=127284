There technically is no reason for that file to be in the EQ folder at all, as that is a directx file.

If that file was in the EQ folder, there maybe other system files in there also.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Edit.  Did you use to use a program called AAutofire or such, that was a way to hit a key repeatedly?</description>
