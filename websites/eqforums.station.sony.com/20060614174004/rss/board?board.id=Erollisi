      <title>Seeking * troll* master tailor for cultural armor</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Erollisi&amp;message.id=177#M177</link>
      <description>Looking to buy a set of expert's and master's reaver armor for troll beastlords.&amp;nbsp; Been looking for a tailor who can make this on the server, and its understandable that they'd be rare, as the only trolls who use leather cultural armor would be beastlords.&amp;nbsp; But if there's anyone out there who can make it, send *Koolzek* a tell in game please. &amp;nbsp; Payin' well for this. &amp;nbsp; I know another troll BL out there, named Bozzly looking for a set as well, so it might be worth it to produce a few pieces.&amp;nbsp; Thanks ~&amp;nbsp;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi All !!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those that havent left EQ1 this maybe old news, but there is a new server opening up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Progressive server.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Open Date: June 2006&lt;br&gt;Server Name: The Combine&lt;br&gt;Quick link info:&lt;br&gt;Progressive message board - &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board?board.id=Progression&amp;sessionServerID=H4Pm2.Zej8c7KI18"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;Sonys&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Progressive message board - &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://progression.inquisition-eq.com/"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;Players&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;=================&lt;br&gt;I will be coming back to EQ1 on this server, my goal is to try and get as many of us together again as is possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember how it was when we started out? Only 3 continents, no mounts, no books etc?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember the fun we had as a guild and group? For me some of the MOST fun times there ever were, have been meeting and playing with you guys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lets try it all over again .. to me some of the very best times there were, were from original eq thru velious ( and luclin only due to beast lords rofl ).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know im not the best at words, but this sounds to me like a blast. They will be reverting zones to the way they were originally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expansions will only be opened up via questing and completing in game content. The exact specifics arent being told, and wont be known until the expansion is opened up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I need to know is who is currently tagged as the Guild Leader of Random Acts in EQ?&lt;br&gt;Ill need their help to get the new guild set up on the server as only they are allowed to create “sister” guilds on other servers with the same name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I feel its important to keep our name as I plan on keep the same feeling and helpfulness that we always had on Morell Thule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That include eventually, First Aide camps, guild meets, naked Halfling (lvl 1 of course) races to Halas etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would love to see as many of our friends as we can contact etc come and at least check it out. Im hoping that this will go over really well and we can all have some fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Askyn ( aka Larry ) – Email me if you like at &lt;a target="_blank" href="mailto:Askyn@cox.net"&gt;&lt;font color="#cccccc"&gt;Askyn@cox.net&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or Just post here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Im going to try and make this posting on the guild message boards I know about, aka – EQ1, EQ2 and WoW.

      <title>If you knew a ranger named Ultor</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Erollisi&amp;message.id=174#M174</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;Ultor was an EMarr ranger, of the guild Phoenix Crusaders from a few years back. It is my sad duty to report that Dan, or &amp;quot;Snuffy&amp;quot; as everyone but probably his mother knew him as, passed away on April 15th from a massive stroke. No doubt only EMarr old-timers would know him, and maybe not even many of them. Snuffy was alwasy friendly &amp;amp; happy, a trait that doesn't really get much attention in a medium such as a mmorg.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;He will be missed.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>'Cept for any future free play times they offer, this is it!'&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;after playing eq since dec 1999 on 30 day free to subscription i started in march2000. my eq patcher has finally went under the OOT waters as the eq boat has sunk. Some headinjurys and other injurys healed up at least while i got to BE IN EQ.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;it was quite an 'epic' experience being so many different things. i wish i could be that many things in real life or have ability to change jobs and abilities so 'easily'.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enjoy EQ every one, it does happen in the mind as well as in the game.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brendi-MT, Fhra-MT waving bye.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;I am thinking of coming back to this game, but would like to join a guild where they have lots of players online at ALL levels (not just 60+). I just want to be able to maximize my ability to find groups. A guild that regularly groups together and occasionally raids.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <title>Any Euro Guilds on the merged server?</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Erollisi&amp;message.id=153#M153</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;As the title says.&amp;nbsp; Are there any Euro guilds around.&amp;nbsp; I got a couple of names in game but I couldnt find anyone around.&amp;nbsp; Have they all moved on or retired ?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Well, the title explains enough I think.&amp;nbsp; I have been away from EQ for quite some time but have decided it's the game I have the most fun playing and so I am back to play.&amp;nbsp; At the moment my highest level character on this server is a 40 enchanter but he will be brought up to speed as quickly as possible.&amp;nbsp; SO, if there is a guild out there willing to take a chance and give a level 40 a chance please let me know.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;40 Enchanter&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>Looking for Guild</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Erollisi&amp;message.id=144#M144</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I have just recently returned to EQ from about a year leave.&amp;nbsp; My fromer guild has since fallen apart, and has been reduced to four people who do not play eq anymore but still talk over the message board.&amp;nbsp; I am looking for an active family oriented guild since none of my rl friends play anymore.&amp;nbsp; If anyone has or knows of a guild that fits this and is looking for members, either contact me here or in game.&amp;nbsp; My character's name is Yudoka, a 53 human ranger of Tunare.&amp;nbsp; Or if enough people would be interested in trying to start this kind of guild I would be willing to help.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Yudoka Shosuro&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;53 Pathfinder of Tunare&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
