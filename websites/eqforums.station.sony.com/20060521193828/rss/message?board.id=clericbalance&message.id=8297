    <description>&lt;DIV&gt;One thing that disgusts me is the stigma associated with an unepic'd cleric.&amp;nbsp; I was glad to finally get my 1.0 at level 62, but I never had a guild to help with it.&amp;nbsp; I solo'd most of it, and I made pickup raids for the rest.&amp;nbsp; You always get funny looks because you don't have your epic.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Now, I'm suffering the same stigma because I don't have my shield yet.&amp;nbsp; I've already farmed all the drops I can (lacking only the brain from WW because I need to kill Mirot first) for 1.5 and even the first stage of 2.0.&amp;nbsp; I saw a thread on here saying how any group can expect a cleric in RSS to have their click shield, but why?&amp;nbsp; Is it so easy for clerics to get great guilds that help them?&amp;nbsp; There aren't many middle-ground guilds anymore, they're either low end or high end, so where does a self-sufficient cleric fit into all this?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I never joined a raid guild until I was level 70.&amp;nbsp; Not once.&amp;nbsp; I got all my PoP flags purely from pickup raids.&amp;nbsp; I got an 8k mana pool from OoW and DoN content ONLY... NO RAIDS.&amp;nbsp; Finally joined a raid guild, and now there's this huge stigma because I have no 1.5.&amp;nbsp; And, of course, they don't want to help with my epic because I'm a lowly app, but it makes me feel like I may not get accepted because I don't have my epic, so it's a catch-22 for me.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I've earned everything I have myself, I never had anything handed to me.&amp;nbsp; Not gear, not spells, not flags, nothing.&amp;nbsp; I got everything I have from my own sweat and tears.&amp;nbsp; So why do I have such a hard time getting by?&amp;nbsp; Why do people still talk crap?&amp;nbsp; What do these people know about someone that started the game a year ago and that hasn't been privileged with a lengthy history in a certain guild or on a certain server?&amp;nbsp; Epic 1.0 was so easy to do, but 1.5 isn't so easy to just grab pickup raids for.&amp;nbsp; I really think guilds should rethink the way they treat clerics without click shields.&amp;nbsp; Just because you're new, and don't have all the bells and whistles, doesn't mean you aren't great at your class.&amp;nbsp; I have a friends list full of people that come to me first if they need a cleric for a group, why?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Because they know I'm good.&amp;nbsp; New to the game DOES NOT MEAN NEWBIE.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Anyway... rant's over.&amp;nbsp; Not sure what my point was, but I saw a thread on this forum that basically said, "any group in RS can expect their cleric to have their click shield", like it's so %^&amp;amp;*ing easy?&amp;nbsp; And this guy was a class rep.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;What do you know?&amp;nbsp; You've probably been playing since the game came out and never had to worry from day one about having a guild that'll dish everything out to you.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Well, two things. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;First, anyone who assumes a cleric is poorly geared just because they don't have the epic 1.5 is just being ridiculous. I have a 10k mana pool buffed, 11k hp buffed, 2100ac, and don't have epic 1.5 yet. I'm working on it, but not that worried about not having it atm. I've healed against most raid and group content short of Anguish, and not having my epic 1.5 has never really been a huge issue. Sure, having it would add another tool to my arsenal, but I have successfully healed through a 3 pull in RS, with the warrior tanking one, a pally tanking the second, and a monk on the third, all through the wise use of elixirs, lights, remedy,&amp;nbsp;DivArb and celestial regen. If you want to pull more than 3 at once in RS, without crowd control, I don't want your group anyhow.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Second, the epic 1.0 is not NECESSARY in any group content, but it is an amazing time saver. I would seriously recommend questing the 1.0 as soon as humanly possible!&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;No, I am not "ignorant" of it's usefulness. I know exactly what the effect does, and there are enough clerics in my guild who DO have them, that I am quite familiar with the "helpfullness" of the clicky, and the aggro reduction. Btw, it probably would be a good idea not to make up words while calling others ignorant.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The point being, anyone who selects a group healer based on whether or not they have their epic 1.5 is making a huge mistake.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;Having 1.5 should not be an end all, as stated above. And if someone is expecting you to have 2.0? Hogwash!! Only 5% maybe in the game will have 2.0 cause you NEED CoA access, and not alot of people are going to have that. Let alone, from what I have heard, Rage 2.0 is one of the hardest 2.0 mobs to kill?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I have only had my 1.5 for 1 week basically, and grouped many times in Rifts without it (50 Glowing Runes worth at least since it took me that long to get my 5 for HoConv), and sure I will progress fine even with it. It is all about how you do your job, and can work with groups. I don't break 8k Mana buffed, and don't break 9k HP buffed. I am in a EP raiding guild right now, and we do not progress in GoD either, yet.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I play at very odd hours cause I am stationed in Japan, so having a MT in Rifts, as a&amp;nbsp;sub 11k Ranger, with me as healer, is not uncommon sometimes. I have even done this with no C. I am not picky when it comes to group makeup at the 4am EDT hours, 2 shammies, me, necro, ranger and mage have been a group before in Rifts. Just be yourself, and do the best you can. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Is the epic 1.5/2.0 needed ? No.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Is it worth getting them ?&amp;nbsp; Hell yes,&amp;nbsp; There great items and have the best clicky of any epic 1.5/2.0.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If people expect you to have you epic 1.5 then they should help you with the fights :smileyhappy:&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Repetitive but ill jump on the bandwagon...&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I'm a lvl 70 Cleric w/ 310aa's, 7.2k mana.&amp;nbsp; All 69/70 runes acquired and finished several weeks ago in large part due to RSS pick up groups, when my mana pool and aa amount was FAR lower.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I do not have 1.5 epic, and hello, not even 1.0 (although began working on it 1 week ago).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Most of those aa's are superficial, a non epiced cleric is fine in rss w/ 100aas if placed properly. &amp;nbsp;And if less, just a matter of being more attuned to group makeup, downtime etc.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Give me a KEI and a 13k tank (thats a pretty common number if not more) and I rarely run out of mana in most areas. Sure it depends on how fast your pulling, but chuck in a MW'er (or bard)&amp;nbsp;ontop of C and good bye what little mana problems you have left.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The stigma behind 1.5 tho is founded, that dang dva ability *drool* is a treat. And while you can argue that a 1.5epic cleric may not always be as well played as a non epiced.&amp;nbsp; Line then up side by side and Ill pick the 1.5 epiced, as most would from a PUG perspective.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I cannot believe that level 70 cleric dont have there epic 1.0s yet.&amp;nbsp; Granted I did not get mine until well into the LDON expansion, but now I do not know how I would live without it.&amp;nbsp; back then I started it and got thru the prismatic priest and then stopped.&amp;nbsp; I thought the level 56 spell was sufficient.&amp;nbsp; It was not!&amp;nbsp; In LDoN groups wiped for frequently and it became clear I needed a faster way to rez my groups.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As for Epic 1.5 and 2.0:&amp;nbsp; The shield click has been a life saving tool more than once, but I do not think it's overpowered considering the process to get them.&amp;nbsp; Besides, epic 2.0 (for all classes) is meant to be the end-all-be-all item and therefore should never be nerfed.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I just hope that the Dev's don't make the same mistake twice and trivialize/obsolete the epic 1.5s and 2.0s as fast as the 1.0s were.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;A Cleric without a epic 1.0 are about as usefull as a Wizard with no port spells.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>I really think that you are being to sensitive about your epic.  I have healed in RSS before I got my epic 1.5 and did just fine.  One piece of gear is not going to make or break a good group.  Get into a guild you enjoy and work hard and help others and some day you will reap the rewards.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ailinye&lt;br&gt;Prelate of The Relentless&lt;br&gt;http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=667909</description>

      <description>It depends what you mean by stigma.  You could not have a 1.5 and be a very skilled player.  However, if I see someone without a 1.5, I will generally assume their gear is not that great, and it will make me less likely to choose them for an XP group, simply because better gear makes XP groups go more smoothly.  Gear is not everything either.  I've met well geared clerics that suck, and poorly geared clerics that do a lot with what they have, but all else being equal, if I have a choice, I'll take the guy with better gear, especially items like a 1.5.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for people applying to my guild, we are an endgame guild, and do not demand a 1.5.  If we see one, it's a plus, but it's by no means necessary.  You are correct in that even a 1.5 is very hard to do guildless, and a 2.0 is nearly impossible, anguish orb aside.  We do expect applicants to work on their 1.5's, and have gotten 1.5's for all but one of our cleric apps atm, and he is currently working on it.  We do expect apps to have decent gear.  This doesn't mean anguish level, but if we see apps wearing 40/40 bracers, bp's, legs, etc., or using ldon 6 to a resist augments, we tell them to get better gear and come back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sometimes, no matter how skilled you are, lack of gear will make you unable to do your job.  This is only in the harder content though.  8K is a pretty decent manapool, and if you have a lot of AA's, I would think RSS wouldn't be a big problem.  I certainly healed in RSS before I had my shield clicky.  At the same time though, sometimes the clicky will save you, so you have to expect people to prefer those that have it when looking for people to xp with.</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;Or you take your app and one group Msha's on a stick to gear them up faster. Honestly between Msha's and places like Time and Tacvi it's not hard to gear up new people. Epics on the other hand take alot of time and time away from major targets to a guild become a burden. Often times an epic is a reward for longer term members, as this practice also prevents guild hopping after a quick grandfathering/flag run. Hate to say it, but most guilds repulse at getting new people their epics very quickly because alot of us have fond memories of being in a feeder guild to have a new guy get his epic and then apply to uber guild01 two days later.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The only stigma I think that holds water is when people are under geared in a zone, and that's about it. Otherwise an epic 1.5 is a nice thing, but not something you always need. DVA works just fine, and I normally use that first anyway because of the quick cycle and zero aggro. 1.5 still gives you some aggro, especially on an fd monk. So those people don't know jack.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The last tank that had a problem with me meleeing, was having a much harder time keeping aggro after the comment as I took over his tanking role.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Vjik on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;06-16-2005&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;02:12 AM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#cc9933&gt;I disagree with the first part of this, and agree with the later, if they are walking around in 40/40 gear, and you are an upper end guild, they most likely don;t belong in your guild. They should, and will truly enjoy the experience and sense of accomplishment of joining a PoP guild, kill Grummy kill Bert, kill TT etc, make their way into the Planes, farm Fire, Farm Water, kill the EP gods, and make their way to Time. Taking peope that are wearing 40/40 gear and popping them into an end game guild and gearing them up in a week of time and Qvic, well, it really does neither the person or the guild a long term service, at least rarely. They do not appreciate the gear, as they did not earn it, they are not worthy of the gear, as they did not put in the time, the raids, to earn it. Anyone with 40/40 gear apping to a Guild higher than say Time, is a loser wanting a free ride as far as I am concerned.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Which in turn takes years, when you need a new member in a few&amp;nbsp;months and not years. Realistically, most applicants have 100/100 these days mixed with a few ornate slots and the gearing up process isn't as imediate as a week or two. It's more of like a month to bring into the adequete category and then up to three to get parked into the adverage category. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;There's more than a person applying for loot or status. First and foremost is friendships and in some cases family. In every guild I've ever been in, especially real life friends and family, will cluster to the same guilds. Secondly, people have already progressed through the "low end" and got tired of the loot mongering and infighting or slow progression these guilds often have. If someone's friend got into Uber_Guild_01 and likes it there, then the person will be more inclined to apply to that guild. It's as simple as that. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Often times only the very upper escheleon has the hand pick of cross server, top end applicants. And if you're on a top heavey server, you'll often have to deal with what you get. I've seen some of these so called "losers" become high standing officers, the best in their class, and ect. after they got tired of the low end or follow their friends. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Most guilds have basic AA requirements, which generally reflects also gear. If you have a 250-300 requirement then generally you will not see the 40/40 people and more of the 100/100 to 140/140 people. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;For the most part, applicants want a guild that is stable and offers fun progression.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;So what are the higher end guilds supposed to do for new members, when they lose a few people. Poach from other guilds at the same level? We have an anti-poaching policy, so unless they come to us, that's not going to happen.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Probably half our apps have EP or worse gear when they first show up, and within a month or two, are up to speed, and most are doing fine. The ones who can't handle it get cut during their app period. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Raven, you know you are breaking some simple rules.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;1. never tell someone else *how* to play.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;2. do not ignore the devs. they are always right.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;How i play my class is entirely up to me. your input, specially as an out of class player, is not wanted nor valued, nor relavent.&amp;nbsp; just say shut up and heal like the rest of the trolls have for 3+ years.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The devs SPECIFICLY stated that zones like qvic are designed for raiders to gear up recruits because it is not possible for said recruits to gear to a raid level on their own. the seperation is just too large.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;So revanheart , whats happens if you are european and the only european guild is a high end guild. You are either stuck not raiding or having to raid at 4am , if you work that is an absolute no go. Or you have to try to join the euro guild.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Please don't say make a guild as there as only so many euro players on a server and therefore you will have a very limtied pool to get members from.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
