      <description>&lt;div&gt;Revamped Sol C would be extremely difficult for players at 50.  I think it'd be interesting if they left that zone open initially just to see what players could / would be willing to do there.  There's some decent loots but i wonder if players would be willing to raid it much for them at that stage of progression.  Fire giants required raids to kill at 50; the stuff in there hits 2x as hard as FG's at the min.  Same thing with CT, there's no reason really to block it off because of the difficulty it poses and the level reqs on the gear.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Revamped Splitpaw is going to be undoable until Velious / Luclin.  And at that level (mostly 60's) we're still talking raid / mini-raid cause those mobs are some serious nastiness (hate that spinstun).  Single groups won't be able to handle it until PoP is opened.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Yes people will attempt to hunt Droga and Veksar quite a bit, but they won't be easy (especially Veksar).  People might raid these zones for loot and exp in Seb (assuming its a hotzone then still).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was quite a bit of decent armor (not LoY, but still decent) dropped in the older zones which havent been revamped... Cold Iron from Warrens was some of the best Plate Armor you could get before Hate/Fear Raids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking of raids, I think most guilds will be raiding Hate more than anything... Ethereal Mist for all the clerics, Indocolite for all the warriors... Perhaps pick up a piece or two of Rune Etched for any shammies that come along...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next is Fear... Best armor you could get for Rogue/SK/Necro/Wiz/Druid/Monk/Pally... and maybe I missed a class or two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sure there will be raiding other places, I see a lot of raiding done, but these will grab most of the priority I think.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Few thoughts ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One old world zone may need an update on its loot, The stuff in Cazic Thule would be some of the best droppable items in the old world, and CZ would definitly be a good hard raid zone for level 50's but it has one minor drawback... its Required level 51.. maybe they should change it to Recomended 51 for this server.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actualy another thing is will TradeSkill items be allowed, Blue Diamond Cultural plate is better then any plane of hate / fear stuff, heck its better than anything that drops in Kunark. As far as I know it wasnt tied to any expansion, it was introduced about late Velious but the expansion wasnt needed. Of course I guess they could just remove Blue Diamonds from any old world zones and problem solved. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would it be an idea to add in some low level Augments? all armour has slots now, and beside some of the revamped old world zones no mobs drop them, maybe add in some +5 or so (similar to dropped ldon) augments so we can use those slots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will Focus items work? I forget which expansion introduced them, PoP maybe? but when they were brought in tons of old world items got focus's added to them. are they going to be &amp;quot;turned off&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description>

Its not going to be time-based, I see kunark open in 3 months max, so is this really as big of a problem?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actualy another thing is will TradeSkill items be allowed, Blue Diamond Cultural plate is better then any plane of hate / fear stuff, heck its better than anything that drops in Kunark.

I dont think SOE is willing to nerf too many things on this server just to have to look forward to re-implementing them later on.  And I sure hope they dont nerf any more drops without that intention :(&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would it be an idea to add in some low level Augments? all armour has slots now, and beside some of the revamped old world zones no mobs drop them, maybe add in some +5 or so (similar to dropped ldon) augments so we can use those slots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Probably not.  Might be an idea for a future re-vamp though to have some low-lvl augs that drop off trilogy-era nameds though... Maybe some Planes single-stat augs too :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will Focus items work?

      <description>&lt;div&gt;the drops from jaggedpine are &amp;quot;nice&amp;quot;, but imo arent &amp;quot;uber&amp;quot; enough to bother worrying about, except for maybe the 7/18 monk weapon, but even then, eh.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;droga/nurga on the other hand, drop some items that way way way above par for kunark gear...you can get a 25/23 2hander for example, that is worlds better than any other 2hander available at the time.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;cazic gear all has req lvl of 51, so dont see it as a problem till maybe kunark..and that zone would be pretty rough at 60 with no aa's.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>One zone that nobody seems to talk about is: Sol C.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That's a zone that could potentially be available from Day One.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now I don't know if a group of 50's could even get in there, but I&amp;quot;d be willing to bet a raid of sorts probably could. I don't see anyone beating Culthor, but there's still quite a few nice items in there that could throw off the power level of characters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A full list of the zones that concern me in the pre Luclin stages at least:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-Sol C.&lt;br&gt;-Revamped Cazic Thule&lt;br&gt;-Revamped Splitpaw&lt;br&gt;-Jagged Pine&lt;br&gt;-Stonebrunt&lt;br&gt;-The Warrens&lt;br&gt;-The Hole&lt;br&gt;-Revamped Plane of Hate&lt;br&gt;-Revamped Nurga&lt;br&gt;-Revamped Droga&lt;br&gt;-Revamped Veeshan's Peak&lt;br&gt;-Veksar&lt;br&gt;-Chardok B.&lt;br&gt;-Revamped Howling Stones&lt;br&gt;-Revamped Plane of Mischief&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don't think I'm forgetting anything.  As you can see, the &amp;quot;revamped&amp;quot; zones are the most dominant in that list as far as big upgrades in my opinion..&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Those zones could be reverted back to their old state. The key is will they?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As far as the non revamped zones of Sol C, Veksar and Char B mainly. I suppsoe they could just be blocked off until a later date.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My personal preference is that they revert the revamps back and then later on install the revamps. Then simply block any other zone until a later date.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;span&gt;Tutorial&amp;gt;Lavastorm&amp;gt;Stonebrunt&amp;gt;Jaggedpine&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don't think i'll really have any of the loot from the old world.&lt;br&gt;On the bright side, I've never really hunted these zones much before.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lavastorm is really not going to be able to handle the amount of players that will be heading there, make sure you arrive early.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
