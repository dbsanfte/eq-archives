      <title>Grappling Strike and Press The Attack on same timer?</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=warriorbalance&amp;message.id=26111#M26111</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I was excited to purchase Grappling Strike, thinking I'd be able to push and pull a mob into position to be tanked, but they are on the same 30 sec timer.&amp;nbsp; Being on the same timer kind of makes the one not being used really not worth much.&amp;nbsp; I wonder if this could be reconsidered.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>Weekly Question:  11-7</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=warriorbalance&amp;message.id=26107#M26107</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;We were told in an earlier weekly question that there should be some right click imbue aggro proc clickies in TSS.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; None have been found yet, and ok, if they're embedded into content we've not found yet, ok.. no problem.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;For raiders.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The primary issues we're beginning to see is lower end warriors having to follow a specific path for weaponry/aggro progression, and that progression being simply unavailable for non raiding warriors.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;At this point, we're beginning to see Qvic-Txevu level drops in single group content for OTW's (Other than warriors).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Missing within the itemization schemata at this level are:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;1. Hate focus:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; It's on the Time BP, and the Qvic gloves, both content that single group play has passed for OTW's, but there's nothing for warriors in non-raid content with a hate focus.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;2. Imbued Click:&amp;nbsp; Symbol of the Planemasters (Time) ... Call of Fire Gloves (VT)... both content that single group OTW gear has surpassed significantly, nothing currently known to be available as an alternative to non raiders.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;3. Weaponry:&amp;nbsp; Single group weaponry is lagging terribly behind other gear.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; There is no alternative to Darkblade, Fleshbiter (Content which single group OTW gear has passed), nor is there any reasonable Qvic/Inktu'Ta/Txevu level weaponry like other gear.&amp;nbsp; Weaponry available to single group players in EQ is really falling way behind, and warrior oriented weaponry is terrible.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;4. Armor Class:&amp;nbsp; Gear in the last few expansions has been woefully inadequate in AC, and that trend appears to continue in TSS at all areas of play, but in particular in single group level of play.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; There are simply put, too many high HP/Low AC items entering the game at the low level and not a counterbalancing level of even decent AC items entering the world in the single group game.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Warrior question:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Historically, resurrection effects never depleted Endurance, only putting on items with END and stats gave more "empty" potential endurance.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; With TSS, this has changed, and we now have a completely empty endurance pool on resurrection, which really limits what we are able to do in a post res environment.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This actually represents a dramatic change from all precedent, when since Kunark throughout the rest of the game, we've been able to use at least one discipline on resurrection.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Now with the ooc regen system, we've got a minimum cooldown time of until reseffects wear to generate enough END to cover the use of even one disc, and that's not counting any AE's that are occurring.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; We do not have the ability to improve regen outside of the ooc regen system such as C7, or bard songs, etc.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;We would like to be returned to the state we have had since the implementation of the END system, which is to be resurrected in with a minimum level of Endurance.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>Suggested Improvements for Mid-level Warriors</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=warriorbalance&amp;message.id=26002#M26002</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;While dramatic improvements to the damage output of other classes tends to occur at higher levels and/or with access to PoTime+ raid gear, lower level Warriors need competative aggro and some passive survivability advantage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I realize that the addition of "-1 DI", the Sturdyness AA ability, and the Provoke line has helped with both of these issues. Nonetheless, some modest improvents to mid-level Warriors seems to me to be potentially helpful.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. Mock/Scowls Line&lt;br&gt;Unlinking Mock/Scowls and Bazu has made 2Hders and sword and board more practical for 70+ Warriors at the cost of expending Endurance. I suggest adding Rude Gesture to the Mock/Scowls line to accomplish the same for mid-level Warirors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rude Gesture&lt;br&gt;Level 56&lt;br&gt;600 Hate&lt;br&gt;300 Endurance&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. Right Click Weapon Buffs&lt;br&gt;Glove of the Crimson Sigil and Symbol of the Plansmasters are acquireable only in raids. New upgraded versions should have been provided from time to time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While mid-level non-raiding Warriors can be buffed with Trickster's, I can see no reason that a a right click weapon aggro buff isn't provided for mid-level non-raiding Warirors on an item that can be obtained in appropriate non-raid content. Something like:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Level 56&lt;br&gt;Decrease hitpoints by 50-75&lt;br&gt;Stun 1.0&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3. Shield Specialist&lt;br&gt;The loss of ~30% of a Warrior's DPS when switching from DW to sword and board is the case for mid-level Warriros as well. True, ~100AC not subject to the softcap is potentially a great benefit to them, but they are just a much as any Wariror forced to use a weapon designed to be use two at a time on it's own with a shield.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shield Specialist should made available to Warriors level 56 and above.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I realize these suggestions might be contentious. My intention is only to trickle down capabilities provided to 70+ Warirors to mid-level Warriors who face many of the same issues - not to provide them with unbalanced advantage vs. their competition for group spots - merely to balance the scales a bit better and make 2Handers and sword and board more practical for mid-level Warriors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Battleblade-Xegony on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;10-06-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;04:24 AM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;A while back, an option was introduced to filter out strikethrough spam, yet it hasn't eliminated all strikethrough spam from all sources, it seems as though it only filters out item based strikethrough, not AA strikethrough from AA's such as Tactical Mastery.&amp;nbsp; Warriors have a lot of item and AA based strikethrough and would really like the ability to turn it all off, can we have a universal strikethrough filter that covers all strikethrough messages?&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>Our "Hold the Line" AA</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=warriorbalance&amp;message.id=25981#M25981</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I have posted this in the Vet forums too, as i didnt think to post it here...&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Well, picked this up today, hoped to use it on our DP run.&amp;nbsp; Didnt really get a chance to have a look at it.&amp;nbsp; So after raid, we headed for a single grp aug run.&amp;nbsp; I asked cleric to hold off on CH until I was at about 50-60% so that the full CH would land.&amp;nbsp; Once there, I hit the AA, but CH still only landed for it's max 9600 hps ....&amp;nbsp; This AA is supposed to increase healing on me by 10% while dropping my overall dmg output by 25%.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Is the AA broken, or does it just not work with Complete Heal?&amp;nbsp; For 9AAs I'm really hoping its just broken at the moment, cause CH is almost standard among heals, I was REALLY hoping it would affect CH.&amp;nbsp; Kind of a let down if this is another case of "working as intended".&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3&gt;1) Do we know if the cap on worn avoidance and shielding went up with TSS?? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;2) I know as tanks gain level they get some improvement to mitigation and avoidance just due to level.. I.E. a level 70 tank nakked ( assuming he has 0 AA's) has better mitigation/avoidance than a level 1 tank... Do we know if we get any improvement at level 75 vs level 70.. JUST due to our new level??&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Also I belive warriors get more improvement this way than knights.. as I understand it.. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;hello, &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;I was wondering about my player profile that appears on eqplayers. My hit points and other stats show like this ( i'm sure you all know what they look like)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp; 11,659 / 14,374... My question is why do my rankings show 14,374 to be my hit points when they are indeed 11,659 ( base) i currently buff out to 15,100 &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;Can any of you guys explain this to me , no im not a noob but never until recently saw my profile on eqplayers and was just curious has to why sony does this &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>Mid-End gear, high level warriors</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=warriorbalance&amp;message.id=25967#M25967</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Greetings all&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I just wanted to air a few things out.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Seems to me, that most discussions on this board, are refering to the HIGH end gear warriors.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;What if we for a few minutes took a look at the mid end gear warriors tanking ?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I currently have a 66 warrior with 50somthing(forgot exact amount) of AA's, and working to improve this.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I currently sit with 6.7/8K hp and around then 1300ac mark(Unbuffed)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;My point of this post is that, at the progression I am at (Missing very few kills till EP'ed). I have been in situations where I have been "taken" out of the role I held in my group,&amp;nbsp; take for example a time in WoS,&amp;nbsp;there was a knight (SK) that could take over tanking THOUGH havnig less HP / AC then me (I was sitting at 9000hp/1500 ac, and he was sat at 8.2K/1400AC), and the cleric actually insisted to the point (was groupleader) That I stepped down as tank, and let the SK overtake, or left the group. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;This to me, seems rather unbalancing, when a cleric actually ask's a inferior(Hp/AC) tank, to take over tanking, when no issues were being had with other tank (Hell, we had slaughtered 3-5 nameds in WoS, before the SK came into the picture, without a problem) &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Am I the only one who has experienced this sort of happening ? Or have I just been unlucky?(Happened 6-7 times to me now)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If there is anything I can improve let me know. I have done my very best to be able to cope with handling my responsibilty as a tank, even though I am NO WAY near the high end equipment. Due to being at work (And the firewall is blocking me to get to my magelo, I will be posting it once I get home later today)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;But any feedback of what I might have been doing wrong or what I can improve, will be very much appreciated!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>Separate BASH and KICK</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=warriorbalance&amp;message.id=25768#M25768</link>
      <description>I have played with a shield quite often as a 70 warrior and like the way it ads a new element to game play. It helps alot when the healer is having a hard time landing heals. The problem jumps in when the dps are drawing my aggro alot due to my lack of attacks. I noticed that BASH will remove one of my attacks because I play a dwarf. The larger races never use kick, but I have since day one. The separation of Bash and Kick would allow me three attacks with a shield and I believe would be enough to grant me the ability to hold my aggro and give the healer a better chance to keep me standing while I use the benefits of my shield. This might require separating Bash/Slam too, but I never use Slam anyway.</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;Warrior question:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Many of our skills and AA's are not usable while performing our primary function, because of the way we're set up insofar as "casting times" is concerned.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;All of the Veteran Reward AA's, as well as Aura of the Champion/Myrmidon have "cast times", but due to a lack of actual channelling, or the inability of the concentration AA&amp;nbsp; to affect these, a single hit for a single point of damage causes an automatic interruption of those skills.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Many warriors feel that since pretty much all other classes, outside of special circumstances, can utilize all of their skills as well as the veteran AA's while performing their primary function, we should be able to as well.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Can either the skills themselves be adjusted, or have the concentration AA apply to them so that we can use these while taking damage?&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;i have seen people on the Boreds Post about endr Regen and i know befo thay did the Big change there was a Endr Heal bards had a song Bsts had a HoT Shammys had a heal for it but now none of them work.. now i am a War that raids Tacvi CoA and after i get a battle rezz to get back in the Fight im Really Low on Endr how about Fixing some of them Endr Heals and songs to help ot the wars to regen it for Fighting im not gear Great only have about a 8.5k endr Pool but it gos fast..&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;i seen some 1 Post for a Fear AA where we can not be feared At All would love to see that but dont think thay will seeing as theres to many raid mobs that AE fear if might end up costing more Lives then saving .. i know thay gave us an AA called War Cry.. but at 30 Secs best&amp;nbsp; its almost useless seeing as Killing a Time mob still takes about 90 Secs at Max DPS yes i still raid time for Fun and Alts Lol. and i want a Dbow just to say i got 1 ...&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;and there was a Disc i was goin to say something about but cant recall the name because i never use it ... it says that it increases the anger with all your Atks well it dont the Disc kinda dont work at all maybe Kicking up the anger mod on that would help out some i will repost&amp;nbsp; on this when i have the name of the Disc ..&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;thats all for now Folks see ya on th battle field..&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Don't mind me, just passing through.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Do many Warriors think it's a complete absurdity that they have pay actual AAs to use a potion or something in battle.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I'd like to know how the master of War is going to be any less adept at drinking a potion whilst engaged in melee combat than the slightly less adept at melee class aka Paladins.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Just came up this week talking to a Warrior friend, I thought it was pretty stupid, what&amp;nbsp;could a Warrior even abuse if SoE gave them a channelling skill?&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Warriors:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;One source of warrior aggro, since Luclin has been clickies which imbue a proc independent of weapon procs (Examples, Aten gloves, Symbol of the Planemasters).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;We feel that these imbued procs should be made available not only to raiding warriors but to warriors of all levels.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; We also feel that there's been stagnation since PoP of imbued proc items as well for the higher end warriors.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Can we see more availability of imbued proc items at all levels of play?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=warriorbalance&amp;message.id=25125#M25125</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I've looked around for about 20 minutes and couldnt find this topic anywhere.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I was just curious, if anyone out there is parsing there raids dps and each member at the raid etc...&amp;nbsp; Where are most of the warriors coming in at with ther parses for raid nameds?&amp;nbsp; Like say on a 5 min + fight what is the max dps some of you guys have parsed etc what mob etc what weps/ augs did u use etc.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;With 2.5 + consecrated ball of silver in main hand &amp;nbsp;and mayong's 1hnd blunt Twinfang the Immortals bane in offhand &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I parsed 1109 dps on ayonae ro tonight&amp;nbsp; for a 6:20 sec fight for a total of&amp;nbsp; 421720 damge.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
