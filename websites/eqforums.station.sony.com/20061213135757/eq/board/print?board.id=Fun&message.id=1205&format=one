				I began EQ in July of 2000 with my RL hubby.  We only had one account so we had to play without each other.  We got most of our friends to play also.  Within a few months we split up as he moved in with my best friend. He took the account and I quit playing.  I picked EQ back up two years later in early April 2002 but couldnt play much as I worked constantly.  In 2003 I broke my leg and hand on vacation I had little I could do around my house so I started playing again.  Once I was able to go back to work EQ was put on the back burner.  In Oct 2004 I started playing EQ again.  All the friends i had made had moved on and I was soloing and really bored.  I was more than ready to put EQ on the back burner again when one of my old buddies Logged in.  He was now divorced and happy to be back.  We talked the first morning he was in game for a few hours and grouped up.  After that however we didnt talk much.  I decided to make a toon something like my first one and asked if I got her to his level could we group.  So I started on a quest to get my girl to his level.  <br>   I leveled to ten in a matter of hours and headed to CB.  I was soloing her good with a few buffs.  One of the Orcs laid into me pretty well and I hardly made it out alive.  On the other side in GFay was this high elf.  He healed me and buffed me.  He told me to zone thru and he would help level me.  I got a level and logged for the night.  The next evening I hunted for him and couldnt find him so I added him to my friends list and set off to get levels.  Once I got 14 my friend from the past and I grouped up for an evening, he had leveled up a few levels so he was ahead of me but it was fine.  Over the next few days I had no contact with either of them until one day in PC I see my cleric friend is there also.  I send him a tell and we talk for a few minutes and he invites my 16 rog to group with him outside PC as he was 25.  So we head to MS and he helps level me with his SK friend.  Out of the blue he tells me his name, age, marital status, and where hes from.  I was shocked but glad he did.  I returned his tell with my stats.  Since that day we have played the game together and talked almost nightly.  Our Toons are to be wed this weekend Feb 13!! and I am heading to AK to meet him in person later this month.
