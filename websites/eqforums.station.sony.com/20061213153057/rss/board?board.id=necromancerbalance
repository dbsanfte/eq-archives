&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Effective immediately I will be stepping down as the appointed Necromancer Class Correspondent. I want to take this opportunity to thank every single person in the community for their contributions in this near year I’ve held the position. Whether kind or cruel, your words kept me honest and hard at work.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I will not be quitting EQ. I will still be around, hanging out with my guild Dark Bane on Saryrn and enjoying all the game has to offer. I am a college student pushing my third year in Pre-law and Biochemistry, and each year gets busier and more intense. It is simply time to take a step back so I can have more time to explore the extracurricular student organization activities and concentrate my studies. I believe strongly in service, and for me the time I have spent in this position has given me a chance to give something back to the community and game I have enjoyed for a very long time. I have learned many things from this community about leadership, accountability, online communication and hard work. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Now into the nitty gritty. Kytherea will shortly be posting an announcement asking for people to apply to her via a short PM- if you’re interested in the Class Correspondent position. Please wait for that post, though. The last time she posted that announcement, the Necromancer community beat the record for number of applications, and I know you’ll do it again.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I must emphasize this position is not something you can manage by just daily reading the boards. It requires constant communication with the community, dissecting complex issues and relating them to the developers in a concise and productive way; and it requires a lot of time.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I have no reservations in stepping down at this point in time since there are so many outstanding and active necromancers in our community. I have full faith that whoever is picked will pick up the communities’ torch and march out issues right to SOE and make them listen.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The number one hardest part of this job is staying neutral in the fray. Everyone has an opinion on the issues of the day. Be prepared to give up those internal great ideas and opinions and get ready to dissent the hard issues the community agrees on. It’s hard to communicate solely for the community, especially when what your advocating runs contrary to what you believe to be the reality. But it’s just the job. Correspondents aren’t advocates.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Our class continues to face real issues. I have a lot of respect for the developers, but there is a hell of a lot not getting done. It is my theory they are incredibly overworked and underappreciated. It is important that this community and the next Correspondent remain actively engaged with the developers and the community, not to merely remind them we are still here, and are unhappy about certain things, but that we have a stake in the direction of the game and have some real solutions and ideas on how to improve it together. Only by being respectful, thoughtful, and inclusive with our words, can we hope to create change.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Here are some general issues the new TSS era Necromancer is facing. Efficiency, i.e. mana regen and the mana cost to damage ratio, haven’t scaled near high enough creating multitudes of issues with sustained damage, formally the Necromancer niche. Our disease line remains uninspired, being neither efficient, highly damaging, nor reliable. We need to kill the myth that Necromancers do great damage to the undead. Lifetap hasn’t scaled with the times meaning the normally independent Necromancer must receive healing in perilous times. Our PoR “trap” has not yet been replaced. Many TSS spells remain non-functional or less then ideal in terms of efficiency or damage. Many issues that preexisted from beta leaked into the live game and have received no resolution. There certainly is no shortage in things to look into. I’m excited about stepping down because now I’ll have more time to investigate issues like these in a detailed manner and report them to the new Correspondent instead of being the guy in the middle. It is clear we haven’t made the case for many of these issues to the developers, and until that is done, no change will occur.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Our battle drum needs to remain on efficiency and large sustained damage over time. If we keep the message simple, it’s only a matter of time until our issues get addressed in a constructive way.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Thank you for the time I had as your Correspondent, and I will do everything I can do remain there for the community in the interim and going forward with the new Correspondent.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Thank you,&lt;BR&gt;Nick&lt;BR&gt;a.k.a. Sauruman Gnomepowa&lt;BR&gt;Gnome Necromancer of Saryrn&lt;BR&gt;Former Necromancer Class Correspondent&lt;BR&gt;“Only the wisest and stupidest of men never change”&lt;BR&gt;-Confucious&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>Musings on building upon the usefulness of Mindflay</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=necromancerbalance&amp;message.id=3367#M3367</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Mindflay is a powerful tool for Necromancers.&amp;nbsp; When OoC regen first came on line, I thought the need for Mindflay would diminish.&amp;nbsp; And for awhile, others were just as disillusioned as I was, believing that they could simply burn hard, get into OoC regen, and be OK.&amp;nbsp; I stopped using Mindflay, but on a whim I began to break it out again here and there.&amp;nbsp; The response from the casters in my groups was the same as in the past, and they loved me for it.&amp;nbsp; It's still better to keep up a steady rythym than to burn burn burn and rely exclusively on OoC regen.&amp;nbsp; OoC regen has its limitations.&amp;nbsp; And folks use it as best they can.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;But as the waters have settled, it is easily recognized by most that FT, Mana Pools, and spells like Mindflay, do still matter.&amp;nbsp; I jumped the gun on the changes OoC brought to the game in some ways, and I posted a negative evaluation of OoC in the TSS/OoC feedback threads.&amp;nbsp; To the Dev's, I apologize for SOME of that, however....&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;....Getting back to Mindflay.&amp;nbsp; I remember a time when Necromancers used to SOMETIMES use their group beneficial tap spells.&amp;nbsp; The problem is..they were just poorly designed spells that took up too many spell slots, had poor resist rates, and didn't seem to be of much benefit to the group.&amp;nbsp; Now Mindflay is much like those spells, only it truly works, and it works well.&amp;nbsp; What I'd like to see, is a more powerful version of Mindflay.&amp;nbsp; If we release ourselves from the word&amp;nbsp;"Mindflay" and adopt one such as "Lifeflay" (or something else), it opens up new possibilities of what such a spell could represent.&amp;nbsp; With a name like that, a plethora of attributes could be added to the spell.&amp;nbsp; Such as:&amp;nbsp; Endurance sap and recourse for the melee classes&amp;nbsp;:smileywink: , Stat saps and recourse for the group, Lifetap melee proc recourse for the group, etc.&amp;nbsp; I'm talking one neat and powerful spell, "Lifeflay", that combines many of the attributes from our past stat saps, integrates Mindflay, and is booned by some outstanding additions that would benefit the entire group, not just he casters.&amp;nbsp; If you really wanted to make the spell nasty, you could add damage onto it, give it a small regen recourse as well (combining Zev's theft of vitae type spells).&amp;nbsp; What a powerful spell that would be!!!!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If such a spell were considered, I'd ask for one more necessary change to make the spell useful: Lower Cast Time.&amp;nbsp; Mindflay just takes too long to cast.&amp;nbsp; The recast is a balance factor that&amp;nbsp;I can accept.&amp;nbsp; The cast time, however, is just&amp;nbsp;too&amp;nbsp;large of a roadblock to it's usefulness.&amp;nbsp; And with a spell like "Lifeflay" (if it were considered...), it would require ease of use so that a cast of it wasn't wasted and didn't interfere with our dps responsibilites.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by PrinceyPrince on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;10-30-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;11:42 AM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Ok so I finally got my root spell as a 34 necro drakkin.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;enemy cons Blue and I just root and use my DT spells and let my pet do some attacking while I watch.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Is this a technique that will last for many other creatures ?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>1. With OOC regen Lich needs a major improvement.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
2. Mana efficiency of Ashengate needs another look at.&amp;nbsp; It is horrible, &lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
3. With affliction efficiency being discontinued, the new DOTS need to&#xD;
have a bump in efficiency or probably easier give Lich an improvement&#xD;
to reflect the lost focus.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
These should be our top 3, we got other issues but we need to focus on these I think.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

      <title>why waste the time?</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=necromancerbalance&amp;message.id=3347#M3347</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Why do we continue to pretend that dev's and what not are listening to our "weekly Q and A" and&amp;nbsp;our "top ten lists" etc... &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I see what's been done with the new expansion (and yeah, i understand some content will most likely change this weekend before it goes live) and i ask what has the last year or so accomplished? I'm not faulting the class reps, i'm faulting the system that implements them and doesn't listen to them. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I've seen some good ideas recently (not counting the "we want 20% more crits and double crit dmg and immunity to everything" posts) such as abilities to be dragged while FD (which has been a request for a long time, along with group FD spell). i've seen requests for either better mana feed spells or eliminate them completely (the argument being the best one, sed sub, was given to us in luclin, when mana pools were 5k tops at the time... and now they're 12 to 15k and we use same spell?) Someone pointed out years ago, that necros were the **SMURF** children of the eye candy gods... WTD, army of the dead, swarm of decay... none of which really accomplished anything, just something to say "ooh cool". Well, the toy has lost its thrill... &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;We've asked for better disease based lines, a cold based line of spells, self only cures/ports, etc... and gotten nothing... we've had kick taken away from our specter, we cant pet pull now, circlet of shadows got nerfed (yeah, long ago, but the day after i sold one for 3k, thinking i could get a new one), robes get clicky times changed 2 years after they come out... and its not just us, its all the classes.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;the question is, when is enough enough? when are you going to stop nickle and diming not just us, but the entire EQ community? your player base has made mass exoduses for other games... does World of Warcraft ring a bell? they're what, the number one mmorpg&amp;nbsp;2 years in a row now? thats where you super-guilds like afterlife and fires of heaven went. on my server (quellious) two of the longest standing top guilds on the server have disbanded now (vis maior and lotus cult) and it seems alliances are the hot ticket now, if you want to survive, for most guilds... when EQ came out, the joke was "the vision (tm)" because it didnt matter what the community wanted, you were the only game in town and we basically had to pay for the privalige of playing in your fantasy world. thats not the case now. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;i dread bidding on items that drop on raids, or worse, paying good pp for a droppable or attunable item in bazaar, wondering if its going to be nerfed, or made no drop (ie, whatever that cloak was with like 25cha, that got made attunable but the stats got level resticted so you no longer got full stats). when is something thats been in the game 5 years not going to be called a bug and get changed... if someone working for you is that slack, get them the hell out of your company, because they are whats costing you more and more memberships each month. fix it before you implement or SHORTLY thereafter.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;and for the love of innoruuk, LISTEN to what the community wants and quit playing god... implement the desires of the paying customer with expansions rather than some pretty new zones and some new focus and spells that, quite honestly, leave us scratching our heads and saying **SMURF**?&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=necromancerbalance&amp;message.id=3329#M3329</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Folks, I gotta say, I'm just fed up with this spell.&amp;nbsp; Believe me folks, I've always been one of the Necromancer's willing to use the spell if necessary....I like winning.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;And I've already seen uberguild spokesperson X say that their clerics don't need feeding, so I don't need some jackass replying to this thread about my guild this and my guild that.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I belong to a fairly decent guild, but there is ALWAYS at least one or two inefficient, undergeared, or recruit clerics/druids/healers that settle in to requesting twitch night after night during raids.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;All I'm saying is this.&amp;nbsp; Create a potion that essentially covers what it is twitch does.&amp;nbsp; 150/per tic over X amount of time reusable every X amount of minutes...yadda yadda yadda.&amp;nbsp; If you don't want other classes using it, like mages or wizards, make it cleric only.&amp;nbsp; Make it cleric/druid only if need be.&amp;nbsp; Whatever you gotta do, but get this goddamn spell out of my spellbook.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If you can't take it out of the game because it's effect has become necessary, the least you can do is make a potion or something that gets it off my classes shoulders.&amp;nbsp; You won't upgrade the spell, and I've heard rumors that the Dev's wish it had never been created.&amp;nbsp; We Necromancers understand its utility, but we HATE IT.&amp;nbsp; CAN'T you folks figure out a way by spell or potion to have the effect in game while removing it from us?&amp;nbsp; Put it in their hands.&amp;nbsp; Get it off my shoulders so that I can do what my class is supposed to be doing instead of feeding healers.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Mind Flay is GREAT! The mob is still targeted, everyone gets help...HURRAY!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Sedulous Subversion SUCKS!&amp;nbsp; I have to keep going back and forth during battle AND during raid recovery I can barely even ask to go use the restroom because I'm supposed to be feeding the healers.....&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;PLEASE find an alternative way to have the utility of twitch in the game while removing it from us.&amp;nbsp; Merely adding a way for the effect to be in game without removing it from our spellbooks won't be enough, because as long as we have that ridiculous spell in our repertoire it's going to be asked for.&amp;nbsp; REMOVE TWITCH!&amp;nbsp; Find a way to put it in their hands...PLEASE!&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;What question would you like to ask a developer about the necromancer class?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Every week (in the current form, but subject to change) each correspondent will be asking one question of the developers. The main questions I've been asking are basically about top ten issues and hotbutton issues. I will leave this thread stickied for a while, and I'll heavilly moderate it for anything that isn't a question or helpful. We can make discussion threads on individual issues, however this thread will merely serve as a reference for the correspondent in constructing the weekly question.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Remember there won't be polling or anything, but if I like your question, and especially if it isn't a "gimmee", SOE envy, or class envy orientated, it stands a decent chance of getting asked by me. Responses by the devs aren't guarenteed either, but I will continue to do my best in getting those answers.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>Tracking Q and A between corr and devs</title>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;This thread will be for tracking items that have received RESPONSES from the developers, and questions that remain UNANSWERED.&amp;nbsp; Red will indicate answered questions, while white remains unanswered questions&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;This listing will be updated from the top weekly, and the older items will be at the end of the thread.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Week of June 19, 2006&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Necro question (Zajeer)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;From the March 22nd HoC chat of this year this question was asked:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;"Brannoc - *Arial* Hi! This question is for Zajeer. Being that most of the items in the game have been itemized through demi plane is there any plans to rethink some of the more less desirable drops and possibly bring them in line with there counterparts? "&lt;BR&gt;With this answer:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;"Zajeer-Dev - I’m definitely open to feedback on specific items from specific zones that seem a little less than desirable for certain players. I’ve been receiving a ton of feedback through email, the boards, and in game about specific items and how to make them better. I’ll be keeping an eye on specific items and making adjustments in the coming patches. "&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Some input from the necromancer community includes adding additional modifiers to our demiplane class item. &lt;BR&gt;-Spellshielding&lt;BR&gt;-Shielding&lt;BR&gt;-Dot Shielding&lt;BR&gt;-Stun Resist&lt;BR&gt;-Regen/FT&lt;BR&gt;All the above modifiers are getting rarer and rarer, and unless they are added to more armor, it will be incredibly hard for necromancers to keep maxed at one or multiple mods.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Additionally, changing the mod from evocation (which caps at 100 for 99.9% necros) to either alteration or conjuration would be helpful, as this is where almost all our spells come from.&amp;nbsp; Adding a modifer such as ID IV would also help bring the item more on par with other items in the zone.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Thx!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Week of June 12, 2006&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Apokalyps wrote:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Why was the necromancer oow tier 1 and teir 2 clickies changed in the June 13 patch?&amp;nbsp; The clicky used to last 60 secs, now it lasts 18 and 36 secs respectively.&amp;nbsp; To say the community is up in arms over this 2 year old content nerf would be a severe understatement at best.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;In this form the clicky is mitigated severely and many folks who over the course of years have paid top notch amount of DKP for a misrepresented item.&amp;nbsp; EQ players are entitled to continuity of content and knowing the items they loot aren't subject to revision two years and many expansions after the fact.&lt;BR&gt;Message Edited by Apokalyps on 06-14-2006 03:23 PM&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(Rashere) The change was intentional to bring the necro clickes to some semblance of balance with the other OOW clickies.&amp;nbsp; It's still far more powerful than the other ones, but not quite to the degree it was before.&amp;nbsp; It's not changing back.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Week of May 29, 2006&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;QUESTION:&lt;BR&gt;Apokalyps wrote:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Is it possible for necromancers to get channeling mastery as we damage nearly as much as enchanters do?&lt;BR&gt;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;ANSWER:&lt;BR&gt;Channeling Mastery is mainly a tank ability to help them cast their spells while in combat.&amp;nbsp; It was offered to Enchanters as well because they often find themselves under attack, moreso than other intelligence casters.&amp;nbsp; It's not something we are planning to offer Necromancers, Magicians, or Wizards.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Question week May 15, 2006&lt;BR&gt;-PoR spell inquiry re-submitted&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Question week May 8, 2006&lt;BR&gt;-Willful Death AA inquiry re-submitted&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Question week May 1, 2006&lt;BR&gt;Necromancer question:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Can Willful Death receive adjustment to become a viable pulling and survival ability?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Willful Death only works at a maximum of 25% of the time, and when it fails, it is difficult to ascertain and usually the result is death.&amp;nbsp; Increasing the ability so that on a resisted spell it works 100% of the time would make it reliable and effective, and help Necromancers pick up the pulling slack when other classes are not available.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Increasing this ability some degree of reliability would not be unbalancing, yet would promote fairness.&amp;nbsp; Monks have a 100% chance to FD though a spell, if resisted, and a 50% chance if not. Bards have fade. Shadowknight’s- the Necromancers hybrid- have a heightened ability to survive due to their higher mitigation, AC, and HP.&amp;nbsp; Over time Necromancers have received little to no help in modifying their pulling ability, but modification of this ability could help in that regard.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Thx!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Since I received a message after posting from Kytherea in the question thread saying that aa's won't be seeing an answer for a while, I submitted an alternate question:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Q (Prathun): Spell damage upgrades are essential in each expansion in order to keep Necromancers in line damage wise.&amp;nbsp; Considering the only dps upgrade of the expansion was a trap spell which is at best one of the lowest damaging dots we've got in years, while having a plethora of CC and no ability to see the functioning of it from the players perspective;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Is it possible for either:&lt;BR&gt;1) Changing our trap spell to an aura that increases % damage for the group of all dots run (set 20% or so), as per discussion with Rytan during beta?&amp;nbsp; Or perhaps removing our aura spell all together for a pure damaging spell, like a low resist prismatic or chromatic dot with decent efficiency.&lt;BR&gt;2) Increasing the Mind Flay upgrade from 15mana/tick to something higher/tick or with a lower resist (either magic or poison instead of disease like MW was)&lt;BR&gt;3) Increasing the new lich from 7mana/tick to 15mana/tick being that its function and the duration between expansions merits a full upgrade and not an ancient?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;In any case, there is ample discussion on beta spell boards, eqnecro.net, eqlive (necrotomb), and necrotalk.com regarding the type of spells necromancers would like to see replace the current form.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Thank you very much!&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>Necro pet procs</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=necromancerbalance&amp;message.id=3274#M3274</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Since they gave us the ability to see our pet spell damages, I noticed something disturbing on the Lost Soul pet.&amp;nbsp; I can see every non-melee dmg that my pet does to the mob including weapon procs (13-ish dps with 2 Burning Shanks) and the DS he has on if someone casts it on him.&amp;nbsp; However, I do not see any damage from the lifetap procs.&amp;nbsp; In the same time frame that he proc'd 2 Burning Shanks 80 times, he proc'd a spell that gives the message "Jenaner staggers" 157 times.&amp;nbsp; I am under the impression that "soandso staggers" is for taps and nothing else.&amp;nbsp; If I'm not seeing any lifetap damage messages, just what proc is he proc'ing that causes them to stagger and even if it's not a tap, what is the proc?&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>Hope you are all happy necros got nerfed</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=necromancerbalance&amp;message.id=3267#M3267</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I dont know what happened but snare agro kiteing in nest like I always do, there is nothing new.&amp;nbsp; So I pull the mob, snare it, and cast my usual line up to get firm agro Dread Prye, and 2 other DoTs which keeps HoTT.&amp;nbsp; Now my friend bard which is usually around runs in as usual and do some dmg and bam he gets instant agro.&amp;nbsp; He fades x2 maybe it was a bug and he still has HoTT.&amp;nbsp; Then I send in my pet bam it gets HoTT, even FD and the drake is still trying to find him.&amp;nbsp; Then Cleric does her shield epic bam she gets agro. then shammy which is a lower level 65 lost some hps from the shield and drake kills him.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So confused, try it again, so far each mob I have like 1/2 agro.&amp;nbsp; I need to cast x2 more dots now then I used to just to keep HoTT and not get my pet muched.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So once again thanks for the patch, I'm so sick and tired of no play testing and nerfing.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <title>Class Issue List dead?</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=necromancerbalance&amp;message.id=3167#M3167</link>
      <description>So, is this about how it works now?&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
1) The class top 10 issue list is dead (not like it's seen all that much action in months anywyas).&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
2) The class rep (correspondent if you will) gets questions from the class.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
3) The class rep gives 2 questions weekly to Kyth.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
4) Kyth forwards the questions to devs.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
5) Devs may or may not reply to Kyth.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
6) Kyth forwards replies, when they exist, to class reps.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
7) Class reps inform the masses that:&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&amp;nbsp; a) Things are working as intended.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&amp;nbsp; b) Not at this time.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&amp;nbsp; c) Do not have a timeframe.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&amp;nbsp; d) [insert sarcastic response here :)]&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
That seems to be something of a convoluted game of telephone, but hey&#xD;
if it works that's all I really care about.&amp;nbsp; Speaking of working,&#xD;
I have yet to see any questions answered for our class.&amp;nbsp; That&#xD;
means our rep isn't asking, Kyth isn't forwarding, dev's aren't&#xD;
replying, Kyth isn't forwarding replies, our class rep isn't replying&#xD;
to us, of I have just missed them and if so mea culpa.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
I've heard that many class' top 10 list were peppered with 'gimmee' items that were not going to be considered.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
It makes one wonder which of our items were not up for consideration, and even better why not.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Having that answered may have gone a long way to getting a more&#xD;
reasonable (from the dev's perspective) top 10 list, and may have&#xD;
allowed the list to remain more of a functional working animal for&#xD;
positive in game change.&amp;nbsp; What's done is done though, so now&#xD;
knowing will only help us articulate weekly questions that have a&#xD;
chance of being replied to.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
By the way, what questions have been submitted each week for our class?&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
The mage class board indicated that not all reps have submitted questions (May 12th), hope that wasn't us:&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
