    <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;That's depressing. I feel it to now be my duty to go free more of my fellow druids and their ranger kin from their torment.</description>

      <title>What's an Elysian</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Lore&amp;message.id=9449#M9449</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;Does anyone have any lore about what the Elysians were? The structures in the trees don't seem to be akevan or any other race currently known to have the ability to build on luclin, the ruined homes near them seem generic for luclin and they could be vah shir or combine. Also given the generic structure, and that many races build in that style, they could be Elysian. We also know they drop druid items.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Since we know the akeva were not xenophobs untill their leader's shadow took over, it's possable they lived in piece in UP untill they got caught in the crossfire of the akevan war. Or they could have predated the akevans,  or come in after the war. If after then how long has it been since the akevan war, and was the vah shir war against the akevan after the civil war? I asume after. They could have been an akevan sect, or slaves. The quest for Elysian skulls from the dead vah shir seems more like putting torremented spirits to rest than a call for revenge upon the Elysian, this leads me to asume they had contact at some point with the vah shir, but I could be wrong and he could have just noticed that they were good souls that just needed to be freed, or he might just pitty them since he knows the torment of staying behind in death. They could be a group of elves that broke off from the combine groups to make their own little city on luclin and just picked the wrong place to set up in.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;They must have been some sort of Greek Mythology scholars that were so obsessed in there studies that when they became undead (since that happens all the time, of course) they thought they were in the Elysian Fields~&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;They apear to have been human (druid?) allies of the original Vah'Shir king Vah Kerrath, at least he likes you when you release the remains and hand him the skulls to prove you did it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was some sort of battle in the Umbral plains between the Vah'shir and the Akhevans .. what started the war is unknown, but the Vah'shir and thier allies lost badly it seems with the king ending up bound there as an undead apperition. He was originaly ment to be part of the Key to Vex Thal quest (think he still says only wearers of his amulet can pass through the barriers guarding the Ahkevan city) but it was either badly broken or with the personal changes at SoE at the time all the notes for the original quest were lost and they decided to start over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;They were from Sanctus Seru.  If you search in this forum for &amp;quot;The History of Luclin&amp;quot; you can read about it.  &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Lore&amp;message.id=6220&amp;query.id=68033#M6220"&gt;http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Lore&amp;amp;message.id=6220&amp;amp;query.id=68033#M6220&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;They were scouts from Seru when he wanted to take over the moon. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;quot;For the most part, the Maiden’s Eye and the Umbral Plains were only inhabited by the shades of the Akhevans who had fallen in the war, along with the tormented souls of the mortals from Seru, who became known as the Elysians.&amp;quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The Vah Shir did come but that was after Seru.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;quot;Vah Kerrath was struck down in battle, along with the other great heroes; very few made it back to Shar Vahl alive. The spirits were able to contain the Akhevans, and drive them back into the city once again, but the losses of the Vah Shir had been great. As she had done with the Elysians, Aten Ha Ra caused the spirits of the fallen to be darkened, and kept to wander the plains in torment. Vah Kerrath himself was among these, but the spirits came to his aid and protected him. To this day, they say, his remains sit in the plains, pleading for freedom.&amp;quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Pretty much, yeah.  They were a benevolent clan of human druids and rangers who helped scout out Luclin for the Combine remnants (namely Seru, apparently).  They settled briefly in the Maiden's Eye, but were soon found by the Akheva of Vex Thal, killed to the last man, and raised as tormented undead.  According to the EQRPG sourcebook &lt;em&gt;Monsters of Luclin,&lt;/em&gt; they still maintain a semblance of humanity, and only attack others when they perceive a threat from them.  However, several Elysian undead have been corrupted by the long years of torment suffered in their undead state, and now attack any living thing they encounter.</description>
