				I've seen some commentary about people wanting a new 'BattleMage' type
class or some changes to exsisting classes such as tracking for
Beastlords and evil Rangers. My favorite one is new races for the Monk
class.<br>
<br>
I really like the idea of Vah Shir Monks, they can already be Beastlords and Shamans why not the rest of the trio?<br>
And what about Froglok Monks? If for no other reason than open flipper combat!<br>
C'mon! Cat claws to the head, Sneak, Safe Fall, Feign Death!?! My cat does this at home!!<br>
A forward flipper-kick and a wet fish sounding .wav for the open hand frogslap?! How can you not want that!<br>
Humor aside the Vah Shir make more sense as a Monk than the Iksar, just look at the inherent abilities.<br>
Vah Shir, Sneak and Safe Fall. These are Monk skills.<br>
Iksar, Forage. I'm not seeing the Monkly connection.<br>
<br>
Frogs would just be Monks for comic relief,&nbsp; Feign Death could be renamed 'RoadKill'.<br>
<br>
<br>
On the Battle/Magi concept what about a Bezerker/Wizard hybrid?<br>

Limit them to 2HB/2HP and chain armour.<br>

Plate class would be too strong as would a Mage hybrid with all the
pets and nukes. But a chain class DPS that could drop an occasional
medium-large nuke?<br>
<br>
Just some twisted ramblings while bored at work.<br>
