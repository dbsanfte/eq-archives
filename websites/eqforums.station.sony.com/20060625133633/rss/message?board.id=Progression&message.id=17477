&lt;DIV&gt;I would treat fear and hate just like Veeshans Peak for the first few raids, farm alternate sets of gear or become a tradeskiller and make some banded ect. Dont take your fbss and best weapons into&amp;nbsp;fear then complain to gms for hours till they despawn zone for you...&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;FYI the scarelings are the most dangerous thing at the zone in of fear, reminds me to ask about berz epic mob...&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Anyway, if you see scarelings get them dead or mezzed very fast. They will port you all over the zone causing a giant train, then Fright and Dread will begin death touching every few seconds randomly. Whatever you do, dont touch Cazic Thule or he will summon everything to him as pets. Then hes pretty much unkillable till server reset.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>I remember doing Chardok royalty when my guild was all level 65, or mostly anyway, and wearing mostly Velious raid armor.&amp;nbsp; It wasn't easy.&amp;nbsp; And yet, it was one of my favorite raids for the first few tries.&amp;nbsp; After we had succeeded a couple of times, it became tedious going back to get more epics.&amp;nbsp; Sky was just plain a pain in the ass moving from one island to another.&amp;nbsp; Other than that, not too bad, but too many time-sink blocks to make it really fun.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Still, I doubt I'll bother doing all that again on this server.&amp;nbsp; I'm just here to see the train wreck happen. ;)&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Just goes to show that one's man "trash" is another man's "treasure". I am looking forward to doing all those things on your list, having met some&amp;nbsp;great players&amp;nbsp;on those events. The first planar raids pre kunark were some of the best&amp;nbsp;EQ times I've had. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Although I'll most likely be guilded, I'm also kinda hoping there will be a revival of the old open planar raids happening. Those raids&amp;nbsp;can take the credit for&amp;nbsp;forming the server communities more than almost&amp;nbsp;anything else.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Hate was my favorite guild raid until we started&amp;nbsp;killing king dain. Then later on Emp ssra was fun stuff. But all the targets in between you got to experience at least&amp;nbsp;once. Or its a waste of money buying the expansions...&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Personally I&amp;nbsp;don't mind the crap graphics of the oldest&amp;nbsp;areas. That was never the draw of the game for me. The disparity between old and new might be a problem for some but not for me, I enjoy seeing the old textures. I think at some point they&amp;nbsp;updated every single&amp;nbsp;texture in the game to be a higher&amp;nbsp;resolution. This was after Velious I think,&amp;nbsp;and for&amp;nbsp;a while I think that texture pack was optional.&amp;nbsp;So even the 'old' textures you see in the game&amp;nbsp;are not the originals.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Anyone know if it's still possible to see those original textures, simply for nostalgia's sake?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I logged in and ran around Ak'anon earlier today and it's still as cool as I remember it.&amp;nbsp;The only key element that's missing is other player-gnomes running around. It's simply geometry if there's noone else there interacting with the city.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I disagree with the zones you say 'blow', but that's just personal preference I guess.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The harder I think back to the early days the more I realize just how impossible it will be to play the game the way it was back then.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I just hope the server doesn't suck, and give newer players completely the wrong impression of why we look so fondly back to the old days. It would really suck to see people post " I told you so... it's just nostalgia, EQ1 is better than EVER !1!!" &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
