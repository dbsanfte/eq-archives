      <title>A few questions - Hell levels, Dain, Progression</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Veterans&amp;message.id=235449#M235449</link>
      <description>1. I've been grinding out 66 and am about 3% from 67.&amp;nbsp; Am I wrong, or&#xD;
was this a "hell level"?&amp;nbsp; I only have my primary toon - Paerien the&#xD;
Ranger on Bristlebane, so I've not gone through to 70 yet.&amp;nbsp; Just&#xD;
curious, how are 67-69?&amp;nbsp; I get (it seems) exactly 6% xp on a Clockwork&#xD;
or Dain MM.&amp;nbsp; Just wondering how the last push is going to be to 70.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
2. No one seems to like to do Dain #2.&amp;nbsp; Well, I shouldn't say "no one",&#xD;
but not many.&amp;nbsp; It seems like I've run across many that like to do #1 or&#xD;
#3 over and over again for XP.&amp;nbsp; Is there a way to make #2 shorter?&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
I've only done it once, but would like to upgrade my aug.&amp;nbsp; But the one&#xD;
time I did it, the strategy was to have a puller run out and grab a mob&#xD;
or two, train them back to the entrance, then we all engage and root&#xD;
like crazy.&amp;nbsp; Rinse and repeat until you work your way to named.&amp;nbsp; So my&#xD;
question is: Is there a better way to do this?&amp;nbsp; Could a fast runner&#xD;
train all the trash leading up to the named to the far end of the&#xD;
zone?&amp;nbsp; I don't even know if those little guys can outrun the giants,&#xD;
but thought it would be cool if they could.&amp;nbsp; Then the remaining five&#xD;
run in and take down the named, the runner dies and (if he got far&#xD;
enough away), loots with everyone else.&amp;nbsp; Or one of the five who looted&#xD;
does the same (trains) so that the first runner can loot?&amp;nbsp; Ignorance is&#xD;
bliss.&amp;nbsp; :)&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
3. Please be gentle on this one - even though I'm VERY close to dinging&#xD;
to 67, I'm still very EQ-Ignorant.&amp;nbsp; :)&amp;nbsp; Can someone explain Progression&#xD;
to me?&amp;nbsp; I know about planes Progression, but have done very little (did&#xD;
the PoJ one and just did a raid and succeeded in PoEarth).&amp;nbsp; But I've&#xD;
only played a total of about 8 months since 2001, and most of it was&#xD;
just grinding.&amp;nbsp; No, I did not buy this toon.&amp;nbsp; ;)&amp;nbsp; I guess my question&#xD;
is more related to DoD progression and PoR progression.&amp;nbsp; It seems DoN&#xD;
is mostly dead, but would like to know more about that too...&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Well, that does it for now.&amp;nbsp; I have lots of dumb questions to ask, but I'll save them for later today.&amp;nbsp; heheh.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Thanks!&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Paerien on Bristlebane&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Dain 2 is pretty easy, though it's easily the longest mission.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;One big key is to only use CH for healing, and when in doubt heal the Dain.&amp;nbsp; That way, you save mana and can keep on moving.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Generally, we have the Dain pull.&amp;nbsp; Make sure you pull them a ways towards the entrance so you have room for them to run without spawning adds.&amp;nbsp; You should get no more than 4 on any pull, which keeps it easy.&amp;nbsp; Kill the ones that don't run first - they're really the only ones that do damage.&amp;nbsp; Make sure everyone assists.&amp;nbsp; After you kill off all the Master scouts in the pull, start in on the runners.&amp;nbsp; Have everyone who can root keep the scout from running - you really don't need healing with only scouts.&amp;nbsp; You should pretty much never have the adds spawn - once we figured out the event we'd get a set once every 3-4 runs (usually when we were down by the named, since you've got less room there.)&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>When i do dain 2, typically I use dain, am the puller and last one in for aggro bonus,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; best way to do it is not sit at zone in(encurages crappy play)&amp;nbsp; but keep moving up and keep it interesting for the rest of the group members(most important imo)&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;They got rid of the "Hell Levels".&amp;nbsp; That is not to say, however, that different levels all require the same amount of experience; far from it.&amp;nbsp; 60 is still basically a "half level" in that it takes about half the experience one would expect to go through.&amp;nbsp; 66, 67, 68, 69, and 70 all require more experience than the level previous to it, and the jump from trying to ding 66 to trying to ding 67 is significant.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;But, they're still not "Hell Levels".&amp;nbsp; Hell Levels were levels where the experience formula changed.&amp;nbsp; Gonna be going off of memory here, about this concept - and no,&amp;nbsp;these numbers are not going to be accurate, they're just for the purposes of explaining the concept.&amp;nbsp; While Hell Levels existed, each level (except the Hell Levels) took 10% more experience than the level preceeding it.&amp;nbsp; If going from Level&amp;nbsp;1 to Level 2 took 1000 Experience Points, then going from level 2 to level 3 took an additional 1100&amp;nbsp;: 1000 + 10% of 1000.&amp;nbsp; Then hitting level 4 took 1210 more experience points.&amp;nbsp; Thats not the total cumulative, that was just what was required to be earned to hit the next level.&amp;nbsp; 1000 to hit level 2, 2100 to hit level 3, 3310 to hit level 4, etc.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Hell levels, on the other hand, represented an increase in the multiplier.&amp;nbsp; If level 4 was a hell level, then the multiplier would have gone from 10% to 20%.&amp;nbsp; Unfortunately, something in the calculation extended that multiplier increase on down.&amp;nbsp; So while it took 1000 experience points to go from level 1 to 2, and then 1210 to go from level 2 to level 3, going to level 4 would have required you to have obtained a total of 4368 experience points, a far cry from the 2100 total it took to hit level 3.&amp;nbsp; 4368 came from saying 1000 to go from level 1 to level 2, 1200 to go from level 2 to level 3, 1440 to go from level 3 to level 4, using 1.2 as the multiplier instead of 1.1 that was used in previous levels.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Hell levels started at level 35, IIRC ... and were every 5th level until level 50, at which point every level in the 50's was technically a hell level because the multiplier went up each time - with 54 and 59 being far worse.&amp;nbsp; My guess is the multiplier went up by more in those two levels than in the rest.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;They have long since smoothed out those hell levels, though as I stated above, 60 is still a very short level.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Kick/bash break root much faster. Ban it and you will see much better results with root.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;for the Dains - 2 seems to take the longest and is the most pita to do.&amp;nbsp; its not difficult just a pain to chain root or chase down the giants.&amp;nbsp; I've done it with as little as 3 people, no problems just takes time.&amp;nbsp; for a better strat..not sure there is one. the only thing I can think of is once you get the 10 master's killed, you might be able to run a toon to pull all but named to other side of zone and have a 2nd puller to pull the named, bu that won't get you out of killing many mobs as you have to kill a good portion of them to get to the 10.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;on the other hand, dain 1 is fast, completed with 3 within the 45 min timer and dain 3 is easy plus you can take a few minute break between eacy wave.&amp;nbsp; I've done 3 with 3 people as well.&amp;nbsp; So i think its the annoyance or length of #2 that causes people to not like it.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#cc33cc&gt;There is the Term "progression server" thrown around alot currently, in reference to the new server named The Combines.&amp;nbsp; They don't mean the&amp;nbsp;same thing, so don't get those terms mixed up.&amp;nbsp; What you are referring to is game progression, not server progression.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#cc33cc&gt;The basic idea of game progression is that you have to successfully complete something in the game in order to advance to the next "thing".&amp;nbsp; Most commonly this is successive quests to obtain keys or flags to let you into higher level zones.&amp;nbsp; Each expansion has its own progression track.&amp;nbsp; For example, you have PoP progression, GoD progression, DoN progression, etc.&amp;nbsp; Usually, these progressions end with you gaining access to some high level zone for hunting or raiding.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#cc33cc&gt;The best example of "progression" was the Plane of Time access, in the PoP expansion.&amp;nbsp; Think of this progression like a pyramid.&amp;nbsp; This particular progression was confusing but just as an example, imagine that you have to complete 4 different raids in low level PoP zones in order to zone into each of the four elemental zones.&amp;nbsp; So, you win 16 raids in order to have access to all 4 elemental planes.&amp;nbsp; Then you complete raids in each of these elemental planes to get access to Plane of Time.&amp;nbsp; (This progrssion is WAY more complex and it takes more than 20 raids, but I'm just explaining the &lt;U&gt;concept&lt;/U&gt; of progression with a pseudo-example).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#cc33cc&gt;Progression usually requires raiding but there is some group-level progression as well (most notably, many &amp;nbsp;parts of the DoN progression sequence and the early GoD sequences, MPG/OOW trial sequences, etc.).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#cc33cc&gt;If you look at &lt;A href="http://crucible.samanna.net/index.php" target=_blank&gt;Samanna's&lt;/A&gt; website, under "Info for Everybody" --&amp;gt; "Progression", you will find some nice examples of the latest expanions' sequences.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#cc33cc&gt;Hope this helps&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#cc33cc&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;

One thing to note, however, which can save you:&amp;nbsp; Dain can zone out&#xD;
(returning to Icewell Keep) to clear his aggro and then use the key&#xD;
phrase to zone back in within two minutes, so staying near the zone&#xD;
line is helpful for him.&amp;nbsp; The runners are ridiculous and we always&#xD;
get a swarm of mobs at the beginning.&amp;nbsp; Then pulling long distances&#xD;
is just not fun.&amp;nbsp; Most people describe this one as simply&#xD;
tedious.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I would suggest they let the mobs turn at 40%&#xD;
instead of 80% and run at 20% instead of 50%.&amp;nbsp; Then to&#xD;
counterbalance that, increase the number you need from 10 to 15.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

Daring Raid (Dain 2) more than the other 2. I've played through all 3&#xD;
on live servers with a variety of groups. I think the frantic pace of&#xD;
the mission is fun - even as the designer of the mission there are edge&#xD;
of my seat moments when I play through the mission on my play account.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
After reading this I took another look at the scripts and examined the&#xD;
Scouts in game. They currently run at 60% health, not 80%. It was at&#xD;
80% during Beta for a time but players testing it gave me feedback that&#xD;
it was too harsh. I lowered it to 40% and they they said it was too&#xD;
easy. We split the difference and it seemed to work out well.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
They definatley run at 60% but they may appear to run earlier due to&#xD;
latency but I set them to 61% health and they didn't move but at 60%&#xD;
they ran just like they were supposed to.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Don't get me wrong Nodyin - I love the Dain monster missions.&amp;nbsp; I think they are the best and most creative monster missions yet.&amp;nbsp; I really enjoy them and the rewards seem appropriate.&amp;nbsp; I agree "fun" is totally subjective.&amp;nbsp; There is no right answer to which is most "fun".&amp;nbsp; That would be like telling someone esle what their favorite color is.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I also enjoy a frenetic encounter.&amp;nbsp; I played an enchanter for the longest time and my idea of a good battle was one marked by total chaos and tons of mobs to handle (as opposed to one smooth pull and a mob that squashes everyone in one hit).&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The complaint I have about Dain2 is just the general "feel" of the encounter.&amp;nbsp; If you are the puller its more interesting, I suppose.&amp;nbsp; The other five dorfs just sit for a long time, while the puller runs a tremendous distance and drags a few mobs back (the same trmendous distance).&amp;nbsp; So, you sit for a long time.&amp;nbsp; Fight a mob who turns away at 80% health.&amp;nbsp; Now you are just trying to hit this mob while it runs away, before it gets close enough to get assist help.&amp;nbsp; Its more of a crap shoot.&amp;nbsp; If you get a couple lucky rounds in the mob dies safely.&amp;nbsp; If you get a couple rounds of misses the mob runs into a crowd and you wipe.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The mobs absolutely turn and walk away at 80%, then at 60% (I thought it was 50) they begin to RUN.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;This encounter isn't about fighting though, because you only fight these mobs 20% then they run away and its like fear kiting.&amp;nbsp; And you have to do that over and over.&amp;nbsp; Most people I talk to don't like this one at all.&amp;nbsp; Most folks I've talked to like Dain1 and love Dain3.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

It is like any other encounters, once learned in detail there are parts of the script that can be used to your advantage.  It is about assisting while controlling the DPS output, determining which mob dies when, along with who actually zones in last.  A cleric zoning in last/completing zoning is last is a bad idea.  Killing everything, or almost everything, does make the run back easier after a death, nevermind the run out at the end.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;HR&gt; Fight a mob who turns away at 80% health.&amp;nbsp; Now you are just trying to hit this mob while it runs away, before it gets close enough to get assist help.&amp;nbsp; Its more of a crap shoot.&amp;nbsp; If you get a couple lucky rounds in the mob dies safely.&amp;nbsp; If you get a couple rounds of misses the mob runs into a crowd and you wipe.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;P&gt;The mobs absolutely turn and walk away at 80%, then at 60% (I thought it was 50) they begin to RUN.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;P&gt;This encounter isn't about fighting though, because you only fight these mobs 20% then they run away and its like fear kiting.&amp;nbsp; And you have to do that over and over.&amp;nbsp; Most people I talk to don't like this one at all.&amp;nbsp; Most folks I've talked to like Dain1 and love Dain3.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(nods)  One running mob can bring back 3-5 defenders.  AFAIK, they do not respawn, or if they do they have a very long respawn timer.  They do not walk/run away and no nasty DPS.  If a 3-boxer can do this event, even with the defenders being pulled, a full group should make even better time.  It was a fun event to figure out.</description>

&lt;P&gt;I lost a Dain 3 mission by having the Dain zone in last and parking him at the general.&amp;nbsp; When the tank died to the last named clearly out of target range, the named summoned the Dain and the giant army promptly destroyed him.&amp;nbsp; Zoning in last to get zone aggro does exist and isn't just in instanced zones.&amp;nbsp; It's used to control who takes the DT in PoSky for one example.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Tis tough for it to die when the evidence says otherwise, that there that might be least a bug that does exist for instanced zones and multiple of mobs in camp. Examples would be the Highpass MM. Even when the last person in is the last to close with the mobs and engage, the untargetted mobs swarm to that person. The same with some of the MPG group trials, particularly the The Mastery of Efficiency trial. One could discount the MPG trials since they have long lockup timers upon a win, but with the MMs and their short lockout timers, it is quite noticeable. It will be even more difficult to sway others away from it, particularly those who spent alot of time in MMs such as Highpass MM on double exp weekends.&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Pretty sure dain 3 is (or was) like this as well...last one to zone in got aggro/summoned 1/2 way across the zone.&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I lost a Dain 3 mission by having the Dain zone in last and parking him at the general.&amp;nbsp; When the tank died to the last named clearly out of target range, the named summoned the Dain and the giant army promptly destroyed him.&amp;nbsp; Zoning in last to get zone aggro does exist and isn't just in instanced zones.&amp;nbsp; It's used to control who takes the DT in PoSky for one example.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Last to zone in zonewide agro happens in Anguish as well, I can confirm.&amp;nbsp; It was rather fun zoning into the instance after a LD near the zone, and being summoned to the area just before Ture before you have really even appeared in the world yet =)&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;I found dain1 and dain2 to be quite easy if time-consuming.&amp;nbsp; I did both with my 3boxed accounts and while&amp;nbsp;dain2 took a long time it wasn't all that difficult.&amp;nbsp; I foudn the named&amp;nbsp;at the end to be much more difficult than dealing with the runners.&amp;nbsp; Dain3 is the one i've only managed to do once, and i sure wish i could find people doing it for xp so i could pick up the aug piece on my other 2 accounts.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;And for last in zone aggro, if you don't believe it exists i would imagine you've never done hatchet ;)&lt;/P&gt;</description>

several of my characters and the giants definately run at 80% on my&#xD;

&lt;p&gt;Z&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;I'm not saying you're wrong, because I've seen it happen, but...&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
On The Rathe I just tried Dain 2. The Scout didn't run until I dropped&#xD;
him to 60% hp. At that point he said his text and ran just like he was&#xD;
supposed to.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
It's a real weird situation. There actually isn't the number "80" in&#xD;
any of the scripts attached to these guys anymore - it's definatley set&#xD;
to 60% or lower.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Overall there may be something odd going on but the mission is still&#xD;
stable and fun (the fun part being my opinion) so I'm not super worried&#xD;
about it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Maybe the code is recognizing 60 as 0 in terms of health then? Which would make the final 20% where a mob tends to run begin at 80%?&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;They &lt;STRONG&gt;turn and walk&lt;/STRONG&gt; at 80% and &lt;STRONG&gt;run&lt;/STRONG&gt; at 60%. If you do not damage them below 60% they will forget about you and just reset.</description>
