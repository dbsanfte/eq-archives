				<DIV>Regardless of whether Gates was a "collossal disaster" or not, the fact is that the playerbase showed with their actions that they arent' willing to do hard single group quests to access content.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This happens to be the case with Tactics as well, which has an amazingly easy alternate quest which people aren't doing.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>That's the reality, what people claim they want, and what they show that they want by their actions are two entirely different things.&nbsp;&nbsp; </DIV>

<DIV>Don't try to make your "accomplishments" to be bigger than they really are.&nbsp; They didn't re-tune GoD because of you, they re-tuned it because it needed to be re-tuned.&nbsp; Big woopidy do.&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I was asking about this at the Fan Faire, and GoD's "failure" came from player stubborness, not out of "too hard content".&nbsp; Everything you asked for was there, and you turned it down.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I mean your entire arguement is completely filled with contradiction.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Using charm pets?&nbsp; Are you insane?&nbsp; Maybe that's the method<EM>&nbsp; you</EM> used, doesn't mean it's the right one.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV>I mean, you're being pretty presumptuous to assume that because you didn't like something it "ruined" anything.&nbsp; The whole backlash of people whining about Planes of Power flags didn't come around until about the GoD era, when people were mad they couldn't finally leech onto the old expansion for no effort.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Nothing was "ruined" with any of these expansions, and your unwillingess to actually take advantage of what was given to you doesn't dictate the success or validity of expansions.</DIV>

				<DIV>The reason I have not done the group access in GoD has nothing to do with an unwillingness to use a hard, group-based alternative.&nbsp; It has to do with the fact that the hard, group-based alternative was designed for characters who already have raid-level access to zones, and thus equipment, that make GoD trials viable.&nbsp; To compare this to planar access, or to claim that such alternatives are available and not used because of this is off the mark.&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The point is, there is NO hard, group-based alternative to accessing the elemental planes, and as of yet, no valid argument why there shouldn't be.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>To their credit, SOE has made it possible to gain equipment to make GoD viable for non-time/elemental geared players with many of the drops in groupable areas in OOW.&nbsp;&nbsp; This has corrected much of the urgency for fixing the flagging/backflagging issue, but it hasn't eliminated the issue.&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>And as to charming in GoD..why is that insane?&nbsp; Nothing crazy about using a pet that quad-taps for 1048 1048 1048 1048.&nbsp; The insane thing is that they allow that.&nbsp; It should be corrected (not in the halfassed way the nerfed it in OOW but in a well-thought out way) but it's a very valid way to go through these zones if you know what you're doing.</DIV>

The point is, there is NO hard, group-based alternative to accessing the elemental planes, and as of yet, no valid argument why there shouldn't be.

<P>Nor has there been a single valid reason why there should be single group access to raid zones.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>And I'm referring to having charm pets tank.&nbsp; It's ridiculous.&nbsp; I don't even really use charm pets, because while the DPS is insane, I do enough myself that the pet is more of a risk than a bonus.&nbsp; Last thing I want is to be fighting Jhiru and the charm breaks, chanter isn't paying attention and gets hosed, and then a pooka pumping out 1k+ DPS is going at my healer.</P>

<DIV>I was thinking about a possible alternative to the flagging solution. While the current solution solves some of the large guild issues, it ignores a&nbsp;many individuals who have gotten their flags through pickup raids. These individuals have worked just as hard getting their flags as anyone else, and as far as I can tell this solution does nothing to help them.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>First let me say, that I have for a long time, thought the whole flagging system was inequitable and a horrible idea. Unfortunately however, they are here to stay. Way too many people have spent way too many months getting flagged to just be told that all their efforts were in vain and were not required.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The current solution seems reasonable. However, people who have never gone through planar progression should not get a free ride. There should be semi-substantial&nbsp;soloable or groupable quest&nbsp; required in addition to the item, to get the flags. Giving&nbsp;them to people for free would be a slap in the face to everyone who worked though planar progression through pickups.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>So how do you compensate the people who have gotten their flags through pickups?&nbsp;One way to accomplish this is to make flags account based instead of character based. That would allow all of someone's alts to be, in a sense, backflagged.&nbsp;There are many benefits to this approach for both guild raiders and pickup raiders. Unfortunately, it does not address multi-boxers, but I am not sure how to do this without creating an exploitive situation.<BR></DIV><BR>
<HR>
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<DIV></DIV>
<P>It has probably been mentioned before but i can't be bothered reading all the posts.</P>
<P>The <EM>reward</EM> is for doing all the planar progression is that you get a rather nice charm slot item. The folks that only do the backflag don't get any of the charm increases. The only <EM>reward</EM> for doing the back flag loot is that you can now get into PoFire/PoW/PoE/PoS without a raid.</P>
<P>It is quite literally a backflag - not a method for guilds to "leapfrog" the progression, unless some other guild deliberatly invites them along to loot.</P>
