      <description>I'm done.  7 years, and I'm finally going to read the credits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sony has butchered PvP to the point it is freaking pointless to hang around.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Caster PvP ( neglecting necro's ) is a joke.&lt;br&gt;PvE is being totally screwed too, EQ is making it's last few laps around the toilet bowl before it's gone.&lt;br&gt;Sony is putting out ANOTHER expansion, but won't fix the 1,000 problems they already have.  I mean nothing like putting out another expansion to add MORE problems to the infinite list of crap they can't figure out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sony pull your heads out of....  well... Stop being gluttons, and provide QUALITY gaming, and you might get out of this with something left over.  Living off the fumes of what Varent had going isn't doing you justice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;EQ is dying, and Sony is trying to squeeze the last penny out now. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For those of you I fought on the battle field, GL to all of you with whatever you do in life, but this is my stop.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;casters are dispatched first because they are the easiest to remove, and if left alone can pose a HUGE problem. If you leave that chanter alive you can expect to be mashing your instaclicks instead of doing damage, wizard nukes still land fairly reasonably, necroes can still do some good damage if left alone and mages can put items on your cursor! In general, melees have around twice the AC of casters, and between 40% and 50% more HP than a comparably geared caster meaning that picking on the casters is going to drain the healers far faster than the melees. We can assume that resists are fairly even across the board, so a nuke is going to land on a warrior as well as it would on a mage (disregarding spell shielding) whereas a melee swing is going to hit a caster for nearly twice as much and twice as often as it would on a melee. This, combined with the lower HP on casters, means that they're easily 5-6 times easier to kill by using brute force, once again this is highly gear dependant as an anguish geared mage is going to be slaughtered by an anguish geared warrior whereas a VT geared mage might in fact be a reasonable fight to a VT geared warrior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NOTE: I chose mage and warrior because neither have any healing abilities short of healing potions and would represent the best &amp;quot;mano en mano&amp;quot; display of PvP damage&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Actually we kill casters because if left alone,they are as deadly as a rogue backstabing you.Enchanters are a huge thorn in 1vs 1,group pvp,and mass pvp.A necro can and will kill about anyone if he gets to stand there tapping and dotting.Mages have nuked me fairly common for 3k.And last ,wizards,telekara is still very powerful and I was nuked by etherflame just this week by nukalavee for just over 6K.Its true these classes die quicker and this may be why some people attack them but for me its the issue of if I dont take them out first,I will die.My berserker is Ungrum and I have very high resists,just over 500 in all with resist click mask.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Nukes were modified a while back to land more often, making Mages and Wizards balanced.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There was nothing put in for dots landing, so the rest of the casters are still screwed, other then necros who at least get a 40% killshot AA called Lifeburn.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;for the love of god quit your whining......Zek is supposed to be the premier pvp server and yet all i see is complaints about class balance when it has actually been balanced fairly well.  There is always going to be someone better than you so please quit trying to /complain until you get your way and their is a patch in your favor.  Main thing i see whining is the casters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ummm hello you die quickly in pvp because:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1) you're really bad at pvp&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2) casters are overpowered if anything in pvp so yeah...everyone typically tries to take you out first.  Why leave up a chanter that can neutralize your assistance or a necro that can stack dots on you.  If you've ever actually pvp'd either of these classes 1 on 1 you'll notice that they are extremely capable of pvp and can slaughter you no prob. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know enchanters on blue servers than can take out an extremely well geared 2.0 monk and your telling me that they &amp;quot;need to be fixed&amp;quot;  revise your strategy and try again sir because pvp just isn't for you if you think so.  And as far as necro's go you have been and always will be among the top pvp classes.  And why do they need to give anything more to the top soloing class in the game.  If by now you can't pvp well then there's just nothing left that soe can do for you. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I agree about caster PvP sucking.It really always has. The only things casters really have going for them is root-nuke, root-DoT type strategies, and since everyone maxes MR first, roots don't stick anymore and they also have raid type numbers on all their other resists, so the DoTs and nukes don't work half the time either. Before bazaar, it was really hard for players to get their resists up to the point where they became untouchable. Enchanters were the hardest hit of all though. The one thing that Enchanters do best, mind control, doesn't work at all in PvP. Fear, charm, mezz, etc are an Enchanters livelihood. Tell Necros and Shammies that they aren't allowed to use DoTs in PvP and see what happens. Tell Wizards and Mages that nuking is verboten, and there will be rioting in the streets of Qeynos. The Enchanter class is pretty much useless in PvP and doomed to slaughter since all their class defining spells are worthless and all their other offensive magiks are negated by everyone elses super silly resists. What does leave enchanters? Meleeing with daggers?</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I can mez three as well, rapture, ancient rapture and Stasis, but that's discounting their group members waking them up. This thread is about caster survivability, lets look at some numbers.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;A warrior with a Greatsword of Mortification and damage aug from Tunat can crit for 1400 or so. With flurry AAs, that warrior can hit a character up to 6 times in one round. If the warrior is Berzerk (below 40% life) then all crits do nearly double damage. By using the Mighty Strike Discipline that same warrior can deliver 6 crippling blows in one round for nearly 3K each, even though that's nearly impossible I've seen multiple max crippling blows in a single round which drop casters in a second or two, and if they survive the first round, they're most likely stunned and awaiting the next volley.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
