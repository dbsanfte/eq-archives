&lt;P&gt;EQ is good! :D&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The different graphics you see in newer zones are a result of a new graphics engine we introduced awhile back and the new terrain editor we are using. We are slowly revamping older zones to update their look and playability, but many original zones remain.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>Ok, never been an EQ player, but I am an avid MMO player.  Literally, Ive played almost every one BUT EQ, even tried EQ II, but WoW was just too good.  Heres my question.  Did the graphics in EQ get better or something?  because they look pretty dang good compared to what i saw earlier.  Also, what makes EQ 1 better than 2, and why is EQ just SO great.  I dont understand.  Thanks&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The first time I ever played EQ was early 2001 when the original game was all there was. The &amp;quot;buzz&amp;quot; concerning the first expansion was just beginning when I quit for personal reasons. Even then, I believe EQ was ahead of its time.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The major advantage to EQ is longevity. There have been 10 expansions (soon to be 11) and plenty of update patches. From what I've read, there are about 400,000 EQ players spread across 24 servers. The game has so much depth and so many different things to do, places to go, and different ways to play, that it is impossible to imagine any other online persistent world game will ever be able to come close to it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Whether or not you will find it &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; or not is up to you. You can play the trial demo for free.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The depth of EQ and the amount of content and quests really is quite awesome.  I do believe many of the old quests need to be revamped, as the reward for them for the effort can easily be better'd by something you can buy in bazaar for a few plat nowadays.  But still, if its doing the quest for the sake of questing, EQ certainly has enough of them.  As for graphics, they have been getting better and better, but considering the state of hardware and graphics capability provided by today's computers (and we are not necessarily talking state of the art hardware) the EQ graphics engine could use another upgrade.   I am currently testing beta software of other MMORPG games (wont mention here, NDA) and these are showing unbelievable graphic detail and quality (even full shadows!) with no or very very little video lag.  Even at full graphics capability, still very playable and just blow EQ graphics away.  Turning on shadows, even just enough to see the shadow only for the person standing next to you, should not bring my computer to its knees.  I know this for a fact after playing these others on my hardware.  I cant turn all the luclin full models on without a lot of lag in EQ. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just saying they could do so much more with the graphics, but still give them an 'A' for effort and kudos for the revamps.  For just playability, yeah even after 7 years (started soon as EQ was originally released) EQ definitely has a lot of replayability.  I get tired of this character (I prefer to devote my attention to one main character at a time) I'll just make another race/class and start over!  =) &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tanthulus, you're my hero. All valid points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm kind of contrary to the norm, as I've defected *from* WoW to Everquest. I made the switch last week, and I have to say EQ is shaping up to be incredibly immersive for me. I started playing last friday night, averaging about 30 minutes a day. While it's not as 'polished' as WoW, it also doesn't have many of WoW's problems... specifically, it's community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, I just got through the tutorial. I'm level 10, I'm a human warrior, I'm about as 'newb' as you can get. The only way I found my way around PoK to do the tutorial quests was with CTRL+F. But more importantly, last night I entered my first true zone, Greater Faydark. The thing about that zone is that there's this city... a city in the trees. How do you get up there? A lift. How do you control a lift? Well... I had no idea really. I ask in OOC, and I got &lt;b&gt;three&lt;/b&gt; tells immediately, all of them telling me exactly how to go about it. By comparison, in World of Warcraft, if I had asked &amp;quot;How do I use the griffon master?&amp;quot; in general chat, the replies would have been something like &amp;quot;Omg you nubbles gt*o of this sservar&amp;quot;. That's about all the conversion factors you need to convert to EQ - the respectable people behind it's success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My toon on Stromm - Sanridil, 10 Human Warrior&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;depends what you like, if you like medieval characters pick EQ, if you like alienic characters pick WOW or SWG. I like EQ because it has MANY classes and races like medieval times, people ride on horses and drogs.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;EQ IMHO is still by far the best of it's CLASS in the gaming world...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WoW was a very fun game, but the interest in WoW is a very short lived...The artwork in WoW is really done very well...Anyone who tells you it is just cartoony, probably never actually tried the game for any length of time...other pluses for WoW was very well done even comical emotes...and a good underlying sense of humor on item drop ect...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EQ2 was a HUGE disappointment...and do not over read into that...EQ2 has some innovative ideas...like Guild XP bar...I would have prefered a different way of grinding XP for the guild, and I have heard it already changed....but had it been more like AA in EQ1 where you let the player decide how much of their XP they are will to sacrifice to another XP bar it would have been an awesome concept...The biggest problem with EQ2 to me, was the radical changes to the core classes...and the way the core engine handled combat...They really took the whole strategy of combat and through it out the window...I have heard many EQ2 fanboys say that WoW is EQ2 for dummies...and it is really FAR from the truth...EQ2 is more like EQ1 for dummies...and WoW is just a different style of game...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I guess if you are looking for a solid answer to which is the best of these three, I would hands down pick EQ1 over WoW or EQ2, I would also take WoW handsdown over EQ2...but that is an OPINION...not the holy grail of whats what with MMO's...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you really think you will enjoy the concept of PvP I would suggest WoW...I honestly think the only saving grace WoW has is it caters to the crowd that enjoys PvP...if you do not like the concept of PvP I would save my money on WoW and go into EQ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Personally I would avoid EQ2...it really does not deserve to carry the name Everquest....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I will compliment EQ2 in ONE WAY...having played both, I am starting to see alot more of the EQ2 technology funneling down to the original EQ...and most of them have been nice and welcomed additions...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Did you know only subscribed EQ players can even post here? This is like walking into your local pizzeria, and asking the people eating if they enjoy eating there. Apparently, they do, or they wouldn't be there. Don't ya think?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But I will try to be as objective as I can.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is EQ good? Sure. Its the best out there, imo. Is that saying a lot? No. I've played every MMO, too. They lack substance and a feeling of accomplishment. That is about the only think that keeps me coming back. EQ2 lacks a lot of things. Its too easy, no one groups, I didn't enjoy the elitist attitude they have, its basically a WoW clone, the classes are not fun, they've employed a bait and switch tactic on Adv packs, etc. I get they feeling they only care about stealing my cash instead of making a great game to earn my money.

For $99 a year, we have limitless hours of entertainment, numerous updates, at least 2 expansions per year, enough adventures to keep even the most dedicated adventurer busy. Notable as of 2005 and into 2006 is the best developer communication to the player base in years. EQ management and developers have focused once again on responding to the players suggestions, frustrations and ideas. You can truly see that they listen and are responsive......aAnd no they won't give every class whatever they want cause it would break the game. :smileysurprised:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;The different graphics you see in newer zones are a result of a new graphics engine we introduced awhile back and the new terrain editor we are using. We are slowly revamping older zones to update their look and playability, but many original zones remain.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;EQ is a great game. What other game has the addictive properties that EQ has? How many people have quit, and continue to quit but always get drawn back into the game?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think that the graphics have made a real improvement with each expansion that has been released. I have noticed that graphicwise EQ is leaning more and more towards EQ2. I am very impressed with the graphics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The game play is great too. Overall I think that EQ is and will continue to be a great game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Kawarimono&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Is Everquest good? ....&amp;quot;To be or not to be that is the question...whether it is nobler to suffer..&amp;quot; Loading...Please Wait...(LOL had to put that in there) A question debated by many scholars and philosophers of many races and classes....everquest....well..to be honest...is like  a book to me..when I sit down to read a book, I read it to get immersed in the main character...to become a part of that world, and EQ does that same thing for me.  I live in a house with a WoW player *mumbles* who used to be an EQ player, I ask him what makes WoW so much better than everquest..and he tells me that its soo much easier to get money and levels....(Obviously he was a player who only cared about the game being EASY) If everquest was easy and it didn't immerse me..I wouldn't play it...I stopped playing for 1 year and just had to come back.. Once again I'm running around POK looking for words to research my spells and working on my Pallies Ghoulbane......Everquest is good because it requires imagination and immersion....if you dont like to get immersed..its not for you...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Axlexander Boneweaver 34 Necromancer Cazic Thule(Brell) Dark Elf&lt;br&gt;Sironn Underbank 47 Paladin Cazic Thule(Brell) Halfling&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;EQ is good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just don't hold your breathe for new character models with more variety in armor.  At one point in Velious, we had 3 types of plate, 3 types of chain, and 2/3 type of leather.  Even though they were just different textures only, it allowed for a huge range of combination of character variations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when we moved to Luclin, we are back to 1 type of each armor type again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later we get to use armor dye for more personalization, but that in turn diluted the unique color available certain UBAH armor set (Absor will probably agree here).  Wheres before armor dye people know by the color of someone's armor pieces that the person has a full suit of elemental armor, now no one can tell what armor someone is really wearing unless you do an /inspect.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does a one legged duck swim in circles?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is a frog's a*s watertight? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does a teddy bear have cotton balls? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Really, it's all subjective but here's my experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EQ is the granddaddy of graphical MMO's.  You are here so you at least generally know how the game works.  We have specific Classes and Races, chosen at character creation, that we advance in levels and capabilities as we adventure through Norrath.  We can learn many tradeskills that we can use to turn raw materials we find on our adventures into useful items such as Armor, Weapons and all sorts of gadgets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In EQ2, you have a radically changed Norrath where the Good side lives in Qeynos and the Evil side lives in Freeport - but there is no ongoing battle between these factions - it feels like a storyline that was just left hanging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In EQ2, once you start a fight with a creature in the world, the encounter becomes locked to you.  No one can kill-steal from you, but they also can not help you whatsoever.   You can't heal them, buff them, slow the mob for them - anything.  If the mob is &amp;quot;tied&amp;quot; to other mobs, forming a &amp;quot;group&amp;quot;, you can not separate them - if you pull one, you pull them all.  No tactics - just drag and kill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you start a new toon in EQ2, you choose a Race and one of 4 &amp;quot;general&amp;quot; Classes - Fighter, Mage, Priest, Scout.  Later on as you hit the milepost levels (10 &amp;amp; 20 iirc), you further refine your Class and choose a sub-class, i.e., Fighters break up into Warriors, Paladins, Shadowknights, Priests become Clerics, Druids, Shamans....Mages become Wizards, Enchanters, Magicians...Scouts break up into Rogues, Rangers and Bards, etc.  This is a simplified breakdown and from memory so is not completely accurate or complete but illustrates their idea.  My problem with this system was that my preferred Class, Ranger, was developed based on the Rogue - all about stealth, sneaking up behind mobs and backstabbing....as a foundation for Rangers and Bards?  Rangers are about archery and Bards are about music.  What do either have to do with Stealth and Backstabbing? Totally wacked idea imho.  Yeah, my Ranger in EQ has sneak and hide but such a low skill cap in both that they are useless....and no backstab, pick locks or pick pockets - so why did the EQ2 peeps think a Ranger has anything to do with being a thief?.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In EQ2, buffs are all group-based.  It was kind of handy not having to re-cast buffs when new members joined the group as their buffs were automatically shared with you and vice-versa - but the drawbacks became readily apparent.  If you get too far away from your group, your buffs suddenly disappear.  If you are in a group with another member of the same class, and they are higher level than you, then their buff overwrites your own, and once you get out of &amp;quot;range&amp;quot; you end up losing your own buff and have to re-cast it on yourself - which then gets overwritten again once you get back in &amp;quot;range&amp;quot; of the group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tradeskills in EQ2 are equally gimped.  To begin with, you can only truly learn one skill.  That skill will then be dependent on other trades to supply your sub-combines.  But it doesn't work that way.  Where the designers obviously intended for a market of goods to form where you go shopping for your sub-components, people ended up creating alts to feed their mains with the subs.  The market never really materialized beyond people selling raw materials.  To add insult to injury, what started out as a cool side-game inside the main game, rapidly became an exercise in extreme patience.  Where it may take you a loooong time to raise your smithing in EQ to a high level, it will take you 10 times longer in EQ2.  Not because of the rate of skillups, but because of the excruciatingly slow mechanism they created for performing combines.  What takes a coupls of seconds in EQ takes a couple of MINUTES in EQ2.  For ONE combine!  As a simple example, I can crank out 80 combines of Blessed Champion Arrows in about 30 minutes in EQ - that includes making the arrowheads, shafts and fletchings.  In EQ2 it took me about 5 HOURS to complete a comparable run of arrows there.  NEVER AGAIN!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All things considered, EQ2 is NOTHING like EQ and in no way whatsoever deserves the EverQuest name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ok, on to WoW.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I found WoW to be a LOT of fun.  It is similar to EQ in that you choose a Race and Class at character creation and that is what that character will be forever.  Zones in WoW are not separated like they are in EQ and EQ2 - the only &amp;quot;zoning&amp;quot; occurs when moving between the 2 continents in Azeroth, or when entering or leaving an instanced zone.  Buffs work like they do in EQ - you can cast buffs and heals on toons outside your group.  You can actually help people in trouble!  What a concept!  (Not that it actually happens all that often, but at least it IS possible).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of your experience in WoW is generated from doing quests.  You get experience from each mob you kill as you do in EQ and EQ2, and Blizzard doesn't hide the actual numbers from you.  You know that it will take you X experience points to reach the next level, and that you got Y experience from killing that rat, or completing whatever quest.  The quests are fun, you get large chunks of XP on completion, and many of them offer items such as weapons and armor in addition to the XP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The environment in WoW really impressed me.  While the graphics are not as &amp;quot;bleeding edge&amp;quot; as EQ2's are, they are extremely well done and create so much more Atmosphere than I ever felt in EQ2.  Transitioning from a desert area to a mountain zone, you really &amp;quot;feel&amp;quot; the mood change.  Bright, bold, beautiful colors make for a much more inviting world than the highly-detailed, washed out looking pastel world of EQ2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tradeskills in WoW are very simple in comparison to EQ or EQ2.  While the interface is more like EQ in that you don't have some tedious little time-consuming &amp;quot;game&amp;quot; to perform your combines, you are limited in that you can only choose 1 &amp;quot;profession&amp;quot;.  All of the professions in WoW offer something to generate income, but not much.  Most of the player-made items in the game are either usable only by the profession that created it, or are gimped in comparison to the items found adventuring.  One nice feature of the WoW TS interface is the All button.  It will repeatedly preform a selected combine for all of the materials you have in inventory - or until you stop it.  Very handy single-click to crank out a pile of bandages, for example.  Some folks consider this just a bit TOO easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of all these games though, WoW does Fishing the best.   EQ is simply throw your line in some water, wait a minute, spill your beer, and wind up with either a fish, piece of junk, or nothing on your hook.  In EQ2, its a weird system of seeing a &amp;quot;school&amp;quot; of fish in some water and using your &amp;quot;grabbing hand&amp;quot; icon to &amp;quot;fish&amp;quot;.  Oddness abounds there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In WoW, you throw your line in some water and you see your bobber floating out there in the water in front of you.  You have to sit there and watch that thing - when you see it dip under the water (indicating a fish biting) you have to click it within a couple of seconds to &amp;quot;hook&amp;quot; the fish.  Very interactive and very difficult to &amp;quot;bot&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drawback to WoW to me, is that the end-game is nothing but Raiding, Faction Grinding, or PvP.  They even go so far as to lock your experience bar when you ding 60, so that you can't even fill it up - obviously they don't want anyone insta-dinging when they inevitably raise the level cap.  So, from that point on, every mob you kill, every quest you complete - you get awarded the XP but it just goes up in smoke.  VERY frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blizzard could very easily have done somthing for the end game like what Verant did for EQ - Alternate Advancement.  But they didn't, so imho, the game suffers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another drawback to WoW is the playerbase.  It is a much younger audience in WoW than we ever had in EQ.  WoW is full of the gotta have it now kids with the E-Peen disease.  Where you can find a lot of help in OOC chat in EQ, you get mostly insults in WoW.  It's just the nature of the playerbase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All things considered, WoW is a great game until you hit the level cap - from that point on its a boring grindfest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EQ2 has a rich, highly detailed world that feels like it has no soul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EQ1 is the only one that has the variety, longevity and playerbase that keeps me coming back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can't speak for many of the other MMO's out there....I played DAoC for about a week when it first came out and was not impressed enough to leave EQ, beyond that, maybe some others can offer some info on them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description>
