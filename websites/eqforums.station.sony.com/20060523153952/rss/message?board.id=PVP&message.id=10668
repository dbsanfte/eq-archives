    <description>&lt;DIV&gt;According to the Knowledge Base in the Petition System under "What is Ninja Looting":&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Ninja Looting is a term to describe the action of someone looting an item or all items from a corpse of an NPC they did not help kill, without the groups consent (not that your character has to be logged in and the actual character to have rights to a corpse).&amp;nbsp; This is a highly disruptive action that can lead to actions being taken agains the account.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;This is what is stated under Article ID 9790.&amp;nbsp; No where in the article does it say Ninja Looting on a pvp server is expected to be resolved using a PVP solution.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; So, why are we being told it's legal, and should be resolved using pvp?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I have petitioned in game, and been told by 2 GM's that being ninja looted was legal.&amp;nbsp; "Please note that rules for the Zek server state that "On Zek , PvP-related Play Nice Policies are expected to be resolved using PvP situations, so unfortunately I am unable to act upon this issue."&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Ninja looting is not and never has been part of the "PnP".&amp;nbsp; If I am wrong, please show me an official post saying it is, and I will eat my words, and start DA'ing to Ninja Loot everyone I can, then die to pvp, summon my corpse to Guild Hall, and go transfer the loot to my bazaar mule, rinse and repeat.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;This is a problem.&amp;nbsp; It's opening doors to much more griefing.&amp;nbsp; GM's say talk to developers.&amp;nbsp; Developers expect us to resolve issues using GM's.&amp;nbsp; Loot unlocks after 2 minutes to people outside of raids.&amp;nbsp; You know, sometimes I take tells for 2 minutes.&amp;nbsp; Either make everything attunable so raid leaders can loot it and sort it out after, or increase the timer, or do something to enforce the rule you have posted in your knowledge base.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Furthermore, if you truely don't give a darn about Zek.&amp;nbsp; Then just make an official post somewhere that says Zek has no rules.&amp;nbsp; None are being enforced anyway.&amp;nbsp; Guide Addison wittnessed a train in Sebilis and said "I'll petition too".&amp;nbsp; A GUIDE, petitioned?!?!&amp;nbsp;Will Nibele tell her he has to witness it too??&amp;nbsp; Come on seriously, put some rules down, enforce them, or don't.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
