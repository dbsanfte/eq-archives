    <title>Extreme problems with Noble's Causeway</title>
    <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=DevCorner&amp;message.id=2</link>
    <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Everytime i go to NC it's fine for a while then the whole zone starts to lag. to the point the game almost grinds to a halt. It's not just me either, everyone in the zone said they had the same problem. I and many others have done /feedback on it and still it does it. NC is my favorite zone but it's completely unplayable like it is, I have noticed that it happens when the fecund is up and pups are already summon. Maybe it has something to do with them. I just noticed that tonight though so i don't know if it's a cause/effect or just a correlation between them. Please fix this as it's such a fun and challenging zone to kite in i almost don't even want to play anywhere else.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Methinks GorGreybeard is right - I never noticed any lag in NC/Luclin server until last week; We took turns going nearly LD, mobs warped up to half a mile, group very nearly wiped af ew times until we decided to call it quits and left. As soon as we got out, none of us in group had lag issues, even in PoK.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>Doesn't really strike me as surprising.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course if they were even remotely smart, they would realize that it'd be far better to, as was suggested, put in an NPC that hands out the epic piece until they can fix it.  Rather than leaving the zone unplayable until they can fix it.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;At the least, they should consider "resetting" the zone when the problem shows up.&amp;nbsp; Loss of NC for 3 minutes &amp;gt;&amp;gt; limited playability for weeks.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;i myself have been having all of these issues on the Bertoxx server. Its a nice fun zone to kite in and have a little bit of fun but due&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;to the lag its almost unbearable at times. I have found something out that is fairly interesting. I noticed how Noble's Causeway and&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Walls of Slaughter operate pretty much the same way raid mob wise. Recently, we had a tank in our group that decided he was &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;going to attempt to single pull the Murkglider Hiveleadear whatever his name is to our group. I know this is a scripted event with &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;having to kill the eggs but i had never attempted to kill this npc before so i thought that u could pull him somewhere. After the tank&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;attempted to pull him the first time and a few times after that, the rangers track showed a serious amount of eggs that had spawned&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;and the zone was starting to lagg and got so bad that the zone had almost crashed. We didn't try intentionally to cause issues in &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;WoS that day, but the lagg that happened made me think as to part of the issues with Noble's Causeway and possibly that could &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;help with trying to find ways to overcome it. In my opinion if sony would take any scripted mobs like for epics and stuff&amp;nbsp;and replace &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;them with static mobs for the time being or maybe even just rewrite all the epic scripts there one by one, that would probably help&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;out majorly, but no matter what is done, they need to at least remove any scripted or specially spawned npc's and slowly work each&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;one back in to figure out the issue.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>Is there any progress being made on this problem yet?  I have been waiting to complete this part of my mage 1.5 for a few weeks, but have been unable due to the lag being too unbearable for a raid to take down the event.  I am also on Maelin btw.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;On a 3.2G P4, 2g ram, 10k rpm HD, Nvidia 6800 ultra video and a cable modem 400k sec connection and it still is unplayable in NC even for me.&amp;nbsp; The lag spikes are frequent enough to prevent proper play.&amp;nbsp; If I turn all particles off, clip plane to 0, sky off, drop mount, and no lev I can dodge 70 pct of teh lag, but it is still there and affecting my ability to heal groups reliably.&amp;nbsp; Even under those conditions, I freeze for about 3 secs every min. the last 3 tries I been there, so been avoiding that zone until I see it fixed.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>Any update on a solution for this ? As it stands since the last warrior 2.0 fight took place in NC on Maelin Starpyre the zone is pretty much unplayable . Usually the frame locking lasts for a period of time and then goes away for 10 -15 minutes only to return. I guess a zone repop might help until another guild comes to complete another warrior epic. It's extremely frustrating.</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;It's not just NC - I've seen it in Dranik Scar too - and I know just what it is... EQ did this a while back too - it's "hitching" when people enter the zone. It always does it, it's just really obvious at the moment. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I'm thinking it's not going to matter much where you set you settings... &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Try this -- I'm from a PvP server - so it's still a habit for me... &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Check the zone population - note the players in the zone... When it hitches bad like that - take a look - I bet someone just zoned in... Or even worse a number of people. &lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Noble's Causeway is currently a dead zone on Prexus due to this issue.&amp;nbsp; The zone is unusable, and I pity anyone who has an epic fight in the zone right now.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Played on an alt for a while tonight in Noble's Causeway. The zone still lags severely. Every 2 or 3 seconds the screen freezes for a second. This goes on for 5+ minutes. Then you'll have 5-10 minutes of no lag, then&amp;nbsp;the lag comes back.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Really a shame. It's an otherwise fantastic&amp;nbsp;zone for 60-65th level folks,&amp;nbsp;but&amp;nbsp;playability suffers&amp;nbsp;terribly. Our tank (who was 2boxing his low 60's toon)&amp;nbsp;was a&amp;nbsp;level 70 warrior in higher end raid gear. I&amp;nbsp;hate to think how many deaths would've happened if we had been relying upon a tank with appropriate level and gear for this zone. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Considering how many customers this affects,&amp;nbsp;it would seem logical for&amp;nbsp;SOE to&amp;nbsp;suspend the warrior epic&amp;nbsp;2.0 scripted event&amp;nbsp;and replace it with an NPC that&amp;nbsp;simply hands out&amp;nbsp;the quest piece -- and make the script active again once they get the kinks worked out. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I'd rather&amp;nbsp;see one part of a quest temporarily&amp;nbsp;'given' than allow an entire zone go to waste.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Regards,&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;This happens to my fiancé from time to time still, including today. It only happens on his main machine, which is weird because I would expect it to bog the laptop down as well. Usually he logs out and reboots then it is perfectly fine and doesn't come back for the rest of the play session.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Had this problem in NC just a few nights ago on Maelin. Zoned in to horrible lag and after about 2 minutes it seemed to get better. Did a mini hit on Menlo and as we enguaged got horrible lag spikes. Spell casts and refreshes were for crap and things were horribly lagging. I have a cable modem connection and was not experiencing any ISP connectivity problems. This seemed zone related, especially once we ported out to PoK, which was 100x better on lag ;) Not sure what was going on but a few of the people on dial-up couldn't maintain their connection there very well due to it. &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;A few nights ago we did the final Warrior 2.0 fight in NC.&amp;nbsp; There were 2 mobs up, both agro'd, we had double adds and the zone was pretty laggy.&amp;nbsp; Last night we tried to do the same fight again, but the zone was impossible to move in.&amp;nbsp; There were 6-7 Krekks up, we were debating whether to try the fight or not.&amp;nbsp; The decision was made for us when everyone in the raid went LD at the same time.&amp;nbsp; I can imagine how frustrating it is for warriors to finally get the Orb for their 2.0, then not be able to to the final event because of a bugged script.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>Since the May patch, this zone has been virtually unplayable.  Other zones have experienced new lag, but this zone seems to be the worst.  I play on Saryrn.  I thought it was related to some of the new graphics just recently introduced, so I turned off basically everything and all new models.  I still get lag.  I have an Athlon 2400 with nVidia 5950 and 2 GB RAM.</description>
