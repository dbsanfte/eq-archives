      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Ok, with the free come back offer and just because, we are getting a lot of people on the boards looking for rundowns on what has happened since X expansion.&amp;nbsp; Let's get together and put together everything we can think of on this thread for expansions after the initial trilogy (If you only played the trilogy, just figure this is some different game).&amp;nbsp; Feel free to either write your own opinions or link to threads that are your favorites.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Before we get into the other tips, here's a big one for people coming back.&amp;nbsp; In January a new bundled pack will be released for $20 that will have ALL expansions through Depths of Darkhollow (DoD or DoDh).&amp;nbsp; It can be used to start a new account or to upgrade an existing account.&amp;nbsp; In addition to being really awesomely cheap, you also get the special boxed gifts that as we understand can be claimed by only one character (all gifts to the one, but I'm not certain on that).&amp;nbsp; That would get you some largely uninspiring extras, but will give you a nice little pack and the free robo-boar mount.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;First off, here are some previous threads I have found helpful:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;OK, now what we need are non-expansion related changes.&amp;nbsp; I know that my interests and priorities will be different than other peoples.&amp;nbsp; So Let's get started! &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Hi there,&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;OK, I've tried finding this answer but can't...hope someone can help.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Thinking of returning after a year away, my question involved installation of the expansions.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Is there a particular order the expansions should be installed in? I have the old POP and all the other expansions, but I was thinking about just buying the new one that has all the expansions (Platinum I think), then install the newer expansions after that.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I want to get my old account back up and running sooner rather than later, and installing them in the right order is quite important from what I remember hearing.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Any help would be greatly appreciated.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Thanks,&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;PS&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Would buying and registering Platinum on existing accounts cause any problems as far as accessing and using the old accounts?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;DONT buy platinum. Go to the store and pick up Titanium - same price except it has all the expansions out now except phrophecy of ro (10 in all), it's only 19.99. There is no digital dl for this - you can pick it up at the store now or order it from the station store and wait a week. Otherwise you'de be paying about 20 for platinum and 10-20 for each other expansion.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;from what i understand you dont need to install them anymore. The easiest thing for you to do is install original eq. Then when you get to the patcher (after big download) choose Advanced and make sure all the expansion downloads are checked. Patch again. Then all you have to do is go to account page and register the keys you have for the expansions you have.&amp;nbsp; If you already have expansions registered and you buy titanium for that account you wont have any problems.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I recently logged into my character that I haven't played for about 3 years, and found that he has a different face than when I last played (using the oldest character model graphics.)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I know there was a period in which they allowed people to choose their character's "new" face when they upgraded all the character skins (back when Luclin was released?), but I just couldn't get used to the new graphics and would like to get my old character face back. Is there any way to do this? I've logged in and fiddled around with the confusing new menus, but can't seem to figure it out.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Has anyone faced a similar problem? Thanks in advance. =)&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;When you are at the log in screen, go to options.&amp;nbsp; There you will be able to click on/off luclin graphics.&amp;nbsp; Keep in mind that to use a mount, you must use Luclin graphics.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Then, in game, open up your inventory window to change your face.&amp;nbsp; There is a button there, don't remember exactly what it is called - may be as simple as "face".&amp;nbsp; Remember to save your changes.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Welcome back!&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;I am enjoying the game, but regeneration of hitpoints has been so rediculously slow, I'm going mad. It doesn't help that the enemies in Paldual&amp;nbsp;disease&amp;nbsp;me and it slows down even more.&amp;nbsp;I've read that there are potions (but I cannot find who sells them, and they are rarely sold by players, it seems). Out of combat regeneration would make the game for me...I perfer to solo, which isn't really viable as a rogue.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Coming back after a long absence is daunting.&amp;nbsp; Many of your friends are gone, those that remain are in zones you've never heard of.&amp;nbsp; It's not so easy to get a pick up group, especially if you are under level 60 (but they are out there).&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;You may want to create a new character and run through the tutorial just for the basics of the game.&amp;nbsp; It also fills you in on some of the changes.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I still heartily recommend you get the Titanium expansion pack, only $20 US it will get you current up to Prophecy of Ro.&amp;nbsp; Options are always good.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Shrouds are really just a toy.&amp;nbsp; Their intended use is so higher levels can group with lower levels, or if you need a specific skill in a group, say rogue, you can shroud into a rogue character.&amp;nbsp; Shrouded characters have less abilities than a normal character.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;One thing shrouds are good for is that you can be buffed up and then shroud which suspends the buff timer while you are LFG.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The DoD zones do start from Nektulos, or rather they start from Corathus Creep which connects to Nek.&amp;nbsp; The zone is at one end of the river.&amp;nbsp; Do you have maps?&amp;nbsp; You can download them from eqtoolbox/Mapfiend.&amp;nbsp; With the proper expansion (I am forgetting off hand) you also have the Atlas, a tab in you map window that lets you see zone connection information.&amp;nbsp; BTW, you can now look at maps from other zones while you are in a zone if you want.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;There are vendor sold potions that do help significantly reduce down time.&amp;nbsp; There are heals and regen (and clarity and haste) in a bottle.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I know it is overwhelming, try and ask as specific questions as you can and we can try and answer them.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>Lol, sorry if I was a bit out of focusI was very tired wen I wrote that.&amp;nbsp; I was making an analogy withe last paragraph, lol, I know how to fight.&amp;nbsp; Its just all the info I have found was stuff like what the shrouds ARE, not how to use them.&amp;nbsp; So you gain power by leveling up in them?&amp;nbsp; At what rate does it level.&amp;nbsp; I shrouded down to 15 and was smacking some blues around in N Ro, but after awhile of gettin exp, I saw no chnge.&amp;nbsp; That made me totally stumped on how to use em.&amp;nbsp; Guess I gotta kill more.&amp;nbsp; Is the progression equally fast at all levels?&amp;nbsp; Or do higher level shrouds progress faster (killing tougher mobs for exp).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, I dunno if it was a bug, but in shroud form, I didnt seem to be gettin the progressive regen rates sitting.&amp;nbsp; As an Iksar I had regen up to 75 per tik, but as a bear, it never went over 6, and it took me more than half an hour sitting to heal to full.&amp;nbsp; The pixie had the same problem.&amp;nbsp; I didnt bothe checking the rest though.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, is there any preferred class of shroud to work on?&amp;nbsp; Or is it just personal choice?&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;First, you don't need to be in shroud form to access any DoDh content. There is a quest available in Corathus Creep, a DoD zone off of Nektulous Forest (the zoneline to CC is at the end of the river that flows through Nek...if it's not marked on your map, I'd suggest going to &lt;A href="http://www.mapfiend.net/" target=_blank&gt;www.mapfiend.net&lt;/A&gt; and downloading the all zones zip file), that can be more easily accomplished in a rogue shroud form if you don't have reliable invisibility (using Hide and Sneak). I don't know the exact name of the quest, but if you look up "Slipgear gem" (the quest reward) at &lt;A href="http://www.allakhazam.com/" target=_blank&gt;www.allakhazam.com&lt;/A&gt; you will find all the details.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;As for shrouds, they are not as powerful as your character at the same level (unless you are severly lacking in the gear department...and if that is so, you probably shouldn't be anywhere near the new high level content until you gear up as well as you can). What shrouds are mainly intended for is to be able to "shroud down" to a lower level and join lower level groups,&amp;nbsp;filling in needed class roles in said groups. As you gain experience in shroud form, you build points to unlock more powerful shrouds. A side effect, and much loved thing about shrouds, is that while you are shrouded, your buff timers are suspended on your normal self, and if you happen be a pet class, the buffs and summoned gear held by your pet are suspended...even when you log off. I've had the same mage pet, fully geared with summoned equipment, for over 3 months.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;As for your last paragraph, if you are having problems rembering how to do the basic things, like attack and communicate with NPCs and PCs, roll up a new character on any server but The Sleeper and The Combine, and hit the new tutorial. Don't hesitate to ask people in game and here on these boards when you have questions. The majority of the people here in EQ are still mature and helpful, even if you do encounter a few unsavory people.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Parks_Hyperlight on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;07-26-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;08:54 AM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Most people use the Potion Sellers in Plane of Knowledge.&amp;nbsp; They are on FIND and are in the room with the alchemy merchants (also on FIND).&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Potion costs varies by level and include heal, regen, haste, and clarity.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The Serpent’s Spine (TSS) Expansion 12 (and the first without an “of” in the name) &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;EXPANSION SPECIFIC &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;U&gt;Level Cap Increase&lt;/U&gt;: 75 is the new cap. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;U&gt;New Player Race&lt;/U&gt;: The Drakkin are a humanoid race touched by dragon blood and can be any human class (so no Shamans, Berserkers, or Beastlords but they are the first race since Iksars to have monks). Drakkin have been modeled with a new engine and are not made the same way the Luclin models were made. BTW, armor dyes do not work on armor worn by Drakkin. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;U&gt;New Starting City&lt;/U&gt;: Crescent Reach is a neutral city (non-KOS to all) the home of the Drakkins. All races/classes can now start at Crescent Reach as well. General: The expansion was designed so that you could level from 1 to 75 entirely within the new zones if you wish. It is very quest/task oriented although you can just run around killing things. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;U&gt;General&lt;/U&gt;:&amp;nbsp; To reach the new expansion there is a new stone in PoK, it is in the neutral section, between buildings, sort of in front and in-between the Qeynos and PoT stones. The stone takes you to Blightfire Moors, the zone next to Crescent Reach. It is not particularly close to the Crescent Reach zone and can be dangerous for very low levels (call it under 10) to travel, especially if you don’t know the way and aren’t looking. There is also a zone from Highhold&amp;nbsp;Pass into Blightfire. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Highhold has had a graphics overhaul, keeping the basic layout of the old zone but not really the feel although I like the new buildings. East and West Commonlands are also getting a graphics overhaul which was not ready to be released with the expansion. I believe they will be one zone after it goes live. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Zone graphics of pre-existing zones are changed for everyone, not just TSS &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;New spells and AA for the new levels, not many for lower levels but although it didn’t make it with release an AA for forage for all races/classes should be coming out soon. New research for LDoN and OoW spells. New tradeskill recipes in general and the ability to skill up to 54 in all the trades in Crescent Reach (faster than in Abysmal, less turn ins). &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Non-SOE maps are available for downloading, check eqtoolbox/mapfiend.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;NON-TSS EXPANSION GLOBAL CHANGES (effective 9/19/06) &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;U&gt;Racial Experience Penalties&lt;/U&gt;: ARE GONE! &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;U&gt;Zones&lt;/U&gt;: As mentioned above, zone revamps for Highhold Pass and East/West Commonlands (to come). Bankers added to the Guild Lobby (because apparently, having banks available just one zone away in two directions from the lobby was too much of a hassle) &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;U&gt;New AA system&lt;/U&gt;: AA is no longer strictly the amount of exp it takes to go through level 51 (except at level 70). The big thing with this is that characters under 70 should gain AA faster than they did before. Players above 70 will need to kill the same number of mobs (of the same con) as they do at 70. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;AAs were refunded to enchanters for Jewel Craft Mastery since it is no longer a chanter-only AA (you do have to buy it again though if you want it). Also, AAs were refunded for all classes with Channeling AAs, Channeling is now set at 100% for all classes. Bard AA Spell Casting Subtlety is also refunded. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;U&gt;Death Change&lt;/U&gt;: When you die you no longer immediately gate to bind. You float over your body so that your group/raid mates can rez you first. Doesn’t make that much of a difference if you are soloing, but it shortens the zoning time if you have a rezzer available. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;U&gt;Character Creation&lt;/U&gt; has been changed. I’m not a fan of the new “more graphical” interface, but that’s probably because I am old and resist change. I believe that all characters are now defaulted to start in Crescent Reach regardless of their original home towns, which can cause problems for people without the expansion. Go to the advanced options to check/change your starting city. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;U&gt;Con Changes&lt;/U&gt;: &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Gray (old green) - This creature is trivial to you and will give you no experience for killing it. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Green (basically old lt blue) - This creature is not much of a threat, but will still give you some experience. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Blue - This creature is below your level, but high enough level to give you experience. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Dark Blue (within 5 levels of your level) - This creature is below your level, but close enough to provide a solid challenge and gives you more experience than normal blue cons. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;White - This creature is the same level as you Yellow - This creature is slightly above (up to 3 levels) your level. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Red - This creature is well above your level. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;U&gt;New Regen/”Out of Combat” (or ooc&lt;/U&gt;): Mana, Health and Endurance will all regen much faster than before once you have been resting for about 30 seconds. A new series of icons are now in your character box (where your name, health, and mana bars are). Just like in the old system, you have to be sitting or on a non-moving horse to gain the benefits. Pets also benefit from higher regen rates. I don’t believe the pet has to be sitting, only the master &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The Icons are: &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;"Crossed Swords” you are fighting and not resting. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;“Hour Glass” you are in your waiting mode before the enhanced regen goes into effect. There is a new bar under your endurance bar that shows graphically how long you have to wait. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;“Void” you are eligible for the ooc/resting regen. “Energy Swirl” you are resting and regaining mana/heath/endurance. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;“Poison Drop” you have a negative spell affecting you. If the debuff has a yellow border, you don’t need to do anything (regen-wise) with a red border, you have to get rid of the debuff before you will start resting.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>Ok. As far as I can remember, I haven't played EQ since Ruins of&#xD;
Kunark. I dug around some boxes and found my password/station name so I&#xD;
could login to EQplayers. I saw that my Characters were still there. I&#xD;
have a 33 Ranger and a 10 Ranger (different servers). So I clicked on&#xD;
them and it brought up their info screen. Now this is what concerns me:&#xD;
all my characters stats (hit points, attributes, resists, etc) are all&#xD;
at zero. What does this mean exactly? If I buy the Titanium pack, and&#xD;
Time Card, and login and play the game, will my characters "revert" to&#xD;
normal? Or are they deleted? I ask this because I looked up other&#xD;
characters on EQplayers (random ones) and some of them had full stats&#xD;
and abilities, and some had them all at zero (like mine).&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; So here is my question: is the reason for this&#xD;
zero-stat "state" because they were deleted or just that they haven't&#xD;
been "re-activated"? I don't want to go through all the trouble of&#xD;
starting over again with a new character.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Thanks for reading&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;Your older character should be fine.&amp;nbsp; The level 10 may be gone, during the server mergers characters under level 10 that hadn't been played in the 6 months prior to the merger were purged.&amp;nbsp; Now, I'm not sure if that is 10 and under or just under 10...&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;While you were at EQPlayers, did you look at the front page to see if there is a welcome back trial subscription?&amp;nbsp; They come up periodically and are usually in a box on the upper left side which I think has changing screens in it.&amp;nbsp; You could come back that way to see if they were still there.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;It may be that your previous server was the one that lost its name and so your info hasn't updated, plus that you haven't been subscribing.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;As far as leveling up a new character -- well -- if you've read this thread you know that the game has changed significantly since back in the day.&amp;nbsp; Your 33 ranger could very well be wearing what is now worn by mid-teens.&amp;nbsp; I know that the newbie armor quests were better than anything I had at level 22 back around Velious launch.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Although we don't have the low level players that we once did, it really isn't all that bad to start over and get to the 30s.&amp;nbsp; PoK (easy travel plus potion vendors) and the Bazaar (buy/sell) plus the Guild Lobby (corpse summons) are all available as part of "basic" eq now.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Titanium is still the best bundle pack available.&amp;nbsp; TSS (currently available only by download) will be where most of the lower level characters are now found.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;To search for player made potions in the bazaar, use "philter" and "distillate" as two separate search keywords in the /bazaar window. Player made potions *usually* are cheaper than the potions vendor sold in PoK. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;Hi all, returning player from two years.&amp;nbsp; I was wondering how players got the "of Veeshan" or "of Luclin" behind their names.&amp;nbsp; I assume it was something to do with the server mergers, but I wasn't sure if that was still available.&amp;nbsp; Thanks.</description>
