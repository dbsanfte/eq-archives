				CLASS:&nbsp; Shadowknight
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>HP: Unimportant.&nbsp; A byproduct of gear with high AC<br>Mana: Same as HP<br>Endurance: Completely useless<br>AC:&nbsp;
Most important stat in the game for an SK.&nbsp; All of my gear choices
are based on this number, plus the type 2 mods(e.g. shielding) and
focus effects.<br>
 </div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>HP Regen: Unimportant<br>Mana Regen: Only important if you are not capped.&nbsp; Very easy to cap.<br>Endurance Regen:&nbsp; unimportant<br>
 </div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Strength: not considered when making gear choices<br>Stamina: not considered when making gear choices<br>Agility: not considered when making gear choices<br>Dexterity: not considered when making gear choices<br>Charisma: not considered when making gear choices<br>Intelligence: not considered when making gear choices<br>Wisdom:
not considered when making gear choices.&nbsp; Why does the
shadowknight planar armor from plane of fear have wisdom on it instead
of intelligence?<br>
<br>
 </div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Cold Resist: Generally not important as the high ac gear typically
has decent resists.&nbsp; Resist buff clickies are a whole other story.<br>Disease Resist: Ditto<br>Poison Resist: Ditto<br>Magic Resist: Ditto<br>Fire Resist<img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-very-happy.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0>itto </div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Attack: Not important<br>Delay: Not important<br>Damage: Not important<br>Range: Not important </div>

<div>Haste: Not important can be tributed.&nbsp; I'm having&nbsp; a
hard time optimizing my tranking gear and finding an affordable haste
item.&nbsp; This is at the qvic level </div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Combat Effects: Unimportant<br>Shielding: The second most important stat.&nbsp; This and AC are how i choose my gear<br>Stun Resist: not something i try to find on gear.<br>Strikethrough: unimportant.<br>Spell Shield: Something that i should focus on but it is very hard to find on gear with high ac and shielding<br>Avoidance: the third most important tank stat.&nbsp; <br>Accuracy: unimportant<br>DOT Shielding: Something that i should focus on but it is very hard to find on gear with high ac and shielding </div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

Skill Mods: generally considered useless.&nbsp; <br>
Click Effects: One of the real joys of EQ.&nbsp; I have 17 click effect items that i have collected for this toon.&nbsp; <br>
Proc Effects: Not all that important.&nbsp; Happy with the generic
lifetap effects for SK weapons but would like to see more rune proc
effects for the SK class<br>
Worn Effects: improved dodge, improved parry and similar worn effects
have been shown through parsing to have such a minimal effect on
tanking that it could be nothing more than the RNG playing games.&nbsp;
Completely unimportant.&nbsp; <br>
Focus Effects:&nbsp; Very important at all times to have a magic damage
focus for lifetaps, a distance focus for pulling, a focus for extended
DOTs, mana preservation focus, and for HT we need a generic damage
focus.&nbsp; The generic damage focus is very hard to find.&nbsp;
Almost everything is magic.<br>
<br>
<br>
My gear goals for my SK are to cap shielding and avoidance, put the
highest AC aug i can find in every slot, and pick the highest AC gear
for my content while maintaining the needed focus effects.&nbsp; I
would like to get more spell shielding and dot shielding but the
choices are very limited.<br>
