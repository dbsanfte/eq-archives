      <description>Aye, Bards need some DPS in PvP but that should come with the cost to be finally vulnerable like any other class too. If there would be a way someone could loose Selos just from PvP actions and not from PvE actions that could be a good thing. Also instant gates suck in PvP (even though I am a Druid *g* ) and I d rather have cheetahs upgraded to fastest speed ingame (lasts only a few sec) and insta gate nerfed when engaged in PvP (wizzies have shadowstep to escape).</description>

      <description>Hm, if it leads to one guild fully dominating a server its also no good thing.&lt;br&gt;With huge amounts of content no guild can fully "cxxkblock" all the other guilds on the server.&lt;br&gt;Also IMHO most of the players (as I already stated there are two fractions of PvP players at least) do love PvE .&lt;br&gt;On Vallon all our player made rules exist because the guilds know that PvP rules enable raiding PvE content.&lt;br&gt;It would only need a handful of people to mess up most raids. People have choosen to PvP for mobs and for fun but not to destroy the opponents fun. Playing without rules would result in no raids at all and people wouldnt be too happy about it after a few weeks. &lt;br&gt;IMHO the solution is to have PvP events via the ongoing storyline. Lag is always an issue, but there could be for sure events covering a bunch of zones like for example a "crusade" event where several zones have to be captured/defended or a ringwar like event in several zones "prevent the "Lighty" Army from merging"-style.&lt;br&gt;On a Light vs Dark server additionally would be the option to change traveling/books to some degree so crossing "enemy lands" would be an issue again. And for sure the protection of new players should play a huge role. If thats the case there could even be PvP without level limit. Especially if newbie zones are also populated by strong NPC defenders and there would be no one shot newbie kills (reduced effectivity of spells/melee vs lower levels). It is critical to envolve new players into their "new world" so they learn to know that reputation and friendship are way more valuable on a PvP server.</description>

      <description>Hm, still think the setup I suggested covers two of the significant issues:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) The option of changing alignments improves roleplaying variability, fixes lacking class issues and controls team balance if changing alignment also keeps track of team balance and if it is more difficult to be a good troll then a good human.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) Events and the chance for people to read about those will lessen the fear of non PvP players to give the server a try. And since thats the by far bigger playerbase luring some former blue server players onto this server would add greatly to the financial success of such a server...</description>

And thats what they fear (from games like UO) - on some servers this might be the case but I rate for example Vallon rather adult. Why would you want blue server players to play on a PvP server? Answer is simple: If the PvP servers become a significant economical factor we will continously receive the amount of support we receive now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also ppl with tons of insta klick items are an issue in PvP...</description>

      <description>Rytan, I honestly doubt a PvP ranking system will work. Maybe only if you scale down you killing the same person making you receive points like only once a week and/or if the helping groupmembers (healer debuffer) receive points either. The bounty system is a not a bad idea though, but dunno how it works when implemented, prolly only if you can only place one offer a time and when the victim is killed the offer is canceled. Keep in mind that its all about fun in PvP and harrassing and exploiting are harming the servers more then a bounty or point system will aid them IMHO - so please only implement those features if they bring fun not frustration.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Every spell should have a minimum chance to land (lets say 10-20%) and besides that there should be an exponential resist system valuing the first 100 resist more then the next 100 and so on to make gear still worthwile but not overpowering. Decreasing the amount of time "critical" spells like snare stick or having a chance to break them when hit is a good idea.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Balance in PvP can never be achieved IMHO but a stone / paper system where classes have the ability to kill one class easier could help some with that issue. Balancing also means to keep in mind that there is not only outdoors but also indoors where the melees have the upper hand usually. Wouldnt mind some Magic immunity skills in PvP for pure melees as tradeoff for lacking spells and / or a nasty range weapon disc that stuns the opponent for some time to enable the pure melee to actually kill someone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Insta gate discs are a problem in PvP and I d really like to see Spirit of Cheetah be the fastest run speed in game since it has only a few seconds duration. Wiz can step anyways.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bards and Insta kills and fastheals are a problem, too so giving bards more offensive power while making them vulnerable to runs speed decrease and less annoying (mez / drain) same as making Dru Shm Clr Pal MR Pr Dr spells less resisted if tuning down healing on people hit in PvP "who are in pvp mode".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PoT and a few other zones being PvP enabled sounds nice - but PoK should be unchanged IMHO.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Would there be a chance to implement a "just zoned" flag that prevents you from zoning a few seconds so zone dancing wouldnt be an issue anymore or is this too much effort to code?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyways its good to see finally some constructive cooperation on implementing changes on the PvP servers.&lt;br&gt;As most people already noticed there are at least two fractions of PvP players - some are hardcore and some are blue. Luckily there are several server setups so both fractions will hopefully find their home in the end.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not to forget that a lot of bored players on the "blue" servers could be interested into "blue" PvP servers (or lets say low grief factor servers) with that changes and the proper promotion. The positive things on a PvP server is that reputation, friends, gear really matter her and that you have additional options while playing EQ. My dream was always a Light vs Dark server (maybe including Neutrals ie Humans) where you can change factions via Quests and take faction hits for kills. This server would need an ongoing storyline and a lot of events like fights for cities and wars. The server would have an online chronicle where the players are the figures of the chronicle developing via the events and you could read that story like an Dragonlance book with screen shots. Ok prolly too much work and support staff needed but maybe someday? ;)</description>

      <description>Well I really hope that the DEV team does finally talk to the community prior to any changes or server setups.&lt;br&gt;One thing is for sure hindering them and thats the PvP community not speaking with one voice. Every single change will cause tons of people crying fearing to loose their advantage. And generally there are at least two fractions of PvP players (hardcore, wanting huge rewards/penalties for PvP deaths and blue, wanting only small rewards/penalties to prevent griefing) making it nearly impossible to create ONE environment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The solution is already existing - several rulesets.&lt;br&gt;If the servers could be tweaked in cooperation with the communities and also including an one time server move option maybe this could solve a lot of issues. But since that would need some SOE manpower chances are pretty low :(&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;About talking to the top guilds: Well, its generally not a bad idea but has one problem:&lt;br&gt;We on Vallon are a server where not only ONE guild fully dominates the server. There are actually three time enabled guilds (Defiant, Ancient Dawn, Zephyros) with another guild (Aduentus) working hard on it. On a server where only one guild dominates the server via gear advantage I guess they would not want to loose their incredible superiority. Therefore you could not expect a totally neutral and objective statement regarding PvP, esp. high end PvP IMHO.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;just my 2cp...</description>

      <description>Well, on the other hand I have the feeling that the blue server players have a very biased point of view because of the experiences in other MMORPGs esp. UO. There are really a lot of intelligent nice and adult people playing on VZ at least ;)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But besides that I fully agree with you.&lt;br&gt;I think extended rezz effects and coin loot is the way to go.&lt;br&gt;Besides that the only way of preventing unsocial behaviour in EQ is prolly punishment/rules, esp. because people dont communicate face to face but just play their toons. Thats why I d prefer a server where PvP is just a tool to achieve a more "real" environment, have more options, thrill and fun and where friendship, items and reputation are of a higher value.</description>

      <description>Sure, it has to be a solution that has maximum effect with minimum effort - it's meanwhile all about the money in the gaming industry like in every other business :P&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But honestly I don't know how hard it would be to code such a setup - thats a question only the Devs could answer. Still think that this setup creates a roleplaying promoting environment while also catering a good amount of the PvP players. And since a lot of players always demanded a roleplaying server this setup (if only few penalties for death like enhanced rezz effects and coin loss to prevent harassing) could attract players from non PvP servers. All it takes would be some advertisement -&gt; for example a server history accesseable by everybody via webpage and events taking place. Too bad that EQ has mostly "static" content I'd always loved to see a MMORPG that develops over time and where you could be taking part in the changes that happen. And people could read the story of the server like reading a "Dragon Lance" book while the players would be the characters in that "online book" thats developing over time via events and consists in fact of a summary of those events. Yes I really think that such an online book combined with a few screenshots including a few massive fights for a town for example would be enough advertisement. To a small degree such a server history already exists since reputation is important on most PvP servers and so I remember for example the Grey Companions being a honourful guild with some intentions to roleplay and for sure remember guilds like the Prophets who wrote some part of the server history. And for sure most of the old school players remember even the "heroes" of the server that wrote server history ( like the term Blizzymodem ;) ), friends and enemies.</description>

      <description>Bards are annoying atm - aye. But making them more vulnerable should only come with the tradeoff of them being able to dish out more damage. Will be hard to balance this though because of their insane versatility and casting when running.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Overall I think we should try to keep the discussion here calm and productive.</description>

      <description>A solution to this could be faction based teams. So every race/class combo would have its "starting" alignment.&lt;br&gt;I personally would really love a Light vs Dark server, or like on Sullon even a neutral team included. Good: All good fantasy races like Elves,Froglok, Vah Shir, Dwarves, Halflings. Neutral: Humans/Erudites/Barbs ( human races mind their own business ).Evil: the evil fantasy races. Now every player would have his "reputation" and this would determine his actual team. By killing players of other alignments and questing you could gain the faction needed even to change teams. To make it more realistic the different races could have different modifiers - which elf would trust a troll, eh? ;) And especially humans would have it easier to switch from neutral either to good or bad alignment while good and bad would have to do some serious questing at the beginning to change the team to ensure there are really only a few Dark Elves in the good team and only a few elves in the dark team. The more you switch the harder it gets and the higher the population of one team is the harder it gets to change to that alignment. Dont know how easy thats to implement/code but I think that server would rock especially since it could be a combination of a PvP and a roleplaying server.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Combine that with content for mass PVP (like conquering enemy towns temporarily to kill an NPC there for benefits for example, or having special items that improve your team in PvP and PvE or content only being accesseable if you control the majority of the items like in DAoC) and changes and balances to the resist system like mentioned in the other thread and a few more balance issues - voila there is a server that would prolly even attract "blue" players and would give players a reason not to play WoW :P</description>

      <description>Well, if you are looking for "hardcore" PvP and are willing to accept that you might get harrased and have some frustration from time to time you should try out Rallos or even Sullon. If you just want to have some occasional PvP on servers that have player made rules against harassing you should try Vz Tz. Even though in lower levels those rules like "loot and scoot" "no corpsecamping" "no engaging when in a fight (not including running into mobs on purpose)" etc etc. are not known by every player or sometimes misinterpreted or not obeyed. But once in higher levels your reputation as griefer will usually hinder you to get into a high lvl guild and once in range of the high level guilds without friends and as a well known griefer you will prolly have less fun to play.</description>

      <description>To get more precise on reists in PvP I would suggest an "exponential" resist system.&lt;br&gt;I will give an example:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Spell X resist check vs Magic&lt;br&gt;-----------------------------&lt;br&gt;0-100 MR -&gt; normal count -&gt; 100 MR max eff MR&lt;br&gt;101-200 MR -&gt; 60% count -&gt; 160 MR max eff MR&lt;br&gt;201-300 MR -&gt; 40% count -&gt; 200 MR max eff MR&lt;br&gt;301+ MR -&gt; 20% count...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also there should be a minimum chance for every spell to land (for damage spells maybe to do full or at least half max damage).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lets say spell X has 15% minimum chance to stick and additionally the now improved chance to stick due to lowered effective resists for example. This would make several magic based spells more valuable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the end it will prolly come down to how easy to code/implement such changes are.&lt;br&gt;But generally I find exponential systems the best solution since they still give the hardcore gamer an advantage but give also the casual player a chance. For sure it would not be a bad Idea to have different minimum stick chances for each spell and also for each class. Generally pure melees should have a lesser minimal stick chance then hybrids and casters and maybe even an "temp invul to spells PvP skill 'focus of mind'" to compensate the lack of spells they have. If such a system would be implementeable that would also make it possible to make some classes more vulnerable to others as I suggested in my other post.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sure such changes would need excessive testing but I think they could solve some of the issues in PvP.</description>

      <description>Ah, yes - now we are back to probably the basic problem in the PvP discussion I already mentioned in the other thread: there are minimum two fractions of PvP players. This Idea would probably be a good idea for a "hardcore" server but for a "blue" PvP server I d really like the suggestion about mass pvp to gain access to special zones, etc. Shouldn't be that a guild can rule a server completely via that ruleset but there should be a benefit for winning a battle vs another guild IMHO thats also not easy exploiteable. Mass battles are what I enjoy most when it comes to PvP and I am sure I am not alone ;)</description>

      <description>...so what could the devs do to improve PvP IMHO?&lt;br&gt;As I posted they should improve the rulesets/settings on the servers on the one hand (ok that would maybe need to include server moves or merging servers, dont know how likely that is since that needs manpower and thats costly). On the other hand they need to balance PvP to some degree. What I d like to see would be that no spell would be totally useless due to resists. There should always a minimum chance to be snared rooted dotted nuked etc. One shot kills are not really leading to interesting PvP but more to frustration. Should be looked into. Monks Warriors Rogues have a hard time PvPing - I think there is room for improvement here, making skills more valuable or adding special PvP skills. In general there won`t be 100% balanced PvP in any game, but every class should be effective vs a few other classes. Like the cleric being able to kill SKs necros easier due to resist modifiers lowered extremely, making root stun etc work well or Druids being Bard killers due to root snare sticking almost every time while warriors monks do extra damage vs Pallies and Shammies have less resists on Druids, etc. I think that it is less frustrating to have classes that are almost unkilleable or win button classes then everybody being vulnerable to a few other classes. Skill should always play a role, though.</description>

      <description>Well, I really was no fan of PvP in general.&lt;br&gt;But what I love(d) are things like:&lt;br&gt;- smart "real" enemies and the thrill of crossing enemy territory (when VZ was brought up and I was a newbie running from RV to FP my invis dropped near the entrance to nektulous forrest - omg all the shouts in a language I did not understand! OMG half the zone is chasing meeeee! *sweat* Hop... Hop... Hop... ah finally the zoneline. Ah, wait  hope the humans there will be friendly to shorties!? )&lt;br&gt;- friendship, reputation really matter here. All the trouble on "blue" server, childish behaviour about loots and spawns. Not really possible on VZ if you want to belong to a top guild. Even left alone from the Developers we developed our own "code of honor" on the PvP servers like loot and scoot, dont attack when mob engaged, dont interfere raids when bossfights already started, dont train, etc. Sure, since there is no real power enforcing the rules besides the high level guilds (because of the game mechanics since harassing and getting harassed lead to no "phat lewtz") most of the rules will be only obeyed by highlevels and there are always debates and accusations, but in the end I think it works pretty well as long as all keep in mind that EQ is just a game and everybody can loose a fight or make a mistake...&lt;br&gt;- more options and a totally different "world"&lt;br&gt;- guild success and loot are really of value here not to forget the huge guildfights about bossmobs and zone control. Thats PvP how I like it - I suck at 1vs1 anyways ;)&lt;br&gt;For sure there are also downsides but I think that more bored players from "blue" servers would be surprised how interesting and different playing on a PvP server is. And the PvP community could benefit from the bigger attention they receive from the developers.</description>

      <description>Honestly, I think the biggest issue is that there are different fractions of PvP players.&lt;br&gt;What I always liked about EQ PvP was that you had several choices in rulesets. But since the developers did not really communicate with the PvP community the setup of the servers was not well thought out and balanced. Since the game development after the PvP servers being no financial success purely shifted towards PvE now EQ PvP is even more broken. IMHO the first thing needed to balance PvP is to create a framework for the different PvP fractions via a server setup. Basically there are two groups of PvPers - the "hardcore" PvPers and the "bluebie" PvPers. Both fractions don't fit too well together since the hardcore PvPers want to have huge rewards for PvP victories while the blue ones PvP to have fun and for zones/mobs but want to have low penalties for PvP deaths. I'll leave it to the hardcore PvPers to write down their options about a good "hardcore" PvP server setup but will post some about a good setup for a "blue" PvP server. The "hardcore" PvPers probably know that only a "blue" PvP server has the chance to attract players from non PvP servers, increasing the playerbase and making SoE look more into PvP issues in general. The reason is simple: with no big penalties to PvP (coin loss only for example or expanded rez effects) harassing other players is not such a big issue here and thats what most non PvP players fear. They would be surprised that you can find a lot of mature people on PvP servers and friendship and reputation are of a real value here. Heck, there are even a bunch of IRL females playing on PvP servers - a fact that many of them prolly wont expect.&lt;br&gt;As far as I remember screenshots from RZ where Lighties and Darkies fought for Freeport excited the community and they demanded a PvP teams server - and got it, err ok them. IMHO the reason why it didnt work out as expected (still had incredible fun in my early newbie days after VZ was brought up) was that the setup wasnt arranged with the community. Thats also the reason why sullon flopped IMHO. &lt;br&gt;The Setup of PvP in DAoC isnt too bad for my taste, but for sure not balanced either. I personally would love kind of a Light vs Dark server, though. Since disrupting existing guilds is no option a guildwar server or the possibility of faction bringing you into the "team" you want to be in (Dark, Neutral, Light) could be a solution. And hey, imagine roleplaying a good Troll ;)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or long story short: a lot of people fear to be harassed when playing on a PvP server.&lt;br&gt;The harder the punishment for PvP deaths the more effective harassing is possible.</description>
