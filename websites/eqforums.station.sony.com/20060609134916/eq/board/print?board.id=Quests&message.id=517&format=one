				<DIV>I have tried various things.&nbsp; I believe there is a timer and there is a bug.&nbsp; The timer is about an hour, the timer is for both sets of quests.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I have tried zoning.&nbsp; I've tried getting the text.&nbsp; I've tried being logged in waiting more than an hour game time, I've tried being logged out and waiting consecutive days.&nbsp;&nbsp;I've tried alternating the quests.&nbsp; I've tried doing tasks in between them.&nbsp; I've had the same problems on multiple characters AND on separate accounts (in case it was account related).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I haven't had any problems with the first tasks, IF it has been an hour between whatever turn in was before it.&nbsp; I have tried for hours and hours and hours and days to get the Ring especially.&nbsp; Don't seem to have as many problems with cloak.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I have no idea whether it helped or not, but this go through with the ring, I had tried numerous things.&nbsp; Finally, I got rid of the ore that had been given back to me (sold to vendor) and got four new pieces of ore.&nbsp; Bingo.&nbsp; The ring was in my packs.&nbsp; Now, I have no idea if it was because the bug/timer had cleared, if it was&nbsp;the new ore, or if it was because I was killing fire drakes in the zone.&nbsp; (The drakes have a pretty good rate of ore drop, especially if you are a higher level character you can get 4 rather quickly, takes longer if you are lower level.)</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Just another thing to try.. fresh ore and drake killing.</DIV>
