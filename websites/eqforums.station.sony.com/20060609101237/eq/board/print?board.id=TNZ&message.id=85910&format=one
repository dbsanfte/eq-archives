				<P>Of course the issues came to the fore when progression bottlenecks hit all the non uber guilders in PoP. No point in more expansions if you are still stuck trying to get into elementals because of numbers required.</P>
<P>It has taken me, in my "Family Guild", three years to get to 65 just recently and have 30AA's. Lack of new&nbsp;upper end content accessable to 3-4 group raids has just started to bite. We keep having the top few characters skimmed off by uber guilds or boredom/game bugs&nbsp;&gt; new games, thus limiting our ability to progress.</P>
<P>Stretching the player base across more expansions/zones isnt viable anymore, expansions need to be spaced further apart, if there are to be any more. You have run out of things to give us that arent unbalancing. You could overcome the problem of level adequate content by upgrading more of the old world. Most players arent in guilds with 72 plus raiding capacity. Those who are, arent going to perpetually back flag new members. They are cannibalising each other of already flagged players to maintain membership levels.</P>
<P>Go back to the pre pop EQ and revamp zones to provide modern progession pyramids outside of PoP/GoD and OoW. Make access easier in terms of keys etc and put graveyards in all dungeon or Planes zones. </P>
<P>Of course you wont have the expansion moneyspinners then.....</P>
