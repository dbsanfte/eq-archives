    <description>Is there going to be one? A lot of these issues could be worked out there by anyone, instead of having a beta type test. This server will be very close to a live server anyway.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Here's a thought...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I think progression IS the new test server.  The biggest problem on test has been getting players to actually play there.  All sorts of incentives have been offered, (free expansions, double xp etc...), but when I logged in and created a char there i found 2 pppl in new player chat, 24 in general and 3 on trader in the baz.  The most I have ever seen in pok was 12 players, usually fewer than that.  The progression server will allow the devs to have a large population start at lvl 1 , work through the expansions in an orderly manner, (non sequiter re : EQ?), essentially testing all the contnent and call the bugs to the devs attention.  This won't help with end game or high level content but that's not getting tested until live anyway since the population on test is too low to do it effectively. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This will give them a means to fix or not fix, depending on your degree of cynicism ,everything that doesn't work or used to work but has been broken over the course of the last several expansions.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Whatever their motivation, I'm just glad they are doing it and am looking forward to starting a char on the progression server.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Again, not bloody likely.&amp;nbsp; This will be a test server for all practical purposes over most of its lifetime.&amp;nbsp; If SOE was smart, they'd make you patch it through TestEverquest.EXE for at least the first 6 months it is out.&amp;nbsp; And then do a character wipe and move it live.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>I tend to talk in shorthand. Small mind I guess. I mean set the server up as a test server that any can access through the test patcher, then after the right amount of time, do a wipe and go live with it. During the test period, small problems that tend to be missed, can be found by nit pickers like me. This would also take the pressure off getting it done quickly. Anyone with a bad itch can scratch it.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;I think this progression server is basically going to be the test server.  It was said this was going to be the pilot server for the ruleset.  Sounds pretty close to test server for me.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I, for one, hope that we get a few devs working on the broken trilogy-era quests for this server.  The normal test server work serve purpose to this, but I like the idea :)</description>
