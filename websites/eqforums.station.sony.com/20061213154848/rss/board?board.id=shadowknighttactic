&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;The Anti-Newtank (j/k)&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Shadowknights tips and tricks from guys playing an SK at a good level.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Firstly wanna say that I'd like this to be a tips and tricks for players to use and for all old players and possibly even new players to make and contribute to. I figured possibly that I'd pick one area and give my personal tips and tricks for that area, hopefully other knowledgable SKs will pick up the ball and write other areas. I don't claim to know everything so if you have things to add, feel free. I'll write other areas I feel are missing tactics or are things that can be used in several possibly un-obvious ways if this doesn't get flamed to hell hehe.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size=5&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;The AE Taunt.&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Firstly this is a spell that taunts every mob near you (I'm not sure if there's a limit on how many but I dont believe I've ever hit it) with a non-damage spell which increases agro. Currenlty Dread Gaze and Vilify are on different timers so you can have them both up and use them more regularly. I cast vilify in 1.6 seconds and I'd recommend spell haste for SKs in a lot of situations, the quicker you get the agro the better.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Uses I've found for this are as follows&lt;/STRONG&gt; :&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The basic AE taunt&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;/U&gt;- more than one mob in camp, you want to have them all on you at the same time and don't want to change target. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;The pull catch&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; - There are a lot of areas in the game where you can use this spell to "catch" mutliple or even single mobs that you couldn't see on inc by timing their running speed and your cast time accordingly. Also, if you're in a place where you need to have good agro and sometimes you have a caster you can tag the mob with a normal agro spell and cast whilst it's running to you whilst you're around the corner. This has so many uses, on so many raids like mobs that pop and / or split near to your raid. Also whilst tanking a mob and more mobs are being pulled you can use this to hold agro without having to switch targets.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The Mez Hold&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;/U&gt;- This spell can be used with enchanters in several ways, as in "The basic AE taunt" to let mobs be mezzed and also once the mobs are mezzed you can continue to do this to save the enchanter if his mez is broken or wears without him re-mezzing by holding agro.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Quick mez breaking&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;/U&gt;- Another way of speeding up killing mobs while there are mobs mezzed in camp is by using the mez hold with the intention of getting high on the list so you can just run up to the mob and whack it and it's agro on you, this can speed up exp groups where a lot of mobs are being mezzed.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;The untanked identifier&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; (couldn't think of another name) - If you're in a raid and 4 mobs come (or whatever) and you have a load of people in there assissting off someone and a few tanks finding mobs to OT, identifying and grabbing one mob for you to OT can be made easier with this. Get near the group of mobs and AE, if one doesn't actually come out clear your target (by hitting escape) and go within melee range if one isn't being tanked you getting in melee range will a lot of the time have them turn and hit you (filling your target window) and you can cast an agro spell or two and pull it out of the crowd and OT. Obviously use this with caution and either where u think there's only one or two loose mobs tops or several light hitters.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;Get above healers on agro list but after tanks&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; - With practice you can use this (usually when you're not attack the mob in question e.g. when OTing and another mob is being killed closely) and stay above the casters on the agro list but after the tank for said mob just incase he goes down. Not always useful but when u're in a tight spot it can help. Also this is good if the other mob charms or mez's and the other tank loses agro.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;The multi-kite&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; - If you're kiting a lot of mobs you can stop and time this so it goes off and catches them and still gives you time to keep going without getting hit. Something which is much preferable is to use a bracer of the hidden here, you equip the bracer and target yourself or someone and chain cast it and the mobs stay on you (this I think is good for any clicky u can cast on others).&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;The controlled multi-pull&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; - If you're pulling a couple of mobs into camp, you may want to time "this kite" or even to stop and let one off on the mobs that you pull so that when you come in with a couple of mobs they stay on you whilst you get healed / they get mezzed etc. This is basically just to keep the mobs under a tighter leesh and more controlled. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;The controlled multi-pull extra mob&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; - If you're pulling and you've just tagged a mob and walk past another mob or have others inc you may want to use this instead of changing targets so the ENC / Whoever knows the first mob isn't your target and the mobs inc need to be mezzed as the snared one is inc....this is only really usefull when you're pulling and tanking at the same time I think. (Almost identical to "The controlled multi-pull " I know).&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Killing lots of low hp mobs with DS&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;/U&gt;- This used on all the mobs will allow you to kill a lot of low hp mobs with your DS and still get some heals. Some people my use it whilst PLing tho personally I don't need heals a lot may. A use of this may be AO2 for example where enuf mobs may take you down but if you get a heal or two you can get through it.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;OT one mob DPS another&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; - while OTing you may want to burn another mob down, using this carefully (so you don't get agro from the one your DPSing) can let you DPS another mob without having to switch back and forth to reagro it....if you need two up and how often you need to cast really depends on the amount of healing going on tho.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Other things I've used this for were to pull a lot of mobs away from a group, as the mobs got to me I HSed.....waited for the mobs to run back to the group then clicked my HS for them to come back, can give your group time to compose itself / mez or whatever tho a uber rare usage.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;That's all I can think of at the moment maybe I'll think of more later...it's late so my brain may not be working at this may all be jibberish...hope not tho. Some are rarely used, some everyday, I guess the usage depends on the players.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&#xD;

      <title>Newtank's Guide for Playing a Shadowknight.</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=shadowknighttactic&amp;message.id=750#M750</link>
      <description>I wanted to put down my strategy for EQ and give those who are having&lt;br&gt;a bit of a hard time some general advice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In general this advice is most valid for CASUAL players it will give&lt;br&gt;you a fighting chance to catch up to your friends and stay relevant&lt;br&gt;even though you are playing many hours less than them a week.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Newtank's Rules&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SOLOING&amp;gt;ALL&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For casual players the ability to solo well is very important unless&lt;br&gt;you have a wife or buddy or kids who will go where you want when you&lt;br&gt;want to get the grear you want (that others may think sucks). The&lt;br&gt;reason is that there is GREAT equipment that goes uncamped all the&lt;br&gt;time. In addition if you play 1 hour a night you can't tolerate the 45&lt;br&gt;min that many groups take to get going, nor the backlash you get when&lt;br&gt;you leave a group after 15 min of play. In order to catch your friends&lt;br&gt;you will need to get some of that great but undervalued equipment&lt;br&gt;while also maintaining a consistent exp flow. Grouping is fine but you&lt;br&gt;need to be able to go places that no one else wants to go and perhaps&lt;br&gt;hang out there for days to get that one drop to fill your biggest&lt;br&gt;hole. My fabled earring is soloable far below the level that it&lt;br&gt;becomes obsolete, I am still wearing it 6 levels above when I soloed&lt;br&gt;it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Being able to solo and survive in a zone far above where you should be&lt;br&gt;allows you to be where great drops are and often get what is rotting.&lt;br&gt;Often there are a few low level mobs in a zone intended to be greens&lt;br&gt;(but are solid blue to you) that you can solo while waiting for uber&lt;br&gt;group to decide that they can't use uber sk only item or uber item&lt;br&gt;they have already gotten 12 times before. I got a fabled neck this way&lt;br&gt;in cobalt scar because someone was farming tailoring supplies and had&lt;br&gt;gotten the item 5-6 times already. The rune 3 aug currently on many of&lt;br&gt;your magelo's is usable by 60 and is the type of item that I may go&lt;br&gt;and camp for days or go daily to check if there is a situation that&lt;br&gt;can lead to my getting it even though I can't tank any of the mobs in&lt;br&gt;that zone and would have difficultly finding a group there (although&lt;br&gt;after new expansions its amazing where you can go if you are not&lt;br&gt;afraid of death).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SOLOING&amp;gt;DPS&amp;gt;ALL.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In order to keep up with your friends you need to maximize your dps.&lt;br&gt;Your dps sets your exp rate, your ability to farm gear and your&lt;br&gt;ability to farm plat. Unfortunately because it is the most important&lt;br&gt;aspect it is also the most controlled aspect. Sony works very hard to&lt;br&gt;make sure that every single DPS is controlled IE you get this DPS for&lt;br&gt;free at level 60 but if you are in a good group you get drops of&lt;br&gt;higher DPS if you are in a raid you can gets drops of digher DPS and&lt;br&gt;if you are in uber raid you get drops of digher DPS. Thats why you see&lt;br&gt;people carrying the same weapon much more often than the same anything&lt;br&gt;else. The easiest way to get a good weapon is to learn how to&lt;br&gt;calculate dps from stats and save up plat and visit the bazaar OFTEN.&lt;br&gt;I bought the twin corpse pitchfork for ~6k at level 54 and at the time&lt;br&gt;it was the best droppable weapon (for level 54 as others got better&lt;br&gt;with level bonus). In my opinion casual gamers should almost never&lt;br&gt;camp weapons as the risk/reward is soooooo tightly controlled by sony&lt;br&gt;so as only the gimmie weapons can be casually aquired. Failing to do&lt;br&gt;this is the single biggest cause of gimp players. The current best&lt;br&gt;casual weapon at lvl 55 is the dark mace with its 180 pts heal proc&lt;br&gt;imo and I got mine for 2k.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SOLOING&amp;gt;DPS&amp;gt;All&amp;gt;HP&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although HP do play a real role on major tanking of major mobs in&lt;br&gt;general HP is all BS. The reason for this is that you still have to&lt;br&gt;heal the HP with mana that now won't become DPS. Unless you are in the&lt;br&gt;region of HP below 7000 and have a complete heal bot HP doesn't&lt;br&gt;increase your ability to do DPS over time. HP for some reason is the&lt;br&gt;most sought after stat for misguided players. For that reason all good&lt;br&gt;HP drops will be chain camped and in general its best to accept that&lt;br&gt;HP will be the last thing you work on. But don't dispare with low HP&lt;br&gt;you can still be the cleric's favorite because sony doesn't let&lt;br&gt;average HP fall all that far below uber HP IE maybe a factor of 2 but&lt;br&gt;if you get the rest right it won't matter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SOLOING&amp;gt;DPS&amp;gt;MITIGATION&amp;gt;ALL&amp;gt;HP&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mitigation (as defined by newtank) is the ability to be doing DPS&lt;br&gt;while not dying. One of your best mitigation tactics is Fear. If you&lt;br&gt;use fear well you can be naked with a good weapon and still fight&lt;br&gt;decent mobs and win. Armor Class is also a good form of mitigation. We&lt;br&gt;can all agree that one of the best forms of mitigation at low levels&lt;br&gt;is the regen on a fungi tunic (although what level this ceases to be&lt;br&gt;the case is not something we can agree on). Grouping is another good&lt;br&gt;form of mitigation but in general it will prevent you from getting the&lt;br&gt;best gear or best exp rate (for casual players)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SOLOING&amp;gt;DPS&amp;gt;MITIGATION&amp;gt;REGEN&amp;gt;ALL&amp;gt;HP&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is what makes me famous. REGEN is more important than AC because&lt;br&gt;SONY intends AC to be more important than REGEN and is more careful in&lt;br&gt;controlling risk/reward for AC. No Kunark era AC item is priced as&lt;br&gt;high as the fungi tunic because the regen on the fungi is more&lt;br&gt;powerful than its lack of AC. The reason for this is that there are a&lt;br&gt;lot of very powerful AC items and getting a few of them allows you to&lt;br&gt;totally ignore AC on some of your slots (chest ahem fungi). I use&lt;br&gt;regen here largely because of my infamy regarding wearing a fungi but&lt;br&gt;most regen at high levels comes from proc heals not straight regen.&lt;br&gt;Also with very good gear regen can be distributed to the point that a&lt;br&gt;fungi is no longer a good idea. But in general the fungi is the single&lt;br&gt;best piece of gear in the game if you take into effect its value from&lt;br&gt;level 1-75.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SOLOING&amp;gt;DPS&amp;gt;Mitigation&amp;gt;REGEN&amp;gt;DEX&amp;gt;ALL&amp;gt;HP&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dex is the greatest stat in general because you can use it in ways&lt;br&gt;that SONY didn't intent much more than any other stat. For example I&lt;br&gt;get 36 worn AC from my DEX/WA5 via stave of shielding and cresant&lt;br&gt;blades of luclin (about 2k each in bazaar). That helps to make up for&lt;br&gt;the 58 worn AC that I drop by wearing my fungi instead of my&lt;br&gt;Brestplate of Emblazoned souls. Procs also form the dominant form of&lt;br&gt;self regen and adds DPS with good weapon choice. Weapons Afinity 5 is&lt;br&gt;a must once you get to 55 imo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SOLOING&amp;gt;DPS&amp;gt;Mitigation&amp;gt;REGEN&amp;gt;DEX&amp;gt;DS&amp;gt;ALL&amp;gt;HP&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Damage shields in combination with regen/heals is pretty much the only&lt;br&gt;way around the very strict DPS enforcement for solo sk. DS is closely&lt;br&gt;monitored by SONY but the combination of DS and regen has not been&lt;br&gt;closely monitored imo and allows you to increase DPS by increasing&lt;br&gt;regen and having a DS.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SOLOING&amp;gt;DPS&amp;gt;Mitigation&amp;gt;REGEN&amp;gt;DEX&amp;gt;DS&amp;gt;AC&amp;gt;ALL&amp;gt;HP&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;AC really only becomes the dominant stat for a soloer/casual player&lt;br&gt;after regen and DS because AC is relatively easy to catch up to your&lt;br&gt;friends. Example, a AC30 earring has been available in bazaar since&lt;br&gt;luclin but because it has no other stats on it many players don't want&lt;br&gt;it dispite it having ~20 AC more than most high end earrings in that&lt;br&gt;slot at the same level. +20 can be spread around a lot of slots being&lt;br&gt;a few pts under for stats to achieve a net similiar AC/STATS with 1&lt;br&gt;great item and the rest relatively gimp. Likewise the LVL 45 SK armor&lt;br&gt;is pretty good AC but has no stats but provides very cheap AC for&lt;br&gt;lower levels. Don't get me wrong I believe in AC but I wear a fungi&lt;br&gt;and still have top 10 AC unbuffed for my level serverwide among sks&lt;br&gt;because if you are careful you can get good AC in unexpected areas.&lt;br&gt;Basically keep a ratio in your mind of what regen you would need to&lt;br&gt;tank naked when trying to determin how much AC to trade for regen.&lt;br&gt;Also if you are above the curve AC starts to matter less and is easier&lt;br&gt;to trade for regen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;STRATEGY&amp;gt;SOLOING&amp;gt;DPS&amp;gt;Mitigation&amp;gt;REGEN&amp;gt;DEX&amp;gt;DS&amp;gt;AC&amp;gt;AL L&amp;gt;HP&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Having a strategy for how you will avoid Sony's Time for result&lt;br&gt;equation is more important than even soloing. Items like the lvl 45&lt;br&gt;arm with unlimited snare are MAJOR MAJOR MAJOR(at lvl 45) if you use&lt;br&gt;them to enhance prolonged DPS and Mitigation via fear kiting which now&lt;br&gt;only drains ~half the mana. That wrist item, a good weapon and nothing&lt;br&gt;else will outperform many groups in ability to tank tough mobs over&lt;br&gt;time if you use the strategy effectively.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As part of strategy I would include itemization. The real trick for&lt;br&gt;being uber on a budget is understanding the effects of items and being&lt;br&gt;able to save up for the items that work and skimping on the items that&lt;br&gt;don't. In order to do this you often need to have more gear than you&lt;br&gt;can wear and master the art of replacing multiple items because that&lt;br&gt;+30 AC earring means you need to drop AC in another item and trade for&lt;br&gt;stats as there are no stats on the earring etc. Or you buy an item&lt;br&gt;just for its clickie.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To this end I believe that you want your best pieces to be separate.&lt;br&gt;For example you don't want your haste on your weapon because when you&lt;br&gt;out grow your weapon you lose your haste. Likewise you want your&lt;br&gt;effects on augments so you can replace the armor under them. You want&lt;br&gt;good +AC augs and poor armor so that when you level you can easily buy&lt;br&gt;gimp armor and put the augs on it for non-gimp results. When you level&lt;br&gt;with gimp Aug and great armor and have to replace the armor and are&lt;br&gt;screwed. Likewise taking a haste aug and a +30 AC earring at level 60&lt;br&gt;gives you an item with 2 outstanding aspects and allows you to free&lt;br&gt;your haste slot which usually is not a high ac slot and thus&lt;br&gt;outperform someone else with maybe 1-2&amp;#37; better haste but at the&lt;br&gt;expence of 10-20 AC even though they may have spend tens of hours more&lt;br&gt;than you getting the items...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Quick word on exp.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;AA&amp;gt;LEVELS&lt;br&gt;Casual players won't have someone to carry them if they end up gimp,&lt;br&gt;and carrying yourself out of gimp takes a long long long time. People&lt;br&gt;will say you AA faster at 70 so level first. But trust me you LEVEL&lt;br&gt;very fast if you have maxed AA for that level. So you have one set&lt;br&gt;that is slow and one set that is fast either way. The only advantage I&lt;br&gt;can see is that if you level up into total gimpness and have a guild&lt;br&gt;or friends who will help you out of the goodness of their hearts and&lt;br&gt;go bust their asses to get you gear then you only need to gear once.&lt;br&gt;But if you follow this guide you will see that getting gear is&lt;br&gt;actually rather easy and AAing in hard places lets you get higher than&lt;br&gt;level gear.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS&lt;br&gt;# kills&amp;gt; level of kills&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The exp equation for eq is (or was) roughly this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;exp~= mob level * mob level * zem * con mod&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But if you figure that blue is 100&amp;#37; and light blue is 50&amp;#37; (not sure if&lt;br&gt;this is still true)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So if con mod and zem were equal (they are not) then 10 level 60 mobs&lt;br&gt;is the same exp as 6.4 level 75 mobs. Now even if you factor in a 50&amp;#37;&lt;br&gt;con penalty for lvl 60 mobs which would you rather solo?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;20 lvl 60 mobs or 6.4 lvl 75 mobs?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PPS&lt;br&gt;exp to level used to be your level * your level * your level&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So that&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;level -  exp needed - exp to get to next level&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;     1         0             8&lt;br&gt;     2         8             19&lt;br&gt;     3         27           37&lt;br&gt;     4         64           61&lt;br&gt;     5         125         91&lt;br&gt;     6         216         127&lt;br&gt;...&lt;br&gt;...&lt;br&gt;60 216000 10981&lt;br&gt;61 226981 ...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;since (level +1)^3-Level^3= 3 level^2 +3 level +1 ~=3 Level^2&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You basically need to solo 3-4 evens to level (I know this isn't&lt;br&gt;strictly true at higher level) but when you look at mobs about 10&lt;br&gt;levels down you need 40-60 mobs solo with a 50&amp;#37; con penalty.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Hello Shadow Knights,&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Basically I'm coming back to EQ from a long hiatus. My girlfriend and I started new characters, and I liquidated everything not no-drop from my other characters to twink out our new ones.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I've decided to play a SK, simply because I always wanted to, and I'm sick of being a beastlord or bard (my original 2 characters).&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Anyway, here is my SK's magelo:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;A href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1322449" target=_blank&gt;&lt;FONT color=#00aaaa&gt;http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1322449&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Now, my girlfriend has made a DE Cleric, and a WE Druid. I bought top notch wis/hp/mana gear that can be used on either character (non-attuneable/nodrop). Which is going to be the best duo partner for me? Cleric or druid? She loves playing healers, so either one will be good.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I told her to play what she wants to, and from my previous experience, I told her a cleric would probably be best. However, I've been gone for a long time, and I'm not sure if druid healing/buffs have kept up with cleric.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Any advice would be great. Also, any gear advice would be helpful as well.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;!--  / message  --&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

I tried the new South Ro (god I hate the updated look!) but experience was only so-so.&amp;nbsp; Are any of the new zones good?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, I keep hearing about a damage cap but I don't know what means, really (I've only played cleric before).&amp;nbsp; Could someone explain how it works?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finally, I admit that I hate dying to guards because of faction issues but I wanted to explore with this girl if I could all the places that I didn't see when I was a goody two-shoes cleric.&amp;nbsp; Are Erudites KOS in places like Overthere and Neriak even if they are SK? Are there decent places to up faction with both cities?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks for your help!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Well since Fear is consta farmed for that AoN, it's been over a year trying to finish this epic bottle necked at this one item. I'd rather it be just a random 1/100 drop in fear than this current methood, but that's just me. Anyway, i got someone to MQ it for me, a DE rogue, he cons apprehensive to Duriak Bloodpool and he tries to turn it in. Duriek says "I have no need of this and returns it". So then he tries opening trade, stealthing, then turning in. Same response. Did SoE fix MQ'ing on this item or is this guy bugged and I should bust his face with my necro to reset him? Any responses would be very helpful on weather you have recently sucessfully MQ'ed the epic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

Innoruk says do this, etc..&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Does chosing a diety effect the SK in any way?&lt;br&gt;Would it effect the faction of the outpost when working on my Epic.&lt;br&gt;Would I kill my faction, if as a Cazicite, I hunted in Cazic Thule?&lt;br&gt;(I know, kinda unrelated, but still curious because the lizardmen in Feerott were indiff to me)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I've never played a SK past 10, but screwing around on one at level 25 w/ good gear was fun.&lt;br&gt;I enjoyed the necro, but will only play one as an iksar, and I need a class to play from the beginning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

maybe I had to do the 1.0 epic first so I searched up that guide and&#xD;
went to find the guy in OT to start it and finaly I get him to spawn&#xD;
and he won't talk to me either! Any help or advice here? Any help is&#xD;
