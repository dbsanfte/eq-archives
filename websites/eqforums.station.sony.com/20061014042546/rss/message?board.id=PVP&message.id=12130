      <description>The 'winners' were the top six players.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Four of the top six players were Darkenbane. Trindamere and one other&#xD;
were not, and they did not hack or SEQ. The four Darkenbane did.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
I was in Darkenbane at the time, and some of us did not hack. Darwoth&#xD;
being the most vocal among that group, and all of us backing him up. He&#xD;
fairly called Gray out several times over it.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;unknown about a discord server but it was stated (and i hope this isnt breaking NDA) that if a combine server went great that the devs would think of additional servers including mabye a pvp combine....but they stressed the word "THINK" . but there are alot like me that played zek....got pissed after pop and quit went to WOW yadda yadda and are returning just for the combine.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;From a finacial point of view the amount of re activated accounts just for the combine and the amount of sales of EQ titanium should give the chance for a pvp classic,combine or discord server a pretty good chance.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>I think that when a new PvP server is broached ingame, the most popular option is a Discord style server. &lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
I think, also, that because of very rampant 3rd-party software use, in&#xD;
addition to a number of other issues, we would fine that a Discord&#xD;
server without the finite time limit of its predecessor would quickly&#xD;
outlast its welcome. Don't forget that 4 of 6 Discord winners, as well&#xD;
as the majority of the most powerful guild, were blatant SEQ users.&#xD;
They said they had to SEQ to remain competitive. The worst part was&#xD;
that that statement was absolutely true.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>I refuse to accept the statement "had to use it to survive".&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
Grayrage and the members of Darkenbane willingly, time and time again,&#xD;
hacked and used whatever BS they could find to get ahead, and many of&#xD;
them placed.&amp;nbsp; Many guilds did this.&amp;nbsp; But there were still at&#xD;
least a handful of people who ranked among the top players on that&#xD;
server who did not hack or use any exploits.&amp;nbsp; I seriously believe&#xD;
that hacking ruins the game and that there has been way too little&#xD;
policing of it in the past, but I also believe that EQ is still worth&#xD;
playing despite this and if players simply took it into their heads to&#xD;
show a bit of class and decency in reporting hackers and policing their&#xD;
fellow players better, combined with at least a slightly better&#xD;
practice of watching players who are suspect, would alleviate the&#xD;
problem enough that it would work out in the end.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Gah, hit enter while typing the title and it posted the empty&#xD;
message.&amp;nbsp; Can a mod please add this to the first post or something?&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
A while ago Kyth posted a list of PVP issues and it included checking&#xD;
out the logistics and possibility/plausability of a Discord-type&#xD;
server.&amp;nbsp; Has any headway been made on this account/anything been&#xD;
said?&amp;nbsp; I figured Pinhead might know something or be able to find&#xD;
out.&amp;nbsp; While I doubt anything has been done, I've had a bunch of&#xD;
old EQ friends ask me recently if they ever reinstated the Discord&#xD;
server because they'd like to start playing again if they did.&amp;nbsp; It&#xD;
seemed worth checking.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
