    <title>Event Expansion Unlocks</title>
    <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Progression&amp;message.id=1164</link>
    <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Here is one thought i was thinking about for unlocking expansions, it probably will be based more on the population of the server on if it would be worth the time in doing. The idea is that after trigger has happened to unlock the next expansion that some kinda GM event type script will become active with lore / loot that will lead into the next expansion.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Take dodh to por.... be something like maylong leading army around the world like the war event scripts we have seen and lead into the opening on PoR... sure some kinda scripting to link expansion together could be made if there is enough support for this kinda server.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
