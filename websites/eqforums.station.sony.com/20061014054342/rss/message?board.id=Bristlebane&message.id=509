    <title>Returning to EQ</title>
    <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Bristlebane&amp;message.id=509</link>
    <description>Hello all. I'm returning to EQ after a two year lay off. I've missed the game everyday since I left and now that I have some more free tiime I want to play again. I gave my old account to a good friend so I can't go back to my old toons. I played a dwarf rogue to 58, a human cleric (Deda) to 52 and a troll shaman (Nomog) to 59.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I've started up a female barbarian shaman named Deda. I'm wondering if there are any guilds looking for an experienced person with no high level toons. I'm not to keen on rushing up to max level again. This time around I want to see the sights and do all the things I missed out on last time. If there are any mature guilds looking for a semi old man with alot of EQ experience but no immediate dreams of level 70 greatness please let me know.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks and see you all inside!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Deda&lt;br&gt;Barbarian Shaman&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
