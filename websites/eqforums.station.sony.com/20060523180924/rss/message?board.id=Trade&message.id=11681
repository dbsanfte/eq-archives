    <title>Trophy Certificates giving xp to the trophy now, is this how it works?</title>

    <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Quote from Patch:&lt;br&gt;- The trophy certificates will now give the trophy exp to get it to a percentage appropriate to your skill within the &amp;quot;Tier&amp;quot; in addition to setting the trophy to the appropriate level. This will not exceed 99% though, so do not hold onto the certificate, but use it before you gain more skill.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, at 282 fletching, I am 64% of the way through the expert level.  If I destroy my trophy and redo the expert fletching task, get a new trophy and then apply the new certificate, I will have ~64% on my expert trophy's evolution?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just trying to figure out if that is exactly how it works.  If so, I will redo my expert fletching task for a new trophy.&lt;br&gt;</description>

&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;that is about correct yes.&amp;nbsp; You should get a level 5 trophy with aproximately 64% exp&amp;nbsp;if you do the task again.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Should we really have to do this pita again.  Can you please make it so we can hand the hammer back in and get another ticket so we can get the hammer again with the xp on it.  Just flagg completion of the task to be either hand in all the stuff we who did this early already made or hand back in the hammer that is at 0% and get one leveled to the appropriate level within the tier&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;Also considering the&amp;nbsp;fast catch up that the trophy will do once you reach 300, it's not that big a deal IMO.</description>

      <description>Redoing the trophy isn't a big deal, if you take your time.  Every day or two, do some subcombines for the trophy and set them aside.  When you have them all done over the course of a few days and materials gathered and ready, destroy your current trophy and go and request the task again.   As long as you have some extra ingredients incase of failures, it shouldn't take you too long.  I know every tradeskill has differing levels of difficulty on the test as far as obtaining materials; however, the expert fletching trophy took me all of one hour to redo after I had saved up enough parts (that includes travelling to and from WFP and to the bazaar when I failed too many times on the GM trophy).&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;If you bother to equip the trophy as you do your skill ups it actually levels with you so it's pointless to waste time and money redoing the trophy test when all the combines in it will be trivial to you except for possibly 1 or 2.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;No.&amp;nbsp; As I have said before, I cannot think of a way that is not abusable, that does not take up extra resources.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Only non-exploitable solution I can think of would be increasing the catch-up rate on the higher level trophies to minimize the number of combines - the rate is fine (and perhaps even slightly too HIGH) on the lower level ones.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Would suggest maybe 150% rate on the 200-level trophy and 3x rate on the 250-level - this would leave someone at 300 skill but 1% skill on the 250-level trophy with 35-40 combines to catch the trophy up - which seems a little more reasonable given that redoing it would be about the same number of combines of lower difficulty (albeit with rarer components) combines.&lt;/div&gt;</description>
