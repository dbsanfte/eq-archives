&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Kyth if you could keep us informed on the progress of going through this second list that would be much appreciated.&amp;nbsp; I'm pretty sure many others like myself will go back and try daily to see if our rejected names(three variants with 'vyc' in them somewhere here)&amp;nbsp;have been cleared by paring down the 2nd list but if you can give us a heads up like say, "ok guys we just cleared another 1000, try now" that would be great.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>Beta sign ups and logging into the game are two different things, one is a web based form and the other game based.&amp;nbsp; Yes the log in server is having issues, or at least it was having issues, but the beta sign ups are working fine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you are trying to log in to The Combine to reserve a name, wait a few minutes and try again.&amp;nbsp; The name reservations will be available until June 26th so there is plenty of time to reserve a name.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Kyth, fast question on the "reserve name" thing.&amp;nbsp; I have my name on Terris Thule, Karana before that and now Prexus, also on a few other servers, but it won't for the life of me allow me to get the name on The Combine :( My hubby and I did a name search on the server and its not there, any help would be wonderful.&amp;nbsp; Its Nyrvana same as my login name here.&amp;nbsp; and NO it's not for the band it is for the Euphoric Feeling.&amp;nbsp; Will wait and see if you respond here before starting a whole new post.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Thanks in advance!&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>There is nothing I can do to alter the fact that a name is rejected.&amp;nbsp; You can, upon the opening of the server, contact CS and see if they can assist with rectifying the name though.&amp;nbsp; No guarantees it will be changed though as I am not sure what their policy will be for this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I recently started a new character on my old server. When the servers merged, I transferred off and had to change my name (too many XXX's at the end). I wanted the same name I played on for years and it kept getting rejected. I made a character of the race/class I wanted and submitted a petition explaining the problem. GM responded and the next time I logged on, she changed my name for me. I have heard of instances where a GM insisted a name change for even this reason would have to be handled throught the Name Change service and cost about $50USD. If you get that response, I suggest waiting a week and trying again, you just might get a different GM who is willing to help.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;Perhaps they're blocking it because it's the name of a music band as well as the term used to describe ultimate&amp;nbsp;inner peace in Buddhism.&amp;nbsp; I know, yours isn't the same spelling, but they may have upgraded the name filter recently to block that alternate spelling or something.&amp;nbsp; At any rate, it sucks not being able to use a favorite name on a new server :(</description>

      <description>Well, may I suggest an alternate idea.&amp;nbsp; Instead of having the GM's deal with the nightmare scenario of hundreds of name petitions once the server goes live (along with normal server petitions), you guys might want to start a thread somewhere on the main forums (and advertise it!!!!) where people list the character name in question (and just the name, no other arguments/junk) and you guys take it from there.&amp;nbsp; Whatever system you guys would use, doing over the course of the next month would probably be a much smaller headache then having to deal with it after the server goes live.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
