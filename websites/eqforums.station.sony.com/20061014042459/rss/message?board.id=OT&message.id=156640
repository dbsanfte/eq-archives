    <description>&lt;a href="http://www.cbc.ca/nb/story/nb-moosehead20060607.html" target=_blank&gt; The Moosehead Bob that is.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I hope this guy can get this sorted out fine. I'm sure he can easily prove he's had it for years (surely some photos will have the head in it). The law itself has good intentions, but it clearly needs a statute of limitations on the age of what's being shipped too in any case.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And go Moosehead for helping him out. They may be a small brewery, but they seem to get mixed up in a lot of different things... like the Beer Baron caper a few years ago when someone stole a truckload of their beer destined for Mexico. :)</description>
