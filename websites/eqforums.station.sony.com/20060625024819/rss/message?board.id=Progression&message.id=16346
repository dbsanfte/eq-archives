&lt;P&gt;mages 1-50s total destuction solo machine&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;55+ faction grind to be a CotH mule and mod rod vendor&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;although with the number of mages&amp;nbsp;projected on the combine (because of their early power) there might be some DPS raid slots to be filled in with the extras&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;can't speak for bards, but your experience with them will be a plus. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;but then again there's something to be said for trying something totally new.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;br&gt;i guess i will be going with a bard again . i love the class but did want to play something new this time around.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;i don't have a guild on this server, all though my old guild ROI is moveing to the server. i might be able to get back in if any of the old school ROI are still around. &#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS. i hope they don't unlock half the game in a few week's , beleive me if they are like old school ROI... the entire game will be opened up in 6 month's. probably less.</description>
