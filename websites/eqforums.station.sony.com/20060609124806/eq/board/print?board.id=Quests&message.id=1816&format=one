I think it's better to wing the people off of the armor progression quests about at 20 or so because that's about the time in which they can actually start getting their own upgrades as well as gain money reasonably fast enough to start buying or making better armor. Having these quests go all the way to lvl 50 would be more harmful than helpful. People would start getting to 50 and hit a brick wall when it comes to how to upgrade their character. Post 50 the upgrades are more sensitive to how well you preform than they are from 20-50. I'd rather have 20 or 30 levels to spend actually learning how to best to choose what is a good upgrade when making bad choices isn't going to be nearly as costly as it will no be if you don't have to start learning until you're over lvl 50 when many armor upgrades cost more than most level 50-60 players can make in a week while playing normally.

</BLOCKQUOTE>I much prefer being given quests to do rather than having to go to the bazaar. They could make them all require groups to complete the quests. They could be equivalent to or even slightly less/more than the cultural quest armors are for those levels, maybe even different stats, like focusing more on WIS for shamans. Many of the trade skill armors are fillers, not really meant for using as a complete set, especially if you want to focus on a certain stat. This give more alternate paths to getting armors. The point about grouping, learning how to upgrade your character, and costs can still be found. I didn't use every piece I got from the 10-20 armor quests.

<P>Requiring groups isn't going to make any difference.&nbsp; It's not a matter of using the bazaar.&nbsp; In truth there are already quests out there between lvls 21-50 that give armor pieces.&nbsp; What I'm saying is that by lvl 20 you need to start learning how you get gear normally.&nbsp; There isn't any need to have NPCs standing around in PoK or where ever handing out tasks, even group tasks, for lvls 21-50 to get their next set of armor from.&nbsp; Sorry but people are not going to bother learning anything about how to choose what armor is best for them if there's a new set of quests every 5-10 lvls to gear them up.&nbsp; They will just do the PoK ones and use those till the next set comes along or they run out of tasks they can do to get the gear.&nbsp; There is no lack of paths for gear between levels 20-50 like there had become for lvls 1-20 (mostly from the rise of rec/req lvls on armor).&nbsp; What this is asking for is to just make the progression from 20-50 more mindless than it already is.</P>

They don't necessarily have to go into the details they do for many of the armor tasks and the money tasks. They could merely just record the quest text you get while doing/getting the quest. If your suggesting a different method and window, sure, id go for that too. I don't want hand holding in doing the quests, I just want a record of the quests. Would also great to be able to look up past tests i've completed.<BR>

<P>They have that it's called the NPC Journal window, not that anyone really uses it.&nbsp; Lots of people claim it causes more lag when activated, and that it also logs tons of stuff that is useless too (which it does).&nbsp; The way that the Task windows work is they tell you what to do next after you do the last thing.&nbsp; So if anything your suggestion of a new window for quests would be the best way to go.&nbsp; The best way would be for it to work as a mixture of the NPC journal window and the task window.&nbsp; Have it automatically group the texts that are for certain quests into a grouping instead of having to flag them ourselves as such.&nbsp; It'd be nice if they had the texts from different npc's go into the correct order.&nbsp; Like if was doing a quest and you've done part that is at the beginning and then another part that is towards the middle, it would have the texts you got from the first npc's then ??? for the ones you haven't talked to till it comes to the NPCs in the middle that you talked to, then ??? for the ones after that again.&nbsp; The most important thing in my mind to make them actually quests instead of just tasks would be the fact that they would only update when you get the next set of text from one of the quest NPCs, instead of when you loot quest item_002 off of mob_8347.</P>
<P>They could also do something to improve the NPC journal by changing it so that the NPCs that give quests are flagged as that, and get listed in like a quest npc listing when you talk to them.&nbsp; Would save loads of time having to wade thru the death messages of the trash mobs you kill that just have flavor text on them.&nbsp; Speaking of which&nbsp;a filter to remove&nbsp;the text that is just flavor text from the NPC journal would be very nice.</P>
