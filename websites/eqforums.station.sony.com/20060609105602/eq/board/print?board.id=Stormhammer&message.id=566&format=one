				<DIV>NBG would be nice but it simply can not be done fairly on this server. First we have no idea what everyone owns or are even wearing. Second alot of those under geared people are here for a month just to get better gear and leave so it plays right into their hands, and last it's not real fair when the gms insist on staying with the 51+ level range on events. Obviously the lower levels are going to "need" things worse but in alot of cases those people may be alts compared to other people's mains plus you just automatically elimanate alot of people from every having a chance at anything. And no one stops the level 50s from rolling on some really nice gear that would actually be an upgrade for almost everyone.&nbsp; </DIV>
