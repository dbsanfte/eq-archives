Druid, cleric, shaman, paladin, ranger, and beastlord (non pet heal line) deserve to have a relatively higher hate component..&nbsp; The heals that can only heal your pet? &nbsp; Meh, they don't need or deserve to generate much hate.... pets are supposed to take mobs aggro off the owner, not give it to them.&nbsp; The pet only heal is so increadably limited&nbsp; vs other heal spells.. <b>I wouldn't bat an eye if SoE dropped the hate down to 1.&nbsp; That may be over doing it, but it should be considerably less than their average nuke generated hate.</b>&nbsp; A mage's damage output is generally based on 2-3 factors, Spells, Pet, and Evil Imp (if they have their DoDH spell). Imp hate is effecively 0 as soon as the spell ends.&nbsp; That leaves pet and nuke.&nbsp; You can nuke alone, you can pet alone.&nbsp; Neither work extrordinarily well alone.&nbsp; When a mage combines the two, adding in hate to pet heals ends up like the mage chain nuking, which is not good.&nbsp; I'm not saying it should have 0 hate and give 10k XP every cast or something... but hate on pet spells alters the way mages have played for a long time.&nbsp; After all of the other changes that have lowered mage utility (no not the pulling argument), letting them run around without having aggro issues from healing their pets would not be such a bad thing.<br><br>-Wyre<br><div></div><br><hr></blockquote>Healing pets aggro is already going to be dropped back down to 0 with the next patch, supposedly. The issue is no so much how much aggro healing pets generates so much as that it generates aggro at all.<br></div>
