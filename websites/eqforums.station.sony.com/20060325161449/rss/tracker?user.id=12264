      <description>Gloomingdeep is just for EQ, EQII has the Outpost of the Overlord and Queen's Colony (the former Island of Refuge) OotO &amp; QC share the exact same layout but have different mobs and quests&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gloomingdeep is not an automatic start point (you have to select to enter the Mines/tutorial at character select screen) but ah agree, it should be automatic so you have to free Arias (if you choose to go to your home city first on creation you miss that part, even if you are still lvl 1)</description>

      <description>We had a variation on British Bulldog, but it was called Bullrush over here, about the only difference was you didn't hold hands (ah believe it got banned in most schools because of all the injuries)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There was one huge empty section across the road from our house, totally overgrown with a few man-made hills, we dug tunnels in one of them until it collapsed (luckily noone was in it at the time), one group would have one of the hills and the other group had the other and we would have wars, either with clods of dirt or handmade toy guns&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A variation on Roll-a-Bat was with one person using either a cricket bat or tennis racket and the rest would take turns with throwing a tennis ball at the batsman's legs with the batsman attempting to hit it away, the person who either 'bowled' the batsman out or caught the ball would become the new batsman&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Freeze-tag with a tennis ball&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What's The Time Mr Wolf, this was played in the area in front of our classrooms which was seperated from the next class by a short brick wall (wasn't so short back then though), one person would be Mr Wolf and stand one one set of seats with their back to everyone else who stood against the opposite wall, we would take one step and call out 'What's the time Mr Wolf' and he would reply with the time until we got close enough and he called out 'dinner time' and chase us back to the wall, who ever he caught had to go sit beside him&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That's all ah can think of at this time</description>
