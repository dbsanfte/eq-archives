<P><FONT color=#ff0000>CLASS:</FONT> Enchanter<BR>&nbsp;<BR><FONT color=#ff0000>HP:</FONT> Very.&nbsp; Enchanters get beat on regularly.&nbsp; HP is the single most important stat to me.<BR><FONT color=#ff0000>Mana:</FONT> Secondary to HP.&nbsp; Most common cause of running out of mana is death.<BR><FONT color=#ff0000>Endurance:</FONT> Zero Importance. No use at all<BR><FONT color=#ff0000>AC</FONT>: I actaully place i,portance on AC. Typically our Soft cap is so low and return off AC over Soft Cap is so low noone bothers but I want to see as much as I can as every little amount helps.&nbsp; Would never chose a High AC item with less other stats on it however.<BR>&nbsp;<BR><FONT color=#ff0000>HP Regen:</FONT> I have always wanted more HP regen.&nbsp; Is easy to cap at CoA level and beyond.&nbsp; Because of that holds no meaning for me any longer.<BR><FONT color=#ff0000>Mana Regen:</FONT> SO easy to reach the cap this also holds no meaning.&nbsp; I prefer items without Mana regen on it as they have lower DKP costs in our system.<BR><FONT color=#ff0000>Endurance Regen:</FONT> Not at all<BR>&nbsp;<BR><FONT color=#ff0000>Strength:</FONT> Other than zones like Uqua STR is useless<BR><FONT color=#ff0000>Stamina:</FONT> At lower level was very important stat as it added the most important stat "HP"<BR><FONT color=#ff0000>Agility:</FONT> Matter in helps not get hit.&nbsp; so small effect Not one I worry about tho.<BR><FONT color=#ff0000>Dexterity:</FONT> Zero<BR><FONT color=#ff0000>Charisma:</FONT> Helps with Charming and Mezzing.&nbsp; Very important.&nbsp; One of the hardest to Cap at 365<BR><FONT color=#ff0000>Intelligence:</FONT> Semi important but have been at 500+ (more than 100 over cap) so long I nver even look at it anymore. <BR><FONT color=#ff0000>Wisdom:</FONT> Zero<BR>All stats are next to meaning less at my gear level. It is SO easy to cap them it isn't funny.&nbsp; The only Stat I do not have max'd before buffs is Wisdom.<BR>&nbsp;<BR><FONT color=#ff0000>Cold Resist:</FONT> average<BR><FONT color=#ff0000>Disease Resist:</FONT> above average<BR><FONT color=#ff0000>Poison Resist:</FONT> above average<BR><FONT color=#ff0000>Magic Resist:</FONT> below average<BR><FONT color=#ff0000>Fire Resist:</FONT> average<BR>I am a resist freak.&nbsp; Every enchanter I talk to has Posion as thier lowest resist even with Dead Man Floating on. Disease is always a close 2nd.&nbsp; Oddly ot my current gear level however Fire is suddenly become my 2nd worse.&nbsp; Now sure what changed.<BR>&nbsp;<BR><FONT color=#ff0000>Attack:</FONT> Nice for farming Greens/lt blue.&nbsp; Not game breaking<BR><FONT color=#ff0000>Delay:</FONT> Nice for farming Greens/lt blue.&nbsp; Not game breaking<BR><FONT color=#ff0000>Damage:</FONT> Nice for farming Greens/lt blue.&nbsp; Not game breaking<BR><FONT color=#ff0000>Range:</FONT> zero<BR><FONT color=#ff0000>Haste:</FONT> Nice for farming Greens/lt blue.&nbsp; Not game breaking<BR>&nbsp;<BR><FONT color=#ff0000>Combat Effects:</FONT> Nice for farming Greens/lt blue.&nbsp; Not game breaking<BR><FONT color=#ff0000>Shielding:</FONT> VERY important and hard to Cap, IMPOSSIBLE to cap at my CoA level.&nbsp; I place a higher importance on Shielding than Avoidance only becasue it is hard to cap.&nbsp; Avoidance is more important to have but WAY easier to cap.<BR><FONT color=#ff0000>Stun Resist:</FONT> Very important. The differnce between a wipe and a heroic save (or even locking down a simple single add) may be not getting stunned.<BR><FONT color=#ff0000>Strikethrough:</FONT> zero, I don't melee any mobe this is an issue on.<BR><FONT color=#ff0000>Spell Shield:</FONT> Very important to survive AE's on raids.&nbsp; However Our runes make this less important than other classes.</P>
<P><FONT color=#ff0000>Avoidance:</FONT> Of these effects by far the most important to get, however is also the easiest. I am nto even thru CoA and am at 160.&nbsp; 60 over cap.&nbsp; Am purposly not getting avoidance augs as other calsses need them more since it is harder for them to cap Avoidance.<BR><FONT color=#ff0000>Accuracy:</FONT> Nice for farming Greens/lt blue.&nbsp; Not game breaking<BR><FONT color=#ff0000>DOT Shielding:</FONT> Very important on raids, as our runes do not protect at all vs. DoT's<BR>&nbsp;<BR><FONT color=#ff0000>Skill Mods:</FONT> Is their any skill mod that has any effect in the real world at all?<BR><FONT color=#ff0000>Click Effects:</FONT> Love em, want more! Game changing-Click slow &amp; Click Mezz. Almost too much as it is a haves vs. have nots. Click Love all my clickies. However seems most other classes get clickes that add things thier class does not naturally get. Enchanter clickies seem to typically lean towards skills and abilities we already have. I may be Baised on that. (oooo would love more "Bedazzling Aura" type clickes!)<BR><FONT color=#ff0000>Proc Effects:</FONT> Nice for farming Greens/lt blue.&nbsp; Not game breaking.&nbsp; Love the Time lapse type procs for farming low level stuff.<BR><FONT color=#ff0000>Worn Effects:</FONT> Most don't matter squat to me Damage shield is&nbsp;Nice for farming Greens/lt blue.&nbsp; Not game breaking for me (unless there is one I am jsut not thinking of right now.<BR><FONT color=#ff0000>Focus Effects:</FONT> I will let others make the focus argument who are better than I, but as a whole when it comes to damage, caster Foci do not seem to scale near as fast has melee weapons.&nbsp; As far as enchanters go, I would like to see more foci with Tash aggro reduction to chose from, Also concider/thinkabout/look into adding Foci that effect runes. Most of the things Chanters do, there is not much scaling as gear progresses.&nbsp; Slows are the same percentage. Mezz only varies in duration by 1 tick on a high end gear chanter over a naked one.&nbsp; No foci effects debuffs or buffs other than duration which REALLY doesn't matter all that much.&nbsp; But adding a Foci that effects runes by X% would start to make so gear difference between chanters, in my humble opinion anyway.</P><p>Message Edited by Breez_Bayou on <span class=date_text>07-06-2006</span> <span class=time_text>12:44 PM</span>
