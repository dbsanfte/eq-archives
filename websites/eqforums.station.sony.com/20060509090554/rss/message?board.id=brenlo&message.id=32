&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I live 18 miles from our offices.&amp;nbsp; 18 short miles.&amp;nbsp; (&amp;nbsp;I will not go into further&amp;nbsp;detail&amp;nbsp;for fear that one&amp;nbsp;of you will show up at my doorstep some morning&amp;nbsp;demanding that I&amp;nbsp;fix your class, which would be impossible to&amp;nbsp;do when sitting around on my couch watching a movie and eating oatmeal as I am at this moment.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; MMMMmm Oatmeal, Cinnamon Roll flavored&amp;nbsp;good stuff and it&amp;nbsp;keeps you regular.)&amp;nbsp; A normal person driving within the government prescribed speed limits can make this drive in under 30 minutes.&amp;nbsp; Some people I know make it in under 20, I of course am not one of those . . .&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Anyway,&amp;nbsp; 18 miles.&amp;nbsp; When I was in the military (story for another time but for those in the know 11B Hoo Rah) We would regularly walk 18 miles in about 3 to 4 hours.&amp;nbsp; So in car: 20 to 30 minutes, by foot with a heavy backpack and other gear: 3 to 4 hours.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Here in San Diego, I have found the unhappy medium.&amp;nbsp; I have found the wonders of traffic.&amp;nbsp; I know I am not alone in this misery, that many of you also share the pain of being one with an automobile for extended amounts of times thanks to sheer volume or the unfortunate happenstance of others.&amp;nbsp; On one of these wondrous traffic days it can take as long as an hour and a half to go home.&amp;nbsp; 90 minutes to travel 18 miles.&amp;nbsp; In a car.&amp;nbsp; The length of a Disney Cartoon.&amp;nbsp; 3 episodes of seinfeld with commercials.&amp;nbsp; One mission in DoN.&amp;nbsp; The only pleasant side to this solitary confinement is that I can listen to music. In 90 minutes you listen 2 or 3 cds, or in my case the same one over and over.&amp;nbsp; I find it helps to reinforce the pain.&amp;nbsp; (Currently I am subjecting myself to the Incredibles soundtrack.&amp;nbsp; I like the campy James Bondish 60's sound and the movie was . . . Incredible HA HA HA HA)&amp;nbsp; I also get to see the scenery.&amp;nbsp; The very same scenery I see every day on the way to work and on the way home.&amp;nbsp; For 90 minutes each way.&amp;nbsp; "Oh Look!&amp;nbsp; That flower bloomed!"&amp;nbsp; or "Wow they paved that new stretch of the freeway that has been under construction for the last 3 years.&amp;nbsp; NEAT!"&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So I bet you wonder where I am going with all of this?&amp;nbsp; As&amp;nbsp;do I, as the Happy Halfling Juice (AKA Coffee) has not fully kicked in yet.&amp;nbsp; Oh wait there it is. . . Oh lost it.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Oh yeah.&amp;nbsp; So on those rare days I do make it to work in 20 to 30 minutes, I do not find myself at the office wishing that it had taken longer.&amp;nbsp; "Gosh, it would have been nice to have gone 5 to 10 mph the entire way so I could see how that bee hive near exit 34 was doing"&amp;nbsp; Nor do I lament the days when in the military that I would walk that far in the rain, uphill both ways with a backpack in the snow and no shoes.&amp;nbsp; I am happy for the days that I can make the trip quickly, and get to work or home with time to spare for other more meaningful things than catching up on my music collection.&amp;nbsp; Yet I see this waxing nostalgic for what was "lost" every day in EQ.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Not a day goes by that someone does not complain about the progress the game has made.&amp;nbsp;" I remember when&amp;nbsp;I had to run from Qeynos to Freeport with rancid meat hanging from my belt and wolves chasing me the entire way, and I liked it!&amp;nbsp; Anyone that doesn't have to do that is lazy, Hold on I have to get to POK so I can port to my raid!"&amp;nbsp;or &amp;nbsp;"Gosh I sure miss the slow boats that did nothing but cruise slowly from dock to dock, I wish they would put those back in so I could see them every once in a while when I cruise by at high speeds on my horse en route to a nexus portal."&amp;nbsp; As though, somehow, those unhappy mediums made the game better, let's face it, riding the boat in EQ was the equivalent of being stuck in traffic.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Sometimes I wonder if the game is not filled with&amp;nbsp;curmudgeonly folk who remember the days before remote controls and microwave popcorn.&amp;nbsp; The days when you were the remote control and scratching a record was a bad thing.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Folks who wax nostalgic for play styles or features that in many cases they can still choose whether to use or not (take that folks who want the portals gone, just don't use them) or were an impediment to fun.&amp;nbsp; Progress is not a bad thing (except in fashion where progress seems to be the return of styles from 20 years past, I can't wait to bust out my parachute pants.)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Enjoy the progress.&amp;nbsp; Do not begrudge those who may have it easier.&amp;nbsp; The game has changed for the better and rather than belittle those who have it easier than you did as an "EQ Kid", wear that as a badge of honor.&amp;nbsp; You were here when the game was harder than it should have been and you prospered.&amp;nbsp; You were the pioneers. &#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So next time you are critical of a change in the game, like oh . . . I don't know, maybe the bazaar.&amp;nbsp; Ask yourself if you dislike it because it is a bad change or simply because it changed?&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;There I did it again, I have infected you with another bit of Brenlo's wisdom.&amp;nbsp; Have a happy weekend and happy President's Day.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Brenlo on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;02-19-2005&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;11:52 AM&lt;/span&gt;</description>
