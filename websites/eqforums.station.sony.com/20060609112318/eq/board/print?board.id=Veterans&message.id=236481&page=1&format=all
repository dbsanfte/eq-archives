<P>I myslef find Iksars a wonderful race and go out of my way to help them in any way I can as often as I can. Iksars are a valued race and should have an even footing of respect with all other races in the world of Norrath...</P>

<P>one of my favorite past new class ideas, of course it's one of my own. Feel free to skip it if you've allready read it.</P>
<P></P>
<HR>
New class Idea? <STRONG>Acolyte</STRONG> &nbsp;<B></B>(<A href="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/acolyte" target=_blank><FONT color=#fac400>http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/</FONT><B></B></A>)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hybrid class, half cleric half necromancer. These are followers of innoruk that have been cast out from the plane of hate for being weak in the eyes of the mighty god. The <B></B>have been in seclusion in the firey pits of sol ro and only now have found there way back to the surface of norrath lead by a single high <B></B>that served only Innoruk but was casted out after inquirying too deeply into the plans of her lord. Until recently the skills have the <B></B>have been muffled by innorukks curse but she was able to keep her powers intact and spread her teaching throughout the ranks. 
<P>Abilities?&nbsp;&nbsp; Heals less than cleric but better than paladin and, using very high tiered rites, can resurrect the fallen. They can use curses and dark ceremonies to capture the essence of there enemies and use them to&nbsp;heal others. They can both do immediate heals like a cleric or damage over time/ heal over time the group. They can do impressive damage with spells at higher levels. Gear: Everything chain except chest and head which is silk for the robe graphic.</P>
<P><SPAN class=time_text><FONT color=#ffffff>Notes: The most interesting thing about the </FONT><B></B><FONT color=#ffffff>would be that they don't use the mana bar traditionally. Instead they use alot of regnants to perform there ceremonies and have to "charge" thier mana bar with to souls of enemies. In light of this they have no other mana regen much like a bard meaning having alot of mana would be imparitive. This pool of energy would be like a reserve only used for instant heals or quick heals when no mobs are present which would take alot from this pool. Keep in mind not all spells heal for the same amount of damamge. Some do considerable damage and "charge" the mana bar alot&nbsp; while others do marginal damage and have a HoT effect on the group. Then again some are just for the damage. <U>This class can fiegn death&nbsp;</U>&nbsp;however it's not the monk/necro get outta jail card we all think of, Instead this spell granted to </FONT><B></B><FONT color=#ffffff>has an 8 minute timer (reduceable to 5 minutes with AA's) and costs the </FONT><B></B><FONT color=#ffffff>a very stiff penalty taken from there reserve mana. </FONT></P>

<P>Actually I think berserkers were introduced to use the coding they developed in the melee re-envisioning that they felt too good for the other melee classes.</P>
<P>The 2h use may have been a factor though too...</P>
<P>As for new classes, please no. </P>
<P>As for new race/class combinations, sure <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0> I cannot understand why many combinations do not exist. Vah Shir monks are just one example. Why do various races not have bards? Can't dark or high elves sing? Dwarves sing no drinking songs? Sure High Elves are snooty, but they still follow Tunare.. why no druids? Why can't Wood Elves be clerics? I just do not understand <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-sad.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0></P>

				<DIV>First off, I agree that adding new races is the safest thing to do (of course, keep in mind that new races equals more memory to store more images in every single zone).&nbsp; If I had to choose a race, I would probably select orc or kobold.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>While new classes are probably out, if we were to add a new class, I would want to see a rune monk, which would be a wizard/enchanter/monk hybrid.&nbsp; This would be a silk wearing class that could cast multiple layers of runes of protection on themselves (like enchanters can, but better).&nbsp; The rune strength would be affected by their total hp (i.e. more hp = more powerful rune).&nbsp; They main mode of damage would be elemental fists (flame/ice/acid, etc) which is a self buff that increases their damage by doing a particular elemental type of damage when they successfully hit.&nbsp; You can add in some utility spells from wizard or enchanter to round out the class.</DIV>
