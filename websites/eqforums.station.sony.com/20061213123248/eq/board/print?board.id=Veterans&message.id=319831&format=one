<P>Whether or not an NPC is a raid NPC is based on the original intent of the content.&nbsp; The planes were raid zones originally and therefore the NPCs in there are considered raid NPCs for the purposes of regen.&nbsp; That you can solo there now is irrelevant.&nbsp; That's due to the&nbsp;progress and advancement of your character in relation to the content.&nbsp; At worst, the&nbsp;5 minute timer just ensures that raid content remains at least slightly more difficult than equivalent non-raid content even as time marches on.</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>yes, we know and uderstand that, and have been told that already by you or someone else, i do not remember who all has stated that but its been a couple times stated already. the problem is people at level 46 can go there and solo all the trash with ease, and have been able to since i started playing a few years ago. this is the only so called raid zone i know of with this problem, well besides the people that can solo anguish trash, but theres not many yet that can do that. i do understand your point, its just very frustrating and i personally hope you will change the stance on it, now or in the future. however im realistic, someday probably not to far away someone will be soloing anguish trash with complete ease and probably ask for the same thing there, however atleast thats a keyed/flagged only raid zone, where hate is not either of those.
