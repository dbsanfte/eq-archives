      <title>After the Transfers</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=PVP&amp;message.id=10665#M10665</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I logged onto Zek the other night and noticed that the server population took a hit again. Im one of those people who took advantage of the /movelog and got out. Looks like a bunch of other people did to. Several months ago when the first bunch of PvP changes were being discussed i made some posts about how the PvP servers need ALL players to succede. Meaning, the uber guilds need lesser guilds to prey on, the lesser guilds need even lower guilds and so on. PLease save all the comments about how all players on Zek are interested in the Quality of PvP and fight against equal or greater guilds. Thats a bogus statement. If that were true guilds like PDM and Defiant, from what ive seen the 2 top guilds on Zek, wouldnt have allied each other. If they were so interested in the Quality of PvP theyd stay enemies knowing full well that each guild is the only guild capable of taking the other. It was safer for them to ally and grief others. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Hate has been actively griefing the bejesus out of any and all guilds they can. When confronted about it the say "This is a PvP server if ya dont like it leave". Seems to me alot of people did leave. So now whats the fate of Zek? The higher end guilds have no intention of fighting same strength guilds, its too hard. Because they selfishly drove off the lesser guilds and players they have no one to feed on. So now the members of the higher end guilds will get bored once again and start quiting again. So Zek once again will wittle down to non existant server population and then what? You people left on Zek have no one to blame but your own selfish selves.&amp;nbsp;A productive server needs players of ALL levels and gear ranges to stay alive. Even the economy needs them. Those people who sell plat on the Zek will cease to make a profit from this game. If the only players they have to sell to are the same as themselves and dont need the crap gear they are selling off.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Ive wondered if SOE didnt see this comming a long time ago when the mergers were first talked about. Cant say as i blame them. Let one of the biggest points of headache kill themselves off and have no one to blame but themselves. Zek goes away and SoE doesnt have to deal with the complaining of everyone. Im not just refering to the lower geared players either. We all saw what happens when SoE gives the lower players a edge up on the high end crowd. They made it so spells land on everyone a little more often and the Uber guilds cried for weeks. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Anyway im glad to be rid of that mess. Thank you Sony for moving my chars. I wish all the rest of you luck on how ever your server turns out. You and you alone are responsible for the Fall or the rebuilding of it now. Be careful what ya say cause a bunch of us Did get tired of it, Didnt like it and by god we DID leave.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
