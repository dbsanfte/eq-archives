    <title>Sony doesn't trust Guides, player testimony, or screenshots. How are exploiters to be caught?</title>
    <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=SOE&amp;message.id=4378</link>
    <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Tonight (6/5/06) on the FV server, in Ruins of Takish a group of folks were obviously ghosting. They were taking down Criwea Strongbow without taking damage... blinking in and out of sight.&amp;nbsp; As luck would have it there were 3 guides on, so I sent a tell to the highest level one. Long story short, according to the Guide they are not allowed to travel around for investigative work.&amp;nbsp; I was told to submit a /report.&amp;nbsp; Umm... How exactly is a non-exploiter expected to get close enough to a raid mob to /report someone ghosting?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Heck, speaking from experience, even when a GM does get on in time they do nothing. I petitioned against some folks who were ghosting in PoF about a month ago. Within maybe half an hour I got a response saying they had no evidence. The kicker is, the exploiters were STILL in the zone, still ghosting! So I petitioned again, telling if they actually looked instead of saying there's no evidence they'd have their evidence.&amp;nbsp; Those folks are still around; nothing has been done.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So I have a few questions:&lt;br&gt;1- Why doesn't Sony trust their own Guides to go look and see if someone is exploiting?&amp;nbsp; Why tie their hands like that?&lt;br&gt;2- Why do Guides tell players to submit a petition when by the time a GM sees it the exploiters will be gone anyway, but if the Guide simply went and took a look they'd see it first hand?&lt;br&gt;3- Why do Guides and GMs frustrate players by asking for a /report, when they should know full well that (1) a report won't prove ghosting and (2) it's basically impossible to get close enough to a raid boss to do a /report anyway?&lt;br&gt;4- Why do GMs say there's no evidence instead of simply going to take a look?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If proof of any of these claims is needed I can provide numbers for the petition responses, and screenshots/logs of the Guide conversation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thank you.&lt;br&gt;-Nashwan&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Guides are no longer part of the ingame Customer Service Team, this has been the case for over a year. They do not deal with any ingame issues.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;If you have complaints regarding the quality of service you have received, we ask that you email eqcs@soe.sony.com with the details of the complaint and the ticket number of the petition you submitted regarding the original issue. This email address is not intended as an alternative method to the in-game petition system and should only be used for complaints regarding quality of service.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The eqcs@soe.sony.com email address can also be used to offer feedback and suggestions regarding ways to improve the ticketing system. Feedback and suggestion emails, while important to SOE and often quite useful, will most likely not receive a response.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
