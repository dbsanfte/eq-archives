<P>"As for pets not doing a lot of damage, that is nonsense, magicians are severely crippled without their pets. New pets can reach 300 - 400 + sustained DPS, without that the magician simply can't compete and should be left out of the raid."</P>
<P>I don't think my pet does that much damage, qvic focus, level 74 earth pet--I am crippled without him but not because of his dps.&nbsp; Its because he is my tank and holds&nbsp;a lot of my nuke aggro&nbsp;with his taunting. &nbsp; I crit over 10 k, that is where my damage comes from--the piddling extra damage from the pet is nice, Raging Servant is great when GoM procs (that is definitely 400 plus dps).&nbsp; But&nbsp; how do you get 400 damage per second from a normal pet?&nbsp; He hits something like 150--though I really don't care that much if he holds the aggro and lives, lol.&nbsp;&nbsp;Average hit goes down on raid mobs too btw.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>I definitely still do a lot of damage without my pet on a raid--I just can't help offtank adds, I can't assist chanters for mez, and I can't nuke quite as hard without pulling aggro maybe, although on raid mobs, warriors build some good aggro with their proccing, pets unneeded for that I suppose.</P>
