    <title>Suspension of Slime VII ....</title>

    <description>I used to use the Ensnaring Concotion 3 and had &amp;gt;75% success&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway I ran out and tried to determinte the highest ones i could make with vendor components just like the Ensnaring Concotion 3 thie potion is  Suspension of Slime VII. After spending 2 hours makign ~400 of these I head out to PoN to start pulling Gargoyles to farm Piles of gravel (Insert unfair drop rate rant here) and low and behold out of 50 throws not a single snare lands. So I went out to other places and again it was resisted EVERY time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;this potioin was of limited use before because of the very short duration of the snare but it was a good tool when used correctly but now much like most of the other revamped potions they are ineffective at the level they were before and the components to make the potions that would be effective are either too rare or not on mobs that are &amp;quot;farmable&amp;quot; in the quantities needed to make them useful.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Quite frankly i am MADDER THAN HADES about this not only did I waste about 2 hours making these they are now worthless....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;i am more and more disliking the alchemy revamp between the potions that are no longer able to be made in mass due to drop rates, the ones that were out right removed, the ones that are ineffectual due to the potions having there own caster level that is to low to be of any use, and the introduction of cast timers and recast timers on potions that did not have them before I think im pretty close to hanging up my bag and my orb.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;IMNSHO the potions that require drops should be special and make them worth the effort of farming the components but the vendor potions should still be effective. I think part of the problem is that the Alchemy potions are pretty much unique in their consumption, im ignoring food and drink because you can force feed to preserve the expensive or rare foods making them still worth it, and that is not really being taken into account. So far teh ONLY revamp potions that I feell are correctly balanced are the &amp;quot;class balance&amp;quot; potions (HoT Clairty Heal Haste HP/AC) which arent really part of the revamp. I still maintain that Heal Haste HP/AC potions are a little weak but that is a discussion for another thread.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
