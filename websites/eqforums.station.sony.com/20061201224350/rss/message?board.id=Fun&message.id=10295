&lt;P class=MsoNormal 0pt? 0in **SMURF**?MARGIN:&gt;Meanwhile as they get Arelat to help them, you find the wand that was missing, it was still laying in the corpse of the previous victim.&lt;SPAN yes? **SMURF**?mso-spacerun:&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;You touch your "brightly glowing orb on the pedestal" next to you to try and contact the gnomes but after you contact the Gnomes, you feel a sudden sensation and out of no where a figure appears.&lt;SPAN yes? **SMURF**?mso-spacerun:&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;The shape resembles nothing you have seen before. And it seems to be changing forms constantly. After what feels like hours, the apparition seems to settle for a humanoid figure. Not tall as a human, but not as small as a gnome.&lt;BR&gt;As its shimmering eyes fixates on you. The room grows colder and you feel a sudden shiver down your spine.&lt;BR&gt;Then you hear the chilling voice. A voice you haven't heard in many years.&lt;BR&gt;"So, we meet again. To your suprise it was &lt;FONT color=#ff0066&gt;Kytherea&lt;/FONT&gt; who was wielding a giant hammer &amp;amp; a hairless War Hamster.&amp;nbsp; Kytherea says, "I sensed you were using an artifact from the ancient Pantheon’s, so I used my own magic to transport to that power and the person using it.&amp;nbsp; You see that orb is only for those who possess the Scepter of Forbidden Knowledge"&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal 0pt? 0in **SMURF**?MARGIN:&gt;Since you are bent on using such an artifact for your own use, I guess I can let you use it providing you prove that you are capable of using it properly there for I have a quest for you.&amp;nbsp; First I need you to investigate the circumstances regarding the disappearance of Angie Mack, formerly of Halas.&lt;BR&gt;She has a rather nifty scepter I'd like to.. ehm... take a closer look at.&lt;BR&gt;Meanwhile the gnomes, after receiving your message, have started on their journey back to you.&lt;BR&gt;En route, they find a female elf that appears to be crying which with her crying the weather starts to rain almost like her emotions can control the weather.&amp;nbsp; The Gnomes stop by and ask what is wrong...................................&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal 0pt? 0in **SMURF**?MARGIN:&gt;Meanwhile you begin your trip to Halas picking up some barbarian illusion potions along the way in the bazaar since for some reason the barbarians&amp;nbsp;don’t like you too well.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal 0pt? 0in **SMURF**?MARGIN:&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As you enter Hala's you are suprised how easy it was to get information from the barbarians. After asking around with many barbarians you found one elder shaman who talked about Angie Mack and how she went into Permafrost to do research on Lady Vox who rules that realm but was never seen since.&amp;nbsp; So your journey continues, off to even colder place Permafrost, you hope the Dragon is not hungry as you set forth into her realm.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Meanwhile with the Gnomes, the young elf talks about her last memory of her father at a druid camp in everfrost against some Frost Giants. Her last image of her father was as he was being dragged into the lair of Vox, into permafrost.&amp;nbsp; Appears as she talks the gnomes learn the Father was trying to teach the young elf how to kite and kill giants when something went wrong and a powerful giant overcame him.&amp;nbsp; With some Luck the giants did not bother with her for some reason and she escaped.&amp;nbsp; Her mystical power she appears to have is also a mystery to her, but she thinks Karana has something to do with it.&amp;nbsp; The Gnomes decide to help her and start on there journey to Permafrost as well, using there magical Tinkering devices they zoom off.&lt;/P&gt;</description>
