    <description>&lt;DIV&gt;BB makes some really good points.&amp;nbsp; Unfortunately, his demeaning catch-phrases and generalization of who did/deserves/earned/said what really takes attention away from his arguments.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;- VoT is nowhere near EoA... if EoA was a clicky with a 10 minute load up time that took a buff slot, maybe we'd have a valid comparison.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;- Symbol of the Planesmasters doesn't stack w/ ShadowKnight self-buff-procs... I believe the same is true for Paladin self-buff-procs, but not exactly sure how much they value those... I know as a SK, they're invaluable to me.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;- Asking a Paladin (or any tank) to gear up in order to hold aggro is fine... asking anybody to wield the best and most potent aggro combination while demanding for hardly used Voice buffs and clicked buffs from 5 expansions ago&amp;nbsp;in order to '&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;U&gt;adequately&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;' hold aggro is too much.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I'm sure most of us here probably have a different opinion on what's "adequate"... especially when talking to classes that have gone about gaining aggro in completely different ways.&amp;nbsp; And just to point out that I'm not completely intending to hijack this thread... remember when discussing Warrior dps/aggro with shields that your idea of "adequate" might be completely different.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>In the event SoE does not make changes that reduce the insuperable disadvantages Warriors face when using a shield, the only real alternative is a new weapon type - 1 Handers with ratios simular to Knight weapons and procratemods sufficiently high so that we can continue to hold aggro and not lose 40%+ of our aggro procs when switching from DW to sword and board.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I thought it would be FUN to see us put together some "fan-designs" much like players of other games produce fan art. Obviously SoE is working feverishly on this problem and doesn't need our input, but it would be fun.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Endgame 1HS example:&lt;br&gt;Warblade of Rallos Zek&lt;br&gt;90DMG 35DLY 50AC +20 all Stats and Saves, 350HP, 350END WAR LORE MAGIC NO TRADE SHIELDMATE (can not be used with a weapon in the off hand) Effect of Anger IV (increase Hate by 800?) procratemod 90.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Just saying that if you used the &amp;quot;reinvisioned&amp;quot; discriptions, not only could knight's  feasably tank better than warriors but so could rangers. Calling Sk's unholy warriors for instance gives SK's the warrior discription automatically, since warrior's have a discription. They then add things to the unholy warriors discription. Leastways you could read it that way if one so chose. Not saying Sk's are supposed to be that or not but you could percieve them to be.</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;weapon ratios are not a good "fix" for warriors. a set innate aggro modifier&amp;nbsp; would mroe than address the issue and allow sthe devs to itemizae without wrorry of aggro/ a warrior with mock or bellow and the innate aggro modifier would still have the option of equipping hate augs to even further increse their aggro gneration. I do think however the devs dont wont us "locking down" mobs lke in the past . A fixed taunt. with innate aggro modifier along with focus efects available in tiemizatin, two different types of aggro disciplines&amp;nbsp;and living shield would give warriors the most comprehensive aggro package.&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Tornicade_IV on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;03-24-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;11:14 AM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;I disagree, any aggro ability should be on-demand, and not innate (unless it can be turned off)... it'll only cause problems for times when a Warrior's&amp;nbsp;not supposed to be tanking.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Raid encounters need to be balanced around aggro, since the DPS of a raid will be dependant upon the aggro of the tanks.&amp;nbsp; So if anything,&amp;nbsp;Warrior focus on proc aggro has led to a hindrance in cheap on-demand aggro, since with both, they could be producing much more than the devs would like.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The move from high aggro, to higher-dps w/ similar aggro, is always perceived as a sideways upgrade, but might be more balanced around the idea of trying to get the Warrior away from relying on solely procs......but with Endurance and melee re-envisioning looking like its still a far ways away from the last dev chat... it's not a good path to be heading down.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Which is why&amp;nbsp; the innate modifiers would&amp;nbsp; change depnding on the wepaon configurations.. two hander use is already flagged. shield use is alredy flagged with the&amp;nbsp; seperate ac modifiers. aggro is built through weapon ratios taunt and disciplines for&amp;nbsp; warrior as well as procs. You can take aggro from a voiced warior if the warrior isnt trying to keep aggro.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sk's are 'unholy&amp;quot; warriors who use fear and yadda yadda. Have to remember that when it states unholy warrior, the warriors discription is already a given since they are warriors. All they are adding in the text is the extra things the spell casting allows the unholy warrior. No big W little w just warrior's who use the unholy arts to enhance thier warrior ability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Has nothing to do with monks, Sk's start out as warriors and learn necromatic arts from there. If you want to be technical about it SK's are &amp;quot;specialized&amp;quot; warriors who use fear and intimadation with the aid of other necromatic spells to bully, maul and generally cause pain to  thier target.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Actually considering I checked the new 'reinvisioned&amp;quot; definitions it calls all three of the old 'hybrid&amp;quot; classes warriors, meaning most of thier abilities would come being warriors. In my case you would take the warrior difintion then apply the sk one right under it, but on the same page being it's basically an extended difinition.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Oh man Frodlin, you've made some pretty bad attempts at discrediting me in the past, but ac? You know darn well that knights have higher ac on most servers because they use ac aug sets, and augs, for the most part, have 0 impact on focuses, effects, ect. As if that wasn't enough, ac as a whole has virtually not changed since tacvi. 5-10ac differences don't show up when a single aug can compensate for up to 5 pieces of gear.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I won't deny that last bloods/bazus have done a lot to trivialize hard to find focuses, but realistically, very very few high-end raiders have more than 1-2 pieces of cultural. 500k per piece is just too much of a pita.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Personally, I'm in itemization crisis because I haven't had a mana preservation focus in a month or so. Before that it was FT, and I'm still holding onto an earing from Uqua because of the 3ft, despite having setup my 1 piece of bazu armor in anticipation of loosing the focus on it. I also have to find a way to pickup 3 shielding that I lost in favor of a focus. If nothing else, needing to accomodate a wide range of effects forces us into very narrow gear paths that can result in waiting months for a specific drop. So, please, never having played a knight at the highend level, you really don't know what you're talking about.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's Bloodeye btw, and no, Bloodeye requires an incredible amount of coordination and curing that you're not going to pull off in a pickup raid. Shyra may be doable with a pickup raid and a good tank (although I can't say I've ever seen it done), but it's not intended. I'm 99% positive that the 2 guards, who's ae's provide a very interesting dynamic to the raid, are supposed to be leashed to her, and the fact that they're not is an oversight that should in fact be fixed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by BertyB on &lt;span class="date_text"&gt;03-21-2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;01:27 AM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think thats partly why knights argu about 'tanking&amp;quot; the vision has us as primary group tanks as often as warriors are. The spells they have been giveing me allow me to do that quite well. However, I certainly don't overwealm mobs near my level like I used to be able to. It's a different game now, knights tank as much as warriors. That's how SoE want's it so they modify content, spells and gear configurations to ensure thier vision is the only vision that matters. Verant's isn't relavant anymore, they don't have any say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So we can all toot our own horns about our &amp;quot;class descriptions&amp;quot; all we like. Fact of the matter is, that the horn was removed from the car ages ago.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;BB, I think Frodlin hit the nail on the head. If all three classes actualy did what their orginal discritpion said they did, none of us would be argueing. The problem is because SoE's has this 'vision&amp;quot; about certain classes filling certain roles so everyone can do the same thing in 6 person groups with out haveing to use the same classes. That ends up causeing arguments about who should be doing what and why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is like Battletech in a way, each &amp;quot;mech&amp;quot; has the same weight allowance the difference is where you put that weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warrior's weight is more in armor and heavy primary gun&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sk's is more with multiple lasers, missle racks, rail guns...skimps on armor to max out firepower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's two different ways of fighting. The one is useing heavy armor and a decent sized close range weapon to live through long slug fests. The other maximizes firepower in the hope the fight doesn't last long enough to become a slugfest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reinvisionment has redefined us as classes so that our orginal 'definitions' no longer define who or even what we are anymore.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Sharbreena,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The difference is Knights aren't arguing for SoE to deliver what they were told they would get as part melee/part caster lowercase "w" warriors. and Warriors &lt;u&gt;are&lt;/u&gt; and have in the past argued that they should get what they were offered.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SoE didn't have a "vision" - it had a bad case of blindness. Hopefully that's over and done with. IF Knights had to skimp on mundane AC, HP, tanking AA's, and weaponry to acquire FT, Mana Pres, channeling, etc. you'd have a point. But they don't.&amp;nbsp; There was never ever any intention of Tank Parity (and Knight Spellbook Superiority). You can still look up in the FAQ and find a statement that there would not be dual classes or superclasses. Right from the very beginning Verant SoE made a commitment that there wouldn't be TankMages. Yet, we have PlateMonks and BattleClerics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some of these godmode players can't even bring themselves to admit that Warriors are supposed to be better tanks, do competative aggro with all of their weapon configurations, and do heavy melee DPS. They not only want to steal the Warrior Class Description, they want to prohibit Warriors from being described by it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's a sad day when Knights have co-opted so much of the Warrior Class Description after years of campaigning specificly for Warrior class defining capability that they are more like Warriors than Warriors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&amp;quot;IF Knights had to skimp on mundane AC, HP, tanking AA's, and weaponry to acquire FT, Mana Pres, channeling, etc. you'd have a point. But they don't.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;- Battleblade&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Could've fooled me. Maybe you should try playing one. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I am pretty sure he took most of that into account. The problem I think raid warriors face inparticualr is that they have to go high hp compared to AC on the bases of you can only mitagate so much. Don't get me wrong AC is really nice and I am not trying to through out the benefits at all, but&amp;nbsp;as mobss start hitting harder the need to the hp so you&amp;nbsp;can have enough of a hp pool for a heal to land. I don't think translate well to group environment where the extra hp buffer isn't as needed and AC gets some good value back.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;For mobs that hit for 5k or more the hp buffer starts to become very valueable becuase there is only so far AC can go before that hp buffer needs to start to&amp;nbsp;get bigger. Because of the warrior DI advantage this works out well in raid areas. Knights don't really worry about this issue because they aren't thrown against such mobs. You go towards the group environment where warriors have made their armor reflect the need for higher hp buffer against the AC buffers knights build becuase htey don't need much and you see some problems.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Again this is not saying AC is not important, in fact it is quite the opposite....but hp does mean a lot on the buffer because AC only goes so far.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>When it comes to tanking very hard hitting mobs, the thing that kills tanks is damage spikes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I define a dangerous damage spike as one high enough and prolonged enough that healers cannot adapt and heal fast enough prior to the tank dieing, or simply cannot keep up with the total dps of a mob.&amp;nbsp; 2000 mean dps is more like 1000-1500 dps most of the time, with nasty spikes to 3000+.&amp;nbsp; The 1500 or 2000 dps isn't what kills the tank.&amp;nbsp; It's that spike to 3-4k that erodes your hitpoints before healing can adapt.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You can reduce the probability of a lethal damage spike in two ways- increase hitpoints, or increase mitigation.&amp;nbsp; Both have a profound effect on reducing the probability of a lethal spike.&amp;nbsp; The difference is.... the AC will reduce the effects of the spike (smaller damage spike, or no damage spike), the hitpoints will give you a larger cushion to stay alive until heals catch up (the spike still happens, you just have a little extra time to live before the healing catches up).&amp;nbsp; Higher mitigation will also reduce the average damage/sec taken, reducing total healing requirements while tanking.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Defensive reduces the value of mitigation, by halving the DI value of a mob (that's a key reason knights are sometimes rabidly focused on AC).&amp;nbsp; However, even for a warrior... when do you need the extra tanking help from AC the most?&amp;nbsp; While under defensive, or after it's gone?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The thing is about raid mobs, they generally have high atk.&amp;nbsp; This *increases* the value and importance of AC.&amp;nbsp; On an exp mob, if you have pretty good AC you'll often start to get into the upper portion of the mitigation curve where mitigation starts to approach its limit and the slope decreases.&amp;nbsp; On a raid boss, you're not likely to reach that point until you're WELL past it in progression.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It may well be that a balanced approach to AC vs HP is the best way.... it's very difficult to prove the relative value of HP and AC, and then it only applies to a given mob under a given set of parameters (ie, it changes.... a lot).&amp;nbsp; I am, however, totally mystified by tanks of all types (including warriors) who ignore AC augs and focus fully on hitpoints.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyways, the fact many of the top AC people on EQRankings are knights does not indicate a class balance problem, as some would like you to believe.&amp;nbsp; It reflects personal choices, based on easily obtainable items that are available to all classes.&amp;nbsp; If a warrior has focused so much on hp that knights far below them in progression out-mitigate them- well, that's their own problem created by poor decisions on their part.&amp;nbsp; That top end knight that focused heavily on AC has dramatically less hitpoints than many other knights and warriors- they made a sacrifice for it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;When killing very hard mobs the thing that kills the tank is a Cleric late in the healing rotation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I couldn't get past your first sentence without concluding you didn't know what you were talking about. But then you've never tanked really hard mobs.... 8).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ANY mob a Warrior can tank for over three minutes a Knight can tank - all of them. How many "really hard mobs" die in three minutes? Not many.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's true SK's make sacrifices for AC. They sacrifice a tiny insignificant piece of their total class power for a shield. They sacrifice wielding aggro weapons with aggro augs for life gaining procs and lifegaining augs. They sacrifice endurance for mana 8P. They give up +10 ATTK stats for FT +5. They sacrifice wearing tank gear for earing tank PLUS caster gear all rolled into one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Poor SK's.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nice post Josahd. Awesome.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Battleblade-Xegony on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;03-22-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;06:19 PM&lt;/span&gt;</description>
