They were there and did just as much as any other player and there is no reason why they should not get the same chance as anyone else.  I agree there should be 62+ events, maybe the GMs will take that into consideration.

				<DIV>Why even have NBG on a pick up raid. It can't be enforced. For NBG to work on a Pickup it requires everyone in the raid to aggree to it. If one person doesn't agree NBG will not work. With a pickup raid of 40 to 72+ people there will always be someone that will not agree for NBG so it can't really be enforced. For that matter Large Guild Sponsered Raids don't have NBG for the very same reason. That was one of the reasons DKP is used. The idea of RL deciding on who is allowed to get loot and who don't in a GM event is not right and a person should be able to petition if they are ever refused loot if they have won that item fairly. After all the only person that can say if or if not a person that can atttend or loot at a GM event is the GM. Everyone that attends a raid has put in as much effort as the next one so everyone that participated in the raid should have egual rights to roll on the loot. Be it if the person is Time geared or still wearing newbie armor. Otherwise I'll just strip all the gear of my main and bring him to the events nekked. Roll on the NGB because atm I would need it because look, I'm nekked and then sale the stuff in the bazaar and put my time gear back on. But there will always be the few that will demand NBG, but you don't have to give up your looting rights, because of that and the GM will not enforce a NBG rule if everyone does not agree to it. I mean it's not in the TOS agreement that NBG must be used in GM events.</DIV>

<P>I was simply pointing out that people with good gear will rarely have a chance at anything while the lower levels get a chance at everything.</P>
<P>&nbsp;There are a lot of people that agree that the high levels and the level 50s need to be seperated for events and I would seriously doubt there would too many people that would actually perfer the 46 or 51+ events so why haven't they been changed?&nbsp; It is a simple request. It's more than reasonable and it would make the events much&nbsp;more enjoyable&nbsp;for most people. It also wouldn't require anything as far as expense or time for the staff.</P>

<P>I'm going to alter my answer a bit from earlier. The events that would support this are the ones where multiple GM's participate. It doesn't fit very well from a roleplay perspective if the guy you're trying to kill is also trying to control the loot distribution. Honestly, if its a free-for-all roll, I don't see why a GM would be needed, as I've never seen a problem with one of our raid leaders managing the rolls.</P>
<P>When it comes to loot, no one will ever be happy.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Level 50ish players get frustrated when high end raiders get items that would be of more benefit to them</LI>
<LI>Players who attend lots of events seem to get frustrated when first timers get nice items</LI>
<LI>First timers get upset if it seems like only long time players are getting items</LI>
<LI>Level 65ish players get upset if a level 49 character tags along, and then rolls heavily on items</LI></UL>
<P>Here's my position: </P>
<P>First and foremost GM Events are about roleplay and interactive fun, whether it be a raid, scavenger hunt, or a dungeon crawl. If you're worried about "gearing up", join a guild, its the best possible way to accomplish this. Now, I don't support the argument that GM events are not at all about the loot either, because as long as nice items are dropping, people will want to participate for a chance to win those items, lets try be realistic about this fact. Personally, I have no problem at all with a full out "greed" roll, once you win, you can't roll on another item in the event (naturally, rolling on the "best" items last). It is really the only "fair" way to handle distribution for "dropped"/tradeable items (you shouldn't be denied a reward for your participation, just because you have good gear already). I also think it would be appropriate if the GM's would "hand out" occasional items as rewards, based on participation. </P>
<P>I think that with OoW coming out soon and the level cap going up, you'll see fewer issues with lower level players tagging along on events that are designed for higher level players. However, try to keep things in perspective, we have a low population server, especially at lower levels, so if someone is trying to tag along on an event that they might be 3-5 levels away from the minimum on, let them. <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-wink.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0></P>

				<DIV>ok lemme say something as a vetran event goer ive got somwhere around 2500 events under my belt. ive won a whole 3 things on roll ive lead(been raidleader and incharge of lewt distroy next to the gm)&nbsp;close to 150 or so events. all the gear i wear none of ir was won on rolls i only had&nbsp;2 peices i actively wore after ive won the roll.&nbsp; there is gear ive won on events i will keep wearing till i am in time/god most likely these items ive been awarded for my roleplay skills and my attendance. these events were designed 2 make eq more fun for some of us vetran players that have been around for many years and loot is only secondary to me but i guess that comes w/ the fact that i only roll if 1 of 2 thing; 1. its a upgrade, 2. it's open greed roll cuz its not a upgrade for anyone their(that does not mean a upgrade for their twink only the toon that is present)</DIV>

				<DIV>first off, I don't play on stormhammer, I sort of wish I did, but the fact that I play two accounts just doesn't make it economically feasible.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The rewards for GM Events have always been really nice, in general.&nbsp; However, (even on the nonpremium servers) a better system could be devised.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>In fact, the framework is already in the game, thanks to LDON.&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>For stormhammer, an "event points" pool could be created, where by attending, players are given points to spend on gear they choose.&nbsp; Special rewards could still be awarded for people who would normally earn them, though everyone who attends would be assigned a number of points.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>All this would take would be a little work on the GM Client to allow a command to assign the points.</DIV>

				<DIV>Well hopefully today proved that there is high demand for tighter level restrictions on events. We had just under&nbsp;a full raid on a weekday morning for the 60-65 raid. Now if they can just tune the events to be at least a little challenge for the force assembled. It will also be interesting to see the turnout for a 50-60 event. Hopefully they will have one soon.</DIV>

				<DIV>Well this is my 2 cents worth.....&nbsp;&nbsp; I left stormhammer over the gm events - period.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Why ?</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>They were terribly unfair.&nbsp;&nbsp; After doing many many raids I&nbsp;got some potions and one ring that to my lvl sucked BIG TIME and 2 aa.&nbsp;Thats it! </DIV>
<DIV>the only 2 events i saw anything worthwhile 1.&nbsp; was in the arena it dropped great&nbsp; stuff and i was there for the whole fight but no one would let me in a group so no i couldnt roll.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
<DIV>I saw a druid get a mana +2 ring for healing the&nbsp;event host&nbsp;(I couldnt have possible win it cause im a mage)&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV></DIV>
<DIV>2.&nbsp; I did the second part of a two parter (I had to work the first part) .&nbsp; It was a long fight and took twice as much time as the first part.&nbsp; Well great stuff did get given away to the people but not to me cause I wasnt there for both.&nbsp; I got nothing.&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Thats the night i put my notice in to be transfered back and left stormhammer.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Who cares? no one but me -&nbsp;every time i play eq i remember these things and it makes me feel bad.&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><STRONG>I strongly support no drop stuff (my ring was)&nbsp; and i strongly support giving stuff to all that earned it even if you have to do it twice in a 2 part or 3 times in a 3 part everyone one should be treated fair!</STRONG></DIV>
<DIV><STRONG></STRONG>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><STRONG>As for the rest I dont even care about loot - I have been playing EQ for 5 years - But I do care about fair.&nbsp; Loot becomes obsolete over time...&nbsp;&nbsp; whats great today will be useless tomorrow.&nbsp; </STRONG></DIV>
<DIV><STRONG>
<DIV><STRONG></STRONG>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><STRONG>Heres an Idea&nbsp;- Why not let&nbsp;&nbsp;the classes roll before finding out whats on the table and a special item made up for the winners of that roll - maybe something that they could use?&nbsp; Maybe something unique?&nbsp; Thats what i though it was when i first came to stormhammer....&nbsp; But thats to simple having casters roll and finding a mage with a terrible robe and wow a brand new with a few nicer stats?&nbsp; </STRONG></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>the conversation would go like this - </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Gm - and proud as the winner of the roll for casters what item would best suit you.&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Proud - well my rings are kinda low would you have anything better than this (<FONT color=#6633ff>jade earring</FONT><FONT color=#ffffff>).</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#ffffff></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#ffffff>Gm - ah yes try this (&nbsp;<FONT color=#cc00ff>electified earing of the tempest</FONT>&nbsp<img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-wink.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0> on u might find it nicer!</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#ffffff></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#ffffff>Proud -&nbsp; Wow thanks GM this is something i can really wear.&nbsp; Thanks all to the raid it was very fun!</FONT></DIV></STRONG></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Grr I hate to see something like the events run so poorly! When they can be so much fun.&nbsp; </DIV>

				<DIV>Well Humper, I hear ya. I left SH too, both for the long LFGs and events. I actually won a roll for a spell. However I had all of my spells as a ranger level 60, a fairly easy task.&nbsp;So I asked for a higher level spell.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Mind you, the event became very difficult due to a major train brought by an unrelated guild. Lots of deaths. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>So, because it was taking time to sort out and the raid party was waiting for other rolls, I told the GM to deal with this after all other items were distributed since he/she refused to give me a higher level spell or a comparable item.&nbsp;Long story short, I got NOTHING out of that roll. I moved out that weekend and am still bitter.</DIV>

				<DIV>Greets,</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I've skipped the last few days events not for being upset just been sick irl.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>However,&nbsp; the majority of events I've been to lately... all the gm loot for the events has been no drop.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Actual drops on mobs that we've passed out have just been as normal.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I also took some time off because it got a bit petty over the no drops last few events I was at.&nbsp; Either people weren't happy, mostly because they wanted the item.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One time people showed up at almost the end of the event and caused major greif over loot which they hadn't earned a right to.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Just goes to show you most peoples motives I guess.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I've also seen people discussing no groups here and in pok etc... Personally I've had groups every day I've been on this server.&nbsp; Either with my now 62 beastlord... or being requested to drop down to my low 50's monk for ldon's.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I'm mostly grouped with the same people tho its about 12 of them in total.&nbsp; Only real problem I've had on storm hammer is noone I've met plans to stay here.</DIV>

<DIV>I made friends in SH at the end. It is not about getting my way; is about followup. The GM never got back to me.</DIV>

				You know, I've been looking through this thread, and having been around since the earlier days of Legends, I'm wondering...<br>What's all the bickering about over items? Back in my first few events, we were given no-drop coins that we would take to a certain individual in town, and we would get what would appear to be a randomized item, though it may depend on the coin you get. As I recall, I have an earring from such an event. Moving along to the 'dividing the loot thing'.<br>Uh.<br>While I'm all for fair play and all..<br>WHY?<br>I figure that everyone should get something, and loot probably should not be divided according to rolling unless someone can only get one item, and then have to stop participating. At which point I would hope that there would be enough rewards to cover everybody participating, which is how it was last I recall this sort of thing happening.<br>Personally, I get upset when I see say, a caster, rolling on a weapon for warriors. Why? I'm a warrior, and more than likely I could use that weapon more than the caster, who is going to go sell it in the bazaar for more than I'm going to be able to afford to begin with, and I wouldn't blame other classes for getting upset if the same thing happened to them.<br>Likewise, I would not roll on a caster-exclusive-use item because I know I can't use it, and while I could SELL it, I would also be depriving another player of a well-deserved item.<br>This is just an example.<br>'Need before greed' can't be applied very easily, but when it's blindingly obvious (A caster rolling on a well-known, high-end warrior weapon)...<br>Well, you see my point.

				<DIV>nbg is nice, in a group with friends or guildies etc.. an open event though where there are 20 to 100 people, I say rolling is the only way to go.</DIV>
<DIV>so what if that chanter got a BoC, yeah, there are lots of warriors there that would of liked it.. but that caster earned it just as much as anyone else at the event,&nbsp;they run to bazaar and sell it...thats their choice with the items they won/earned.&nbsp; Alot of peoples goals in this game is to accumulate as much riches as they possbily can, use that money on alts, themselves or just look at it <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0>&nbsp; Everyone has their own goals in the game.&nbsp; And with open events, everyone should have an equal right to all the loot dropped.&nbsp; The events are fun to do, but it is nice to know that you may have a chance at an item in the end.</DIV>

				Oh, yes, by all means, let the casters have a shot at things.<br>Just don't give them priority over it. If you only get ahold of ONE of a certain item (again, example is a blade of rallos zek), then the people who can use it (warriors) get priority on it. If there's more than one, sure, give the casters a shot at one.<br>The thing is there's no way to tell what you're going to need to give out until you see the group, and if they tailored to the group and judged by what they already have, everybody could get something appropriate for them. That may be a little too much work for the guides, though.

				<DIV align=left>I personally agree with the starter of the thread.&nbsp; All NO DROP items would eliminate the NBG/FFA problem.&nbsp; Events should be fun, and should offer a chance at upgrades for you charachter.&nbsp; I'm really not pleased that I pay $40 a month to listen to a bunch of people fight about loot that they want to sell in the bazaar.&nbsp; To anyone that says you can't please everyone... I leave you with this..&nbsp;&nbsp; The happiest group of players I've ever seen after an event was on a 30-40 event in splitpaw.&nbsp; The actor made a list of everyone in the raid at the beginning of the event.&nbsp; After succesfully completing the task at hand, every single person was allowed to choose between 2 of their SS quest armors.&nbsp; Everyone gets nice NO DROP reward.&nbsp; Everyone is happy to continue paying $40 a month for the chance of it happening again.&nbsp;</DIV>

If there's more than one, sure, give the casters a shot at one.<br>The thing is there's no way to tell what you're going to need to give out until you see the group, and if they tailored to the group and judged by what they already have, everybody could get something appropriate for them. That may be a little too much work for the guides, though.<br><hr></blockquote><br><br><br>While I agree, a BoC should not be restricted solely to warriors.  If you're gonna do nbg you do it the way it was meant to be done, the classes who can use it can roll for it.  While warriors are seen as the most deserving of them, I know plenty of bards and SK's who would love to have one.  Just remember you can't play favorites like that.  In a guild it's one thing, but in an open raid, if you're going to do NBG it has to be FAIR nbg.
