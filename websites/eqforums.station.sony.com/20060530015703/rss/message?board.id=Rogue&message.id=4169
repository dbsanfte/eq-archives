    <title>Are Rogues Rare?  No, they're well-done.. without the well part..</title>

    <description>&lt;div&gt;For those who still don't follow me.. Rogues as a class, are done.  And one of the two accounts I've been paying for is done.  I have one account left with a few weeks left.  It will be done as well.  Honestly, I don't know how rare rogues are, but they are about to become a little bit rarer.. at least in Everquest.  Will take a look at some of the other MMRPG's, and see what they have to offer.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I'm holding on by a thread to my account just waiting to see how the top 10 shake out before I decide to move on to another game. I **SMURF** sure don't plan to wait 2 or 3 expansions for improvments either.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;My account expires May 15. Since SoE will not let me change the expiry on my credit card without closing the account and restarting it (at a higher rate!), I'll have a decision to make then.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Right now I really am not sure how I'll decide... if we were at least getting meaningful acknowledgement of some of the problems (or that the Dev's actually consider them problems!) it would go a long way to help me decide to stay. Bugs being hard to find or fix I understand. Bugs not even being acknowledged I do not understand.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

Bugs being hard to find or fix I understand. Bugs not even being acknowledged I do not understand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's exactly the main issue.  Where are the developers?  Honestly, it seems like SoE has fallen apart lately, they seem completely disorganized and chaotic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>
