<DIV>ONLY GMs can solve the GM Event loot distribution arguments and HERE IS HOW:</DIV>
<DIV>Make all loot no-drop or don't hand out loot at all.</DIV>
<DIV>Since no loot at all would not be as fun, and we all pay a premium monthly price to have&nbsp;events with some loot,&nbsp;that leaves MAKE ALL LOOT NO-DROP by using the TREASURE CHEST method that has been used in recent weeks.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>People can say "all gm events should be NBG", but some people roll on the items they know they wont wear or weild and then rush to bazaar to sell them 2 seconds later and despite the best of intentions, even NBG ends up as a class-specific FFA.</DIV>
<DIV>People can say "all gm events should be FFA", but then people get mad when a caster wins a haste item, etc.&nbsp; even though all agreed to let it be handled by lotto and results in a similar "run to sell in the bazaar" situation.</DIV>
<DIV>People will say that "gms dont handle no-drop drops and that causes arguments on drops as the raid is trying to move".&nbsp; Yes, this is a new problem since the policy change and yes it brings out the ninja-looter in the jerks on that raid.</DIV>
<DIV>People can say that no-drop is less fun (and I would say that those who&nbsp;think that are probably not there to have fun in the first place and are not attempting to enhance the characters they brought on the raid, but rather are trying to increase their bank account or twink other chars).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Then its the droppable loot itself.&nbsp; It is almost always a CoF or a Fungi.&nbsp; Mr./Ms. GM, if you are going to put a droppable item on a mob, then please pick something that all classes can use and not constantly exclude a few classes - especially items KNOWN to cause loot arguments.&nbsp; CoF and Fungi tunic dropping should STOP RIGHT NOW.&nbsp; It's old, its boring, its unfair, and it shows how unimaginative the GM running that particular event is on that given day.&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>I swear there must be a "put a CoF on this mob and a Fungi tunic on the very next mob" hotkey that GMs use.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Simply put, even one jerk on a raid will RUIN&nbsp;a fun 3 hour event when it comes time to distribute droppable loot.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>GMs, please use the more recent tactic of TREASURE CHEST style of loot that is OVERALL BETTER FOR THE EVENT, rather than the "drop and fungi so I as the GM can get out of the raid while the players are left to fight off loot whores, latecomers, and plain rude behavior from other players".&nbsp; Whenever the "treasure chest opened by the GM resulting in no-drop items" method is used, there are no loot problems and it enhances the fun of the event (since its the GM awarding the prizes).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Don't let great events be ruined by the last 5 minutes of loot issues over droppable loot, YOU CAN SOLVE IT for the players and make everyone happier!&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>DEAD SERIOUS HERE.&nbsp;&nbsp;REMOVE ALL DROPPABLE LOOT&nbsp;ON GM EVENTS, &nbsp;MAKE IT NO-DROP STARTING TODAY!!!</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV></DIV>
