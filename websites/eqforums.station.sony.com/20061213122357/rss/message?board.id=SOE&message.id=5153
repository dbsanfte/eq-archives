    <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;I agree personal responsibility is&amp;nbsp;the biggest factor in the blog Smed was writing about. I do disagree with Smed that MMORPG's are not designed to be addicting.&amp;nbsp; The shear amount of time required to advance in MMORPG's, the promise of better loot, and the fact that you never really win the game makes it ripe for addiction. I remember playing Super Mario Bros for weeks unitl I finally beat the game&amp;nbsp; but you never really do that with a MMORPG. This fact does not override personal responsibility though because with out that anything can become addicting.</description>

      <description>Check out the latest web blog from John Smedley. John talks about personal responsibility and the choices we make in our lives about video games. With the latest rash of people blaming their mistakes on video games, John's point of view is dead on: it's about &lt;a href="http://blog.station.sony.com/" target=_blank&gt;personal responsibility&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
