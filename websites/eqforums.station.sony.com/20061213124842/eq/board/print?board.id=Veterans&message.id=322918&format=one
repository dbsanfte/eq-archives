You have no idea how much we liked the concept behind every event
(Shades of Calm is sorta the exception- we've sorta seen it
before).&nbsp; The tuning and time requirements for certain events -
thats a seperate discussion, but several are good, several are a bit
too long.<br>
<br>
Overwhelming Numbers - it took us a few to figure this out.&nbsp; New
mechanic we'd never really seen, and frankly, it was pretty **SMURF**
cool.&nbsp; I actually sorta stumled on it in the middle of one
run.&nbsp; The zombies were great - I think the entire guild got a big
kick out of all of it.&nbsp; It's tuned just fine btw.<br>
<br>
Hearol the Tactician - Great concept, really is, just needs tuning - I
would love to see an entire end-zone based around a similar concept.
(easier than the aug minis atm tho).<br>
<br>
Shades of Calm - This we've seen the mechanics for, so just sorta
ho-hum.&nbsp; I liked the "thought" behind it, because it fits the
theme of the zone - chalk it up as a flavor event.&nbsp; This is just a
bit too long imo (25min if I recall, I think 15 is a sweet spot for
these type of events).&nbsp; We liked the Maestro loot btw =P.<br>
<br>
Doppleganger event (forget name) - Seeing dopplegangers never gets
old.&nbsp; The great part is that your coding to duplicate npcs has
improved.&nbsp; The npcs all being monks btw was sorta funny (seeing
clerics and mages and wizzies doing flying kicks).&nbsp; This event -
it sorta has too high of a clearing requirement, but the actual event
is fine imo, has some fun mechanics that make it an engaging event for
everyone.<br>
<br>
Hufdan - It's nothing terribly complex, but we enjoyed it.&nbsp; It's got a good mix imo.<br>
<br>
Lorekeeper Grenwald - This event is the hardest in the first
instance.&nbsp; We really liked the concept behind it.&nbsp; The
various parts of the event were pretty cool also.&nbsp; I can't really
talk more about it other than to say that I think its tuned well, but
needed more debug time.<br>
<br>
Zone trash - The agro is simply insane here.&nbsp; That train of 40
mobs - is entirely due to how the mobs all agro.&nbsp; I guess its
great in that us monks get some work, but its also a bit...insane at
times.&nbsp; Heres an example - agro 1 roamer at the very entrance, if
its in the right spot, you can chain agro the ENTIRE front statue room,
and all 4 of the left and right side rooms.&nbsp; That's about 60 mobs
in total.&nbsp; The mob difficulty is appropriate though imo, but
density is a tiny bit too high (same as regular FC).&nbsp; It's
especially bad for the Doppleganger event, since it requires clearing 5
rooms and it's not on the way to either of the major named (I'd be fine
with the rest of the zone staying the same, but removing alot of mobs
from the Doppleganger's area would be nice).&nbsp; It's nice to have to
be concerned about zone trash though...<br>
<br>
The 2nd instance - it's also got some great concepts and mechanics we
found very enjoyable, but also suffers from some of the same problems
(tuning and a bug).&nbsp; It's not anything that detracts much from it
though.<br>
<br>
Overall though, you have no idea how much we've enjoyed this
stuff.&nbsp; Nodyin, did you do any events here?&nbsp; I was under the
impression that Celrak did all of them, but I like giving props to
everyone involved.&nbsp; The valdeholme stuff even - Merloc's Captain
event (wtb huge huge huge event like that), King Odeen was very clever
even if it had some bugs to start (Zajeer if I recall), Lorekeeper
Udengar was also pretty **SMURF** neat (no clue who did that) - I liked how
you tied that and Kangur together, and the entire script was just well
done.&nbsp; We didn't beta any of this and each new event was a nice
suprise for us.&nbsp; I hope the guilds doing it after us enjoy it just
as much, and feel the same thrill of accomplishment as we did beating
each new boss (and hell even the event minis).<br>
