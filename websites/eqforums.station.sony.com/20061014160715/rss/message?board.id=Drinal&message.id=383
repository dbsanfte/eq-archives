    <title>Looking for help finishing up my Coldain Ring #10</title>
    <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Drinal&amp;message.id=383</link>
    <description>Probably no one does this anymore, but kinda wanna finish up my Coldain ring since I now completed ring #9.  Bascially a good group of level 70s can do it now I think.  Currently I'm guildless(well, in Unguilded Portal Users, but they really not a guild, just created so people can use the guild portal and bank for ease of moving around) so can't really ask for help from a guild.  If I do manage to get help from anyone, whatever nice loot drops from the mobs we kill will go up to /random for everyone, I won't be rolling for nothing as I just wanna get my ring completed(for the clicky, got better wearable rings). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, I'll do my best to return the favor somehow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
