    <description>I have never seen wolf or bear tendons drop on the islands, although I have seen people say that they drop - and I have killed a fairly large number.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I also always found that owlbear tendons were faster to find than sonic wolf, and had other people bear that out.  Still this was all at least a year ago, and SOE do make micro-adjustments relatively often.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I emailed Sony, who told me to send a petition to a GM in the game, who then told me he couldn't answer it and "reveal game secrets".&amp;nbsp; How in the world is this a *secret*??&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;What I wanted to know is, do the owlbear and sonic wolf tendons still drop in Hollowshade Moor?&amp;nbsp; Can anyone definitely confirm this, as I've killed literally thousands of these things in the last week and never even seen a drop.&amp;nbsp; I've focused on mainly the wandering mobs, but I've also killed the stationary ones at the respective camps at times.&amp;nbsp; Can someone give me a current confirmation of whether these things are still dropping?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I don't see why it would be 'revealing a game secret' for a GM just to tell me "yes" or "no" about whether they still drop and the quest is still possible.&amp;nbsp; If they don't drop, that would just be a broken quest then and not a revealed secret, wouldn't it?&amp;nbsp; (is it just me or are these GMs no help at all lately?)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Although I haven't tried the quests "recently" as in the past two months, two months ago I was working on making my bard an honorary Vah Shir.&amp;nbsp; I have done the quests up to the weapon on my Vah Shir Warrior (about 18 months ago), my Vah Shir Rogue (maybe less than a year ago), made Ice an honorary Vah Shir Shaman (after the rogue), and now the bard...&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I can tell you definitely as of two months ago the tendons were dropping.&amp;nbsp; Because I was thinking of working with my beast when they dropped but I had no desire to start yet another alt at tailoring, already having two wisdom classes that tailor.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The secret to most of the sonic wolf bane drops is that they really only drop on roughly two mobs in the entire zone at any given time.&amp;nbsp; Don't waste your time with the caves or the beach, you will not get them there.&amp;nbsp; You need the roaming mobs that can be found on/around the hill between the fort/outpost and the caves at the one end of the zone, and the Grimling zone to the second stream bridge (second coming from grimling).&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I've spent considerable time in the Moor, between farming for Shadowscream drops, doing the quests, and having fun with the war.&amp;nbsp; The drops are beyond frustratingly rare, and I can almost guarantee you that it will seem you get more of the other classes drops than your own.&amp;nbsp; By my estimation, you have roughly a 1:6 chance of getting loot you want per kill.&amp;nbsp; That is not to say you will get the drop in six kills, statistics don't work that way, just that each time you kill one, you have that 1:6 chance.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;You will learn the areas where the mobsare, or bring a tracker.&amp;nbsp; I was able to use my ranger to find and quickly kill the mobs and then camp and switch characters (parked in handy location) and still get to the loot in time.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;But basically, the drop rate sucks.&amp;nbsp; I suggest you do what I have done for the past two years and document/record your success rates/failures, and do feedbac and submissions to the developers corner... &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I've killed the cubs in PC a few times, but I haven't yet seen the big one in there anywhere.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I couldn't find the sonic wolf tendons mentioned on Alla, but the quest itself requires them.&amp;nbsp; I don't know why sony can't just tell me if they still drop or not.&amp;nbsp; If they don't drop anymore, I don't want to be wasting my time trying to get them when I could be doing something else.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>Try reading &lt;a href=http://www.paullynch.org/cgi-bin/Everquest-blosxom/VSBL/30hmwar.story target=_blank&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, on the Hollowshade War.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Both sorts of tendons only drops from mobs outside the caves, from the cubs (etc).  They also probably only drop when the Moor isn't in a war status, and each set of mobs are in their home base.  If a tradeskiller has come along and started the war, and been inconsiderate enough to leave it running, you don't stand a chance of getting the drops.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I have the cloak on five different Vah Shir characters.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I can confirm the owlbear tendons were dropping about a month ago but I don't hunt there often any more unless someone is willing to pay for me to make them a part for the quest.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; It's been months since I hunted the Sonics to any extent so I can't confirm that they still drop but there is no reason they wouldn't except for a bug.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The tendons (or almost any of the quest parts) drop only in Hollowshade Moor and can drop during the war.&amp;nbsp; They are uncommon but I would not say they are rare.&amp;nbsp; They are most likely to drop from the outdoor wanderers in that species's home area but can rarely drop from any appropriate MoB.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Owlbear tendons are particularly difficult since the revamp as there are very few outside wanderers now and they don't stay in any one spot for long.&amp;nbsp; If you really need the tendons&amp;nbsp;try putting the owlbears on the Islands and the farming the patrolling owlbears there.&amp;nbsp; The drop rate isn't great but it's better than farming two wanderers for days on end.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;To put the owlbears on the islands you have to kill the Grimling Cheiftain and the then the five Grimling Defenders that will spawn in front of the Chieftain's hut.&amp;nbsp; In a few minutes some owlbears will come and take over that area.&amp;nbsp; If you are below level 50 this may be difficult and require help.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The Sonic wolf Tendons are a little easier as there are 4 wanderers that have a good chance of dropping them.&amp;nbsp; Two of them are near the Grimling Forest zone line, another spwans in the area between the rivers near where the rivers part.&amp;nbsp; The fourth&amp;nbsp;spawns between the Sonic wolf cave and the Grimling Islands.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;This quest is long, frustrating and painful but if you keep at it you will finish it eventually.&amp;nbsp; The cloak is very nice for the level you can get it at and my Shaman still proudly wears his at level 61.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Thank you for the info.&amp;nbsp; I've done the war several times, both helping lower people in my guild get the final drops like the Eye, and just for fun when the zone was empty.&amp;nbsp; The last 2 days I've put the owlbears on the islands and killed the ones on the very western couple islands... the ones that keep walking around.&amp;nbsp; Never seen the tendons though.&amp;nbsp; Thanks for letting me know they were still dropping about a month ago, at least.&amp;nbsp; I don't know why Sony couldn't have just said that instead of having me ask on several different forums and wait for someone to actually *know* and answer.&amp;nbsp; lol.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I'll keep trying then.&amp;nbsp; I'm wanting to finish it for my little rogue alt and a lowbie friend of mine wanted to do it too.&amp;nbsp; Thanks again everyone.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;We did the cloak quests, and we got most of the owlbear "stuff" from the cubs that roam the hill behind the fort.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>I have done the cloak quest for my BST and had no problem getting the owlbear tendons...I've since move onto the claws quests and am having a serious problem getting the wolf tendons...I have killed hundreds of wolves and have had only a handful of drops..They do drop...just very rare.  I always /ooc when hunting lfg wolf tendons...unfortunately I'm usually the only one in the zone.</description>
