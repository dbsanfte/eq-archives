      <title>Impressions of a Vah Shir coming home.</title>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In a lonely night of December I came home&lt;br&gt;I saw the walls of Shar Vahl carry the sky&lt;br&gt;My heart leaped in joy, once again filled with hope&lt;br&gt;Great was my confusion as I saw I was alone&lt;br&gt;No one on the streets but old citizens, no young Khati Sha&lt;br&gt;Or Taruun, no young Vah shir at all.&lt;br&gt;My heart cried. Our glorious city was left&lt;br&gt;And I felt my whole life was in vain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But I ventured on, through the Shadeweavers Thicket&lt;br&gt;And down to the Caverns. I killed the fiends that dwell&lt;br&gt;There under the surface, I swam in moldy waters,&lt;br&gt;I walked through the streets of the Shadowhaven&lt;br&gt;And I reached Nexus... I saw that everything changed.&lt;br&gt;What happened to our nation, to our children, to our hopes&lt;br&gt;Was everything wasted, am I cursed to travel alone?&lt;br&gt;But still I feel there is no better place than my home.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Farewell OWD Bash  Part 1 -------  Lady Vox</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Roleplaying&amp;message.id=12468#M12468</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;OWD is a group of raiders who have been raiding Lord Nagafen and Lady Vox on the Tunare Server for a long time but is not reaching the end of its run since I am the last Raid Leader for the group.&amp;nbsp; In tribute to OWD and in Thanks for them helping people get epic drops from these two dragons, my warrior, Shinu Swiftpaw, decided to pull off two final raids on these two dragons and slap them around with his shiny new epic swords.&amp;nbsp; Below is a fictional account of the first of these last two raids which was on Lady Vox on 10-29-06.&amp;nbsp; The actual raid took us about 6 hrs and had 1 wipe.&amp;nbsp; (Lady Vox was so glad to see us that she kept coming out of her lair to greet us.)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Old World Dragons:&amp;nbsp; Vox&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The Vah Shir quickly ran across the snowy landscape of Everfrost Peaks heading to the meeting place in Permafrost Keep.&amp;nbsp; This warrior's reputation had grown so much that even the Orcs that were patrolling hid in fear of him.&amp;nbsp; As he approached the entrance to the keep he slowed a little looking for signs of any of the Ice Giant guards.&amp;nbsp; Two of them were sleeping in the guard houses just inside the gate.&amp;nbsp; So the warrior slipped into the compound and into the keep where he found one that was awake and had apparently never heard the name of Shinu Swiftpaw.&amp;nbsp; Shinu was a White Tiger Clan Vah Shir who had grown up in Shar Vahl and then journeyed to Norrath to seek adventure and food.&amp;nbsp; The fight did not take long and Shinu had the Giant dead on the icy floor.&amp;nbsp; Shinu picked up what trinkets the Giant had on him to sell to the vendors in New Tanaan.&amp;nbsp; Shinu had a few minor cuts on him from the fight so he sat for a minute and willed them closed in the manner that Master Benniwan had taught him.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Master Benniwan was a Grandmaster monk of Quellious in Freeport who trained the Elite of the monks known as the White Lotus Clan.&amp;nbsp; It was there that Shinu met Soonguyen Ironfist who got Master Benniwan to take Shinu in for some training.&amp;nbsp; Master Benniwan's wife, Extacee was probably the most beautiful Vah Shir swordmaiden Shinu had ever seen.&amp;nbsp; Shinu thought it strange that one of his kind would join with a Furless but, then Shinu had seen quite a few strange things in his career.&amp;nbsp; Master Benniwan taught Shinu several mental techniques that would allow him to resist magical attacks better and also to help him heal a little faster for short periods of time.&amp;nbsp; Master Benniwan also showed him a few new tricks to add to his swordsmanship repertoire.&amp;nbsp; Shinu trained there until Soonguyen graduated and then the two of them took off for adventure.&amp;nbsp; Shinu had fought as a mercenary in several campaigns including the battle for the Firiona Vie outpost and the relocating of the Frogloks of Gukta to Rathe Mountains.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Just before Shinu joined the Frogloks in their fight, he had started gathering stories and information about two imprisoned Dragons in Lavastorm Mountains and in Permafrost Keep, Lord Nagafen and Lady Vox.&amp;nbsp; These two were imprisoned because of their desire to join their souls, which would have brought about another dragon like Kerafyrm.&amp;nbsp; Shinu heard tales of great treasures being held in their lairs and also that killing them would not invoke the wrath of any of the other Dragons of Norrath.&amp;nbsp; So Shinu sent spies into both lairs to find the locations of the Dragons' lairs and to see if he could form a strategy to take these two great Dragons down.&amp;nbsp; Shinu started gathering friends to him who were of like mind to take these two out and eventually called their band of mercenaries Old World Dragons.&amp;nbsp; After the battles in the Mountains of Rathe had ceased and the Frogloks had their home, Shinu returned to his home in Shar Vahl where he waited as reports from his spies came in.&amp;nbsp; Eventually Shinu had maps of both lairs and a listing of what creatures were there, their strengths, weaknesses and locations.&amp;nbsp; Shinu called together his band of adventurers and developed a plan for each lair and what it would take to pull each off.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Today they were to put their plan to the test on Lady Vox.&amp;nbsp; There would be only one attempt on this creature for to fail would be the death of the whole group.&amp;nbsp; Shinu had made several trips into the Keep and had retrieved items from there that he needed in order to secure his new swords.&amp;nbsp; That quest is another story.&amp;nbsp; As Shinu ran to the Goblin King's main hall most of the goblins he encountered fled in fear from him and his glowing swords.&amp;nbsp; A couple of the Goblins decided to try him but Shinu did not stop until he entered the main hall.&amp;nbsp; Once in the main hall, Shinu quickly slew the king and the High Priest and then started on the guards.&amp;nbsp; The Goblins that tried to engage him on his way in arrived shortly afterward but non were any match for the Blue-clad warrior.&amp;nbsp; Shinu had the main hall cleared in a matter of minutes.&amp;nbsp; All the fighting made him hungry so he started a fire and carved out a few steaks from the dead Goblins to cook on it.&amp;nbsp; As Shinu finished the last steak, Soonguyen arrived followed shortly afterward by the rest of the Old World Dragons.&amp;nbsp; The group could hear the echoing of the Ice Giant guardians’ footsteps as they wandered around in Lady Vox’s lair.&amp;nbsp; Once everyone was assembled, Shinu addressed the adventurers.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;“You all know the plan.&amp;nbsp; We only get one shot at this.&amp;nbsp; If we fail there will be no survivors, except maybe Soonguyen, to tell the tale.&amp;nbsp; Katayana, please assemble your team and prepare to begin.&amp;nbsp; Everyone else find a hiding place.”&amp;nbsp; Katayana traced the runes on her bracelet and an eye appeared floating in the air.&amp;nbsp; Katayana moved the eye through the hallways passed the giants, who gave it no notice and into Lady Vox’s lair.&amp;nbsp; Katayana played a low tune on her flute and bound her sight to Lady Vox so she could see what the Dragon Saw.&amp;nbsp; Soonguyen went to the door leading to the hall and opened it.&amp;nbsp; The Ice Giant on the other side saw the small Human and immediately attacked.&amp;nbsp; Soonguyen dodged the Giant’s blow and ran back into the main hall and played dead.&amp;nbsp; The giant came around the corner and saw Soonguyen lying on the ground and moved closer to investigate.&amp;nbsp; Thagar and Shinu jumped out of their hiding places and attacked the giant.&amp;nbsp; The rest of the band joined in right after.&amp;nbsp; Within a few seconds the Giant was overwhelmed and dead.&amp;nbsp; The group quickly removed the body and Soonguyen went back into the halls to get more Giants and eventually the giant spider that was in there too.&amp;nbsp; Several times during the course of this routine Lady Vox and her guardians came out to investigate but found the main hall to be empty as everyone had gone back to their hiding places and had the bodies of the giants hidden away.&amp;nbsp; Eventually it came down to Lady Vox and her guardian Giants left inside her lair.&amp;nbsp; Soonguyen and Tortuur went to the door of her lair where Tortuur cast his Feign Death spell and appeared dead on the ground blocking the door to Lady Vox’s lair open.&amp;nbsp; Soonguyen slipped inside and threw a dart at the Icy Terror he found not too far inside.&amp;nbsp; The Terror then gave chase to Soonguyen who ran from the lair.&amp;nbsp; The Giants and Lady Vox seeing the Icy Terror leave the lair followed behind it.&amp;nbsp; They all ignored the seemingly dead necromancer at the doorway thinking that another of their number had slain it.&amp;nbsp; The giants followed the Icy Terror around the corner where they found it poking a human that appeared dead as well.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;“All of you stay out here and keep watch.”&amp;nbsp; Said Lady Vox.&amp;nbsp; “I am going to take a nap and dream of that hot red Dragon Lord Nagafen.”&amp;nbsp; Lady Vox then walked back into her lair and laid down for a nap.&amp;nbsp; Tortuur Immediately stood up and ran back to the adventurers in the main hall making sure that the Giants and the Icy Terror saw him.&amp;nbsp; All of the Giants and the Icy terror followed Tortuur to the main hall where Tortuur cast his feign death spell again.&amp;nbsp; Thagar and Shinu again jumped out and engaged the group that had been brought to them.&amp;nbsp; The rest of the Old World Dragons group quickly joined in the fight which lasted several minutes.&amp;nbsp; The Giants and the Icy Terror were now all dead and nothing left between the adventurers and Lady Vox.&amp;nbsp; The group moved close to Lady Vox’s lair and could hear her snoring inside.&amp;nbsp; Shinu gave final instructions to the group and walked up to the lair door.&amp;nbsp; Shinu stepped inside the lair and looked at the sleeping dragon for a minute before he sharpened his claws on the wall, leaving deep gouges in the once smooth surface.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;“Here Leezard, Leezard!”&amp;nbsp; Shouted Shinu as he charged the Ice Queen.&amp;nbsp; Lady Vox upon hearing the taunt immediately woke up and turned toward the blue armored White Tiger Clan Vah Shir that was charging toward her with his glowing blades swinging.&amp;nbsp; Lady Vox blew an icy breath at Shinu who, thanks to some magical protections and the training he received from Master Benniwan, was able to withstand it with little harm to himself.&amp;nbsp; Shinu cut two quick gashes into Lady Vox’s scaly skin and called out for his friends to assist.&amp;nbsp; The rest of the band entered the lair and charged the Dragon.&amp;nbsp; The Tortuur sent his after the Dragon along with the others who had pets.&amp;nbsp; Katayana stood under Lady Vox and played her magical tunes that helped her friends resist Lady Vox’s magical attacks.&amp;nbsp; Haroel, Branlaven and Linsang kept their healing prayers going for the rest of the attackers.&amp;nbsp; Enamlat, Shinu, Thagar, Baeba, Waofno and Endered kept their swords slicing into the Dragon’s flesh.&amp;nbsp; Skwishy stood next to Katayana and kept casting her spells to damage the Dragon more.&amp;nbsp; After what seemed like an hour of constant fighting Lady Vox fell over dead.&amp;nbsp; The group was exhausted but still managed to yell out a shout of cheer.&amp;nbsp; The group divided up what treasures they found in the lair and Shinu cut up quite a few steaks from the carcass of the once great Ice Dragon.&amp;nbsp; “Great work all of you.&amp;nbsp; Let us go rest for a week and we will gather in Lavastorm Mountains at the Druid rings for our attack on Lord Nagafen afterward.&amp;nbsp; After he is done I think we will all be set for life.”&amp;nbsp; The Old World Dragons walked out of Permafrost keep and returned to their homes.&amp;nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Chapter 1:&amp;nbsp; Homecoming&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;"Father, the fate of Norrath is tied to the fate of Veeshan's children.&amp;nbsp; Even you should realize this."&amp;nbsp; Said the younger knight.&amp;nbsp; "Consult with Willa in this matter.&amp;nbsp; For the last four generations, excepting a good portion of your life, she has been a valuable source of wisdom for our family.&amp;nbsp; She even knows this to be true.&amp;nbsp; Did you not think that I would consult her before broaching this subject with you?"&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;"Son,” Said the elder Shadowbane, "for generations, not only have we Knights of Truth been the guardians of all that is good in Freeport but we have also been on the front line to help keep Veeshan's children in check.&amp;nbsp; Now you come to me saying you wish to enter the Holy Union with one?&amp;nbsp; How did you expect me to react?"&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;"Father, she is a child of Keikolin, one of the most noble of the Dragons that created the Drakkins.&amp;nbsp; Surely, you would know that I would choose a mate of such caliber.&amp;nbsp; You will have the opportunity to meet her soon.&amp;nbsp; She should be arriving today."&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;"Lord Gilliadson," interjected Willa, "think on this.&amp;nbsp; The Dragon Nest is no more.&amp;nbsp; When the last of the great Dragons passes from this world then Norrath will be no more unless this new breed carries the blood of Veeshan onward.&amp;nbsp; When Veeshan laid her claim to this world, she tied its fate to that of her children.&amp;nbsp; As long as her bloodline lives in this world, then this world will continue.&amp;nbsp; It is really a wise thing that Shadowbanes should have a hand in keeping Norrath.&amp;nbsp; In this way also, your family will still serve to keep Veeshan's children in check by aligning with the most noble of the line."&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;"Your wisdom is sound and irrefutable as usual, Willa.&amp;nbsp; However, we will discuss this further at the Homecoming.&amp;nbsp; In the meantime, I would like you to fetch Zephistophiles from his tavern.&amp;nbsp; I would very much like to hear his opinion as well when we have this discussion."&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;"A wise choice Lord Gilliadson.&amp;nbsp; Zephistophiles is about as well versed in lore as I am.&amp;nbsp; Master Darthan, if you would be so kind as to fetch our bard friend after your chosen arrives, I will prepare a room for him.&amp;nbsp; Your mother should be returning within the next few days.&amp;nbsp; With your permission, Lord Gilliadson, I shall also prepare a room for your son's chosen.&amp;nbsp; I can sense her presence in the Commonlands and she is coming to us now.&amp;nbsp; I know your feelings but I would respectfully suggest diplomacy until you get to know her."&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;"Unless she proves dishonorable, she is to be accorded the same respect as Lady Obsecion and Lutiana.&amp;nbsp; I will treat her as an honored guest.&amp;nbsp; My son is not known to be deficient in judgment.&amp;nbsp; When she arrives, bring her before me."&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;"So it shall be done."&amp;nbsp; Said Willa.&amp;nbsp; "I shall inform the staff."&amp;nbsp; Willa was about to leave when Gilliadson stopped her.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;"Tell me, Willa, what do you feel?"&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;"I think your son has made a very wise choice in this.&amp;nbsp; I can feel no malice in her from here.&amp;nbsp; The future of Norrath hangs in the balance with this new race.&amp;nbsp; There are benevolent Drakkin as well as some not so well intentioned but they all work together toward the same goal of preserving the Wurm Queen's bloodline and the continuation of our world.&amp;nbsp; Both are honorable goals."&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;"Thank you Willa."&amp;nbsp; The Halfling druid left the study to take care of the business at hand.&amp;nbsp; Darthan met the young Drakkin at the gate with an embrace and a kiss.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;"My beloved!"&amp;nbsp; Exclaimed Darthan.&amp;nbsp; "I am so pleased to see you.&amp;nbsp; Please come in.&amp;nbsp; My father is waiting to meet you."&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;"Vasha my love."&amp;nbsp; Said the Drakkin lady.&amp;nbsp; "I have missed being in your arms.&amp;nbsp; Please allow me to freshen up before appearing before your father."&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;"Very well my dear."&amp;nbsp; The two of them walked into the manor and Darthan called one of the maids.&amp;nbsp; "Ninae, please take M'lady to freshen up and then to Willa.&amp;nbsp; Willa will bring her to the study."&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;"As you wish M'lord."&amp;nbsp; Ninae bowed.&amp;nbsp; "This way M'lady."&amp;nbsp; The young servant led the Drakkin to a washroom.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;"My brother!"&amp;nbsp; Cried out a young lady knight as she ran up to Darthan, threw her arms around his neck and kissed him on the cheek.&amp;nbsp; "Is it true?&amp;nbsp; Have you really found a mate and have returned for Father's blessing?&amp;nbsp; Is she really a Drakkin?&amp;nbsp; When do I get to meet her?"&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;"Slow down Lutiana!&amp;nbsp; Yes to all and as soon as we are done meeting with Father."&amp;nbsp; Darthan held his sister in his arms for a moment and kissed her on her cheek.&amp;nbsp; "Is Mirthan returning home as well?"&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;"We have not heard from him in quite some time.&amp;nbsp; He is off with Shinu's son the last we heard."&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;"I wonder how that cat is doing.&amp;nbsp; I have not seen him since he was a kit.&amp;nbsp; If he is anything like his father, then he is probably deep into something."&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;"Probably so but Mirthan has never missed our annual gathering so if he is alive, he will be here."&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;"Very true.&amp;nbsp; I need to return to Father and present my lady to him.&amp;nbsp; I sincerely hope he approves."&amp;nbsp; Darthan went to the hall outside the study and waited for Willa and his companion.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;"You have chosen a fine lady, Master Darthan."&amp;nbsp; Said Willa when the two of them arrived.&amp;nbsp; "Would you like me to accompany you both in?"&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;"No Willa, we must do this on our own."&amp;nbsp; Darthan turned to his lady.&amp;nbsp; "Getting him to accept you is the easy part.&amp;nbsp; Father has always been a good judge of character.&amp;nbsp; Getting his blessing upon our Union is another matter.&amp;nbsp; If I were not his eldest son, I believe it would be a different matter."&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;"We will get passed this my love.&amp;nbsp; I know how important it is for you to have your father's blessing and I respect that.&amp;nbsp; We will also need to get the blessing of my progenitor as well but that should not be a difficult.”&amp;nbsp; The two of them entered the study and stood before Darthan’s father.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“Father, I would like to present to you my chosen, Vallea, Daughter of Keikolin.”&amp;nbsp; Vallea bowed before the great knight and lord of the manor.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“Welcome to my home Daughter of Keikolin.&amp;nbsp; Please, both of you take seats.”&amp;nbsp; Gilliadson yelled toward the door.&amp;nbsp; “Willa I know you are out there.&amp;nbsp; Would you bring us some to drinks?”&amp;nbsp; Gilliadson turned back toward the couple.&amp;nbsp; “Lady Vallea my son has told me much about you.&amp;nbsp; I have decided to give you the benefit of the doubt.&amp;nbsp; However, giving my blessing upon this Union is still a matter up for debate which will be decided at Homecoming.”&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“After what Darthan has told me about you I expected nothing less.&amp;nbsp; I will say that I love your son dearly and I honor your traditions.&amp;nbsp; Being a knight myself, I would be willing to go through whatever trials I must go through to prove myself worthy to you.”&amp;nbsp; Willa entered the room with drinks for all.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“Thank you Willa.”&amp;nbsp; Said Gilliadson dismissing her form the room.&amp;nbsp; Gilliadson then addressed his son.&amp;nbsp; “Your mother will have a say in this matter as well.&amp;nbsp; She should be back from Felwithe tomorrow.&amp;nbsp; I also received a dispatch from your brother but I haven’t told your sister yet.&amp;nbsp; He and Ralnu will be here in time for Homecoming.&amp;nbsp; He wants it to be a surprise to Lutiana.”&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“As you wish, Father.”&amp;nbsp; Said Darthan.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“Lady Vallea, I would very much like to have a conversation with you alone if you are of a mind to do so.”&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“Lord Shadowbane, I would be most delighted and honored.”&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“You conduct yourself with much honor and grace.&amp;nbsp; That is a good thing.&amp;nbsp; Darthan, I believe you have an errand to run.”&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“Yes Father.”&amp;nbsp; Darthan left the room and went to prepare for his trip to Tuneweaver’s Tavern.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“I will not keep you long.&amp;nbsp; I would not wish to keep you from seeing the man you love off on his journey.”&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“He is leaving already?”&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“He is going to fetch an old friend of mine to join us for Homecoming.”&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“Zephistophiles Tuneweaver.&amp;nbsp; Darthan has told me about him as well.”&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“I am curious about you.&amp;nbsp; Please tell me about yourself.&amp;nbsp; I know you were Human before your ‘awakening’ I would like to know about that part of your life.”&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“Well the short version is that I was one of the Knights of Love before I was invited to join with my progenitor.&amp;nbsp; So, it seemed only natural for me to continue as a Paladin in the fight against the unholy.&amp;nbsp; I met Darthan as I was on my way to Crescent Reach.&amp;nbsp; Darthan was well received among my new people.&amp;nbsp; Many there are familiar with the name of Shadowbane and after Darthan pledged to help us by keeping the undead Ogres at bay, many of those who were of darker persuasions previously in life welcomed him with open arms.&amp;nbsp; I myself fought side by side with him the entire time and have fallen in love with him.”&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“Being a Paladin does much toward your case.&amp;nbsp; But you must realize also that Darthan is my eldest son and also the heir to this estate that I had rebuilt.&amp;nbsp; This is going to take much prayer on my part.&amp;nbsp; Go now and see my son off.&amp;nbsp; We will talk more over the next few days and tomorrow you will meet the fairest lady in all the land.”&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“Good day to you Lord Shadowbane.&amp;nbsp; I look forward to meeting the mother of my love.”&amp;nbsp; Vallea went out to Darthan as he was preparing to mount up and walked into his arms.&amp;nbsp; The couple held each other for a few minutes gazing into each other’s eyes.&amp;nbsp; “Return swiftly my love.”&amp;nbsp; Vallea kissed Darthan passionately before he mounted his horse and rode off to Qeynos Hills.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;Chapter 2:&amp;nbsp; Reunions&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Lady Obsecion returned early the next day and went to her husband first.&amp;nbsp; “I have sorely missed you Beloved.”&amp;nbsp; She said as she threw her arms around his neck.&amp;nbsp; “I wish you could have come with me on this journey but I know that making sure that preparations for Homecoming are completed on time is important.&amp;nbsp; How are the preparations coming along and which of our children have arrived so far?&amp;nbsp; I also have a surprise for you as well.”&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“Well, my darling, the preparations are coming along nicely.”&amp;nbsp; Replied Gilliadson as he held his wife close.&amp;nbsp; “Willa has been most efficient.&amp;nbsp; Darthan and Lutiana are here and Mirthan is on his way.&amp;nbsp; He wants his coming to be a surprise to Lutiana.&amp;nbsp; Darthan also brought home a lady whom he intends to take as his wife.&amp;nbsp; You can meet with her at your leisure.&amp;nbsp; Now what is this surprise you have for me?”&amp;nbsp; Obsecion went to the door of their bedroom and opened it.&amp;nbsp; In walked two Koada`Dal arcanists.&amp;nbsp; “Sineliniel!&amp;nbsp; Elwinde!&amp;nbsp; By the sword of Marr it’s been a long time since I’ve seen you two!”&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“It has been a long time indeed Cousin!”&amp;nbsp; Replied the twins in unison.&amp;nbsp; “There is one other here to see you.”&amp;nbsp; Another Koada`Dal lady entered the room.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“Mother!&amp;nbsp; You have no idea how it pleases me to see you here as well!”&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“This is the annual Shadowbane Homecoming is it not and the fifth such?&amp;nbsp; I would not have missed this one for anything.”&amp;nbsp; Said Lady Mariel.&amp;nbsp; Gilliadson walked up to his stepmother and kissed her cheeks as he hugged her tightly.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“This is going to be a great celebration indeed but we also will have a very serious discussion at it and I am glad that my wisest friends will be in attendance to offer guidance.&amp;nbsp; My eldest son has chosen a lady whom he wishes to join with in the Holy Union.”&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;After the birth of Mirthan, the new council of Freeport restored the Shadowbane lands to Gilliadson and his family.&amp;nbsp; Gilliadson had construction on the new estate started immediately.&amp;nbsp; The manor house was completed first and Gilliadson’s family moved in.&amp;nbsp; The next month Willanaome revealed herself to Gilliadson.&amp;nbsp; Gilliadson was so overjoyed that Willa had been restored that he took her in as a member of the family.&amp;nbsp; The Shadowbane Estate was given the name Gil-Alani in honor of Gilliadson's birth parents at the suggestion of Lutiana.&amp;nbsp; Lutiana and Darthan grew to become Paladins of Marr and upstanding members of the knights of Truth.&amp;nbsp; Mirthan was enamored of the tales of his grandmother and those of Zephistophiles so he became a bard.&amp;nbsp; He and Shinu’s son, Ralnu, grew to be the best of friends and traveled together a lot.&amp;nbsp; Gilliadson was recently made High Paladin of the Knights of Truth.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Shadowbane Homecoming is a yearly event that was started when the Shadowbane children started wandering Norrath seeking adventures and lives of their own.&amp;nbsp; It was six years ago that the rebuilding of the Shadowbane Estate, Gil-Alani, was completed and Lutiana started her quest for her Fiery Defender.&amp;nbsp; Gilliadson made her promise to return home once each year on the anniversary date of her departure to share in a celebration.&amp;nbsp; The next year, Darthan started his quest and vowed to return for the celebration as well.&amp;nbsp; So was born the Shadowbane Homecoming celebration.&amp;nbsp; Two years later Mirthan started wandering Norrath with Ralnu and would return for the Homecoming celebration every year.&amp;nbsp; This year Obsecion decided to make this Homecoming celebration special by inviting Gilliadson’s cousins, old friends and his stepmother from Felwithe to attend.&amp;nbsp; Shinu, Whoos and their wives were sent invitations.&amp;nbsp; Obsecion knew that Gilliadson would send for Zephistophiles so she did not bother with his invitation.&amp;nbsp; Gilliadson invited Zeph to attend every year.&amp;nbsp; The celebration date was yet four days away.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“I must go meet with this lady who wishes to join with my son.”&amp;nbsp; Said Obsecion and she walked out of the room.&amp;nbsp; Obsecion knocked on Vallea’s door.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“Please come in.”&amp;nbsp; Came the call from the room.&amp;nbsp; Obsecion opened the door and walked into the room.&amp;nbsp; “Greetings Lady Shadowbane.&amp;nbsp; I am Vallea.”&amp;nbsp; Vallea said in perfect Elvish as she bowed to the Tunarean Knight.&amp;nbsp; Obsecion was surprised at first but did not let it show.&amp;nbsp; She quickly composed herself and addressed the young Drakkin.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“You greet me in my native tongue.&amp;nbsp; That is good.”&amp;nbsp; Said Obsecion in the draconic language.&amp;nbsp; “Has my son been teaching you?”&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“He has taught me your language M’lady.”&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“He has taught you well.&amp;nbsp; So, you are the lady who wishes to join with my son.&amp;nbsp; I must say I never expected him to choose a mate from among the Children of Veeshan.&amp;nbsp; Getting my husband’s blessing upon this Union is not going to be an easy task but if the two of you manage to convince him then that is good enough for me.&amp;nbsp; The fact that you are here now says much.&amp;nbsp; There is much discussion going on all over Norrath concerning your people.&amp;nbsp; I attended a council session in Felwithe while I was there on the very subject.”&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“M’lady just as there are good and evil in most other races on Norrath there is also good and evil among my kind.&amp;nbsp; One difference though we have all bonded together toward the same goals.&amp;nbsp; While I may not personally condone the methods of Shadow Knights I have had to work with a few to help clear out our space in Crescent Reach and did so willingly for the greater good of our people.&amp;nbsp; Does it make me any less of a holy warrior?&amp;nbsp; I think not.&amp;nbsp; I still stand by my beliefs of defending those who need defending and stamping out the departed that refuse to depart.”&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“You make your case very eloquently but what I really want to know is this.&amp;nbsp; Do you love my son enough to do whatever is in his best interest regardless of how it affects you?&amp;nbsp; It has been my husband’s intention that Darthan would take over the estate following the birth of his first son and I will not allow that to change.&amp;nbsp; We have just restored the Shadowbane legacy and we will not see it falter again in our lifetime.&amp;nbsp; I am not asking you to break it off with my son right now but what I am asking is would you be willing to do so if he cannot receive his father’s blessing?&amp;nbsp; You do know that he will not enter into the Holy Union with you until he does.”&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“M’lady I would not join with your son in Holy Union without the blessing of both your husband and Keikolin.&amp;nbsp; My progenitor has told me that if Lord Shadowbane approves then so will he.&amp;nbsp; But before Lord Shadowbane makes his final decision he must meet with Keikolin as there are some issues that your Husband should be made aware of.”&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“Have you told him this yet?”&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“No M’lady, I am going to inform him at Homecoming.&amp;nbsp; I am not trying to be deceitful.&amp;nbsp; I just do not want anything to hinder his preparations for Homecoming.”&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“Very well Lady Vallea, I will say nothing of this to him for now and give you the opportunity to tell him according to your plan.&amp;nbsp; For now let us be family.&amp;nbsp; Come meet my sisters Luminye and Silyene.&amp;nbsp; I have not yet told Gilliadson that they came with me.”&amp;nbsp; The two ladies spent the rest of the day with Luminye and Silyene.&amp;nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“Tell me Beloved, what is your impression of Vallea?”&amp;nbsp; Asked Gilliadson as his wife lay in his arms that night.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“I like her.&amp;nbsp; I think she would make a fine wife.&amp;nbsp; But she does have more to tell you which I promised to let her reveal to you when she felt she should.&amp;nbsp; Do not confront her about this.&amp;nbsp; She is honorable and will tell you what you need to know when the time is right.”&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“I will trust your judgment in this my love.&amp;nbsp; Now let us put this day behind us.”&amp;nbsp; Gilliadson pulled Obsecion close to him and well some things are just too private to tell.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Chapter 3: More Reunions&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Whoos and Sanlacy arrived the next day.&amp;nbsp; While age is difficult to tell on Frogloks, Barbarians of Halas showed theirs like their Human cousins.&amp;nbsp; Sanlacy was till quite beautiful for her age though the sorrow of burying her mother, Jildarie, recently still showed in her face.&amp;nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Gilliadson embraced Sanlacy when she and Whoos arrived.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“My deepest condolences to you Sanlacy.&amp;nbsp; We all felt the loss of your mother’s passing.&amp;nbsp; If there is anything I or my house can do for you please do not hesitate to ask.”&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“Thank you Gilliadson.”&amp;nbsp; Said Sanlacy.&amp;nbsp; “You have always been a true friend to us and there is no more that I can ask of you.&amp;nbsp; Time catches up to all of us sooner or later.”&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Shinu and his wife arrived the next day.&amp;nbsp; Shinu showed no outward signs of his age other than his fur not being as lustrous as it was in his youth.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“Shinu, old friend!&amp;nbsp; Welcome to my home!&amp;nbsp; Apparently my wife has been busy.”&amp;nbsp; Said Gilliadson as he slapped the Vah Shir on the back.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“Gilliadson!&amp;nbsp; I would not have missed this for the world!&amp;nbsp; I hear my son will be here as well.&amp;nbsp; Where is the kitchen?”&amp;nbsp; Shinu laughed.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“Anything you need just ask one of the servants.&amp;nbsp; I am sure Obsecion has informed them of your appetite.&amp;nbsp; Do not tell Lutiana about your son coming.&amp;nbsp; Mirthan wants his arrival to be a surprise to her.”&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“Ahh understood old friend.”&amp;nbsp; Shinu and his wife went into the manor to unpack.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Later that day, Darthan returned with Zephistophiles and Draigathar.&amp;nbsp; Zephistophiles’ once flame-red hair was now quite gray and his face was starting to tell the tale of years.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“Zephistophiles!&amp;nbsp; How are things at the tavern?&amp;nbsp; Still spinning tales of our glory days for your customers?&amp;nbsp; Draigathar!&amp;nbsp; Welcome!&amp;nbsp; My home is yours as long as you are here.”&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“Thank you Gilliadson.&amp;nbsp; The blessings of Quellious upon you and your house.”&amp;nbsp; Said Draigathar.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“Gill!&amp;nbsp; Me old friend!&amp;nbsp; Though, ye don’t look near as old as I do now.&amp;nbsp; Those blessings o’ Tunare and Marr have been good ta ye.&amp;nbsp; If ye start adventurin’ again ye’ll have ta take me daughter along ta be yer chronicler.&amp;nbsp; I’m too old fer that now.”&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“I do not think there will be any more adventuring for me Zeph.&amp;nbsp; I have retired from wandering but that does not say that there are no more deeds for me to do.&amp;nbsp; Who knows what Marr will bring my way?&amp;nbsp; For now, Willa has prepared your room.&amp;nbsp; Please go in and make yourself at home.”&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“Thank ye Gill.&amp;nbsp; We are looking forward to this celebration.”&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;The next day was the day before the Homecoming and Lutiana rose early that morning and stood at the gate.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“Look at her.&amp;nbsp; You know she is going to be there until he arrives.&amp;nbsp; Maybe you should have told her.”&amp;nbsp; Said Obsecion as she was looking out the window at her daughter.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“I have never refused a reasonable request of any of our children.&amp;nbsp; I do not intend to start now.&amp;nbsp; He will be here today and her reaction will be well worth it all.”&amp;nbsp; Said Gilliadson as he stood behind his wife and pulled her in close to him.&amp;nbsp; Gilliadson gently kissed Obsecion’s neck before releasing her.&amp;nbsp; “I will have Willa take her breakfast to her out there.&amp;nbsp; I know she will not come in for it.”&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;All that day more friends of Gilliadson and Obsecion arrived.&amp;nbsp; Azzor, whom Gilliadson served a tour of duty in Veksar with arrived early in the morning.&amp;nbsp; Leorah and Abeab arrived a little later.&amp;nbsp; Much to the joy of Willa, Snakepaw arrived with several kegs of ale.&amp;nbsp; The sun was going down when Lutiana saw two figures approaching from the West.&amp;nbsp; When they got close enough to be recognized, Lutiana’s heart leaped in her chest and she ran out to meet them.&amp;nbsp; Lutiana jumped into the arms of her little brother, who was not so little now.&amp;nbsp; Gilliadson and Obsecion watched the scene from their bedroom window.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“See?&amp;nbsp; I told you it would be well worth it.”&amp;nbsp; Remarked Gilliadson.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“Yes you did.”&amp;nbsp; Said Obsecion as she rubbed his shoulders.&amp;nbsp; “We shall let those two catch up and we will welcome our son home in the morning.&amp;nbsp; Now come to bed and remind me how much you love me.”&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Chapter 4:&amp;nbsp; Crescent Reach&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“Lord Gilliadson I am sorry I have not been able to bring this up to you before now and I was not aware of how big this celebration was going to be but we need to make a quick trip to Crescent Reach.&amp;nbsp; You must meet with Keikolin before you have any discussion and come to any decision regarding whether you will bless our Union.&amp;nbsp; I brought a few spells for Willanaome that she could use to transport us to Blightfire Moor.&amp;nbsp; From there, it is a run of an hour to Crescent Reach with bard assistance.“&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“Well then we had better get moving.&amp;nbsp; Something that is this important I think I will want Zephistophiles, Willa and my wife along.&amp;nbsp; We should be back in plenty of time for the gathering tonight.”&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“I believe we will.&amp;nbsp; I can have Willa bind me here and we can have my brother port us all back.”&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“Sounds like a plan to me.&amp;nbsp; I am sorry I did not give you the opportunity to bring this up before now.&amp;nbsp; Things have been quite busy here.”&amp;nbsp; The five of them gathered together and Vallea handed the scrolls to Willa who then copied them into her spell book.&amp;nbsp; Willa took a few moments to memorize a few spells and then started casting.&amp;nbsp; Vallea, Darthan and Zephistophiles were spirit bound in the manor.&amp;nbsp; Willa then cast the portal spell for Blightfire Moor.&amp;nbsp; The party appeared in the middle of a set of druid rings on a hill.&amp;nbsp; Before them was an ancient Treant.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“Be careful out there.”&amp;nbsp; Warned the Treant.&amp;nbsp; “All of the other Treants out there have been corrupted and are rotting away.”&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“Thank you for the warning.”&amp;nbsp; Said Willa.&amp;nbsp; Zephistophiles pulled out his drum and started beating a cadence on it.&amp;nbsp; The group’s legs were filled with energy and they started running toward Crescent Reach.&amp;nbsp; When they entered the city many Drakkin came and welcomed Darthan and Vallea back.&amp;nbsp; Gilliadson was impressed with the reaction.&amp;nbsp; Many of them stared in awe at Gilliadson once they found out who he was.&amp;nbsp; Vallea led the group through the city and into the Grove where the six creators of the Drakkin were.&amp;nbsp; Vallea brought the group to the gold Dragon Keikolin, the bringer of enlightenment.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“So you are the great Gilliadson Shadowbane, the father of our friend Darthan.&amp;nbsp; Welcome to Crescent Reach.”&amp;nbsp; Said the great gold Dragon.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“Greetings Lady Keikolin, Child of Veeshan.&amp;nbsp; I am sure you know why I am here.”&amp;nbsp; Said Gilliadson in the draconic tongue.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“Yes and I am glad you came since there are a few things you will need to know about such a Union of our children.”&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“You have my attention.”&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“First, you must know that any children born of this Union will be Drakkin.&amp;nbsp; It is because of the Dragon blood.&amp;nbsp; No matter how many generations.&amp;nbsp; Second, the Drakkin partner of such Unions willfully determines the gender of each child born.&amp;nbsp; Lastly, all Drakkin are Children of Veeshan and will ultimately pay homage to her though they may honor any of the other gods of their choosing.&amp;nbsp; Vallea still holds the Marr twins in high regard.&amp;nbsp; I know your main concern is in preserving the Shadowbane bloodline and traditions and I can see where these conditions can ruin that.&amp;nbsp; However, our children are both honorable and they can be sworn to uphold your traditions as well as keeping the bloodlines of both Shadowbane and Veeshan intact.&amp;nbsp; Remember that these Drakkin were once wholly human and part of them still is.&amp;nbsp; Darthan you must realize that if this Union takes place then you will be the last fully Human Shadowbane in your line.”&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“I do understand that and if my father is willing to allow this then I do swear that my eldest son will also become a Knight of Truth as well as a paladin of the Wings of Virtue and I will teach him to continue this legacy.”&amp;nbsp; Said Darthan&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“Also be mindful that once the Dragon blood awakens in your children they must come here to begin their training and receive the gift of breath from me before they can begin any other training.&amp;nbsp; Gilliadson Shadowbane word of your deeds and your honor has even reached the ears of the Circle here.&amp;nbsp; I myself would not see such a legacy end.&amp;nbsp; I will do all in my power to ensure that it continues for as long as I draw breath.”&amp;nbsp; Gilliadson pondered these things for a few minutes before speaking.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“I accept your offers and your oaths and unless my friends have any arguments to persuade me otherwise, I will give my blessing upon this Union.&amp;nbsp; My son you do know that according to our oldest tradition when you bear your first son, Gil-Alani will be yours.&amp;nbsp; You are to carry on that tradition with your eldest son.&amp;nbsp; You must make sure that he joins the ranks of the Knights of Truth by at least performing the tests for his testimony as you and I have.”&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“Father I will do as you have commanded.”&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“Where is this Union to take place?&amp;nbsp; Have the two of you decided?”&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“We would be honored if Lady Keikolin would officiate the Union for us along with the High Priest of Marr.&amp;nbsp; I would also institute this as a tradition for all Shadowbanes of my line from here on.”&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“Darthan I would be most pleased to perform this service.&amp;nbsp; My Daughter, is all of this agreeable to you as well?”&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“Yes Mother it is.”&amp;nbsp; Replied Vallea.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“Well then it all seems in order.&amp;nbsp; We have a Homecoming to get back to where I will make the announcement and will officially give my blessing.&amp;nbsp; Vallea would you fetch your brother so he can return us home?&amp;nbsp; Udra Lady Keikolin.&amp;nbsp; I look forward to seeing you again.”&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“Udra Lord Shadowbane.”&amp;nbsp; Said Keikolin&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“As you wish, Lord Shadowbane.”&amp;nbsp; Said Vallea and she went to her brother and brought him to the group.&amp;nbsp; Vinlo cast his portal spell and the five were back in Gil-Alani.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Chapter 5:&amp;nbsp; The Celebration&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Everyone was gathered in the main hall, ready for the festivities to begin.&amp;nbsp; The Shadowbane family stood outside the door preparing to enter.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“Vallea I would wish you to wait out here until I make the announcement.”&amp;nbsp; Said Gilliadson.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“As you wish M’lord.”&amp;nbsp; Agreed Vallea&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“And you can address me as father if you like.&amp;nbsp; You are not one of my servants.&amp;nbsp; You are a member of my family or at least soon will be.”&amp;nbsp; Vallea smiled and hugged the great knight.&amp;nbsp; The Shadowbanes entered the room and all the guests stood to their feet.&amp;nbsp; “Please, all of you, be seated.”&amp;nbsp; Gilliadson paused while the guests reseated themselves around the huge banquet table.&amp;nbsp; The Shadowbanes moved to their seats.&amp;nbsp; Gilliadson was at the head of the table, Obsecion on his right, Lutiana and then Mirthan seated next to her.&amp;nbsp; On his left were Darthan, and empty chair and then Willanaome.&amp;nbsp; Willa served as the Head Servant of the Shadowbane house of her own volition in all other respects she was treated as a member of the family.&amp;nbsp; This was the largest gathering of friends and family of Shadowbane that had ever taken place.&amp;nbsp; Obsecion had sent out invitations to all of those who had journeyed with them that were still alive.&amp;nbsp; There were members of the old Fellowship of the Unbroken Adventurers guild, which Gilliadson had led for a season, as well as many friends from the Legends of Madcap Guild, which had taken in the surviving members of Fellowship when it disbanded.&amp;nbsp; Many allies of Legends attended as well, Pohaku and Haertagold and Hullk, the Ogre Warrior who had joined Gilliadson on a few campaigns to name a few.&amp;nbsp; All of the Knights of Truth were in the Hall as well.&amp;nbsp; The Shadowbanes were seated except for Gilliadson and Obsecion.&amp;nbsp; Gilliadson addressed the gathering.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“Welcome all of you to the fifth annual Shadowbane Homecoming.&amp;nbsp; Normally this event consists of just a few close friends and family but I see that my Beloved had made other plans without my knowing.”&amp;nbsp; Gilliadson turned to Obsecion and kissed her.&amp;nbsp; “Thank you my love.”&amp;nbsp; Gilliadson turned back to the assembly.&amp;nbsp; “I think it is only fitting that we begin this celebration with a period of silence in honor of those of our friends and loved ones who have departed our world.”&amp;nbsp; Everyone went silent for a few moments.&amp;nbsp; “Now I have an announcement to make before we begin the feast.&amp;nbsp; My Son Darthan has finally chosen one whom he wishes to join in the Holy Union with and she has met the approval of both his mother and me.”&amp;nbsp; Darthan stood up went to the door and opened it.&amp;nbsp; “It brings me great pleasure to present to you Vallea of Crescent Reach.”&amp;nbsp; Vallea walked into the room, took Darthan’s arm and was escorted to her seat.&amp;nbsp; The room was silent.&amp;nbsp; Vallea addressed Gilliadson.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“It brings me great honor to become a member of this prestigious family.&amp;nbsp; I do have something that must be done yet before we can go any further.&amp;nbsp; Lord Shadowbane, High Paladin of the Knights of Truth, I have a quest that I had started before my awakening but I was unable to continue it until now.&amp;nbsp; Since you are following old traditions as well as starting some new ones, I feel it is only fitting that I should carry one on that started with you and Lady Shadowbane.”&amp;nbsp; Vallea pulled a small token out of her pocket and handed it to Gilliadson.&amp;nbsp; “I think you recognize this.&amp;nbsp; I had received it but I awakened before I was to turn it in to your predecessor.”&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“A token of Truth.”&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“It seems fitting that a son of the greatest of the Knights of Truth should marry one also.”&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“So it shall be done!”&amp;nbsp; Gilliadson sent one of the squires for his sword.&amp;nbsp; “I have no testimony here to present to you.”&amp;nbsp; A quill, ink and parchment were brought to Gilliadson and he quickly scribed the words of the Testimony of Truth to the new parchment.&amp;nbsp; Gilliadson handed the quill to Vallea, who then signed it after reading it.&amp;nbsp; The squire returned, knelt before Gilliadson and handed him the sword.&amp;nbsp; “It is always an honor and a pleasure to welcome a new squire as a full member of the Knights of Truth and this time is even more so.&amp;nbsp; Vallea are you prepared to take your oath?”&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“I am.”&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“Kneel before me Vallea.”&amp;nbsp; Commanded Gilliadson.&amp;nbsp; Vallea complied and Gilliadson drew his Fiery Defender from its scabbard its flames dancing along the length of the blade.&amp;nbsp; As Gilliadson touched each of her shoulders, Vallea could feel the warmth of the blade.&amp;nbsp; It was pleasantly warm instead of the searing burn that the enemies of Shadowbane usually feel as the blade passes through their flesh.&amp;nbsp; “The only words that come to my mind to speak now are the very words spoken at my knighting many years ago.&amp;nbsp; To be a Knight of Truth in itself is a great honor and carries with it great responsibility to carry forward the ideals of the Truthbringer.&amp;nbsp; A Knight of Truth must be a man or woman of great integrity.&amp;nbsp; This evening we welcome one such lady to our ranks.&amp;nbsp; It is by the authority of Mithaniel Marr that I hereby welcome you to the ranks of the Knights of Truth with all rights, privileges and responsibilities thereof.&amp;nbsp; Arise Lady Vallea of Crescent Reach.”&amp;nbsp; Vallea stood and read the Testimony of Truth aloud to those gathered.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“I believe in the might of Mithaniel Marr.&amp;nbsp; I shall uphold the words of Marr and defend them with my life.&amp;nbsp; I shall protect the righteous weak and avenge the souls of those whose life has been taken for naught.&amp;nbsp; From this day forth I shall become a living vessel for the ideals of the Truthbringer and if I should ever falter from his grace may he cast me from this life and into the lifeless void.&amp;nbsp; Praise be to Marr!”&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“PRAISE BE TO MARR!!”&amp;nbsp; Echoed the rest of the attendees.&amp;nbsp; Vallea took her seat beside Darthan and held his hand.&amp;nbsp; Gilliadson then continued his address.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“Six years ago my daughter, Lutiana, began her travels in the world.&amp;nbsp; It was then that I made her promise to return home on this date every year.&amp;nbsp; The following year Darthan began his journeys and promised to return on this date.&amp;nbsp; Thus was instituted Shadowbane Homecoming.&amp;nbsp; Every year since then, we have gathered with a few friends on this date and shared tales of our travels.&amp;nbsp; Mirthan started his travels two years later.&amp;nbsp; This year as I stated earlier it seems that my wife decided to make this one special for some reason.&amp;nbsp; And, with a little unknown assistance from my son, it is special.&amp;nbsp; I hereby bestow my blessing upon the upcoming Union of Darthan and Vallea and welcome a new member to the house of Shadowbane.&amp;nbsp; Norrath is an ever-changing world and in order for us to survive in it we must also adapt to the changes.”&amp;nbsp; Darthan put his arm around Vallea and pulled her close to his side as Gilliadson concluded his speech,&amp;nbsp; “Behold the future of Shadowbane!”&amp;nbsp; Said Gilliadson as he swept his arm toward his son and Vallea.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;The room burst into a round of applause as everyone rose to their feet.&amp;nbsp; Gilliadson raised his mug in a toast.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“Here is to Darthan and Vallea.&amp;nbsp; May you both continue in the grace of Mithaniel Marr!&amp;nbsp; May you live long, live well and live with passion.&amp;nbsp; May you both bring honor to Marr, Veeshan and the name of Shadowbane.&amp;nbsp; Finally, may your children bring you the joys that all of my children have.”&amp;nbsp; All the guests raised their mugs and joined in the toast.&amp;nbsp; “This is the finest Tuneweaver Ale I have ever tasted.&amp;nbsp; Zephistophiles you have outdone yourself this time.”&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“Twas not I who made the ale Gill.&amp;nbsp; Twas me son.”&amp;nbsp; Gilliadson and Zephistophiles laughed together.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;The Celebration lasted all through the night and into the next day as the Shadowbane children shared their tales with the assembled guests.&amp;nbsp; No one left the celebration hungry, not even Shinu.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Epilogue:&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Darthan and Vallea were joined several months later in one of the grandest ceremonies to ever take place in the history of the Shadowbane family.&amp;nbsp; Vallea gave birth to their first son two years later.&amp;nbsp; They named him Barathir.&amp;nbsp; Shortly afterward Darthan and his family moved into Gil-Alani and Gilliadson and Obsecion moved into an apartment in Freeport.&amp;nbsp; Gilliadson continued as High Paladin for three more years before retiring and moving back to his old cottage in Kelethin.&amp;nbsp; Gilliadson and Obsecion lived for many years after and witnessed the birthing of several generations of Drakkin Shadowbane.&amp;nbsp; Gilliadson and Obsecion died together and were buried in the family crypt next to Gilliad and Alani’s remains.&amp;nbsp; The Shadowbane traditions are carried on to this day.&amp;nbsp; I am Daletar Tuneweaver, a direct descendant of the great lore master and bard Zephistophiles Tuneweaver and the last of the Shadowbane chroniclers.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <title>An Awakening</title>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I didn't really understand what was happening to me. I was feverish and flushed and it felt as though a smiths hammer were beating against the inside of my head. An odd rash appeared and began to spread. Welts rose on my head and face. And dreams. Strange dreams of places unknown to me. They told me that in my sleep I uttered words in a strange language. At times I felt myself delirious. Voices called to me to "come home", voices that only I could hear. In my sleep I beheld visions of strange places and creatures...and dragons. The visions should have frightened me but they did not, in fact I found them to be somehow comforting. I spoke of these things to my mother but she would only shush me and tell me that they would pass when the fever abated and to mention them no more. My mother loved me as she did all her children. It was dangerous for her to show it, but she managed to let me know in spite of my father's ire. A whipered word of praise, a brief smile or fleeting hug. Sometimes just a wisp of a look, but it was enough. In time it seemed that we could communicate without words, indeed she could almost read my mind. There was no secret I could keep from her but that she would read it in my face.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;My father was afraid that I has the plague and sent me out to sleep in the old empty barn. My sisters and brothers were afraid of me and kept away, only occaisionally peering in through the crack of the open door...when it was left open. My mother said nothing at all, but simply tended to me with a worried look and assured me that everything would be alright. And that last was what disturbed me the most. Because I knew she was lying.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The isolation did not bother me. Often I had wished for it. I had always been different. All of my family had fair skin and hair. They had eyes the color of the summer sky but I was dark. I think that my father considered me to be someones illegitimate son. He certainly did not show me the favor that is the custom with the eldest son. Instead he treated me more like a servant, and a poor one at that. Beatings were frequent and when he was in his cups I would find ways to avoid him, for those times were the worst. I learned to hide in corners and nooks and other dark places until I could do it nearly at will. I kept a small knife with me and practiced with it when I could find time to myself. Beatings I could endure, but when he was drunk I feared for my life. Those times he did not know when to stop. When he was sober the beatings would come, but those I could survive. He needed me to be able to work in the forge and so was able to restrain himself...to a point.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;My chores were always the hardest, the dirtiest and the longest. He said it was because I was the oldest but when the others had reached an age to be of some help he always found other things for them to do. I was always the last. The last to eat, the last for a winter coat, the last for everything. My brothers and sisters seemed indifferent to me. There was no rivalry between us as they came before me in all things. They did not hate me but the fact that I was different from them was all too obvious and they were not afraid to point this out, often and sometimes at great length. I bear them no ill will, such are the ways of children.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Illegitimate.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I wished&amp;nbsp;for this to be true. Perhaps one day my real father might come and rescue me from my prison, for that is how I saw my condition. But by the time I began to grow into a man I knew this would not happen. This was not a childrens story to be told at bedtime. There would be no fairy princess or noble prince to carry me away. No "happily ever after". This was to be my lot in life, that of a smithy's son, and an unwanted one at that. The only hope for me was that I learned the craft well and when I was old enough I would leave for Freeport or Qeynos and make my living there instead of Highpass where everyone knew me.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I had planned to leave on my eighteenth birthday. All was prepared. I had managed to beg an extra shirt and pants from my mother. I did not have to tell her why nor did she ask, but I have no doubt that she knew. I was able to secure an handful of coppers by running errands for certain discreet merchants and tradesmen in Highpass. It was not much but I could afford enough food to take me where I chose to go.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Then came the illness and all my plans were laid for nought. While I lay sensless in fever my father found my outfit. He took the coppers for himself and the clothes he gave away. He came to my bed in a rage but the fear of the plague was upon him and he would not touch me. I think I would have died that night had I been sound.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I still do not know how long I lay in bed. A week at least I think, perhaps longer. I only know that one morning I awoke and found the fever had abated. I was ravenously hungry and decided to dress and go into the house to find something to eat. I should have been worried about my father but I was not. Perhaps I was lucky or perhaps he was, but fate had him away from the forge on an errand when I rose and began to dress. As I pulled my old tunic over my head it snagged and tore slightly. I finished pulling it on and then put my hand to my head to see why the shirt had snagged and felt...horns a row of them. On my forehead and beneath my eyes. Small, but pointed and sharp. I reached for my breeches and when I looked down I saw that where the rash had been there was now a long, dark design, like a tatoo. It ran the full lenth of my body from my feet to my head. I assumed it went down my back as well. and it was...beautiful! Suddenly all that had gone before thjis morning no longer mattered and I laughed out loud. All of the toil and anguish, the beatings, the insults and the bitterness was gone from my mind in an instant. At that same moment a word came into my mind. A word I knew but had not thought about, it being such a rare thing. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Drakkin. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I was a Drakkin, one of the guardians of Veeshan The blood of these creatures flowed through &lt;I&gt;my&lt;/I&gt; veins. Suddenly the dreams made sense. It was part of my awakening. I was being shown who I really was and where I needed to go. A place where I would at last find welcome. A place that I could truly call home. At that thought a powerful longing arose in me and I knew that I must leave at once for Crescent Reach, the city of the Dragon Kin and home to all manner of adventurous folk. I almost forgot my hunger...almost... and thought to leave straight away. But the ravening within me was too powerful to ignore.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I finished dressing and stepped out ofthe barn. It was a fine, bright day and my brother was hard at work at the forge. Making horseshoes I think. As he saw me coming he set the tongs on the anvil.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;"It's about time!" he said. "Father has much for you to do, we have been sorely..."&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;He stopped talking as he got his first good look at me, his jaw hanging open like a yawning cave.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;"Dad is going to be so pissed." he said softly. "No one is going to want to do business with a...Drakkin." I could only laugh.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I put my hand on his shoulder and smiled. "Don't worry, they won't have to." I said.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;My brother nodded and looked resigned. His work load was about to increase...a lot. He sighed. "No, I don't suppose they will." he said and sighed again.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I left my brother to his thoughts and went into the house. My mother was at the fire toasting some biscuits next to a bubbling pot of stew. She did not look up as I entered the room.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;"I thought you might want something to eat before you left." she said, her attention still fixed on the the fire and what was cooking there.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;"You thought right." I said, trying to keep my voice light. "As always." I failed. She stood then and turned to me. Her eyes were wet and reddened.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;"No," she said, "Not always..." Her voice caught in her throat as she looked up, seeing me fully for the first time.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;"How long have you known?" I asked.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;"I have always known." She replied. "You are not the first of my kin to be called. But I had hoped it would spare us."&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;"Am I hideous to you?" I asked, afraid of what the answer might be.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;"No." She replied, running the tips of her fingers lightly across the small points of bone on my face. "Not hideous. You are beautiful."&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;She studied me for a moment, my markings, my small horns. I seemed to have grown a little taller, a little thinner.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;"You father..." she began, but I raised a hand to quiet her.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;"He will not trouble me." I said. I will be gone before..." This time it was my mother who silenced me.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;"He knows." She said. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;"He knows?"&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;"You did not change overnight. Please," she said, "Do not hate him." But I said nothing.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;"I beg you, do not hate him. If anyone has a right to.."&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;"If anyone has a right to, it is him." A voice interupted from behind me. I turned.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;"Hello father." I said. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;"She is right," he said, "You are beautiful." Then he seemed to be at a loss for words. We both were. In his hands he carried a backpack. It was very fine, perhaps the best I had ever seen. The thick leather was tanned and oiled. The stitching was sturdy and precise. It was the kind of thing one might find one of the officers of High Keep going into the field with. Inside it were two changes of clothes and a good cloak of kodiak fur as well as enough food and water to last me much farther than I needed to go. Also inside was a long dagger on a belt. It was a good knife. A soldiers knife.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;"I thought you might need these for your trip." He said when he handed them to me. I looked into his eyes to thank him. I don't know what I expected to read there, anger perhaps, or resignation. But what I saw was guilt. Guilt, sorrow and a deep, deep shame. Deeper than words could ever express. He looked away.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;"If any one has a right to hate me, it is you." He said. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Here was the man I had once thought a monster. A man incapable of love for me. A man who's only thought for me was how much work I could do for him, how well he could use me like any one of his other tools. But he was not a monster, just a man who has awoken to suddenly find that all the things he had thought and brooded over for 18 years were wrong. It was a change, no less profound for him than mine was for me. And for that I pitied him. Indeed I feared for him, for such changes can destroy a man.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;"I am so sorry." He said and his voice began to waver. "After all I have said and after all I have done... I would that you could forgive me." His eyes glistened as he struggled to speak. "I have no right to ask it I know. And were I in your place I do not think I could do it, nor would I expect it of you. If you cannot, I understand." &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I said nothing for a moment.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;"If I could undo what I have done..." he went on, but I no longer heard him, I had my answer for him now. I placed my hands on his shoulders and pulled him to me.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;"How can I hate you?" I said, my own voice thick with emotion. "You are my &lt;I&gt;father&lt;/I&gt;." I put my arms around him then and for the first time in my memory we embraced. My mother joined us then.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I left the following morning after eating well and sleeping. My strength has not fully returned to me but the compulsion to depart was too strong to ignore. I last saw my parents standing just outside the door of their little house. My father had his arm around my mother's waist and he held her close as they watched me leave. It was a sight I had longed to see for many years.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;My family are the Drakkin now. My memories of that time when I was human grow fainter with each passing day. The humans I see passing through The Reach seem alien to me and often times I finds myself resenting their presence here. But they pass on and are forgotten as quickly as the came. Someday I may return to where I was born to see what has become of my human family. Or not. I do not know what the future may bring. I only know that here, high in the mountains among the others of my kind, have I found my true family and, finally, I am at peace.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Tjirel on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;10-08-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;11:25 AM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Chapter 1 Passing Over&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;My last day in the service of Lord Gilliad Shadowbane was spent on a bed in the Temple of Marr. I was dieing from a dose of an incurable slow poison that D`Vinn had given me. I wanted to be among my fellow druids of Karana but I knew that they could not have given me as peaceful a passing as the clerics of Marr had. I opened the music box that Lady Alani had made for me and listened to the melody that issued forth. I remember the first time hearing this melody had evoked erotic feelings in me as memories of a former lover filled my mind. This time was different. The music had a soothing effect that gave me peace and eased the pain that the poison had started inflicting on my as my life slowly drained away. Lord Gilliad was at my side and young Gilliadson was with him.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;“I will surely miss you both.” I said. “I have loved you like a son, M’lord.”&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;“I know you have, Willa.” Replied M’lord Gilliad. “During your final moments I do not want you as my servant but as my friend. We are equals Willa.”&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;“As you wish Gilliad.” I always enjoyed these times with Gilliad when we were afforded the chance to be considered on an equal basis. During all my years of service to the House of Shadowbane, I never felt more appreciated than when I served Gilliad. He was a wonderful man. As I lay there, on the bed listening to the music box, Gilliad opened his and the tunes from both boxes intertwined. I felt alive even though I was not going to be much longer. Young Gilliadson opened his box and the music from it joined in with the other two boxes. The melody that they formed together was beautiful. I could see Lady Alani’s face and she was smiling upon me. I do not know if Gilliad and his son saw it too. Gilliad and I talked and the music made me feel strong enough to actually laugh. Yes, I was laughing when I saw the last of the two Shadowbanes. Gilliad and Gilliadson each held one of my hands as I slipped into Karana’s bosom. I had never felt so loved in all my life. Not even when I was in the arms of that former lover.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;“Willanaome.” Came a whisper that sounded like distant thunder. “Willanaome.” It came again a few seconds later. Somehow, I knew it had to be Karana himself. Why I was so honored to hear him call my name, I do not know. I bowed down to the ground.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;“Yes M’lord.” &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;“Arise my child. You have been among my most faithful and I wish to reward you with another chance at life in the world of Norrath as my servant.”&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;“M’lord I am your servant. Whatever you wish I shall do.”&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;“You will be needed in a future time to assist the House of Shadowbane again. But until such time you must prepare yourself. A young follower of mine is departing Norrath to join me here. You will take over her body. It is not good to put all of your knowledge into such a young body so I will give you a choice. You can either have all the memories of your magic or you may retain your other memories, including those of the Shadowbanes.”&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;“I can relearn the magic, M’lord, but the memories of my life are irreplaceable. You know my heart.”&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;“So shall it be then. You will not reveal yourself to any of the Shadowbanes until you hear from me otherwise. You may however, gather what news of them that you can since you will be aiding them again when the House of Shadowbane is restored.”&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Chapter 2 Return&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;“Thank you M’lord.” I bowed once more and when I arose, I found myself in the Misty Thicket. I looked at my hands and they were youthful again though they were not my own. I looked around and saw a group of goblins leaving the area where I was now sitting. I looked around me and saw the bodies of several other Halflings, two adults and a child. I bowed my head and wept for them. I was still weeping when the deputies found me and took me to Rivervale. No one knew the names of the dead Halfling family. Somehow, I knew and told them. I also knew the name of the body I had inhabited but I did not use it, instead, I gave them my own.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It is quite an experience being an old, shriveled up but powerful druid one day and being a young but much weaker one the next. I had no recollection of the magic I had learned in all my years of service to Karana. I did remember my friends, the Shadowbanes. I knew I had to get stronger so I could go out into the world to seek news of them. I also knew that I had to be ready for whatever service I was to give to them when I was finally restored to them. My love for the Shadowbane family had nothing to do with the wages that they paid me. Believe me they paid me quite well. It was more the fact that I had become a family friend to them and was loved, truly loved for the first time in my life. It was not an erotic love that we shared. Oh no, it was a pure kind. The kind that told me that if Gilliad had been there that day he would have given his life up if he knew that I would have been spared. It was an honor to fight alongside Lady Alani that day. Never have I met such a courageous woman. The former queen of Freeport accounted well for herself as well. It pained me deeply to see the young maids that I had trained laying dead on the grounds around us. They fought so valiantly. I knew that our end was near when I saw the former queen fall with an arrow through her heart. At last, it was just a few of us and Lady Alani left. The Teir`Dal had us restrained when that **SMURF** D’Vinn walked up. There were some words exchanged and D’Vinn scratched me with his poisoned dirk. He then stabbed Lady Alani through the heart with it. I knew I was dieing. Lady Alani was dead in my arms. I saw the manor on fire and I rushed in to gather the things I knew would mean the most to Lord Gilliad and his son when they returned, the Shadowbane family swords and the music boxes Lady Alani had made. I pulled Lady Alani’s parents’ bodies from their burning apartment behind the smithy so they too could receive a proper burial. I returned to Lady Alani’s body and wept until Lord Gilliad returned. I saw the pain in his eyes and the horror in young Gilliadson’s. We gathered the bodies and buried them on the land. The manor was too far gone to save so we just let it burn to the ground. Somehow we all felt that D’Lere was behind this for the tracks that the Teir`Dal left lead toward Freeport. I gave Lord Gilliad and his son their music boxes and the Shadowbane swords. Lord Gilliad put me on his horse and we rode to the Temple of Marr in Freeport. Lord Gilliad and Gilliadson stayed with me until I passed on.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Chapter 3 The New Druid&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I went to the druid guild masters in Rivervale to begin my training. I was outfitted with some basic clothing and a very nice little club. I was given some patterns and a list of materials needed as well as a kit to make the pieces of leather armor that were magically empowered to protect me from the dangers of the world. I would go out into the Misty Thicket and hunt the creatures that had the items that I needed to make the armor and then fashion each piece with the tools in the kit. It wasn’t long before I was wearing a full set of Moss Toe armor. I learned my spells also very quickly. One final quest was needed. I had to investigate the some ruins where some rats were becoming diseased and some undead Halflings were hanging around. I discovered that the perpetrator of this was a very rude Halfling traitor in the Southeast corner of Misty Thicket. I was commissioned to kill this traitor and bring back his head. So I felt I was ready for this challenge until I arrived at his cottage and found two large wolves guarding it. I resolved myself to complete this mission or die in the process. I managed to calm one of the wolves and decided I would try to take out the other one first so I hit him with my snare spell. He somehow resisted it and came after me with the traitor behind him. I stood toe to toe with the traitor for a few rounds of fighting and realized that he was going to get the better of me if I stuck around. I ran back toward Rivervale with the traitor and the one wolf in pursuit. As I neared the town a Koada`Dal priestess saw the plight I was in and intervened on my behalf. She was a powerful one indeed. The traitor and his pet both fell dead behind me. I thanked the priestess and collected the traitor’s head to give to my guild master. I was given a scimitar and some more instructions on how to make it magical. I went back to the Thicket and found a giant fruit bat and killed it. I took one of its wings and went to the forge in town. I sharpened the scimitar up with a stone and then gave the smith the sharpened scimitar and the fruit bat wing. He did a little work on it in the forge and returned it to me. I could feel the magic in the blade. I started traveling around Norrath some. Apparently, I had been away for a while, though it seemed like just a few minutes. There were portals now that connected various parts of Norrath to a place called New Tanaan. The ships no longer ran from the various city ports but instead there were wizards at each of the docks to transport people magically from one port to another. There was a portal to New Tanaan not too far from Rivervale so I went to it. It looked like a book on a pedestal. I walked up and laid my hand on it and I was suddenly in a different place looking at a stone that had my home city’s name carved into it. I stepped down from the small platform and walked into the busiest city I had ever seen. I saw all kinds of people here including some feline creatures called Vah Shir and some frog-like creatures called Frogloks. When I first encountered a Teir`Dal here I instinctively cast my snare spell on him and was about to conjure up a stinging swarm when I noticed that my snare spell never even landed. It was as if I had never cast it. He walked up to me with a big smile on his face and greeted me most kindly.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;“Do not be afraid little one. No one here can harm you nor can you harm him or her. In this place no harmful magic can be used nor any weapons. Please see for your self. Try to strike me with your blade.” Said the Teir`Dal. I drew my scimitar and tried to swing it at him but the blade would not touch him. “I cannot harm you either. This is a neutral place where all abide as peacefully as we can. All speak freely here and the only thing that will hurt you may be some of the words here.” I was amazed to say the least. I took my leave of the Teir`Dal and continued wandering the city. I walked into a massive library where there were millions of books. There were people in there that sold spells for the various practitioners of magic. I found a druid merchant who was selling some spells that I knew I could use soon so I bought them from him. I also found a map in there of the city that I could take with me. Using the map, I located the stone portal to Kelethin. I decided I would go visit the Fier`Dal druids.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Chapter 4 Catching Up&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I arrived in the Greater Faydark forest a little southeast of the southern lift into Kelethin. I had not gone far from the portal when I met a wolf. He seemed friendly enough. A voice whispered in my head.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;“Greetings Willanaome. Tunare sent me to greet you and to let you know that your friends, the Shadowbanes live here. I am aware that you are not to contact them just yet but if you would like to follow me to the ruined druid circle I will tell you all I know about their deeds since they have been here.” I will tell you that since I have returned to Norrath I discovered that I could talk to the friendly animals such as wolves and bears so hearing from this wolf was not a surprise in itself. Hearing that I had stumbled upon the Shadowbanes however was. I followed the wolf to the druid rings and we sat there while I listened to all he had to tell me. He told me of great battles between the Elves here and the Orcs of Crushbone. My heart was glad to hear of Lord Gilliad falling in love with Mariel of Felwithe and marrying her. I wept when he told me that Lord Gilliad had been slain by D’Vinn. Then he told me of Gilliadson defeating D’Vinn in a daring raid on Crushbone. I was overjoyed to hear of Gilliadson finding love in Rihki a Koada`Dal priestess. The wolf then told me of Gilliadson bringing Rihki’s body back after his fight with Lucan D’Lere in Freeport. I learned about his friends Zephistophiles the bard and his chronicler, Elwinde and Sineliniel the twin Koada`Dal arcanists, Shinu a Vah Shir Warrior and Whoos the Froglok priest and his wife Sanlacy the Barbarian Shaman. Finally, the wolf told me of Lady Obsecion of Felwithe, a Tunarean Knight who was once in the service of Firiona Vie herself, who Gilliadson had fallen in love with and married. I also learned that the two of them went off to the Plane of Sky and returned with the flaming swords called Fiery Avengers. It seemed like things were looking up for Gilliadson and his bride. They just had not produced any children yet. The wolf told me that they were both away now seeking to acquire Fiery Defenders. I thanked the wolf for the tales and went on my way to Kelethin. I knew that even if Gilliadson saw me, he would not recognize me but I was not sure I could contain myself if I saw him. I found the druid guild masters and pledged my service to them for a few seasons. So now, I hunt the Orcs of Crushbone and wait to here more news of Gilliadson.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Chapter 5: A Wandering Druid&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;After my time of service to the Fier`Dal druids was over, I went to my gravesite in the Commonlands and retrieved my music box. At first I was not sure if this new body would be able to open the box since they were made to be opened only by their owners. I covered the grave back up and then knelt between the graves of Lady Alani and Lord Gilliad as I wept over them. I promised them that I would do my best to watch over their son when I was restored to him. But for now I must go where Lord Karana sends me.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I went to Luclin to explore the hidden moon some. I signed on with the houses of Fordel and Midst in Shadow Haven to police the Paludal Caverns for a few seasons. I fought the rogues there in the caverns until my time of service was completed. I decided I would visit the plains that were named after my God and perform my druidic duties there. I completed my service to Karana there and wandered to Stonebrunt to aid the Kejekans there with their problems with the Heretic invaders and the Kobolds. While there in Stonebrunt I learned of Zephistophiles' coming joining. I decided to ask the Kejekans if they had a blade suitable as a wedding present for Gilliadson's friend. They told me that one of the villagers had a couple of them that he might be persuaded to give me. When I went to see him, I saw that his wife was ill. I tried to cure her with my own druid magic but it would not work. He sent me to the village Shaman who told me of a cure that she was working on but needed a few more ingredients and asked me if I would gather them for her. I told her I would. She gave me a bag and I went on my way through the area searching for the items needed. I ported to South Ro and hunted some cistern asps for their poison glands. After I salvaged two of them, I returned to Stonebrunt and hunted Kejekan tigers for two skins. I then collected two panda claws. I had to forage around for the last two items, a bamboo shoot and Kejekan palm fruit. Once I had al the items in the bag I returned to the village and gave it to the shaman. She did a little work and handed me a potion to take to the villager's sick wife. The potion cured her and he was so happy that he gave me two swords that he called Wakizashi of the Frozen Skies for Zephistophiles. I decided also to get something for his bride-to-be, who is a monk. I heard that there are large sabretooth tigers in the area called Snowbeast whose hides make wonderful footwear for monks. I knew the tiger was going to be more than I could handle so I sent a message to Sineliniel asking for her assistance.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When Sineliniel arrived in Stonebrunt she was not sure of who I actually was. I swore her to secrecy before I pulled out my music box and played the melody that was contained in it. I handed her my box and she could see that it was one of the boxes made for Lady Shadowbane as gifts. She also knew that the boxes would only play their melodies for their owners. Lord Gilliad's box was buried in the Commonlands with the part of his remains interred there. Gilliadson still carried his box with him. I told Sineliniel that I would contact Gilliadson when I received permission from Karana to do so. Sineliniel sent for Lady Obsecion to come assist us but did not tell her who I was other than a friend. We hunted for one of those tigers for a long time before we found one. When the fight was over however the skin was ruined too badly to make the sandals. We decided to take a break and go back to it the next day.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The next day Sanlacy's mother, Jildarie and another friend named Kattcankil came to assist us. It did not take us long to find another Snowbeast. This time we were more careful in killing it and managed to get enough material to make two pairs of the footpads so we gave one pair to Kattcankil.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I secretly attended the wedding and it was quite lovely. Ruetamerras did a wonderful ceremony. Gilliadson was not able to attend due to being away on a mission so his Daughter, Lutiana, stood in for him. She is quite a lovely child. From what I was able to see, she has her father's eyes and her mother's hair. She will grow into a great Lady Knight one day. Zephistophiles was happy with the two swords I gave him. I got to sit down and talk with him at great length without revealing who I was. He is a great Loremaster. We discussed Norrathian history among other topics. He told me a few of his tales of Gilliadson, which I had already heard from the wolves but I listened to his renditions anyway.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Word from Karana arrived to me in the thunder of a storm. I will be allowed to finally rejoin the Shadowbane family. I sent word to Sineliniel to let her know and asked her to set up a meeting for me with Obsecion and Lutiana. I have been listening to my music box quite a bit lately. It seems to calm my anxiety over this meeting. I wonder how Gilliadson will react when he hears of me.&amp;nbsp; The only proof I can offer them as to my real identity is my music box.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;There I was staring at the beautiful tree's of the city of kelethin, the moon flickered through the swaying branches of the tree's. It was a new beginning. I found myself lost in this mysterious world of norrath. I maneuvered my way through all the elven merchants selling various trinkets and general goods. Often I would ask for directions to the nearest training area, however everyone was too busy to point me in the right direction. As I walking I managed to take a wrong turn.... I nearly fell to my death..... I was dangling from the top of a lift... Someone hit the lift button and I managed to climb onto the platform to saftey. It was then that I knew that nearly falling to my death was just a preminition of things to come. I could go on all day about how keen and agile the wasps are.... but that would probably only lead to the many stories of me experiencing the afterlife in small sessions as I ran back to my corpse.&lt;p&gt;Many full moons later I found myself stumbling across a forbidden keep. I managed to work my way right into the heart of the threat my fellow kelethinians worst fear. The orcs, perticularly Keep crushbone. I cut through the orcs fast, it was almost as if I was chopping my way through a thick jungle...I charged my way to the top of the keep, and cut down their chieftain....finally a notch in my belt to kick off a neverending career of slaying evil......Crushbone was only the beginning...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I managed to spend a few nights at an inn in kelethin, recoverying from the wounds I sustained fighting the chieftain, and his sidekick... I knew the my next mission was to cleanse a dungeon off the caldron, a place called unrest.... As a small boy my father would tell me stories about such an evil place, that it was at one time a flourishing community wealthy highelfs... however a great curse was bestowed upon them, and as they died they were left forever haunting the mansion. In perticular was a ghost dwarf, who dwells in the bowells of the ancient construction. It was there, that I found that i didn't quite plan for the long haul. I didn't plan on staying too many nights in the forbidden zone, however I found myself low on rations and water.. I was becoming weak.... I'd never give up, but out of desperation I foraged the area, unfortunately I wasn't able to scrounge enough to keep myself full enuogh to fight the evil minons of unrest.... It was when I met this mysterious creature... It was a pure white wolf, almost as if the gods themself had blessed this beautiful creature, and sent it to norrath to watch over those in need.... Although this creature was clearly a wolf, it spoke to me.....the wolf's voice was a very comforting woman voice "hello, are you okay?" I said, yes, do you have any food? I felt strange asking a wolf, but I figured a talking wolf was strange enough, It's not more stranger asking her for food.... the wolf slowly transformed into a beautiful elven girl... I was pretty much stunned---from the moment I layed eyes on her angelic face I was mezmerized..... I was drawn to her, because I knew nothing of her, or her kind.... After she summoned me food out of thin air! She disappeared, as if she never existed, however I was full so clearly I wasn't hallucinating..I kept fighting in unrest until the undead were supressed enough to leave Butch block alone for a few months...I fought in lesser faydark, and all over butcherblock, I traveled to the oasis and helped get rid of their crocodile problem.....Eventually I found my way to a place called high hold keep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was in highhold keep that I found myself struggling for experience at my 22nd season. I was battling a goblin, when I heard that angelic voice, I felt the surge of light coarse through me as my body bathed in blue lights. I turned around and my mystery woman was in her wolf form. We decided to team up officially to slay the goblins that plagued hhk. I found out she had someone in her life, that didn't bother me, I just enjoyed being around her, and talking about anything that was on her mind. I later met her someone of 6 years. He was a very nice person, however he was a peck..... and she was an elf, I've seen stranger things, but I kept an open mind and dismissed the fact that he was a PECK...The months went by, and our friendship grew stronger... Vuluxy was having problems with her friend, and I tried to be there to console her... My love for this druid only grew stronger by the day....I would go to sleep thinking about Lady Vuluxy, and in the morning I couldn't wait to get purple text of a message from her. At that time in my life, this wonderful elf completed me.. She kept me sane, and focused. Whenever I thought about flying off the handle, or saying something stupid I thought about her, and how it would affect her..I tried to never rock the boat when we would group with other ppl, however sometimes I'd get a little jealous, or angry if someone said something to insult her or our PDA. I was young, and inexperienced with love, but that doesn't mean I didn't have a strong emotional tie to this woman. Many seasons later, Vuluxy and I decided to take our relationship to a different level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We left the ethereal world and decided to connect on a completely different level. We met on the material plane. It took her about 4 hours to travel to my village in the material world. From the moment I saw her, I walked over to her and gave her this huge hug, I couldn't let go of her... Everything was so perfect, she was on a long journey, she smelled like she had just ran 20 miles, and I couldn't let her go, I loved everything about her, her smile... her smell, the look on her face when she first layed eyes on me. We got back to my ride and I couldn't let go of her, or keep my eyes off her, we kissed slowly, and then..... we kept kissing, this went on for about 4 hours. I couldn't love her anymore than I did at that moment. I was at peace, I would truely more comfortable than I had ever been.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We rode back to my place, and we slept with each other under the stars... it was rather cold out, but she put her leg over mine, and held me tight, we were definately warm enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next day I took her sledding at "Suicide hill". we played in the snow.... and had a great time. It was that night that we first made love, and every night after that we made love some more. We had a beautiful christmas... and then it was time to say goodbye. This was particularly difficult for me because everything was perfect. I didn't want any of it to end, the sad state of reality was setting in, and of course the question was, will I see her again soon?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 week later, she flew back to my village..and we spent more nights together, enjoying each others company, and making love....life was definately surreal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It finally came to the end of her visit where we had to say goodbye again. For some reason this was more difficult than saying goodbye the first time...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was young, I had no real direction, but I had a plan. I was going to join the Airborne infantry. I spent 14 weeks training, 4 weeks in hold over, and 3 weeks in airborne school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every week of my 14 week basic training, I would get 1 or 2 letters from my dear "Vuluxy". After I got moved to hold over for airborne school, I called to give her my new address. Unfortunately every time i had a chance to call, which was once a week nobody answered... It was a month later I found that she changed her number. She said it was because her old boyfriend was hounding her. We talked about life plans together, and I Tried to call her every week. All throughout airborne school she never answered her phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I took hometown recruiting for 2 weeks plus 2 weeks leave at home. I called her, but never could get in touch with her..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was when I was stationed at Fort Bragg, and I was getting settled into my unit with the 82nd airborne division, I got a call from her. We talked, and it seemed like we were more friends than anything else. I asked her if I could come see her that weekend, and she said no she was going out with her friends. This was likes a stab in the heart I just went through over 20 weeks of training, and she didn't want to take the time to see me that weekend, something was wrong..... I dismissed the negative notions I had..... I asked her when would be a good time to come see her? She said, "how about next weekend? Call me friday!" I was pretty excited..... although also very cautious. I didn't want to build falsehope, just to be buried in the ground..... That following week I called, nobody answered. I checked my email.... it said:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear "soandso"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The basic breakdown and key points are "your too young for me" "your inexperienced" "We learned a lot from each other" "But I'm not ready for a commitment right now".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pretty much that was information entailed in the Dear "Soandso" letter of, I just stomped your heart out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Truth of the matter is If your living in pure bliss, grab that bliss by the reins and milk it for all it's worth, happiness is priceless, however coming off of happiness will leave you in the worst down period you've ever been in. It's like being forced to quit cold turkey, except you didn't have a choice.....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;simply put, the definition of love could be that it's an addicting drug with the potential of heart breaking side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that if you venture outside the ethereal world, you risk getting hurt, but if you never take that leap, you won't experience true happiness even if it's temporary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope you guys enjoyed the story,I'm sure it's one of many stories that have similar characteristics. This particular case happened 5 years ago, and in the realm of the Tribunal. Also, the reason I posted it because for some reason I wanted to do some creative writing! If the lore is incorrect, or I don't use all the right tenses, please get over it =p&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Roleplaying&amp;message.id=12454#M12454</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Rawlodan the Barbarian Shaman and Rhodace the Human Paladin, having made their way to the slave revolt camp in Gloomingdeep at the same time, decided that things would go a lot easier helping the revolt if they teamed up. After aquiring the Kobold Skull Charm from Arias they set out to make a contribution to the revolt effort.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;After doing several tasks which involved helping to clear some of the vermin from around the camp area and killing several rather nasty spiders, they learned that they could obtain some valuable items by ransacking the numerous barrels which the slow witted kobolds seem to have left around the caves. In no time at all Rhodace found herself well equipped with a bow, quiver and several arrows.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;They then accepted the task of sabotaging the kobold supplies down by the fort from Zajeer. Fighting their way towards the fort, they easily dispatched several grunts and warriors, gaining confidence and loot along the way. As they entered the final tunnel to the fort, they encountered a kobold captain and, unfortunately were not of sufficient strength to dispatch this fiend. They both soon found themselves back at the soulbinder in the rebel camp.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;At that point it was decided that they would rest and fight again on another day.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Chapter 1&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The wind coming off of the frozen tundra east of Halas chilled one to the bone. Long past battles fought here left the landscape barren and uninhabitable. Old ruins dotted the landscape no matter which way one looked. Ancient statues, much larger than the wolly mammoths that normally roamed the countryside, could be seen everywhere.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Jandoleer, the young shaman, was on a quest, given to him by a well known merchant of Halas. Jan was trudging through the snow drifts and making only marginal headway, but was determined to continue forward on desolate Everfrost Peaks. In the distance, was a young boy no more than six seasons of age. He, too was making limited progress in the snowdrifts. Jan had been following the child for more than an hour. Not by design, but simply for that was the way each were headed and Jandoleer was not interested in a traveling companion.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Suddenly, an orc appeared in the distance. Apparently he had been killing and plundering the wildlife in the area and had grown bored simply laying waste to the fauna of the frozen tundra. He noticed the child struggling to make way in the snow and moved quickly to interecept him. With a blood curdling yell, the massive orc charged the boy with his rusty sword swinging over his head. Not paying attention to the danger around him, the lad was struck a glancing blow by the oncoming orc. The child stumbled, let out a cry and started running back in the direction he had come. Back toward Jandoleer. The bright red blood from a gash on his forehead, and fear, blinded him to the fact that someone was nearby and in an instant ran right into Jan. Running into the young shaman was like crashing into the side of a barn. The blow was so severe that it completely knocked the boy unconscious.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Jandoleer pulled his weapon and with a cry, began chanting a shamanistic spell. The orc that was bearing down on the young shaman and the boy suddenly froze in his tracks. Calmly, and with practiced ease, Jandoleer dodged a slash from the orc. Backing up out of range, Jan again cast another spell, and the hate faded in the orcs eyes. The life within the orc drained in a flash leaving a corpse where seconds before was a living, breathing, dealer of death.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Once he was sure the orc was no longer a threat, Jandoleer turned to the boy lying in the snow. The child's forehead had a terrible, though not life threatening, gash which was bleeding profusely. Again raising his hands out over the lad, Jandoleer again chanted another spell. The pale light of healing spread out over the child's body. The injury on his head slowly closed, leaving what would obviously be a scar which he would carry the rest of his life. As the boy awoke and realised where he was, rather than thanking the shaman for having saved his life, he jump up from the snow and ran off in the direction of Halas, screaming in terror. Jan smiled once he was sure the boy was headed in the right direction and turned back toward the direction he had been traveling. Back to his own quest.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;End Chapter 1&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>The dragon, the shattered blade, and the gashed armor</title>

      <description>So there I was, walking the halls of the great Temple of Veeshan, a place that I had worked hard to to be blessed enough to enter without being destroyed by the guardian drakes and dragons. I was walking down the halls, the walls stained with the blood of many who failed in thier attempts to slay these beast of legend. The floors were warm, but scuffed by the boots of my fallen brethren. I could still hear the battles raging, the dragons unleashing thier powerful roars that send many running in fear, and the bright glow of thier magnificent magics filling the long coridors. The tools of destruction were scattered around the halls, obviously dropped by those trying to find an exit. It was then that I noticed the glow of my holy blade reflecting from a blade upon the ground. I kneeled down and took a look at the blade, tried to resist the urge to handle the blade, but my curiousity had bested me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As I removed my guantlets to feel the weight of the blade for myself, the indentation of the former owners hand in the hilt, and the swiftness of the blade through the air. I started to have a vision, a most horrible vision indeed. I see several people surrounding me, of many backgrounds, from many proffessions. To my left were priest cowering behind a wall, peeking out occasional to chant a few words and send the bright glow of a heal upon a falling comrade. To my right were archers wielding the most magnicent bows, cocking back the string with pristine arrows lined and aimed for what I had saw next. I looked foward to see a massive dragon, it must have stood six stories tall, surrounded by brave men and women wielding the majestic weapons they had found in thier adventures. In front of the dragon was a knight, much alike myself in my younger days, follying his swings and fizzleing the spells between the swipes of this massive dragon's claws.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then the dragon's claw came down for the first time, knocking him back a large distance, tearing his shield in two rendering it useless. He must have flown back a good twenty feet, stood up and rushed toward the dragon with his sword high in the air, letting out a most powerful yaulp. As he neared the dragon several wizards and magicians rushed toward the dragon, wiggled thier fingers, chanted some words in an arcane tongue and the dragon's skin ignited in the most brilliant display of magics. The dragon roared loudly, and they took off running for cover. &amp;quot;There is no escape for you mortal !&amp;quot;, he bellowed summoning a wizard in front of him. Shortly after came his claw, tearing the limbs from the poor man's body, leaving him in a most un-recoverable pile of human ramains.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the fight progressed several had died from this dragon's fierce power, but knight still persevered, standing face to face with this monsterous beast, hacking and slashing, casting one spell after another in an attempt to keep the dragon's attention. But then something went wrong, a cleric passed out from exhuastion, another attempting to meditate to regain strength to land just a few more heals. But the dragon's powerful magic filled the halls, awaking the cleric from his meditation and weaking the entire force. Corpses were strewn about all over the place, on a few braves remained to finish the beast, who was starting to wear down. It's legs were bleeding most fatally, stomache almost completely unscaled, and skin that was nearly burned to a crisp.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The dragon now realized he was nearing his death, and these brave warriors were still going strong despite thier dwindling numbers. He turned and attempted to flee, calling out for help, but none of them wanted anything to do with him. He was a shame to his race, nearly defeated by mere mortals, unable to guard the inner sanctum of thier great temple. It was then, the knight rushed under the massive being, thrust his sword upwards and pierce the thick skin of the beast. The dragon stumbled, and turned to face the knight. It's eyes were begging for relief, but it wasn't going down just yet. Again he raised his massive claw, swooped down and gashed through the knights thick armor, exposing the innards of his chest. The priest chanted many heals but none were able to save this now fallen knight. In one last breath he said his prayer, asking his god, Mithaniel Marr, to grant his brethren safe passage out of the temple.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everything was blurry after that, and fading away back to the temple that I now know. The sword in my hand began to crack, and shattered shortly after. A loud crackle erupted from the blade, acompanied by a bright glow flowing upward. I think it may have been the knight's soul finally leaving this plane of existing and moving into the afterlife, but only he and Lord Mithaniel Marr know for certain what happend during that instant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Hey Shill, you ok? Your looking a little pale bro&amp;quot;, my friend asked me from down the hall.&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Yeah i'm fine, I think i've seen all i can handle of this place&amp;quot;, I replied to him.&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;What's that broken sword in your hand?&amp;quot;, he asked.&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Just a remnent of a once great knight&amp;quot;, i said to him as i placed the sword back on the ground where I found it.&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Rest in piece brave knight. I will see to it the bards transcribe your battle into the history books of Myrist&amp;quot;, I uttered while placing my guantlet back onto my hand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
