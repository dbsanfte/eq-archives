      <description>And I was pointing out that it isn't as unbalanced as you are portraying it. The spell has a few limitations(12 second recast,difficulty to aim, and target must be stationary) that completely removes the "unresistable" aspect of it. Actually the spell is resistable in the sense it is just an archery hit, so you can avoid it like you avoid regular arrows.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now this spell is quite powerful if you have a caster that is sitting on their bum and you come behind them pop ts and use hoa, for they will take full damage because they are sitting(which is a lot of damage).&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;k lets go over what the spell does it hits all mobs/people standing INFRONT lets say that again INFRONT if you have any sort of sense in pvp as a necro u would be shadowstepping after each spell and trying to generally stay out of range of melee and out of view meaning u wouldn't be bothered about this spell.maybe its just u suck as a player not the spell being overpowered?</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Well, OK, I'll allow that maybe I suck.&amp;nbsp; Answer me this though:&amp;nbsp; What's a ranger's typical first move in a fight (especially with a caster)?&amp;nbsp; Yeah, that's right, snare.&amp;nbsp; Now, I usually resist snare, but many players don't.&amp;nbsp; I happened to get hit with this while I was focused on a mob (also typical, no?).&amp;nbsp; I don't know about you, but I'm not generally moving and&amp;nbsp;shadow-stepping around when there are mobs in close proximity (unless I'm kiting).&amp;nbsp; What you're saying makes perfect sense for a /duel on a blue server, but on Zek (at least in my experience) nobody is going to come up and say "alright, I'm about to start ganking you, better start running".&amp;nbsp; Most fights start with someone trying to use the element of suprise, either by camping a zone-in, or by waiting until you have mobs in camp to attack.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;For the guy who said that the need to aim mitigates the power of this spell, I'm sorry, but we both know that a goodly percentage of the PK specialists out there are using secret sauce that allows them to auto-face their target.&amp;nbsp; Yeah, it's illegal, but SOE either can't or doesn't want to stop it, so when we're looking at things like this it has to be taken into account.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;For Pinhead, any way to find out if damage from this is avoided/mitigated as if it were melee damage?&amp;nbsp; If that's the case then I agree, it's not really a big deal.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Seemed to hit me full both times it was used though, and I have pretty high aa and skill&amp;nbsp;in those areas.&amp;nbsp; If it can't be resisted like a spell AND it can't be avoided/mitigated like melee, then I still think it's a problem.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;god spacebaro give me back my IQ point and rewrite that in english please.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;To Mel: The HoA spell effects are the same as regular arrow hits, thus they follow the standard mitigation rules and are even effected by true shot.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>The only way you could get hit by that spell is if you were standing completely still while it was being cast. The spell has about a 2 degree tolerance, so if you move slightly or the caster barely misaims it will miss you entirely.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Guess what a caster has to do while they're casting a spell.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
