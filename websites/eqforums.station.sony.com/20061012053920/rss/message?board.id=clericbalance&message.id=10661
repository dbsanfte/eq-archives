    <title>What ever happened to Cleric Mana Regen?</title>
    <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=clericbalance&amp;message.id=10661</link>
    <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Clerics have the slowest mana regen of any caster, and even of many hybrids. Currently with full mana regen from items and AA (23), C6, and sitting, it takes me 14.8 minutes to go from OOM to FM.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I think 1/4 of an hour to regen is not just too long, it is damned STOOPID!!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;A few months back some dev said they were "looking into it". Since then I have heard nothing.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So what ever happened to the mana regen issue?&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Consider divine resurrection as well. 5aa every 24hrs will give 100% mana. and yes you can use it after you been rezzed, just loot your gear first, then pop it.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Nearing 10k mana myself, I find mana regen to be just fine after a wipe. Yes it takes&amp;nbsp;a few minutes, but the clerics are rezzed first (if raid), if only to get their clicky out and start rezzing others.&amp;nbsp; If I was fm 5min after I buffed after a wipe, the guild wouldnt be. They rethink strats etc.&amp;nbsp; 10 to 15min after clerics are rezzed back into a raid wipe zone, we're back in action.&amp;nbsp; Nothing wrong, move along.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Aye I learned that trick some time ago.&amp;nbsp; You do not get the 100% XP restored if you do a 96% first, but you loot everything but one backpack and you then div rez, rez effects are gone and you get 100% of your hp and mana restored.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The problem I have with using that ability after a raid wipe is that you are going to have to wait for the rest of the raid to med anyway, so there is little point in div rezzing yourself IMO.&amp;nbsp; I usually save div rez for when I die in the middle of an event and I need to get back into healing ASAP, so I get rezzed, I loot then I div rez myself.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;While I certainly would not mind an increase in the Ft cap, I think med times for wipes are being exaggerated here. After a wipe, if we're resetting in the raid zone, we'll usually MGB perfection, C6, oak and SA. Then everyone clicks their clickies, and the jester wine. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Anyone who needs mana faster will get necro pumped. Usually we are back up and running in 5 minutes. Is that really too long, considering we just wiped?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If we summon to guild lobby it is even faster. Rez, head to pool, then MGB perfection. FM lickety split.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;I don't see this. The problem is that it is not just med time from OOM to FM - it is that you also have to redo all the buffs on self, group, and maybe raid. This alone can take half your mana pool if you MGB.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;And even with bard song, SA, etc, I have timed it and it still takes me a bare minimum of 9 minutes, if I cast no spells that use mana.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;Necros/mages/bl FTW! I don't see you mentioning twitch, mod rods&amp;nbsp;or perfection either. And is 9 minutes really that long to wait, if you just wiped?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;And like the above poster points out, if it is just a group grind, med up to 40 mana and then start pulls.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;One way to do this is like have a Super-Meditative state. To activate it one would, maybe, use one of the old vestiges of our spellbook.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Cast a spell similar to &lt;A href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=2501&amp;amp;source=Live" target=_blank&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/A&gt;, disallow PC's from triggering it. Have it broken upon standing after 2 ticks (also broken if you remain on a horse) so people have&amp;nbsp;to sit down, have it broken upon detection of NPC in a 100 radius. From that point on have it cast a self only bardish mana regen tick, which could gain in strength every couple of ticks or so. With the trigger detection the song could be instantly broken as soon as a mob comes into range of your party.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Have the spell on a 5 minute recast so that people can't abuse it for long pulls, and I think this would be a workable suggestion for all classes.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;I&amp;nbsp;asked it before, I'll&amp;nbsp;ask it again, do you &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;U&gt;REALLY ABSOLUTELY &lt;/U&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;have to get to full mana after you die?&amp;nbsp; In my experience ther answer is no.&amp;nbsp; After buffing I need 30% mana to start pulls in a group.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Raids are a different beast altogether, if you wipe to a boss and are about to try again full mana is a requirement.&amp;nbsp; Raids are about getting loot not XP and therefore raiders want the best chance to succeed.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;NO, use the jesters in the guild hall before raids. Then all the illusions drop when you zone out, and you have already had time to test the food/drink and discard the poisoned stuff.

&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;Well, it is not a requirement, but jesters are not banned in the guild hall, so usually you'll see several up on wipes, or before raids. Personally, I like having a stack of +3 mana clickies.&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;

      <description>My guild leader once told me, when I was complaining about my mana regen and wishing clerics got a gather mana, he said, "you have a gather mana, its called DR".  So now I try to use DR when we wipe at raids, one cleric uses it so they can get the raid buffed while the other clerics are medding.</description>

      <description>I think this is a real issue on raids, but trivial in groups.  Unless you're doing content WAY over your head (or don't have a tank appropriate for the content), then it's pretty tough for a smart cleric to go oom in xp groups.  Yah, CH in groups is a real yawner, but it gets the job done at a fairly minimal cost.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On raids, however, the slow mana regen becomes more of an issue.  Clerics have it worse than any other pure caster because our self mana buff doesn't stack with Oak.  Chanters have gather, wizzies have familiars and gather, shammies have canni, necros have lich, mages can steal mana from pets and have mod rods (although those are shareable) and druids... well, druids are almost as bad off as clerics, except that they get the little bit extra from their self-buff.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There actually was a gather mana AA for clerics in testing (for DoN, I think), but it never made it off of beta.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The real problem with giving clerics a huge mana regen boost is that it would wreck old content (including relatively recent old content), which is designed around old levels of mana regen.  So, what Sony needs to do is figure out a way to increase post-wipe regen without trivializing content.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm not a programmer, so I have no clue how tough some of these solutions would be to implement, but here are my suggestions:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To deal with raid mana regen after wipes:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(1)  a new raid leader AA that gives a raid 25%/50%/75% of it's mana back.  HOWEVER, this ability cannot be activated if anyone in the raid is in an raid level dynamic zone or task.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(2)  a new raid leader AA that basically brings the guildhall hot tub to the raid, for increased hp/mana/end regen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(3)  an enchanter AA that summons a Ward which increases mana regen (can give the ward 1hp and make it generate insane aggro, if it's too powerful for use during encounters).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To deal with cleric mana regen issues in general:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(1)  make Armour of the XXX stack with the Oak line (maybe decrease the Armour line hps a bit at the same time).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(2)  increase the FT cap by another 5-10 (for all classes).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(3)  give clerics the mastery of the past AA (even though this wouldn't work on our high level spam heals, at least we'd stop fizzling CH, a level 39 spell that we've cast 100k+ times).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(4)  give clerics a diety-specific familiar with benefits similar to wizzy familiars (I want a giant floating beer stein!)</description>

&lt;P&gt;The real problem with giving clerics a huge mana regen boost is that it would wreck old content (including relatively recent old content), which is designed around old levels of mana regen.

HOWEVER, this ability cannot be activated if anyone in the raid is in an raid level dynamic zone or task.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;Would be nice, but seems pretty hard to impliment (used to code in C++ for ackmuds.)&amp;nbsp; ALso, how helpful would it really be if it can't be activated in a Zone/Task?&amp;nbsp; ALmost&amp;nbsp;all end-game content is gotten by Task or Instance, and the time you really need the extra regen is after a wipe when everyone is rez'ing and rebuffing IN the zone you wiped in.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;(2) a new raid leader AA that basically brings the guildhall hot tub to the raid, for increased hp/mana/end regen.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;Not a bad idea.&amp;nbsp; Hard to impliment just because you gotta come up with: Would it radiate out from the Raid Leader, how far would the radius be, how long would it last, agro effects of it, etc.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;(3) an enchanter AA that summons a Ward which increases mana regen (can give the ward 1hp and make it generate insane aggro, if it's too powerful for use during encounters).&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Now this is a very nice original idea.&amp;nbsp; Would be great for all classes... Only prob i see it facing is how would you control it for group settings?&amp;nbsp; It some places the extra regen would make content super-trivial.&amp;nbsp; But then again, as levels are raised and new content comes out, older content should become even more trivial...&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;Maybe an idea they could add to help this plus numerous other ideas is create some "Raid-Only" AAs, where you are required to be in a Raid to use them.&amp;nbsp; Also have it set so that if using any of the Raid-Only AA's, the abilities stop when you leave the raid.&amp;nbsp; Yes, i can already see that some can "cheat" or use a loophole to abuse it&amp;nbsp; (create a raid just to be able to use those AA's)... but maybe yall can help figure how to fix it.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;To deal with cleric mana regen issues in general:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;(1) make Armour of the XXX stack with the Oak line (maybe decrease the Armour line hps a bit at the same time).&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;IMO (a druid one mind you), this should have been done long ago.&amp;nbsp; I think they should remove the HP component all-together, and make it stack with both CV and Bali.&amp;nbsp; That way you get your self-only mana regen buff that almost all caster class get some form of.&amp;nbsp; Only thing i dont like about it is that it bumps cleric Mana Regen up and leaves Druids in last :P&amp;nbsp; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;(2) increase the FT cap by another 5-10 (for all classes).&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;IMO, they should make an AA that you gotta get after the OOW AA's that removes the cap altogether.&amp;nbsp; Sounds a little overpowering at first....but what's the point of them adding FT to so many items and so many augs if it has such a low cap?&amp;nbsp; Plus the distribution of loot will have a balance on it.... the newer/younger players will likely have less AA's, less gear not much FT (prolly 10-20 total), while your end-game raiders are cap'd at 20, but wear 30+ Mana regen (in addition to having many augs in the bank that are deemed worthless because of the cap).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;(3) give clerics the mastery of the past AA (even though this wouldn't work on our high level spam heals, at least we'd stop fizzling CH, a level 39 spell that we've cast 100k+ times).&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;SoE has been promising a fix to the fizzle-rate post 65, but haven't seen any word on it lately.&amp;nbsp; How much crap is it for a Level 70 &amp;lt;fill in your class&amp;gt; with 800 AAs, every possible AA to prevent Fizzle (including stupid stufflike Secondary Forte), yet STILL fizzle a spell 3 times in a row?&amp;nbsp; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;I have never noticed a&amp;nbsp; huge difference.&amp;nbsp; example you go to RSS with two groups to take out chalik, you do this and one group stays behind to XP..they are still in the raid but XP is not affected so severely that people notice.&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
