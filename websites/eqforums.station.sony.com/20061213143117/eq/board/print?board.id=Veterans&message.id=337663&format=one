<DIV>I am pretty sure Thrusday is correct, was supsoed to be today (wednesday) but due to SoE:s internet connection was seriously messed up yesterday (login, boards and more was down for 5+ hours) they probarbly decided to push patch to Thursday.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>On a sidenote would be nice to get an explanation of yesterdays mess, spoiled a raid night for me. No information on board or antyhing on what was going on but when there are 99 general channels in chat you know something is seriously wrong.</DIV>
