&lt;DIV&gt;You could always go to your home city do some of the basic quests for armor, it won't be anything half way good but atleast you won't be nude ... or i would suggest getting DoD cultrual Armor sell's pretty cheap and also with the augs its not half bad, you will have to start out with expert's Armor until 55 then you can move up to master's but maybe by then you will have built back up some plat .. Alot of the armor that was selling for 2-3 k&amp;nbsp; a couple of years back is now 100 - 200 so you might find killing a few simple mobs for looter trash will set ya up for a couple of levels. &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;hail vivian the true (in libruary in PoK), she gives you two quests that send you to two NPCs that will give you armor quests, not great armor, but the quests will be trivial to 52, even naked, especially if you use your pet. should have a set of armor very quickly, so you don't look naked.  If you have bought depths of darkhollow, try doing quests there, especially the exploration one the gnome cartographer gives you, about 10ac/50hp/mana plus stats augmentation (augs are gem-like-items you attatch to normal items).  if you need a charm to put that aug in, there is a dwarf in the neutral section of pok, speak to him ('what craft' will give you a charm that improves as you complete raids/quests in planes of power). if you can get a guild, even a medium sized familly guild will do, you should be able to get your epic, shaman epic is relatively easy, plus you will get some boots that cast sow out of it and a shield!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;if you get bastion of thunder or tactic flags, try get groups together there to kill names.  in plane of tranquility you can turn in ornate patterns/moulds for equipment.  At 52 you should be able to kill hillgiants/probably icegiants naked if you canni/heal enough.  these are good money mobs, plus xp on icegiants!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;if you can get ldons together they should yield reasonable equipment and augmentations.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Sound advice, thanks very much for the response. Yes, it does seem this board is pretty dead. Yeah, it looks like I have a lot of farming to do. My shaman not only doesnt have a fungi, he has nothing but an old plane of hate shield. Anyhoo, going to check out that link right away.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>Just getting Virtue and Focus at 52 will put you on par with an 'old school' level 52 Shaman from back in the day. Any gear you don't pay for is good gear; eventually, in your 60s, you'll be killing stuff that will drop nice upgrades for you, even in pickup groups. I just got a new earring in a pickup group yesterday - that was a nice surprise, was just there for xp. :)</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;You need a certain number of posts before you get the priveledge of an edit button can't recall how many exactly but think its over 100.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;As far as your gear goes. /shrug you'd have to replace most of your old stuff anyway unless you were sporting a fungi or alot of jaundiced (even that ye'd wanna replace) gears cheap nowadays and you can always farm the heck out of greens to buy some cheapo stuff in the baz so you can actually get to work gearing back up.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Oh and you'll wanna head over to &lt;A href="http://crucible.samanna.net/" target=_blank&gt;http://crucible.samanna.net/&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp; this board is pretty dead it seems&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Skex_Fu on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;11-14-2005&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;05:50 PM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Please forgive me, first post. I don't know how I double posted, and can't figure out how to edit... lol.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;To continue, a little history of myself. I played the Heck out of this game... 3 years ago. At the time I was staying with some friends and used their pc's. I never owned my own PC until about 2 weeks ago. When I moved out, I gave my account to a friend, who stripped all my chars. I allowed this, thinking I would never play again. I've kept myself busy playing EQOA, on the ps2. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Recently I won a great deal of money at a Casino, and got around to purchasing (a very nice) gaming PC.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I immediately quit EQOA, and started EQPC again. Let me tell you, it was like coming home to a long lost love :)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I've missed this game more than I could have imagined. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Unfortunately, all my chars are naked, lol.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I have a 52 Shaman on Xegony, and I'm wondering where I should go from here? I loved my shaman more than the several other chars I played, and he quickly replaced my, then, main of a 42 Wizard. I don't have all the expansions. My account has through PoP registered, but when I started again, I only purchased Chronicles... Kunark, Luclin, and LoY. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Any advice would be welcome.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
