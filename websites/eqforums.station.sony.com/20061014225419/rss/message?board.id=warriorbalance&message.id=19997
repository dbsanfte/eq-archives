      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Because sk's at least have suffered over 400 nerfs, and people in general dislike haveing something given, then taken away from them. I suppose warriors wouldn't like defensive reduced to 90 seconds either.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;BB's claims&amp;nbsp; are all&amp;nbsp; about haveing things taken from warriors, when in actuallity that is untrue. Granting knights abilities similer to warriors takes nothing from warriors, except maybe their percieved notion of&amp;nbsp;entitlement they don't actually have.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;Someone comeing in and claiming they are a the "Primary group tank" because they are a "warrior" doesn't mean anything more than he is a warrior. A cop is a cop, they are not exactly a brave cop or a good cop or a friendly cop until they proove such through actions. Until then, they are simply a cop.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;A warrior is a tank class yes, but not the primary tank for a group until they proove themselves worthy of such a place. There are knights who aren't good primary group tanks either because they are terrible playing that class. Then again some knights are outstanding primary group tanks, and have proven themselves worthy of "primary group tank".&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;BB sometimes think's groups should make room for him to tank even if they allready have a knight tanking, or that groups should wait for him to log on if they need a tank. Being a&amp;nbsp; tank class is not "being a tank", I could play a wizzard and not know what I'm doing, thus I would be a bad wizzard. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;People need to learn to swallow thier pride, I as much as anyone. If a group prefer's a certain tank because they know them or have grouped with them alot. That &amp;nbsp;make's &amp;nbsp;you the noobie to that group, if&amp;nbsp;they ask you do dps or pull or something while they other person tanks, you do it. Reguardless of what class they may be, because that's teamwork. Trying to bully your way isn't going to win points with that group.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;BB, we don't know what they plan to do with them. They simply said how they are being used now wasn't intended. I personally think they didn't mean for the spell to be used in green zones where they can kill 30 mobs at once. As they are employed against current group content I rather suspect that is how they are intended. So, at least with DS, they will prolly restrict what level critter can actually proc it. Not only that they prolly want to redo it so they can fit another spell like it at level 73 or 75, a more powerful version.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;You need to get over your bad self, the game doesn't cater to any one person or any one class. &lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;That's actually to be expected as knights advance in level, get spells, and stack thier melee aa with thier spell aa. I've said this over and over, sooner or later the thing will collapse under it's own weight and either knights will be allowed to do what a real&amp;nbsp;D and&amp;nbsp;D type knight&amp;nbsp;class can do or they will have to eliminate the knight class.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;We get level 75 this next exspansion, you want to see how my new spells will look? They will be more powerful than the ones warriors complain about now..&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;These discussions are silly.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Warriors consistantly whine about anything a klnight gets, though it doesn't affect our ability to tank at the highest level, the focus of warrior class in EQ.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Decrepit skin is a nice spell for blue-con mobs, big deal.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Perhaps we should totally flatten the classes, let warriors have abilities allowing them to solo and tank low level mobs as effectively as we do, and giving us abilities to tank new-content raid mobs.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;When a warrior gets a new disc or ability that lets them tank a raid mob even better than I can, making the disparity greater, I cheer - it helps us.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Why are warriors (as a whole) so insecure that they are intimidated because I can handle old content solo a bit better?&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Actually fought with Cirulik many times, he's a good man and id choose to have him watch my back any day.&amp;nbsp; Where as id concur a knight blade would be incredible in a warriors hands, its not meant for us. Knights do gain some items thru the prestige of there class type, i wouldnt begrudge them a good sword when they dont have access to dual weild. I would begrudge the devs for not making a blade of a similar type, meaning a warrior weapon perfectly designed for todays content and just for this class as they aswell have had. But in no way would the devs ever give us eulogy, the dps we would create would be imbalancing.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I personally dont care who tanks better in group based content, why should I ? I still get groups as do the knights and my lfg would usually only be on for 5 min or so. Think most of you guys seem to have this idea in your head that there is some conspiricy out there trying to replace wars. Sony made it perfectly clear, this is not going to happen the new content was designed making warriors the preferd tank line to take on these encounters.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Yes a Knight can hold agro without swinging a blade, They still were not choosen atleast on my server to tank draygun, they dont tank ghost in razorthorn even though ghost has a huge ds. Its easy to know there are knights that were upset warriors were given the tools we were. And in the past yes, knights were replacing wars in a great deal of content. But how ive always looked at it is this, a warrior can tank being less geared for the new content your breaking into. Given time and drops from that zone a knight, can also tank effectivly in that new content. Thats where we are at now, if any of you belive the knights are replacing us in cutting edge raid content. Post the guilds, that are useing them as front line tanks on new content and what encounters.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Im sure a knight demiplane geared could tank vish, but i highly doubt if your demi plane geared as a tank, that it would really bother you that a knight is tanking somthing you have done 15 times. I saw cirulik tank Ture actually in fact i put him up to it, he did a&amp;nbsp;fine job . He is max avoidance and has alot of tools and when i asked him to do it, I tried to find was to adapt his own class skills and spells to make it possible. Think really if you guys started looking at knights more as fellow tanks, you'd find less arguements and more common ground. I have no fear that cirulik wants to replace me. He'd probably like to be given a chance to play with the big nasties to, but i never felt he wanted me to be the dps tank.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Warriors currently are designed to take the most ammount of punishment with the least required gearing. Knights are given the best ability to get fast acting agro, but require to be more geared for the content. This doesnt scream there meant to replace us, this screams there protectors of the raid, they watch the clerics and the hippies and keep the heal chain going. Whether you belive it or not, we need eachother in some respects, ive been in guilds where they had only 3 wars ive been in guilds with 10. Every guild has a different feel to it, but knights and wars are not exactly as different as you guys try to make it out. And there is no conspiricy.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Not disagreeing with you, but in reality there has been no upgrade to that disc, because non is needed, it scales up infinitely.&amp;nbsp; The only real way to make it upgradeable is to cap it forcing a need for an upgrade.&amp;nbsp; Not saying it should happen, but as far as I can tell that is the only way to upgrade several of your raid discs.</description>

&lt;P&gt;Thank you for the observation, but that's not the point... I think Knights have skills in missing the point sometimes.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; It's like the 5 people who tried to argue with me over Echo of Anger yesterday when that wasn't the point... the point isn't whether or not we've had an "upgrade", but that this guy drones on about how he cheers whenever we get an upgrade that increases our survival against bosses, yet there hasn't ever actually BEEN one, thus he's not telling the truth.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The point is, don't say "You should cheer like I do", when you've never cheered before.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I want to cheer Warriors on, and I do want to see them get upgrades to things that have been weak over time (their discs/agro).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I was happy to see things come into the game like Bazu Bellow that take away from the direct proc dependency of warriors.&amp;nbsp; I was happy to see stonewall show up, they were good benefits to a class that needed a boost.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The problem is this... you guys go too far, push too hard.&amp;nbsp; You want everything and are willing to sacrifice no where because the belief seems to be "I am a Warrior, I am suppose to be the best in the game."&amp;nbsp; What you guys are best at isn't enough.... you want more, you want to dominate all encounters, all scenarios, no matter how unrealistic that aspiration is.&amp;nbsp; It seems like there is absolutely no acceptance for anyone to be a blip on the radar anywhere near the Warrior class.&amp;nbsp; That is completely unhealthy for EQ.&amp;nbsp; There simply is not enough warriors in the game to fulfill the needs of every group, and forcing every group to have to have a warrior or suffer barely being able to keep another person tanking alive is not healthy for the game.&amp;nbsp; It didn't work in GoD.... and it will never work.&amp;nbsp; All it does is frustrate the entire player base minus warriors.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Things I have seen stated:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;"If a knight can solo it, I should be able to mitigate enough to solo it as well."&amp;nbsp; The answer to this is balance.&amp;nbsp; Power levels of classes are always varied.&amp;nbsp; What some classes can do others can not.&amp;nbsp; Just because a warrior is a better tank than a Knight, it doesn't mean they are to have a higher overall power rate than someone who can cast and melee.&amp;nbsp; Yes, warriors SHOULD gain some more of an advantage to their tanking, but I am also a proponent that Knights need this also.&amp;nbsp; I don't think any of the three tank classes like seeing DPS classes tanking nearly on par with them.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;"There needs to be group stuff that only Warriors can handle efficiently"&amp;nbsp; There is stuff like this in every expansion, the problem is, more often than not people don't want to deal with Challenging Content.&amp;nbsp; When people want exp they want it fast, furious and easy.&amp;nbsp; Why are creators so popular?&amp;nbsp; Solid exp rate, fast pulls, and good return on time.&amp;nbsp; Why is MPG generally more popular than RSS?&amp;nbsp; It's easier, slightly lower exp, but mobs die faster and are easier to kill and have less random effects (ie charm/mez).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;"X Class should not be able to ever tank a raid mob"&amp;nbsp; This one I do agree with, but in the same respect, disagree with.&amp;nbsp; When EQ relies only on one class being there to beat an encounter, that is damaging to the game.&amp;nbsp; No one class should be extremely more important than any other... but that will never be the case.&amp;nbsp; Raids will always require Warriors there to tank, unless what you are raiding has become trivial.&amp;nbsp; Where raids trivial out is however a sliding scale based on the overall encounter.&amp;nbsp; If mobs aren't hard, they aren't hard.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;When I see the fact that warriors are upset that they are not the best tanks for exp groups, and ignore what they are the best at, I will admit that it does frustrate me.&amp;nbsp; The problem is that people seem to view group exp'ing as the holy grail.&amp;nbsp; As it's been said many times over, the power with knights grows when the mobs get weaker.&amp;nbsp; The weaker a mob is, the more a knight "appears" to grow in power.&amp;nbsp; My fast heal saves my tail against exp mobs constantly, why?&amp;nbsp; Because if it crits, it can completely negate 1-2 rounds of combat from a mob.&amp;nbsp; On a raid, I have one fail safe in LOH if I realize to use it before I'm dead.&amp;nbsp; My fast heal, unless it crits, barely heals 1 moderate-full damage hit from a raid mob.&amp;nbsp; My slow heal is rather difficult to get off while tanking raid mobs especially, and my hot is 585 a tic, more often than not a shaman/cleric should be keeping a bigger one on a tank anyway.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Warriors, on the other hand, do have unmatched survivability against the hardest encounters of EQ.&amp;nbsp; They always have, they always will.&amp;nbsp; Exp groups will never be the hardest encounters in EQ.&amp;nbsp; However, looking at 68.3 as an example, Warriors survived that long before I even came close with&amp;nbsp;a cleric, druid&amp;nbsp;and myself all trying to keep me up.&amp;nbsp; The warrior that tanked it for me only needed one cleric.&amp;nbsp; There are exp places where warriors do reign supreme still, but they aren't common because too common and you have the same issues as you did with GoD, the game no longer becomes fun for the majority of the EQ population.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Frodlin, I do believe you to be a rather intelligent person.&amp;nbsp; However, at the same respect, it seems like a lot of times pride, jealousy, ego all get in the way and are the primary motives for a lot of things.&amp;nbsp; This game is about cooperation and team work, and sometimes I think warriors come off acting like a spoiled superstar saying they demand the attention and everyone else is just filler.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Experiance groups ARE the holy grail. A new expansion is coming with new levels to obtain and new AA's. Warrior inferiority in group content must end before then.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"...and my hot is 585 a tic..."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My Stalwart Servant has a 600 HP/tic HoT. It's kinda nice for a half-hour a day to see how overpowered Paladins are 100% of the time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think WoR should be made into an Endurance Regen Aura and DS into a pet buff. SK pets need to be made a little more robust.&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Battleblade-Xegony on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;07-07-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;11:18 AM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Once again Battleblade, you're envy and jealous reigns supreme.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;In exp groups, how often do I cast my hot on myself?&amp;nbsp; Never, clerics keep theirs on me.&lt;BR&gt;In exp groups, how often do I have to cast a fast heal/slow heal on myself?&amp;nbsp; Almost never.&amp;nbsp; Why?&amp;nbsp; There is little to no exp group areas where stuff kills me faster than CH can land.&amp;nbsp; If I get spiked, it usually takes me out cold where I can't even get a heal off in time anyway.&amp;nbsp; More often than not, a solid spike can and probably will stun&amp;nbsp;me, once again rendering it near impossible to get a heal off before the mob can finish the job.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;You're right, exp groups will be important in the near future again.&amp;nbsp; If it's anything like OoW... unless the Knight is over geared, a warrior will always be picked over a knight to start hunting in a place similar in difficulty to RSS when OOW came out.&amp;nbsp; Why is that?&amp;nbsp; Oh yeah, Warriors are more likely to handle more difficult exp group content than a knight of the same gear level.&amp;nbsp; And undergeared warrior is more likely to survive than an undergeared knight.&amp;nbsp; That is fact, no matter how much you want to try and twist it BB.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Let's see here, let's add to further speculation.&amp;nbsp; Paladins might get new stuns again, but how much content will they stun in terms of exp hunting?&amp;nbsp; Following the general trend of DoN, into DoDh, into PoR, all of which have had a steady decrease in the effectiveness of a stun spell.... I am almost fairly certain only about 25-50% of content through the next expansion (lvl 70+) will be stunnable at all.&amp;nbsp; If it's anything like PoR, 0-25% would probably be a more accurate representation.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I still find it amazing you claim something is overpowered when both Shaman and Clerics have HoTs.&amp;nbsp; If necessary, they cast them.&amp;nbsp; Otherwise, they are a waste of mana that doesn't need to be cast.&amp;nbsp; How about this, next time you're grouped with a cleric, demand they cast Supernal Elixer on you constantly so you can have the overpowered, better than Paladin HoT constantly.&amp;nbsp; The only time my HoTs provide any use what so ever is in soloable content.&amp;nbsp; But yeah, solo'ing relates so very much to grouping power in your eyes.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;"...Warriors&amp;nbsp; handle &lt;b&gt;more difficult&lt;/b&gt; exp group content than a knight of the same gear level."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks for posting that. For an brief instant I was afraid you were bright, truthful, and I'd have to take your arguments seriously.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Experiance group content Sir Lee (Surly, git-it?) is ALWAYS low risk fast kill content where Knight advantage is maximized.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I play a Pally. How often do I HoT. Before every incoming mob if I get the chance and after each. Why, so the Druid or Shaman (I'm eligible for &lt;u&gt;3 times&lt;/u&gt; as many groups as a Warrior - Clerics, Druids, and Shaman MH) saves a little mana. Besides with the Aggro Free Ride, I'm at 90% most of the time anyway.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"&lt;u&gt;no exp group areas where stuff kills me&lt;/u&gt; faster than CH can land.&amp;nbsp; If I&#xD;
get spiked, it usually takes me out cold where I can't even get a heal&#xD;
off in time anyway.&amp;nbsp; More often than not, &lt;u&gt;a solid spike&lt;/u&gt;..."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Giggle. Yeah, you gots to look out for those solid spikes in today's experiance group content.

&lt;DIV&gt;What utter tripe.&amp;nbsp; Do you really believe that a warrior is not an effective tank with a druid or shaman MH?&amp;nbsp; Do you really believe that a warrior is not still a desireable tank because the healer isn't a cleric?&amp;nbsp; Man, you've really out done yourself this time.&amp;nbsp; I can't imagine anyone is dumb enough to believe that garbage...not even you so it must be another exaggeration to overvalue paladin skills as you generally do.&amp;nbsp; Now before you hit reply and start twisting my words read this carefully: Paladin spells and skills DO HAVE VALUE, they just don't have anywhere near the value YOU place on them.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
