				<DIV>SirKaine, I was thinking about this again (from your post on the newbie zone).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Have you double-checked your task to make sure you read it right?&nbsp; Is one of the problems I sometimes have that I read the descriptions and then jump into conclusions and only then notice I was sent to another zone or something.&nbsp; No chance that you need to go see Aviaks in Lake Rathe or anything?</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Alt Q to bring up the task menu again, the name of the task will also be there.&nbsp; To be really useful to the developers they would need to know the name of the task and your level and class when you got it.&nbsp; Sometimes the name is used multiple times, other tasks share common parts.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Some tasks are broken.&nbsp; Kharl took down some information yesterday on one where he had to deliver lake pebbles to an npc in Felwithe.&nbsp; There was no line on his compass.&nbsp; I checked his task menu and yes, he was at the right place at the right stage.&nbsp; We looked through pretty much every inch and cranny (ok, I did not check under the water) AND tracked both felwithe zones and couldn't find the NPC.&nbsp; Don't know if it has always been bugged or maybe the NPC was forgotten after the zone repop from the recent FV quests.</DIV>
<DIV><BR>I've also had problems with turn in mobs in Hollowshade not being there.&nbsp; Haven't tried one of those tasks lately but probably will this week.</DIV>
