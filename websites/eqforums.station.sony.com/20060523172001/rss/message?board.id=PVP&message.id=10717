      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Greetings all,&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;This was sent to me by your correspondent Kefray... I am pasting the official CS response in red below...&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
Kefyra wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Alot of people have had questions about the Rallos Zek ruleset and also in regards to the SOE view of what part of each rule entails.&amp;nbsp; Apparently, on each server, the gms have enforced each rule differently.&amp;nbsp; I will break down the ruleset here and ask the questions that most people have had so that can make it more clear and if it's ok with Brenlo, Ashlanne and Kytharrea, repost it onto the other site for everyone to see.&amp;nbsp; The following rules are the main ones that people interpret differently.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;OL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;On Rallos Zek, PvP-related Play Nice Policy situations are expected to be resolved using PvP solutions. However, Non PvP-related Play Nice Policy issues, such as training, causing intentional experience loss, bind point, zone, and portal camping, as well as other various forms of harassment, are not permitted in the PvP environment. &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The main question about this rule is mostly involving "causing intentional experience loss."&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; After talking to various servers, it seems that gms have enforced this rule differently, the main difference being in regards to attacking people while they were engaging mobs.&amp;nbsp; On Tallon Zek, the gms said it was ok to attack on mobs as long as you had a raid force large enough to kill the mob that you were attacking for.&amp;nbsp; For example, say your enemy is engaged on Zum Muram in Ruined City of Dranik.&amp;nbsp; You would not be allowed to send a group of sks to deathtouch clerics or what not ,because a group of sks could not foreseeably fight the mob alone so obviously there to make the raid wipe out intentionally, causing xp loss. &amp;nbsp; However, if you brought your whole raid force to fight for the mob, you were obviously there to pvp and have every intention to fight with the intent of killing your enemy via pvp so therefore were not intentionally causing xp loss.&amp;nbsp;Your "enemy" would have the choice of waiting to attack the mob&amp;nbsp;or prepare for pvp.&amp;nbsp; So attacking the mob was their choice instead of defending pvp, so attacking on the mob was "ok" . &amp;nbsp;On Vallon Zek, the gms there enforced that anyone attacking on mobs was intentionally trying to cause xp loss, according to members of Vallon Zek that I have spoken to.&amp;nbsp; I've gotten a lot of tells in game from different servers asking about this and there have been several posts.&amp;nbsp; Can one of you clarify this so that can inform the community?&amp;nbsp; Is it ok to attack while another guild is engaged with mobs or is it against the rule?&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The other rule fits in with the same as the previous one&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Characters will not lose experience when killed in PvP combat, under most circumstances, although the occasional loss of experience is to be expected. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;If you interpret those two rules together, it seems that pvp is acceptable on mobs as long as you're trying to kill the people, that on occasion xp loss may happen accidentally though.&amp;nbsp;I don't think that any guild is purposefully going to xp kill people for the most part.&amp;nbsp; Just trying to make sure that we're all on the same page.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;That seems to be the main two things that people are confused about.&amp;nbsp; With gms enforcing things differently on the various servers, clarification would help so that people can abide by the rules as best as possible.&amp;nbsp; With you're ok, will copy this post over on to the other boards once an answer is received to help people better understand the rules.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Of course everything depends on if we can prove their intentions or witness the actions in some way, so our response will be somewhat situational.&amp;nbsp; With that said, the situation(s) that this person described would be handled as follows:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;If raid X had yet to engage in the encounter, the raid should find a PvP solution.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;If both raid X and Y engage simultaneously, they should find a PvP solution.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;If raid X had engaged in the encounter and it was disrupted through PvP by group Y who did not have adequate force to have a reasonable chance for the encounter, we will enforce the PnP.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;I think that the rule "Characters will not lose experience when killed in PvP combat, under most circumstances, although the occasional loss of experience is to be expected." refers to the fact that a necro DoT, fall damage, or a Mage pet could kill you and you would lose exp (or any other factor).&amp;nbsp; The lack of experience loss is not guaranteed.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;There were no changes in the Rallos ruleset except the name of the server.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Just curious, has Ascending Dawn and Hate agreed to mob rotation?&amp;nbsp;Y'all would probably make a better allliance than the one you have with Ancient Dawn.&amp;nbsp; Your playstyle, practices, and beliefs are the same.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>Lol and who trained you?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sorry but if you cant kill someone that you outnumber 30+ to 1, then you deserved to be ninja looted.  Is it really that hard for one person to lock the corpse while the other 30+ of your raid force kills this person?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Wahhh bards get DA, you cant kill them!"  Hello, DA lasts for 18 seconds.  That means a bard can live without getting life taken away for 18 seconds of that 5 minutes before that person who is on corpse gets booted.  You have 30 people, use some skill maybe?  Mass dispell said person, SR, DT, MB, nuke this person?  I don't care how you look at it, if you cant kill 1 player with 30+, simply put, you suck in PvP.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now your probably saying "well that person on corpse has to get off so player_A can loot his item".  Yes thats true, and that bard isnt going to know when that happens, if ANY player gets that close to the raid force, 30+ people will destroy him in an instant.  And DA isnt going to help much since it has a recast time.  It takes 1 second for person to get off corpse and person who won the item to get on corpse to loot.  No bard is gonna be close enough to your raid force to stop that.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You got ninja looted because NOONE was on the corpse, thats YOUR fault.  When I ninja looted you last night, I wasn't even DA, I just ran to a corner behind the wall, looted, ran to the tunnel near port in, and camped.  If your raid force attacked me, I would have died for sure, hence the rule "if a PvP solution is available".  You didn't lock the corpse, you didn't pay attention, you didn't attack the threat, its your own fault, stop blaming the GM's.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Hows about this:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;An alliance .. not a " no pvp you " alliance between all the guilds on Zek who do NOT want this new " ninja looting is legal " policy put into play, but an alliance where&amp;nbsp;all agree to NOT ninja loot anyone's PvE spoils except for &amp;lt;Hate&amp;gt;'s kills and make it a point to go out of our way to do so.&amp;nbsp; Like I've said elsewhere, its in my personal opinion that the EQCSR's should just disband &amp;lt;Hate&amp;gt; altogether and ban the entire guild.&amp;nbsp; Eliminate 90% of the problem and only lose 1%-2% of the servers player base.&amp;nbsp; Seems like a win/win in my book.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;This Zek server&amp;nbsp;reminds me of being a kid,&amp;nbsp;playing a game with that other little kid down the street that nobody&amp;nbsp;really likes,&amp;nbsp;that is always ' changing the rules ' mid-game so that they tip the scales to&amp;nbsp;their advantage.&amp;nbsp; Do us a favor Sony and&amp;nbsp;post the actual policies of what is ' legal ' and what is ' not legal ' on the boards.&amp;nbsp; I don't mean something from a board monitor, I mean someone with some actual clout and say so actually sits down and takes the time to spell it out and put into word right here on this site so everyone on Zek knows exactly where they stand.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Some suggestions for PvP to avoid ninja-looting if you are going to allow it now&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;1.&amp;nbsp; DA breaks when you loot anything.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;2.&amp;nbsp; Make lock out timers on corpses last 10 minutes, not 2 minutes.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;3.&amp;nbsp; Possibly coding raid level content loot from ' non-instanced ' zones as " attunable and no rent " until it is worn, then it would become just " no drop ".&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;SoE's cookie cutter&amp;nbsp; "every issue needs to be solved via PvP solution" policy on Zek seems nothing more than a flimsy excuse that they use so they don't have to do any real work.&amp;nbsp; I know most people are begining to see what I have seen all along, that SoE wants Zek to die, they want the server to close, they want everyone to either quit PvP and EQ altogether or to movelog to another server so they can shut down Zek and all the problems that this one server causes them.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;As for &amp;lt;Hate&amp;gt; having EQCSR's in thier hip pocket,&amp;nbsp; that's a given.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Its just plain laughable that someone allowed themselves to be ninja looted. I lock corpses every time I kill something even from others in my raid/group or whatever. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;How slow can you be that a non looter could click on the corpse faster then the person who is supposed to loot the item and knows when the locker will unlock the corpse. And how blind could you be to not do a who all to see if enemies are in the zone or not. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Getting ninja looted is just plain non professional play by those who lost their item. &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;The reason it was legal on SZ was because there was &lt;STRONG&gt;NO PNP&lt;/STRONG&gt;.  The gms here have looked into it here, I say that because it's been several different GMs that give the same answer, and they all say that as long as the person looting is killable then it shall be handled thru pvp.  So far I don't see GMs as lazy on Zek.   Every petition I've seen/heard about gets resolved pretty fast, even if it's not the answer you want.  Which is a &lt;STRONG&gt;HUGE&lt;/STRONG&gt; difference than it was on SZ, it was wierd if you ever saw more than 2 gms on during a month.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Well, I posted it on PDM boards because I used to be an officer in PDM long time ago and I dont want them to get surprice if they get loots "stolen" also. So far just &amp;lt;Hate&amp;gt; has been doing it (3 times so far from Ancient Dawn) and it is completely fine, if that is the new policy.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;You are alowed to ninja loot as there is "PvP solution" but it is extremely hard to defend&amp;nbsp;when bards can DA and corpse must be released for real loot owner to get the loot as well as 5 minute time out in locking. Also having 40 people in one pile with huge corpse, it is not that hard to hide in middle. Inside dragon corpse you cant see other people's tags all the time. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;As there is no official response from SOE except the one we got from GM, we petitioned, we take it is now legal to ninja loot anything you can (untill othervise officially ruled).&amp;nbsp; I have told our guild that there is no guild rules anymore against it. We had that in VZ.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;As I said above, ninja looting is&amp;nbsp;completely OK for us,&amp;nbsp;as long as it is not one sided rule. If we start getting problems&amp;nbsp;doing it, then it looks like some GM is in certain guilds "pocket". I am not accusing it but it looks like SOE has not give any specific ruling about it and certain GM goes where the fence is lowest (=not to&amp;nbsp;do anything as the looter is whining that it was allowed in their original server).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Naturally if you look this thread, Hate members are defending the "ninja loot policy" as it is KEWL from their point of view but it pretty much makes lot of more people quitting if that kind of idiocy is allowed in ZEK. I do understand and support 100% PvP solutions, even more than our guild policy is in many issues. But plain griefing and taking fun out of the game by allowing single person to steal raid level loots is not right way, we should develope our own server.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Kingfish&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Raid officer of Ancient Dawn&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;You people are wasting your time trying to sort through all the ridiculous crap that Sony spews regarding PvP.&amp;nbsp; They haven't given a damn about PvP for like four years now and there is absolutely no reason for them to start now.&amp;nbsp; Do yourselves a favour and stick your hand in a blender.&amp;nbsp; That'll be much less painful than trying to deal with all the retards who run this game.&amp;nbsp; GMs are worthless and don't know what the hell they're doing.&amp;nbsp; They should just take their seats next to Hate&amp;nbsp;on the short bus.&amp;nbsp; Idiots.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I'll never allow my guild to go loot someone else's pve kill.&amp;nbsp; If it's the policy, so be it but it's pretty ridiculous really.&amp;nbsp; There have been times we've killed people and watched their loot rot but it's never been TZ policy to be allowed to take items after another guild got the kill.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Of course, this is not TZ, it's Zek so we have to abide by the rules that our current gm has put into place.&amp;nbsp; It's just very frustrating to see this type of policy put into place.&amp;nbsp; Things will just degenerate into chaos.&amp;nbsp;With people being able to warp around or DA, it makes the whole "pvp solution" seem close to impossible in some cases, though I do agree that for the most part it is each guild's job to maintain zone control/lockdown and to deal with&amp;nbsp;anyone that&amp;nbsp;enters the zone as a&amp;nbsp;threat.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;We'll see though I suppose how it turns out.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;i think pvp solution to&amp;nbsp;determine loot rights sounds fair. grats razlon :)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;btw if someone locks the corpse the person attempting to ninjaloot wont be able to hang around it long enough without getting killed to loot it when the lock comes off....&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;It's funny that you quote that. That rule was&amp;nbsp;the same for&amp;nbsp;rz/tz/vz, where ninja looting corpses was illegal. But on sz where that rule was different, it was legal to ninja loot.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I hear training is now legal because you can prevent it by pvp means!&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
