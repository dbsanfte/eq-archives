&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; Good evening and welcome to another great Stratics House of Commons chat, tonight our guests are the developers of EverQuest! &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Please send your questions to [QT]Cale - to do so type /query [QT]Cale and type in the window that pops up. Questions sent to me or the developers will not make it into the lineup. Full logs of the chat will be up on http://eq.stratics.com shortly after the chat. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; We'll start with a brief introduction from the developers, now would be a good time to send those questions. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Vahlar -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Good evening folks! I'm Holly Longdale, EQLive Designer and sometimes known as "Lore Lady"! &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Maddoc -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Welcome to the chat. I'm Jason Mash, the Assistant Lead Designer for EverQuest. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Kytherea -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Hello and thanks for coming! I am Christina Delzer, the Community Relations Manager for EverQuest. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Ngreth -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Hello, I am Adam Bell, Associate Game Designer, often known as the House Ogre &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Raghnell -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Howdy. I Chris Lena, the Producer of EQ &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Prathun -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Greetings all. I'm Jonathan Caraker, the raid designer on EverQuest. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Zajeer-Dev -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Hi, I'm Camille Abdnor, itemization designer of EQ &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; the time for the questions is now! they'll be answered first come first serve, act now, don't delay! &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *Cinexa* Hi guys! Rage progression seems to be anti-player &amp;amp; very much blocking unless you happen to be EXTREMELY lucky and even then it is nearly impossible - any chance there will be some re-thinking of that zone ? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Prathun -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; What I think you're referring to is the progression NPC that is only up for a limited amount of time before he despawns. We've already increased the amount of time that the NPC stays up to help address the issue and we're not against changing it further if it proves to be an unreasonable bottleneck. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *Doomy* What is EQ doing that will put it above other mmo's? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Raghnell -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; I think the question is always what are other mmos doing to catch up with EverQuest &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Raghnell -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; We have the content in both quantity, quality and challenge that stands with any other game out there on the market &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Raghnell -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; We have the largest foundation and we will continue to add depth and complexity to the game in the future &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *Anon497* I wonder when Coldwind Blackfoot will return to Nektulos Forest so those of us working on DoD progression will be able to interact with him again. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Vahlar -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Coldwind will be returning to Nektulos Forest soon. I can't give you a specific date and time at the moment because he's being thoroughly tested to ensure he's being cooperative. But rest assured, he is returning soon. We'll keep you posted on the boards. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Raghnell -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Hmmm, maybe we should take a closer look at Nektulos in general... &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *Nolrog* Now that research and tinkering have gotten some new recipes and alchemy has seen a major upgrade, are there plans to do something similar for poison making. It's a skill that's in desperate need of some attention (stay tuned to the Tradeskill Top 10 for additional details and some ideas.) &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Ngreth -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Poison Making is definitely on our minds, and we do want to address it. It is high on the list of tradeskills that we would like to address. That said, we have not yet scheduled what is the next big thing we are doing for tradeskills. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *Computer* since Rytan recently left the EQ team has a new spell designer been assigned yet and if so does he plan to review PoR spells and make adjustments that many feel are needed? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Raghnell -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; We are still searching for a new person to work primarily on spells &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Raghnell -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; But a lot of our designers have been chipping in all along and continue to do so. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Raghnell -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; We will continue to make adjustments as needed. However, they may come a little slower until we have a new guru in place :-) &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *Nolrog* Tradeskill progressive quests (Coldain Prayer Shawl, Aid Grimmel Earring.) Are there plans to add more in the near future? Preferably ones that do not require you to be flagged in order to do the combine (like the Aid Grimmel). &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Ngreth -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; We definitely keep the progressive tradeskill quests in mind, and we do like them. Again, we have made no specific plans, but they are on our minds. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *Emil* Hello, have you guys come closer to answering the Endurance Regeneration problem for pure melees? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Zajeer-Dev -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Endurance regen is still a hot-topic on the team and it’s something we discuss on a constant basis. However, we still want to iron out a lot of the details with all forms of regeneration, not just endurance. It’s definitely something on our minds, but we really don’t have a time estimate on when a resolution will be put forth, or when implementation will be done. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *Arial* Hi! This question is for Zajeer. Being that most of the items in the game have been itemized through demi plane is there any plans to rethink some of the more less desirable drops and possibly bring them in line with there counterparts? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Zajeer-Dev -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; I’m definitely open to feedback on specific items from specific zones that seem a little less than desirable for certain players. I’ve been receiving a ton of feedback through email, the boards, and in game about specific items and how to make them better. I’ll be keeping an eye on specific items and making adjustments in the coming patches. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *Tharkis* Hello my question, while best probably for Absor who is not here is this. The zone Sverag seems to be broken, the npc needed for progression seems to despawn very shortly after spawning, and then will not seemingly respawn again many guilds have spent 24+ hours slaughtering the zone (not consecutive) unable to figure out how to progress past. It seems entierly luck to get past that point. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Prathun -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; This touches on the same question that Cinexa asked earlier. The progression through Rage is being bottlenecked by an NPC that's up occasionally but depops if not killed within a certain amount of time. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Prathun -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; I gather that it's been a source of frustration for guilds because it's preventing them from advancing through the content. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Prathun -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; We've increased the amount of time that he stays up on spawning and we can increase it further if it proves to continue to be a problem. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Prathun -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; I'll have to doublecheck, but I'm 99% sure that clearing the zone has no effect on his spawn time. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *Nolrog* Do we still need the "Tannan" version for tradeskill fixed containers (e.g., brew barrel) now that the PoK is open to all? Stuff like acid wash can only be made in PoK stills, which is a pain. In addition, can you please make the guild hall tradeskill devices Tannan flagged? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Maddoc -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; That seems like a reasonable request, and it's not a difficult change to make, however... As with anything we do, we're going to want to look at the recipes that use those containers to ensure that there wasn't some specific reason that required them to be made in the Plane of Knowledge. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *Sauruman* any chance the necromancer class item from demiplane can be looked at, considering another necklace from the zone is far superior? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Zajeer-Dev -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; A lot of the class specific items in Demiplane were not meant to trump other items in the zone. I don’t believe this is a necromancer specific issue. However, I will be making some minor adjustments (adding a mod, slightly adjusting AC, etc.) to a number of Demiplane class items to make them slightly more desirable. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Zajeer-Dev -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; I think a lot of folks have been trained to think that class specific items need to be the end all and be all for that specific zone in a zone (from the Vishimtar class items and epics, I’d imagine), but that doesn’t need to be the case. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *Loral* Is there any further word or progress on new player models? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Raghnell -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; This is a huge undertaking and a lot of things have to be taken into consideration: technical issues, time, money, and just general game performance. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Raghnell -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; We all want to do new player models that is certain and I simply don't have a concrete answer for you right now. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Raghnell -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; We do have something coming in the next couple of months that should be of interest &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *Loral* What is the current percentage of players below level 70? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Vahlar -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; There's just you, Loral. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Vahlar -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Actually, if you want to see the numbers, you can look at EQ Players. The stats are available in one of Kytherea's Keepsakes. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Zajeer-Dev -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; heh &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Vahlar -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; I know what you're getting at and we're not forgetting our low- and mid-level players. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Raghnell -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; But no matter the percentage we definitely want new people coming to the game so all levels are important &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Vahlar -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; We have some really great plans in the future that will bring a really unique, fun and in-depth play experience to all levels. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Kytherea -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; I think it works out to about 98% of the population is under level 70 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Vahlar -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Ya, what he said. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Vahlar -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; And her. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Raghnell -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Including ever Bazaar mule ever created :-) &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *Nolrog* Can you please change the mushroom farm in Kaladim to have an equal number of fungus and shrooms? This drives people collecting them for Kaladim Constitutionals nuts (it's 10 shrooms and 7 fungus per spawn cycle right now.) If you change one shroom to a fungus, it would be a 9/8 ratio, which wouldn't be so bad. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Maddoc -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; You're asking us to disrupt the delicate balance of the 7:10 ratio?! How could you!? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Maddoc -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; All joking aside, that doesn't seem like a difficult change either, though we're going to want to verify that some sacred pact in Kaladim hasn't been broken. :) &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Ngreth -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; I mean really... it is ecology! &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *Nolrog* Will you be announcing the next expansion at Fan Fair? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Raghnell -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Whoa! Didn't we just release one of those? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Raghnell -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; In my personal opinion we have begun to outpace a number of our players with the content we have released &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Raghnell -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; I am sure we will do another expansion but we have to do it with that thought in mind &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Raghnell -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; And to answer the question - I don't forsee any announcements &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Raghnell -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; To be clear we do believe that expansions are good for the game but we have to be smart about it &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *Guest66* is there any chance of getting an expanshion that requries the time of planes of power as far as zones needed to go thought to get to the end of it again or are we going to get the quick reward kind from now on? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Vahlar -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; We always look at our past expansions and try to learn the best and worst from them. Game Design is not a perfect science, but we certainly all know what we love to play. So, this isn't a yes or no answer. What it means is different design elements used in Planes of Power, like long progression quests and zones, do have a chance to return if we think it's going to be fun. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Zajeer-Dev -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; It's tricky - on one hand, we have a ton of people that liked progression content and locked zones like POP. On the other hand, I remember a ton of people who didn't like the fact that they only had 4 zones at launch to play in &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *Loral* Yes or no. Has Zajeer stopped hating players? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Zajeer-Dev -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; No &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Kytherea -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; no &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Prathun -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Oh, heck no. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Ngreth -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; No. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Maddoc -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; No. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Raghnell -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Really? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Raghnell -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; I love Zajeer! &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Vahlar -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; No, seriously. No. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *Nolrog* The creator mission is respawning now, when it wasn't originally. This was apparently unintentional, however, it has yet to be changed back. Have you decided to leave this as is (i.e., respawning)?? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Prathun -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; I've spoken to Keridon about the creator mission and he plans to look it over from top to bottom (everything up to, and including, the respawn). &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Prathun -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; It's something on his plate but we don't have any firm ETA on when he'll be done with it. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Zajeer-Dev -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; So who here thinks pirates are cooler than ninjas? I sure do &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *Nolrog* Please add more cookie cutter shapes. Trolls would love to have cookies that use gnome parts in them (for some reason, the trolls think they can absorb the gnome's intelligence by eating them in cookies.) &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Vahlar -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Ninja bixie pirates, if you please. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Ngreth -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; It is of course possible, but I have made no particular plans to make new cookie shapes &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Ngreth -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Not just Bixie Ninja's? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Kytherea -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; ninjas are cooler, they get to wear all black with neato masks and get to be all sneaky like &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Vahlar -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; No, a patch and pegleg is a must &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Ngreth -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Maybe it should be Ninja Shapped cookies? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Raghnell -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Would you even see those? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Prathun -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Who's Vajeer? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Kytherea -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Zajeers good twin &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Ngreth -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; shhhhhhh... Who says they are not in game already, and hiding? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Vahlar -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; As in they are too small? Or they are so ninja sneaky that even the cookies are stealthy? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *Nolrog* Can you discuss the thought process behind the bow changes. Specifically the plainswalker and composite treat laminated bows. Before the patch the plainswalker was the better bow, and people spent a lot of money buying one. The patch came, and the composite became the better bow (the Druzzil bow) and the plainswalker was downgraded to the composite. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Maddoc -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; When I looked at the bows, there were a few changes that I wanted to make, and there were two ways that I could have gone about making them. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Maddoc -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; The first of the two changes would have caused four of the eight bows to be reduced in power and stats, one to stay the same as it was currently, and three to increase in power, which would have affected a great number of players, as you might imagine. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Maddoc -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; The second of the two changes, which was the one that we went with, allowed us to upgrade six of the eight bows, leave one roughly the same, only causing a negative change to one bow. Given the changes I wanted to make, that was the absolute best-case scenario that. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Maddoc -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; It's unfortunate that any of them had to be changed negatively, but given those options, I went with the one that would positively impact the greatest number of players and negatively impact the least number of players. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; That's it for this chat folks. Please join us next time here on Stratics IRC for another great house of commons with the developers of EQ! &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Vahlar -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Thanks and good night everyone! &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Raghnell -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; I wanted to add that starting tomorrow that we are enabling all expansions for free on the Test Server &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Kytherea -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Thanks for coming folks! See you next month. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Prathun -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Ooh, free expansions on Test? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Zajeer-Dev -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Good for them.

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; Good evening and welcome to another great Stratics House of Commons chat, tonight our guests are the developers of EverQuest! &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Please send your questions to [QT]Cale - to do so type /query [QT]Cale and type in the window that pops up. Questions sent to me or the developers will not make it into the lineup. Full logs of the chat will be up on http://eq.stratics.com shortly after the chat. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; We'll start with a brief introduction from the developers, now would be a good time to send those questions. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Vahlar -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Good evening folks! I'm Holly Longdale, EQLive Designer and sometimes known as "Lore Lady"! &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Maddoc -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Welcome to the chat. I'm Jason Mash, the Assistant Lead Designer for EverQuest. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Kytherea -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Hello and thanks for coming! I am Christina Delzer, the Community Relations Manager for EverQuest. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Ngreth -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Hello, I am Adam Bell, Associate Game Designer, often known as the House Ogre &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Raghnell -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Howdy. I Chris Lena, the Producer of EQ &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Prathun -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Greetings all. I'm Jonathan Caraker, the raid designer on EverQuest. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Zajeer-Dev -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Hi, I'm Camille Abdnor, itemization designer of EQ &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; the time for the questions is now! they'll be answered first come first serve, act now, don't delay! &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *Cinexa* Hi guys! Rage progression seems to be anti-player &amp;amp; very much blocking unless you happen to be EXTREMELY lucky and even then it is nearly impossible - any chance there will be some re-thinking of that zone ? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Prathun -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; What I think you're referring to is the progression NPC that is only up for a limited amount of time before he despawns. We've already increased the amount of time that the NPC stays up to help address the issue and we're not against changing it further if it proves to be an unreasonable bottleneck. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *Doomy* What is EQ doing that will put it above other mmo's? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Raghnell -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; I think the question is always what are other mmos doing to catch up with EverQuest &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Raghnell -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; We have the content in both quantity, quality and challenge that stands with any other game out there on the market &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Raghnell -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; We have the largest foundation and we will continue to add depth and complexity to the game in the future &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *Anon497* I wonder when Coldwind Blackfoot will return to Nektulos Forest so those of us working on DoD progression will be able to interact with him again. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Vahlar -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Coldwind will be returning to Nektulos Forest soon. I can't give you a specific date and time at the moment because he's being thoroughly tested to ensure he's being cooperative. But rest assured, he is returning soon. We'll keep you posted on the boards. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Raghnell -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Hmmm, maybe we should take a closer look at Nektulos in general... &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *Nolrog* Now that research and tinkering have gotten some new recipes and alchemy has seen a major upgrade, are there plans to do something similar for poison making. It's a skill that's in desperate need of some attention (stay tuned to the Tradeskill Top 10 for additional details and some ideas.) &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Ngreth -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Poison Making is definitely on our minds, and we do want to address it. It is high on the list of tradeskills that we would like to address. That said, we have not yet scheduled what is the next big thing we are doing for tradeskills. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *Computer* since Rytan recently left the EQ team has a new spell designer been assigned yet and if so does he plan to review PoR spells and make adjustments that many feel are needed? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Raghnell -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; We are still searching for a new person to work primarily on spells &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Raghnell -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; But a lot of our designers have been chipping in all along and continue to do so. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Raghnell -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; We will continue to make adjustments as needed. However, they may come a little slower until we have a new guru in place :-) &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *Nolrog* Tradeskill progressive quests (Coldain Prayer Shawl, Aid Grimmel Earring.) Are there plans to add more in the near future? Preferably ones that do not require you to be flagged in order to do the combine (like the Aid Grimmel). &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Ngreth -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; We definitely keep the progressive tradeskill quests in mind, and we do like them. Again, we have made no specific plans, but they are on our minds. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *Emil* Hello, have you guys come closer to answering the Endurance Regeneration problem for pure melees? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Zajeer-Dev -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Endurance regen is still a hot-topic on the team and it’s something we discuss on a constant basis. However, we still want to iron out a lot of the details with all forms of regeneration, not just endurance. It’s definitely something on our minds, but we really don’t have a time estimate on when a resolution will be put forth, or when implementation will be done. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *Arial* Hi! This question is for Zajeer. Being that most of the items in the game have been itemized through demi plane is there any plans to rethink some of the more less desirable drops and possibly bring them in line with there counterparts? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Zajeer-Dev -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; I’m definitely open to feedback on specific items from specific zones that seem a little less than desirable for certain players. I’ve been receiving a ton of feedback through email, the boards, and in game about specific items and how to make them better. I’ll be keeping an eye on specific items and making adjustments in the coming patches. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *Tharkis* Hello my question, while best probably for Absor who is not here is this. The zone Sverag seems to be broken, the npc needed for progression seems to despawn very shortly after spawning, and then will not seemingly respawn again many guilds have spent 24+ hours slaughtering the zone (not consecutive) unable to figure out how to progress past. It seems entierly luck to get past that point. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Prathun -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; This touches on the same question that Cinexa asked earlier. The progression through Rage is being bottlenecked by an NPC that's up occasionally but depops if not killed within a certain amount of time. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Prathun -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; I gather that it's been a source of frustration for guilds because it's preventing them from advancing through the content. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Prathun -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; We've increased the amount of time that he stays up on spawning and we can increase it further if it proves to continue to be a problem. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Prathun -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; I'll have to doublecheck, but I'm 99% sure that clearing the zone has no effect on his spawn time. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *Nolrog* Do we still need the "Tannan" version for tradeskill fixed containers (e.g., brew barrel) now that the PoK is open to all? Stuff like acid wash can only be made in PoK stills, which is a pain. In addition, can you please make the guild hall tradeskill devices Tannan flagged? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Maddoc -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; That seems like a reasonable request, and it's not a difficult change to make, however... As with anything we do, we're going to want to look at the recipes that use those containers to ensure that there wasn't some specific reason that required them to be made in the Plane of Knowledge. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *Sauruman* any chance the necromancer class item from demiplane can be looked at, considering another necklace from the zone is far superior? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Zajeer-Dev -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; A lot of the class specific items in Demiplane were not meant to trump other items in the zone. I don’t believe this is a necromancer specific issue. However, I will be making some minor adjustments (adding a mod, slightly adjusting AC, etc.) to a number of Demiplane class items to make them slightly more desirable. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Zajeer-Dev -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; I think a lot of folks have been trained to think that class specific items need to be the end all and be all for that specific zone in a zone (from the Vishimtar class items and epics, I’d imagine), but that doesn’t need to be the case. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *Loral* Is there any further word or progress on new player models? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Raghnell -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; This is a huge undertaking and a lot of things have to be taken into consideration: technical issues, time, money, and just general game performance. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Raghnell -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; We all want to do new player models that is certain and I simply don't have a concrete answer for you right now. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Raghnell -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; We do have something coming in the next couple of months that should be of interest &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *Loral* What is the current percentage of players below level 70? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Vahlar -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; There's just you, Loral. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Vahlar -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Actually, if you want to see the numbers, you can look at EQ Players. The stats are available in one of Kytherea's Keepsakes. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Zajeer-Dev -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; heh &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Vahlar -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; I know what you're getting at and we're not forgetting our low- and mid-level players. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Raghnell -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; But no matter the percentage we definitely want new people coming to the game so all levels are important &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Vahlar -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; We have some really great plans in the future that will bring a really unique, fun and in-depth play experience to all levels. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Kytherea -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; I think it works out to about 98% of the population is under level 70 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Vahlar -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Ya, what he said. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Vahlar -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; And her. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Raghnell -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Including ever Bazaar mule ever created :-) &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *Nolrog* Can you please change the mushroom farm in Kaladim to have an equal number of fungus and shrooms? This drives people collecting them for Kaladim Constitutionals nuts (it's 10 shrooms and 7 fungus per spawn cycle right now.) If you change one shroom to a fungus, it would be a 9/8 ratio, which wouldn't be so bad. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Maddoc -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; You're asking us to disrupt the delicate balance of the 7:10 ratio?! How could you!? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Maddoc -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; All joking aside, that doesn't seem like a difficult change either, though we're going to want to verify that some sacred pact in Kaladim hasn't been broken. :) &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Ngreth -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; I mean really... it is ecology! &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *Nolrog* Will you be announcing the next expansion at Fan Fair? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Raghnell -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Whoa! Didn't we just release one of those? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Raghnell -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; In my personal opinion we have begun to outpace a number of our players with the content we have released &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Raghnell -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; I am sure we will do another expansion but we have to do it with that thought in mind &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Raghnell -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; And to answer the question - I don't forsee any announcements &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Raghnell -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; To be clear we do believe that expansions are good for the game but we have to be smart about it &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *Guest66* is there any chance of getting an expanshion that requries the time of planes of power as far as zones needed to go thought to get to the end of it again or are we going to get the quick reward kind from now on? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Vahlar -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; We always look at our past expansions and try to learn the best and worst from them. Game Design is not a perfect science, but we certainly all know what we love to play. So, this isn't a yes or no answer. What it means is different design elements used in Planes of Power, like long progression quests and zones, do have a chance to return if we think it's going to be fun. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Zajeer-Dev -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; It's tricky - on one hand, we have a ton of people that liked progression content and locked zones like POP. On the other hand, I remember a ton of people who didn't like the fact that they only had 4 zones at launch to play in &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *Loral* Yes or no. Has Zajeer stopped hating players? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Zajeer-Dev -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; No &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Kytherea -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; no &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Prathun -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Oh, heck no. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Ngreth -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; No. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Maddoc -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; No. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Raghnell -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Really? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Raghnell -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; I love Zajeer! &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Vahlar -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; No, seriously. No. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *Nolrog* The creator mission is respawning now, when it wasn't originally. This was apparently unintentional, however, it has yet to be changed back. Have you decided to leave this as is (i.e., respawning)?? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Prathun -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; I've spoken to Keridon about the creator mission and he plans to look it over from top to bottom (everything up to, and including, the respawn). &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Prathun -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; It's something on his plate but we don't have any firm ETA on when he'll be done with it. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Zajeer-Dev -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; So who here thinks pirates are cooler than ninjas? I sure do &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *Nolrog* Please add more cookie cutter shapes. Trolls would love to have cookies that use gnome parts in them (for some reason, the trolls think they can absorb the gnome's intelligence by eating them in cookies.) &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Vahlar -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Ninja bixie pirates, if you please. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Ngreth -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; It is of course possible, but I have made no particular plans to make new cookie shapes &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Ngreth -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Not just Bixie Ninja's? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Kytherea -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; ninjas are cooler, they get to wear all black with neato masks and get to be all sneaky like &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Vahlar -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; No, a patch and pegleg is a must &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Ngreth -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Maybe it should be Ninja Shapped cookies? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Raghnell -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Would you even see those? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Prathun -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Who's Vajeer? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Kytherea -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Zajeers good twin &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Ngreth -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; shhhhhhh... Who says they are not in game already, and hiding? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Vahlar -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; As in they are too small? Or they are so ninja sneaky that even the cookies are stealthy? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *Nolrog* Can you discuss the thought process behind the bow changes. Specifically the plainswalker and composite treat laminated bows. Before the patch the plainswalker was the better bow, and people spent a lot of money buying one. The patch came, and the composite became the better bow (the Druzzil bow) and the plainswalker was downgraded to the composite. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Maddoc -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; When I looked at the bows, there were a few changes that I wanted to make, and there were two ways that I could have gone about making them. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Maddoc -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; The first of the two changes would have caused four of the eight bows to be reduced in power and stats, one to stay the same as it was currently, and three to increase in power, which would have affected a great number of players, as you might imagine. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Maddoc -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; The second of the two changes, which was the one that we went with, allowed us to upgrade six of the eight bows, leave one roughly the same, only causing a negative change to one bow. Given the changes I wanted to make, that was the absolute best-case scenario that. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Maddoc -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; It's unfortunate that any of them had to be changed negatively, but given those options, I went with the one that would positively impact the greatest number of players and negatively impact the least number of players. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; That's it for this chat folks.
