<P>Brenlo:</P>
<P>I won't start this post with a rant about the size of the warder, instead I offer something better (with the limited knowledge you gave us as to the issue) -- a solution.</P>
<P>I think the best solution, and easiest, to solve this issue, would be to make ALL beastlord warders the size of our level 9 warders.&nbsp; The only catch to this would be in two parts:</P>
<LI>
<DIV>Make the amount the warders can be grown limited by the spell that casts the warder.&nbsp; For example, the level 9 warder would not be able to be grown any, the level 49 warder would be able to be grown 1 time, and the level 64 warders would be able to be grown 2 times. </DIV></LI>
<LI>
<DIV>To allow us to grow the warders, give us a grow spell.&nbsp; We were given a shrink spell like our shaman counterpart, but never a grow. </DIV></LI>
<P>This would solve the issues with ALL the beastlord warder sizes, including the trolls saying their warder is too small. This solution would also make beastlords more beneficial by allowing us to grow what we can shrink.&nbsp; Lastly, we would be able to control the size we want our warders to be, without (hopefully) bringing out the bugs the developer is scared of reintroducing.&nbsp; If any pathing issues occur with this solution, the beastlord will be well equipped to handle it with the grow spell, or even using the summon companion spell.</P>
