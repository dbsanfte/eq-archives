I am sorry it does not match your preconcieved notions, but the most common reason for apps to be turned down is not playtime, but in fact, lack of skill.  Skill matters a ton, it's amazing to see what a really skilled player can do, and embarrassing to see what unskilled players can't do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Motivation/desire also matters a ton.  People who are motivated get the most out oftheir time.  They make networks of friends, who can help them do what they want to get done.  They pick goals, and do what it takes to attain them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just to give you another example of how wrong you are about high end players, let's use my guild as an example.  We are about 4 or 5th on server in terms of progression(on a topheavy server), one kill from Demiplane(this week hopefully).  About a year ago, some one started a poll on our message board, asking members there age.  The results broke down like this:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Under 18 = 0&lt;br&gt;18 to 24 = 29 %&lt;br&gt;25 to 31 = 36 %&lt;br&gt;32 to 38 = 23 %&lt;br&gt;39 to 45 = 8 %&lt;br&gt;46 +     = 1 %&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So as you can see, not many school age players, and lots of significantly older players.  Most members are married, have jobs, some have children, 4 have grandchildren.  A lot of people don't make raids every night, some don't make even half the raids, because we firmly believe that real life is more important than EQ.  Some log on late, some log early.  Playtime is not the only thing that it takes for raiders, or any player in EQ to succeed.  it helps some, but it is not even the most important thing.</description>

      <title>What Killed Everquest</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Progression&amp;message.id=17232#M17232</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Hi all, I'm this may end up being a longwinded message, in fact I know it will, but bear with me. I'd like to know what everyone thinks about what I have to say (don't we all though?). Ok, I'm an oldschool EQ player. I'm 21 now, about to start my senior year at UGA (Go Dawgs!). I started playing everquest at the end of eighth grade. I played up from 1999 to the LDoN expansion. When I started, I had no idea what PvP meant so I made a character on Rallos Zek because I thought it sounded cool lol. My "nostalgic" EQ days might be a lot different from the blue server folks because let me tell you, things were DIFFERENT on Zek in those days. They used to have item loot, but the catch was it didn't matter what killed you, NPC or PC... People could loot your corpse. I'm sure you can imagine what kinds of chaos that sort of situation could cause. EQ was much more hardcore in those days, any player past Luclin simply cannot relate to how difficult it was to ascend to the endgame ranks and then actually do things. Classes were played differently, monks were different... And on Zek using AOE spells simply wasn't possible in any situation because you'd fry your party members if you ever tried to cast one of those spells. I've never played on a blue server, so this time around on progression is going to be an entirely different experience for me anyways, which I like. At the same time I miss those days when Darkenbane was the bane of everyone's existence and you constantly had to be on guard no matter who you were because not only were you afraid of mobs, you were afraid of PK's. Yeah, they caused a whole lot of grief but&amp;nbsp;wow did it ever evoke some excitement and emotion. Anyways, I was a raider. I played a cleric, and did everything from Sol B to Trak to VP to ToV up through PoTime&amp;nbsp;even. I've experienced the game, and although it's still changed a whole lot since I've quit I think I'm at least somewhat qualified to speak on issues relating to the whole idea of a "Progression Server." After I quit, I was still able to enjoy some of the cooler aspects of the game because my friends (that I introduced to the game by the way) were part of a guild called Wudan. I spent the night over at my friends house as they were fought and finally defeated Kerafyrm. I remember the sly Trylun and his wonderfully timed MB that got the killing blow on him too.&amp;nbsp;I loved the game, but as many people who were Oldschool can agree with me, the game's peak was DEFINITELY Velious. After Velious the original creator's of EQ were ousted by Sony, who took over and took the game in a completely different direction. In other words, I miss EQ's Verant days.&amp;nbsp;I enjoyed the raid content added in PoP, I'll never forget when PoT was finally opened and I got to fight Quarm. Anyway, with all that being said I want everyone to understand that I'm not some pretentious "know-it-all," and I hope that I'm not gonna get flamed&amp;nbsp;for some of my rants but oh well, this is just how I feel and I want to see if others agree. So, with all that being said, on to the meat of my topic. Oh, and I do hope that the people on this server don't&amp;nbsp;effing wake up the sleeper until there's a chance he can be defeated, because I want to see him again, and this time with me behind the controls of one of the valiant souls that kick his arse.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Luclin caused a weird effect. It was the beginning of some very difficult time sink content, and eventually all that developed into some of the most amazing raid content I've ever experienced. That part was good, I'm not gonna complain about that stuff. What Luclin did do, though, was trivialize and destroy many aspects of the game. From there, it got worse. Anyone who played before Luclin can recall (on my server) hanging out in Kelethin to sell off your hard-earned loot. The economy was so dynamic because people actually had to take part in selling goods. I miss the good old /auc command, where you'd have to make macro's to spam the zone to let everyone know what you were selling. Alot of people on blue servers apparently had the same experience in the EC tunnel. We couldn't do that on zek, because if you carried a lot of money and loot out of town you'd no doubt get jacked. EC was pretty barren on Rallos Zek for that very reason lol. Some of my best memories of EQ stem from hanging outside of the Kelethin bank talking to folks and joking around, getting into flame wars, and all sorts of other things. It was the hub of Norrath. Being an effective merchant was as much of a skill as 2-hand slashing, even though it wasn't something the game could log. The /bazaar command completely wiped out that entire aspect of the game. Sure, it's alot easier and more time efficient to sell your goods at the bazaar, especially since those new expansions introduced SO much more time-intensive content that having time to sell stuff became more and more difficult if you wanted to keep up with everyone else. It's a path that's already been taken in the game that is probably by now too late to revert back to, but that's why this new server is giving me hope. I think that the people who miss the difficult days, where everything was hard earned and you basically had to do it all your self would probably like an EQ sans Bazaar.&amp;nbsp;Some folks will say "Well if you want a chat game, get AIM. You can talk all you want there. Blah, blah, yakaty yak. No, you see the entire IDEA of a game being massively multiplayer lies with in the social concept. To me, the bazaar completely destroyed that particular social concept of the game. I liked being a traveling merchant at the time Velious was out, I could go to Thurgadin, or Firiona Vie, or Kelethin to sell stuff. I could buy low and sell high and make profit. Some days I didn't want to grind exp or loot, I just wanted to relax in a delightful elven city built in the treetops of the forest and socialize with likeminded gamers and sell stuff, advancing in the game monetarily and having a good old time just shooting the breeze. See, before the bazaar, you could do that and still get things accomplished in as, what was then, efficient manner. Granted it's not as efficient as making a mule and leaving him /bazaar all night, but it was still fun and it was the only option so that's just what you did. I think I can rightfully say that alot of the veteran nostalgia stems from that aspect of the game. Whether your experience was in EC or Kelethin, lets face it. You miss it. Simply put, the Bazaar killed the dynamic merchant.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I could go on all day about that, but there's much more I want to say and this is already a long post, so here's the next thing: Travel. Beginning with the Nexus and finally culminating at the introduction of PoK, Travel was completely trivialized. Is it right that you can make a level 1 Barbarian, and within minutes travel from Halas to Fironia to Velious and back again? No!!!! No no no no no no no no! If Frodo could have used a PoK book to transport himself directly outside the gates of Mordor, would his adventure be half as entertaining? I think not. Druids and Wizards were put out of the job. Yeah, you could be lazy and enjoy the convenience of it, but it stripped yet another important aspect of the game. One of the most fun and exciting memories I have of this game consists of trying to get my level 15 paladin from Qeynos to Freeport because I couldn't find a port. Walking through Kithikor at night because I had to, traveling through South Karana and the Mountians of Rathe to get to Cazic Thule while trying to avoid the Hill Giants, Cyclops, Giant Skeletons, and whatnot was an invigorating experience for me. The fact that no one had to do that anymore made it unfeasable to travel by foot anymore because so many players could get around faster with PoK books and such nobody would wait for you to use the old-fashioned way and find a port or walk. Wizards and Druids were the **SMURF** because they could port. PoK killed that aspect of their class, which was unfair, and made it too easy for everyone else. This isn't WoW. One of the things I liked most about EQ was mob placement. In WoW every zone caters to a specific level range. In EQ, you can fight in Marr or try and walk somewhere and always have to be wary of Hill Giants or Spectres or whatnot. To me, that was cool. You couldn't just sit comfortably at just any level in any zone, you always had to be on the lookout. Not to mention I played on Zek, so I had to worry about players and mobs out for my blood. At any rate, I would go as far to say that it was the fast travel PoK books that were partly responsible for the desolate condition that old Norrath was in. This brings me to my next point.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Look at the original map of Norrath. I'm going to list some places on that map that aren't in the actual game. Expansions post Velious, with the possible exception of LDoN and perhaps a few others, could have EASILY added enough content to the old world to make it a viable place for adventure. Here they are (Oh, and BTW, the map I am looking at is from a website, I couldn't find a big enough one to where I could clearly read all the words, so forgive mispellings): The Loping Plains, Ranthok's Ridge, Elivarian Lake, Wayunder Lake, The Hills of Shade, The Dragonscale Hills, The Lifire (?) River (Oh and did anyone notice that a river connects to the oassis of Marr, but in the game it's just a water hole in the middle of the desert???), The Serpent's Spine, The Rujarkian Hills, The Dead Hills and the area around the Greenblood River, Broken Skull Rock, The Buried Sea, The Hatchland, The Northlands, The Nest (Did anyone notice there's also no river flowing down from halas, as there is on the map?), Winter's Deep, Lake Nerious, The Frigid Plains, The Grand Plateau, The Barren Coast, The Gulf of Urun, and The Vasty Deep. I realize that perhaps Dragons of Norrath may have added to these zones, but suffice to say there was SO much more room for content on old Norrath that instead of Luclin they could have patched up the gaps in the old world, with plenty of room for new dungeons and other gameplay fixes to fill an expansion. Not to mention they could have reskinned some things and created better character models, but I'm not going into that.&amp;nbsp; At any rate, what I'm trying to say is that instead of deviating from the original lore that the ORIGINAL creaters came up with they could have made SIGNIFICANT improvements and expanded old world Norrath into something viable. Plus the fact that they introduced a cat race that you could play as on the moon when there was already Kerra Isle, a city of cats that could have been made into something spectacular that people actually went to. Not many people ever gave a crap about Kerra Isle, and unless you had to travel there for a quest many never even knew it existed. Why not have the Kerra as a playable race instead of the Vah Shir (they could have easly used the same models for the Vah Shir too) and created a balence for the continent of Odus. Could we really even call that a continent? More like an island. Only one playable race began on Odus, the Erudites, wheras on Faydwer you had Gnomes, Wood Elves, Dwarves, and High Elves. Antonica had Humans, Trolls, Dark Elves, Halflings, Barbarians, Half-Elves, and Ogres. No wonder no one ever went to Odus, there wasn't much to do there except the eventually The Hole and Stonebrunt, the latter of which wasn't even that great. Had they have fleshed out that continent, and done things with the large amounts of barren land in the Karana's, they could have done something much more succinct with the old world. Why fly off to the moon when there is so much to be done back at home? Imagine, expansions filled with new settlements scattered across the plains of Karana, perhaps even an Aviak Race that starts in South Karana in a city akin to Kelethin (I loved Kelethin dammit). They could have added so much more to these zones insofar as dungeons and new cities to fill up two expansions! Plus, it wouldn't have competely wiped out the old world population. Also, they could have done the plane's soooo much differently. Instead of adding all these "moon zones" they could have created an entire new dimension with its own continent, and within that dimension could have been a slew of new zones that a) made more sense with the lore of the game and b) created a much more dynamic experience traveling to and unlocking the homelands of the various gods instead of just warping to all of them from PoT. Hate and Fear and even Sky could have been meshed in with it somehow; if they're creative enough (or bizzare) enough to come up with all that moon stuff, plus all the newer stuff with the unpronouncable names (Ixxxvt Xvar **SMURF**????) then they could have came up with a way. The lore that the original creaters came up with was more than enough to supply enough content than to justify deviating from it so astoundingly much. This particular rant has gone far enough, but if they really wanted to do it right this time with the progression server, they would release an expansion that revamps much of the old world, makes it useful, and not make it immediately open to the progression server when they finally did release it. Hopefully they would not make the same mistake twice and get rid of those **SMURF** PoK books and make PoK accessible only via Wizard or Druid port and not have it link you to every other major area in the game world. Wizards and Druids would still be in business, and people would get off their lazy arses and not just beam themselves wherever they wanted to go.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;By the way, if you're still reading this, I applaud you. I had more to say than I thought. I've been writing this for a while now lol. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;There's alot more I could say, but I'm going to touch on one last thing. One of the most ridiculous additions to this game would have to be LoY's armor dyes. Yes, some people think it's cool, but hear me out on this one. Oldschool players, I want you to think back to classic EQ. Do you remember Ruby armor? Do you remember how incredibly awesome it was the first time you saw someone wearing it? Do you remember the infamous Aradune and his legendary emerald green chestplate? Planes armor all had their class defining hues, Purple plate for clerics, Green Plate for Rangers, the list goes on. If you had these particular items, people knew what they were because of their color. Anyone remember the new armor textures for Velious armor? The stuff from PoG and skyshrine was awesome (it's a shame that the very next expansion added new models that completely hid the coolness of those new armor textures, they were shortlived but they were cool as crap. Another sign that a new dev team took over and payed no heed to the original path the game was on), some of it was colored and people knew what it was because those pretty pieces of colored armor were trademarks. People knew when you had golden efreeti boots. When they added armor dye, all of that was completely destroyed. You were no longer a bad ass for your awesome red-chestplate, or your cool green slacks. Your emerald chestplate was no longer special because some level 9 guy could color his chest slot green and wear bronze and get that very same effect. People say, "Well if you don't want to color your armor, then don't. It's personal choice." But think of it this way, it's that fact that you have a choice that made it a mistake. Before, you actually had to WORK to get armor that looked like that. After the armor dyes, you could just pay 20pp and have it. No longer would the players who worked for their awesome emerald or ruby or obsidian or WHATEVER armors feel special because everyone else, even if they were $*&amp;amp;$#* level 5 could have that same colored chestplate or greaves. It further trivialized character customization, something that was sacred to the hardworking casual or powergamer alike. Yeah, stats are great. But looking cool is very important too, and it's even more special when you work for it. So, for the love of god progression server, PLEASE don't add armor dyes back into the game this time around when it comes time to open up LoY. Please!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So anyway, I'm done. I think I've gone on enough,&amp;nbsp;but I'd like to know what everyone thinks about my suggestions. I suppose the whole theme of my long-winded post here was that of trivialization. When I play games like this, I don't want to just be another face in the crowd. When I join a group and I'm geared up because of hard work, I want people to see my character and be at least somewhat impressed whether it be endgame or whatever. Yeah, I know that epic weapons and whatnot still are trademarks that you have to work for and everyone knows what you are and stuff, and everyone can still see that you worked for what you have, but still. Why not have that same effect be applied to the whole character? Whether it be armor colors, the bazaar, travel, or lore, I think those later expansions killed some of the suddle yet satisfying aspects of the game. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;At any rate, I plan to become a once again avid member of Norrath, and while the "Progression" from Classic to Velious may be short-lived or long, whatever the case, I will enjoy it. Eventually I know we'll be back into the Luclin era, but perhaps with enough feedback and plus the fact that an entirely different community will be populating this server than those of the past, or even those of other mmorpgs on the market today, we can as a whole create an experience that, for those of us that feel this particular way, doesn't go awry. Peace in the Middle East.&amp;nbsp;\/&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Sure it does. There's a lot of raiding that cannot be done in 2 hour blocks that certainly can in 10 hour blocks. And if you play in 30 minute blocks... I am a highly skilled long time casual EQ player. I typically play in 30 minute increments. I generally cannot raid at all. Sall right, I have fun...&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Still I have long thought that &lt;FONT color=#ffff00&gt;it would be nice to have a server with playing time limits (per day or per week, whatever)&lt;/FONT&gt; for us casual folks so we could be on more of an even footing with the world at large :) &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Time largely does equate to power in game. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Fortunately, the point of the game is to have fun, which is just as easy at level 1 as it is at level 70, if not more so. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

We are about 4 or 5th on server in terms of progression(on a topheavy server), one kill from Demiplane(this week hopefully).  About a year ago, some one started a poll on our message board, asking members there age.  The results broke down like this:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Under 18 = 0&lt;br&gt;18 to 24 = 29 %&lt;br&gt;25 to 31 = 36 %&lt;br&gt;32 to 38 = 23 %&lt;br&gt;39 to 45 = 8 %&lt;br&gt;46 +     = 1 %&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So as you can see, not many school age players, and lots of significantly older players.  Most members are married, have jobs, some have children, 4 have grandchildren.  A lot of people don't make raids every night, some don't make even half the raids, because we firmly believe that real life is more important than EQ.  Some log on late, some log early.  Playtime is not the only thing that it takes for raiders, or any player in EQ to succeed.  it helps some, but it is not even the most important thing.</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;Great post and so true.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;Everquest was made into Easyquest and it went severely downhill.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;There was&amp;nbsp; no going back once this path was created, perhaps no other logical conclusion no matter what was done.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I'm not&amp;nbsp;talking about achieving "greatness" without raiding.&amp;nbsp; If you actually read what I said, you would see where I agree that raiders should reap the rewards of their efforts.&amp;nbsp; That goes without saying.&amp;nbsp; Duh.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;What I'm talking about is casuals basicly not being able to play the game at all once they reach a certain level.&amp;nbsp; For many players, once you hit 70, if you can't raid it basicly boils down to no EQ for you.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Unless you call LFG for 4-6 hours EVERY TIME you log on and getting turned away from groups because of your gear, "playing" the game.&amp;nbsp; This is exactly what my friend reported as happening to him for the month or so he tried to tough it out before finally giving up and quitting.&amp;nbsp; I felt terrible about it too as I would have loved to help him out, but I was busy raiding and he rarely could predict when hed have time to play, anyway........For anybody who only gets a couple evenings a week at random to play, your basicly screwed in current EQ.&amp;nbsp; In fairness, and I told my friend the same thing, there are better choices of class for people with extrememly limited time in EQ than tanks who always need group support.......I suggested he try something else like a necro or a bst and he gave the necro a shot but in the end just wasn't into it.&amp;nbsp; He played a pally from the beginning of the game....hardcore for the first couple years.....and just wasn't into playing anything else.&amp;nbsp; So he just gave up and plays other stuff now.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;And while what Jaya described above sounds great, it's essentially the same time commitment for that tank as raiding is basicly except his guild is helping him with the 1 group content instead of raiding for that gear......Absolutely not a solution at all to a guy like my friend who basicly doesn't have but a couple nights a week at random to play due to his RL commitments.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;So again, it's not a matter of causals not getting to do the best stuff in EQ.....It's a matter of casuals not getting to do ANYTHING in EQ at a point.&amp;nbsp; And in the first few years of the game it wasn't this way at all......Casuals and raiders alike could still workably group together with no problem at all and pickup groups were less of a problem for anyone playing EQ at any given level.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;But the HP inflation changed all&amp;nbsp;of that.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Massimo_Bertoxx on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;06-09-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;09:45 AM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It's admirable the commitment these players have to their toons in light of their limited playing time.&amp;nbsp; Even more admirable, imo, are the people who play with them and help them when they need it.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;But what you describe is the exception not the norm, IMO.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Yes, you could do all that a couple nights a week, assuming you have the patience, the focus and the network of friends to do it.&amp;nbsp; Or you could quit and go find a game that doesn't flaunt in your face at every turn the fact that you really need to be spending more time in game or at least one that allows you to make some kind of satisfactory progress each play session regardless if you are hardcore or casual.&amp;nbsp; A choice that never really&amp;nbsp;had&amp;nbsp;to be made before the HP inflation.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Which choice is more commonly made you think?&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I agree, EQ hasn't been killed yet and as an overall game is still going strong, numbers wise.&amp;nbsp; To say that the game will be over in 2 years is crazy.....It will be around for the foreseeable future.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;But to also say that there is any health in the actual "journey" of EQ these days is just as absurd.&amp;nbsp; The game is played at level 70 now.&amp;nbsp; And it's a raiding game.&amp;nbsp; Period.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;If you don't have a lot of friends to play with or you, at very least, don't multi box you are basicly screwed.&amp;nbsp; A single player playing a non-solo class has absolutely no reasonable expectation to ever get anywhere in pickup groups in EQ at lower levels in the current state of the game.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;A year ago, around the time of the merges, it was doable.&amp;nbsp; But as of the last few months, no way.&amp;nbsp; I did it both times and in the year since the merges the pickup group situation at lower levels has gone to crap again.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I agree, EQ hasn't been killed yet and as an overall game is still going strong, numbers wise.&amp;nbsp; To say that the game will be over in 2 years is crazy.....It will be around for the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;But to also say that there is any health in the actual "journey" of EQ these days is just as absurd.&amp;nbsp; The game is played at level 70 now.&amp;nbsp; And it's a raiding game.&amp;nbsp; Period.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;If you don't have a lot of friends to play with or you, at very least, don't multi box you are basicly screwed.&amp;nbsp; A single player playing a non-solo class has absolutely no reasonable expectation to ever get anywhere in pickup groups in EQ at lower levels in the current state of the game.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;A year ago, around the time of the merges, it was doable.&amp;nbsp; But as of the last few months, no way.&amp;nbsp; I did it both times and in the year since the merges the pickup group situation at lower levels has gone to crap again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;that will always be crap though, one just expects the 60-70, and specfically the 70 (3k hp/mana) -&amp;gt; 70 (8k hp/mana or whatever) game to be decent, but for a large number of reasons it is not.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;but yes there is absoultely zero reason to start EQ as a new player.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Re-call on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;06-09-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;12:41 PM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;that will always be crap though, one just expects the 60-70, and specfically the 70 (3k hp/mana) -&amp;gt; 70 (8k hp/mana or whatever) game to be decent, but for a large number of reasons it is not.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;I don't fall into that catagory, but I know quite a few people who do.&amp;nbsp; They seem to find EQ still quite enjoyable.&amp;nbsp; Maybe it's that they don't spend their time getting upset about raiders, and do spend their time trying to enjoy themselves.&lt;BR&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;If you think more accounts now don't mean something, you're an absolute and utter idiot.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Which your other posts do lead me to believe anyway of course.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
Nobody does DoDh missions, gotta be in a raiding guild to get people to essentially backflag them for you, zero reward once you've got YOUR spell, because that's all that matters &#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Then why should we care what such a minority here thinks?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;If your position is that SO few people need this mission that you can't get a group, you're not a demograph large enough that it should matter.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;You're right, I am not "one of you".&amp;nbsp; When I want something, I do it and get it, I don't settle for excuses.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;That's why my alt has an epic 1.5 and is about to have an epic 2.0, and you're here whining that you can't even get people to do spells with you.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;But I wonder what my man Zek has to say on the issue:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
