				<DIV>Yet, my next dating exprience was with this Paladin lady. She was quite elegant and extrordinary. Quite terrific to be around, kept you honest.&nbsp; But after while she set out to destroy all my bad habits.&nbsp; I could no longer do anything remotely fun like hang out with the boys in the druids grove. She called it hedonistic debauchery, the nude dancing and multiple partner free love thing. She said something about the beauty of monogamy or some such drivel.&nbsp; She was very articulate so some of what she said was just ridiculous to me.&nbsp; Very righteous high and mighty type of girl.&nbsp; Eventually, as she stripped me of my civil liberties by threatening marriage and other such activities, I had to go.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>So, I left her for this shadow knight gal. I must say there is something about an evil lady that is extremely sensual.&nbsp; She was always pretty straight forward about stuff, even to the point of rudeness.&nbsp; We had many wild nights on the town, getting evicted from place to place.&nbsp; She loved the druids grove the wild parties us druids throw every full moon and such.&nbsp; But eventually, and ultimately the paladin lady had changed me and I just did not fit what this lady wanted from me, which was fun and excitement, police officers at our door and such every night, so she dumped me.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Well, after having my heart broken, I took up with this druid girl. She was quite outdoorsey, really meek and mousy. She was kinda skittish, but I liked her. She was really quiet but smart and witty, really nice attractive personality.&nbsp; Well, our first night we were going to get down, it turned out all that was a charade, she was quite the freak tying up and abusing me all night long, not going into to much detail except, my baby bottom hurt so bad I could not sit down. I could expect stuff like that from the girl I previously been with but this was weird.&nbsp; Eventually, I had to leave.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>On yet another, misadventure I went out a few times with this wizard girl. She was really smart but absent minded constantly changing the subjects while we were talking. Eventually as we heated up to each other, she kept forgetting things like going to T.G.I Fridays to hang out eat and socialize with friends and stuff. I had the last straw with her when we were in the movies she had to use the bathroom and ended up taking my car to an ice cream place, I had to walk home that night because she forgot about me.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>And my last misadventure with an Everquest gal was with a mage. She was ok other than the whole domination thing treating me like her slave, but other than that she was aight. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Well, I hope you everyone learned allitle something about some of the weird quirky Everquest player romances as often the classes they choose to play often fit their personality.</DIV>
