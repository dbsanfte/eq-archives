    <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'd give ya a link if I had it, but I use it all the time.  The weapon is called louctors or something like that.  Anyways it drops in karanor's castle off of one of those turkey things.  You'll know what I mean when ya explore down there.  Anyways it's a 35% slow proc on the weapon and works great for what you are trying to do with it.  Hope this helps. Now my question is when slowing mobs with this 35% slow in harder zones such as MPG or RSS I get the message that &amp;quot;this mob is partially slowed&amp;quot; or Mostly slowed.  I mean this is only a 35% slow, so I ask how does slow work?  Is partially slow on a mob different for the type of slow?  IE if I slow with a shammy and slow the mob 75% and get a partial is it really like 50%, where as if I slow with 35% slow does it really only slow it to 20%?  It just doesn't make since to me how slow works.  But anyways there is a rog only weapon that slows.  It's even tradable so you might find it in the bazar sometime.  Just go aoe kunark castle with ya cleric.  Pick up some of them shadowstep boots too =P.  Yes I love me toys. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Ok, I have searched on EQTC and these forums and have only been able to find scattered information.  I play a 70 cleric and box a 70 rogue.  I like to duo these two but content is obviously limited.  I can do trash mobs in Sol Ro and Stillmoon works pretty well but it's still pretty inefficient.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Does anyone have any advice on an efficient way to slow the mobs I'm fighting?  Whether it's from a weapon that I can get on either a cleric or a rogue or a type of poison that is reasonably effective to use duoing?  Like I said, I have some info gained from searches but it's scattered and limited so any help would be appreciated.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Oh and another thing poison's don't do much now adays.  In fact just about the only reason to make poisons are  to skill up and cut augs.  Imo sony really needs to revamp the poisons once again, Now imo poisons would be much better if rogues could get a endless poison aa.  Kinda like endless quiver only with poison's.  In todays content if you use poisons most of the time it gets resisted. Now tell me who really wants to spend all day farming the stuff for poisons just to stop dpsing the mob, cast or apply poison, then have it go off and get resisted.  The duration poisons were a neet idea, they just need to take it out of the buff slot and make it everlasting till you change your poison to another one.  Would be very cool of them to do that.  ATM thou just because I raid all the time it seems that the only poison I ever get to use is my clicky stanos 75 dmg poison.  If I could get an endless poison and not have to always farm stuff It just might make it usefull again.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;thank you&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Not speaking from experience (level 21 rogue) but it seems I have heard that poisons are resisted in current content to such a degree they are useless for slows.  Is swarmcaller rogue useable?&lt;/div&gt;</description>
