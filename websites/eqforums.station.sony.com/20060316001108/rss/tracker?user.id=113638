      <description>I noticed on logging back in that the PoK Bazaar and Guild Hall doors have this odd "fade to black" on the doors.&lt;br&gt;I don't know if this is related to one of the posters' traumas on the metallic sheen problem but I suspect so.  I also don't know if this issue has been brought up somewhere else, but it's the first I've seen and I'd love it to be fixed as quickly as possible.</description>

      <description>That is THE perfect angle though!  I take a LOT of pictures of this game (mostly just FPV shots of things that I find particularly puuurty or text emotes I'd like to view out of game) and usually my angles on larger things come out wrong.  How'd you set that one up so well?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yeah, it's small, but overall (I'm a poet and didn' know it!) the way the shot came out looks very professional.</description>

      <description>Lord Inquisitor Seru.  I liked the politics around Luclin, as it seems (since I recently have come back and don't know too much about GoD or OoW) to be the last major function of faction ties before everyone had "banded together" to fight off a common enemy, so to speak.  As for Seru, I've always loved the zone designs Marus Seru and Sanctus Seru in general, and Seru seems to be a major player in the Luclin scheme of things.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for The Question (pun intended!): How is it, that you can craft a remarkably beautiful and well-fortified city, submit your citizens to a regulated (well let's not mince words here) TORTURE SESSION, have a suit of armor commissioned that is only impenetrable by weapons that are a BANE to you, and yet manage to stay that completely paranoid?</description>
