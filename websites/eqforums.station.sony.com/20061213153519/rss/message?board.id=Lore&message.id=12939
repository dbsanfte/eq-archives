      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Lore&amp;message.id=12936#M12936</link>
      <description>Okay, I've been browsing the Lore forums for a while now and i have a question.&amp;nbsp; Where did all teh necromatic gods come from.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I recall talk that bert was created/assended by a race named Xolous(sp), kinda in teh way Maynog was assended. Is this true? Does this mean hes the oldest of the 3 Necro gods.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;CT -&amp;nbsp; no idea where he came from, hes not an elemental god( who were created by teh nameless right?). So who made him, is it known?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Inny -&amp;nbsp; No idea here eather.&amp;nbsp; He isnt a elemental god eather.&amp;nbsp; Has he and CT just always been around sence Nameless made the universe?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Basicly were did they come from, and whos the oldest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS any links to any pertaining lore would be appreciated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Bertox as a spirit&amp;nbsp; ascneded from the dead remains of&amp;nbsp; dragons and the xulous. Mayongs ascenscions was similiar&amp;nbsp; in some respects&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Mayong had shadowspine... Bertox had dragon blood&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Mayongs enemies were duped into worshipping him. The xulous were duped into worshipping via their dead kings.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;thats where the comparison ends. Mayong had an entire army and faction working towards his goal.. bertox had one agent who appears he did nt relly know what he was doing. Bertox was a spirit that predated the advent of the nameless. Whereas before the pantheon the spirits ruled. some are still around.&amp;nbsp; like to think of this as similiar to the transition from titans to the gods in greek mythology. Bertox is the only None spirit to transition to a deity &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Cazic Thule arrived to norrath just as the major players in the&amp;nbsp; second tier of the pantheon &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;some have speculated these deities arrived from the void or were ceated by the elemental gods.some have even speculated Cazic was created by Innorruuk.&amp;nbsp; It is assumed though unless a specific creator is mentioned then they either arrived from somewhere else.&amp;nbsp; or came into existence at the Nameless whim.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Innoruuk arrived before Cazic Thule. Brell, Tunare and Rallos left Innoruuk out of the first pact... obviously Innoruuk was about or he wouldnt of been peeved about being left out of the equation&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The wheel of Tarton as well as the spirits that still show up on norrath from time to time would indicate that the spirits are outside of the pantheon and would be the powers that be (see monk epic lore)&amp;nbsp; if the pantheon were ever to collapse or abdicate &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
