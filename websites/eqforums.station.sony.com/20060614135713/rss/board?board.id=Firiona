      <title>looking for a family/rp/fun guild on FV</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Firiona&amp;message.id=1582#M1582</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Greetings, &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I'm an old player coming back. I've been fool'n around a bit with the beta for the progression server, thinking about coming back on that. You know, starting fresh, re-living old content, actually seeing toons in old zones etc.... but I decided against it. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;1. I was intertaining the idea of being apart of a raid guild, but I had to just admit that my personal life just isn't suited for raiding. I have a newborn and I play off hours... just don't have time to spend more then a couple of hours at a time playing. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;2. I also had to admit that I've always enjoyed more family/rp type of guilds. I've played UO for a number of years and that's what I enjoyed about it, the more closer knit group of friends. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;3. I was also thinking about starting a warrior. I like playing Ogre Warriors. But again.... just can't be the MT for a raiding guild. Although that's what I love to do, I have to accept the fact that I simply just don't have enough time to commit to that role. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So.... after playing around a bit, I've come back to the class that most suits my play style which is mostly solo, dark, sinister and evil :), and one of the most fun and powerful&amp;nbsp;classes to play, the Necro. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So the last couple of days, I've been playing around with the necro on the test and beta servers and I've been lov'n it. Which has broght me here. I am fully commited and do fully intend to level up to 70 this time. I've played UO and others and EQ for me is the most fun out of them all. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I also like the new EQ, I'm not a 'classic' wanna be. I like the bizzar and the new expansions and so forth. So I would really like to find a good guild on an established server that I can join and make long term friends. ( note.... LONG TERM) &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So, I thought FV would be the best place to find a good RP/family style guild. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So what am I looking for with this post? &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;1. A chance to level my newbe necromancer up from level 1 in the same guild the whole time.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;2. A guild that has been around and will be around for the next five or longer years. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;3. A guild with players who play during the morning and day some. I live on the east coast and play in the mornings mostly or after 10:30 pm est. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;4. A guild who enjoys RP, evil toons and also just casual play and guild chat. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;5. A guild who's members like to have their own sites and gets into out of game RP. ( artwork, short stories, blogs etc...)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;6. Most of all a guild who doesn't raid much and just likes to have fun.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Yes I know I'm asking alot here, but hopefully I get a couple of replys. I know about the EZ, FV boards, but I chose to inquire about a guild here instead. If I don't get any good reply's here, I'll go there. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So what am I intending to do with re-immursing myself back into EQ.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;1. Level my Necro from 1-70 or higher depending on future expansions. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;2. Absolutely essential to find a guild to belong too for the next several years. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;3. Be an absolutly faithful member of the guild, always putting my own leveling aside to help whenever needed.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;4. Be a fun and helpful guild member who will get into traid skills and also start alts down the road. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So if anyone would like to let me know about your guild that you might think I would really enjoy, please reply. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Thank you. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Dave.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;After a long absense from EQ, I left shortly after TLoY came out, I went on to play EQOA and then WoW. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Hitting the max level on WoW and having found almost zilch in the way of a RPing community who aren't retarded(How many fallen god children, exiled lords, true kings, and slain family concepts can there really be?). I decided to come back to EQ, bought the Titanium Edition a couple days ago and have been messing around on a necromancer to level 10. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Im looking to see if theres anyone interested in RPing and/or leveling up with me. Im pretty much willing to reroll most races/classes if needed.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I know about the other forums for the server, don't remember the exact name right now though, I can't log in to those to post for some reason so im posting here.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>New to the Server</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Firiona&amp;message.id=1577#M1577</link>
      <description>After a long absence I have settled back in EQ as most other MMOs out right now are too easy and boring. I've decided to spend some time back in EQ as I enjoyed a great deal before I stopped playing two or three years ago. I decided to settle in on Firiona Vie because I enjoy roleplaying and things of that nature. Im looking for a guild that I can join so I can start making some friends on this server to cut down on the boredom of the lower levels. Right now I have a level 4 Bard, but I am willing to make whatever class a guild needs. Im not asking for money or to be powerlevelled, just a nice group of people to talk to while I level up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xyzon&lt;br&gt;Level 4 Bard&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Necro worried about missing quests by leveling to fast</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Firiona&amp;message.id=1573#M1573</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;Hello,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I am loving the Firiona Vie environment and just wanted to check with those who have been here for a while.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I know I have to be careful to not level past the mobs I need for quests so I am hoping I can get some suggestions for necro quests that need to be started early. I am level 12  now so I am trying to catch as much as I can early on to avoid a problem later.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Thanks in advance for any quest suggestions to start now before it is too late.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Bonz&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Firiona&amp;message.id=1565#M1565</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Note this is a post for a couple boards, to include various guilds and forum to get information consolidated to contact as many of my friends as I can.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;  A PARTING WHISPER FROM CODY:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Hello all that know of the Streea Family from Firiona Vie. (All of which is controlled by me, Cody)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This is one of those difficult post to write, because of the content and manner, in which, it is written.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I just returned from Fan Faire in Atlanta, GA.  It was an awesome first Fan Faire, and I look forward to many more.  I started Everquest about 3 years ago after some Family troubles/divorce and this gave me the option other than going out and drinking myself to death.  For that I owe one kind FRIEND and Colleague, known to the FV Server as Bloodswulf.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So I will address a couple things before my departure from the Firiona Vie server.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I started out this adventure as a Ranger (Wulase) and attained the first Epic Swiftwind, thanks to the help and guidance from my FIRST Guild SOCIETY OF VALOR.  So to all the old members of SoV that may read this, Big THANKS and HUGS for the patience and mentorship you provided to a NOOB to the game.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;After falling in love with the game, much like alot of you that are reading this, I started to expand my inventory of Charactors.  At this point my desire went from boxing 2 to having access to 10 accounts on Firiona Vie.  To this Day and for the future, these charactors will stay my family.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I went through some various Guilds after SoV faded from the Norrathian land.  Mostly seeking the progression to the Uber zone TIME.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I was welcomed into the Guild of RISING DARKNESS.  Here many people showed and fostered the foundations of my RAIDING experience.  So to all of the initial and departed members of RD, I show my gratitude and appreciation for your fortitude to put up with a Military Man's absence during Deployments and Submarine Sea time.  I would especially like to show my gratitude to Warz (1.0), Trawl(1.0), Solomoon(1.0), Lenadebi, and Csoda...(feel in the rest of them).  Now there are so many RD peeps that also deserve mention, but these are the ones that had the most impact on me. I will reserve one name for mention at the end.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I then departed RD upon my return from a deployment, due to various things that change.  Time changes things and sometimes the personnel, atmosphere, or progression short falls can factor into that. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I found my way to Fire and Fury.  At this point, I'd raided Time Phases, GOD Progression, and Epic fights prior to my application to FnF.  FnF showed me alot of high end content, and always had the great strats to the adventures, but due to some..I guess I'll say &amp;quot;Concerns of my ability to Heal during raids&amp;quot;, I determined that maybe I need to step down and move on to getting better experience in the art of masterying the Clerical abilities.  So to those members in FnF that actually worked with me I RESPECT you, and the others that set on the side with the peanut gallery, well: May your time be Successful in those Tossing of Peanuts.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Now moving on to taking the time in FV server as a Solo person, I ran across a few notable guilds, friends, and personalities.  Lilsis and Tynisis Warblade of Clan Warblade.  I cant express my deep appreciation for your support and ears for those many lonely nights.  I love you two like brother and sisters, so you'll always be in my wishes.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Then comes the guild that showed me the City of Anguish, DON content, and the adventures up to the Dreadspire access, RESOLUTION.  Within this guild the Streea brothers found a few close friends, and great resources of knowledge and support.  TO all the members of RESOLUTION: BIG OGRE Hugs and High ELF Heals, example Rhayanon, Cariangel, Qienie, Wrei, Ebangel, Serizel, Rhodious, Halburn, Shackleton, and Others.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;NOw for special mention:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Marjoree:  Your friendship, listening ear, and comforting words have ment so much dear.  You have my contact information, and we shall group on a established time dear.  BiG Kisses and HUGS to the Greatest SHAMAN I KNOW.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Saab:  You have always provided a fatherly figure and strong knowledge with guidance and a TRUSTED word.  I will always value your opinion and dedicated honor to the game.  It was a tremendous honor to meet you at Fan Faire.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Bloodswulf: I look forward to our time on other progression in which partake.  You've been a LIFE SAVER and will always be welcomed to my groups.  Great time at Fan Faire with you bro, I know that there will be many more bro.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; Well this comes to the end for the following toons on Firiona Vie, as they will not be present in the world of Firiona Vie Norrath with exception to designated times with designated people.  Big hugs and Waves...Thanks for the adventure, experiences, and GREAT LEARNING environment.  I will be moving on to other adventures,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Salutes and Honorable Bows from:&lt;br&gt;Saiwen Streea (70CLR)&lt;br&gt;Shibari Streea (70WAR)&lt;br&gt;Kajules Streea (70ENC)&lt;br&gt;Spankins Streea (43NEC)&lt;br&gt;and 6 other mini me's.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Minimum level for monster missions</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Firiona&amp;message.id=1561#M1561</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;Does anyone know the minimum level required for Monster Missions?  After doing some research I see I can gear up my beastlord and Druid and get quite a bit of gear.  It isn't top of the line but after hitting 17 on Beast and 16 on Druid I am still geared in the tutorial drops and would like a way to earn some better gear.  I realise MM no longer give good experience but I couldn't care less about that I just want some upgrades I don't have to fork out a bunch of plat on considering I have a total of 12pp now.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This is what I have found that is available so far&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Shoulders from HHK&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Arms from HHK&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Necklace from Nektulous&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Mana Aug from Nektulous&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Earring from Lavastorm&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Back from Overthere&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Earring from Undershore&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Boots from Undershore&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;HP Aug from Undershore&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Few questions on FV server</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Firiona&amp;message.id=1557#M1557</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;I finished the tutorial last night and finally entered PoK and set the ui back to the old as I hate the new one.  When I went to the bank I only had 8 bank slots instead of 16 on Stromm.  Is it a problem with the default ui or does FV only have 8 bank slots?  With the default old ui I still had 16 on Stromm.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;When I entered the bazaar to see what was available, if anything since I only had about 40pp, I saw a total of 18 people in the zone.  Is this typical?  I am not too worried as I came to this server with the intention of boxing a Beast and Druid so I wont need too many groups but it seems the server population is extremely small.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;How many family guilds does FV have on west coast time zones?  I used to be an active raider on Stromm but had to quit as I was missing tons of work to get home in time to start raids which were on CST.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Well I am trying to get my box setup so hope to see you in game.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;span class="postbody"&gt;Resolution on the Firiona Vie server is now actively recruiting all classes. We've recently had some gaps in our ranks, and are looking for new people!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are a raiding guild, currently hitting targets from DoN dragons to Anguish. We still have 3 raids left for Demiplane (Sendaii, Draygun, and Vule), and are currently working on Vish. We work on a merit based loot system, and for whatever complaints some have with it, I have found it extremely fair.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have family guild style values, and while we expect people to be online and focussed on raiding most nights, we realize that Real Life comes before EQ.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our website is &lt;a href="http://www.resolutionfv.com" target="_blank"&gt;Resolution FV&lt;/a&gt;and in our forums you can find posts on the application process and required/reccomended AAs. We currently instatag, with a 30 day probational period before a vote for full membership.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you have any questions, you can contact me in game, send me a PM, or ask any of the other recruitment officers on our boards.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;_________________&lt;br&gt;Jemi Silverhand, 70 ranger of Firiona Vie &lt;a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1130943" target="_blank"&gt;Jemi's stuff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Emerys Silverhand, 61 Cleric and Trader of FV.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Woulf on &lt;span class="date_text"&gt;03-26-2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;03:55 PM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Woulf on &lt;span class="date_text"&gt;03-26-2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;03:57 PM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Woulf on &lt;span class="date_text"&gt;03-26-2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;03:59 PM&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;::many edits:: I suck at linking stuff....&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Woulf on &lt;span class="date_text"&gt;03-26-2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;04:01 PM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Looking for guild or group of potential friends to play with.</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Firiona&amp;message.id=1547#M1547</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;I am a 56 Iksar Monk 14 AA.  I have been away from the game for almost 3 yrs now.  I don't know anyone anymore.  All my friends are gone, as far as i know of. My guild folded apperently. I can't solo and don't really want to if i could.  I'm aware of the issues with aging of the population on FV and i'm at a very odd age. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If there is anyone that could help me get headed in the right direction, it would be greatly appreciated.  If there is anyone around my level that can offer to hunt with me, i would appreciate your invite. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;My former guilds were The Crusaders of the MIst (now defunct) where I was guild officer and then guild master, and then a long tour as an officer with Indigo Void (apparently now defunct).  I am seeking guilds similar to these which were exp grouping oriented and emphasized friendships and loyalty.  I currently don't have the time to put into a major raiding guild, although certainly willing to help once a week on a raid if I have the time. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;My goals are to increase my level and AA by exp grouping and instanced missions, make some new friends and have a good time doing it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;RP wise, i have always played my monk as having the cunning savagery of my heritage tempered by great wisdom, and patience taught to me thru the hard lessons of the dojo.  In other words, I'm extremely difficult to get riled or rattled and extremly patient with interpersonal dealings, but if its time to get nasty, I have very sharp claws and teeth.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I am what you might call a casual serious player. In other words, I take seriously being competent at the role I play in my group and understanding how it fits into the grand scheme of things, however not so serious that we can't have a little fun.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I am a high dps monk.  I don't have really strong armour and i am not good at pulling.  I do have a very nice weapon though and do very nice criticals. I have always been appreciated as a nice addition to any group, i assure you.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Xarthak 56 Monk 14AA&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Fironia Vie&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Kafimur - Is Sony EVER going to do anything? Ky, note please</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Firiona&amp;message.id=1544#M1544</link>
      <description>Okay, we've got a running problem on FV with a dwarf paladin, Kafimur, and his team of friends/bots (we're not sure which) training people, kill-stealing and just being general annoyances in Omens zones. Every time someone petitions, we get canned responses from GMs about continuing to monitor him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If anyone WAS monitoring, he would have been caught by now. We've had reports this weekend on server of him in Muramite Proving Grounds stealing an engaged Blind Hunter Rekimaru, training a group at six-way on purpose to get the camp. If Cordor can get banned for smarting off to a GM-Admin in General chat (thank you for that by the way), can't someone at least actually monitor him for once? You'll catch him in 20 minutes, usually.</description>

      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Firiona&amp;message.id=1538#M1538</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;Howdy everyone,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I was wondering how the player community is here? I currently play WoW and EQ2. I played EQ1 for a long time and just started to get bored. I do miss the original game alot and I always wanted to be on the RP server ( I play on one of the RP servers on EQ2).  I had a few questions for folks on this server:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;1. How is the RP environment?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;2. How is the population? Easy/medium/Hard to find groups?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;3. How is the choice in casual RP-content guilds?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Thanks in advance for any info.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   Please no flames.....  Will reply ingame or go to guild websites or guild forums from only serious replies.  &lt;span&gt;:smileywink:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Name: Kenassus&lt;br&gt;Race: Vah Shir&lt;br&gt;Class: Beastlord &lt;br&gt;Timezone: Mountian Timezone (Colorado, USA)&lt;br&gt;Gender of Toon &amp;amp; IRL: Male&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As my thread title says, am a casual newbie to EQ looking for a casual guild to call home. What I prefer is something along the nature of family/casual type guild. Good game ethic's as in zero tolerance for cheating and use of ingame exploits, have great respect for real life female gamers (non-negotiable). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Guild must have at least been in operation in EQ for more then a year up to 3 years or more. This way I will know they will have experiences in day to day life in EQ.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Guild must be based in North America, this is non-negotiable as am in Mountain Timezone, or at least guild must have members who live in North America.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Guild must have a working website or forum &amp;lt;-- Non-Negotiable &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thx.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
