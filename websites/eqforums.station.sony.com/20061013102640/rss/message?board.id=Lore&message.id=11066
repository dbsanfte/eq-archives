    <title>So, some of the monster mission lore is wrong...</title>

    <description>So there's those monster missions where you play Dain Frostreaver I, killing giants in the great divide and founding Thurgadin, Dain Frostreaver II, a Warrior, attacking Kael Drakkal, and Dain Frostreaver III (haven't done this one yet).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Dain Frostreaver I died in the Crystal Caverns killed by Drachnids (presumably) long before Thurgadin was founded, Dain Frostreaver II, the Priest King, led his people to build Thurgadin secretly, where they remained hidden for his entire lifetime (there never were the attacks and aggression against Thurgadin that incited his attack on Kael Drakkal), and Dain Frostreaver III fought the armies of Kael Drakkal, driving them back across more than half of the Eastern Wastes, until eventually being pushed back and slain at the hand of King Tormax himself at the end of the War of Yesterwinter, in a battle that took place at the edge of the Great Divide.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You can learn all this by talking to Loremaster Solstrin in Icewell Keep.  He's in a room in the bottom, where the bodies of the three previous Dains are kept.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[Sat May 20 22:58:41 2006] You say, 'Who was Dain Frostreaver I?'&lt;br&gt;[Sat May 20 22:59:33 2006] Loremaster Solstrin says 'Here lies the body of his majesty Dain Frostreaver I. As the son of Colin Dain, he was the first crowned Dain of our people and also the first to carry the name Frostreaver, which was given to him by our people for his skills of dispatching Kromrif in melee combat. Original keeper of the magic axe Frostreaver, which has been passed down to our current Dain, he was a close friend of Glight Snowchipper and aided him in engineering the crystal caverns. It was there he met his death on a mining expedition deep into the caverns. No one was ever quite sure what killed him, only that the bodies of him and his party were found bloated and corrupted by foul poisons.'&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[Sat May 20 22:59:37 2006] You say, 'Who was Dain Frostreaver II?'&lt;br&gt;[Sat May 20 23:00:28 2006] Loremaster Solstrin says 'Here lies the body of his majesty Dain Frostreaver II. Known as the Priest King, he was the only Dain whot was a loremaster before his father died and he was crowned Dain. It was by his will that we left our home in the Crystal Caves and founded Thurgadin. He worked closely with the architects and miners to ensure Thurgadin would be built secretly and defensively. Dain Frostreaver II died of old age with his dream intact, our city had yet to be discovered and our people lived in relative peace and safety for more than five centuries.'&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;[Sat May 20 23:00:43 2006] You say, 'Who was Dain Frostreaver III?'&lt;br&gt;[Sat May 20 23:01:34 2006] Loremaster Solstrin says 'Here lies the body of his majesty Dain Frostreaver III. Known as the War King for his hot temper and brutal combat tactics, he ran a brutally offensive campaign that routed most of the giants from the Great Divide and half of the Eastern Wastes. Eventually, with the powerful magic of the Kromzek and the overwhelming might of the Kromrif, his armies were forced to retreat to the border of the Great Divide where he was killed on the battlefield in single combat at the hand of King Tormax. This war is now known as the War of Yesterwinter.'&lt;br&gt;</description>
