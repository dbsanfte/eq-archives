<DIV>Sorry about the stretch when I put in that long URL for the patcher, I didn't realize it would be that bad.&nbsp; It was that or go on <BR>for a bit about the knowledge base and the new petition system and such, which will be a different post.&nbsp; For this post I will </DIV>
<DIV>put in hard returns which might make it a bit easier for some people to read.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Q:&nbsp; What happened to my hotkeys, UI, and other stuff like that?</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>A:&nbsp; Depending on how long you've been gone, we've had two major UI changes.&nbsp; The original UI is no longer usable for those </DIV>
<DIV>that liked peering into it (I used it until the very last minute when they disabled it entirely).&nbsp; There are a couple of sites that can </DIV>
<DIV>help you with customized UIs, EQInterface is one of them.&nbsp; <A href="http://www.eqinterface.com/" target=_blank>http://www.eqinterface.com/</A></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>My interface is considered default, although I have moved the various windows around so that they are essentially in the order</DIV>
<DIV>of the old UI which is quite a bit different than what you get with a new character.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Recently the hotkeys were changed to a single vertical bar, instead of the two across rectangle it was before.&nbsp; They work just </DIV>
<DIV>the same, they just look different.&nbsp; I think, but am not sure since I didn't want to create a third EQ directory on my system, that </DIV>
<DIV>the Action bar is now defaulted as off.&nbsp; To get it back, the command is Alt M (for menu).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The Window Selector bar is also defaulted as off now, with a little square EQ box replacing it.&nbsp; The EQ Box has some very </DIV>
<DIV>nice options that the window selector bar doesn't have, like (going back to those hotkeys) you can have up to 4 banks of </DIV>
<DIV>hotkeys up.&nbsp; However, if like me you do resist change and want the window selector box, then the command is Alt W (for </DIV>
<DIV>window).&nbsp; I am trying to convert over to the little box, but I'm not quite there yet, I have both up.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>If you deleted your EQ directory, all of the things you put on your old hotkeys are gone and will need to be redone.&nbsp; While you </DIV>
<DIV>are setting up new assist keys and such, check out the options to change various message colors, I for one HATE the </DIV>
<DIV>"invisi-blue" and have no messages that come to me in that color.&nbsp; I do have different colors than default set for various types </DIV>
<DIV>of messages, like guild chat and say and tells are all different colors.&nbsp; That works for me.&nbsp; What works for other people is to </DIV>
<DIV>set up a series of different chat windows, all with different defaults.&nbsp; Although most of my characters only have 1 or 2 chat </DIV>
<DIV>boxes (other people have a multiple number), I admit for Ice that I have set up three:&nbsp; a channel chat box, my general chat </DIV>
<DIV>box, and a direct tell box.&nbsp; The direct tell and channel boxes grey almost all the way out, the main box stays fairly dark.&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>Some people put combat spam in a different window, I just turned most of that off, so no, I don't know when someone makes </DIV>
<DIV>a critical hit or whatever.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>If you didn't delete your EQ directory but your hotkeys or UI seem to be missing, it may be because of the server merge.&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>Check for files like UI_CharacterName_ServerName&nbsp;or CharacterName_ServerName and change the file names to reflect </DIV>
<DIV>your new server name.&nbsp; You can also copy settings from one character to another by making a copy of the file and </DIV>
<DIV>renaming it from CharacterA name to CharacterB name.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>You'll also notice that your inventory window has changed.&nbsp; From little things like seeing the actual number of your mana </DIV>
<DIV>pool and available mana (which, with a custom UI you can put outside in your character information box) to more major </DIV>
<DIV>stuff.&nbsp; The old picture of yourself that used to be in the center has gone, now&nbsp;there is your class symbol (that change was </DIV>
<DIV>made a couple of&nbsp;years ago).&nbsp; More recently, the entire window was redesigned to make room for more tabs and such which </DIV>
<DIV>caused some shifting around of where your worn and equipped items used to be.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>While on the subject of UI changes, two major&nbsp;non-character changes have been made (plus the bank window is a bit </DIV>
<DIV>different now with the transfer slots).&nbsp; The merchant UI is different and you can now sort items in a variety of ways, up or </DIV>
<DIV>down by Quantity, Cost, or Alpha.&nbsp; BTW, merchants no longer have hidden stock, what you see is what you get.&nbsp; The </DIV>
<DIV>Tradeskill interface was quite remarkably changed.&nbsp; Tradeskill containers now have two available views, one (the old view) </DIV>
<DIV>is now called the "experiment" view.&nbsp; The new Tradeskill View shows you learned or selected recipes (plus their trivial which </DIV>
<DIV>is color coded like mob cons), and will show you if you have the ingredients for that combine, has a button to do the combine, </DIV>
<DIV>and an autoinventory button even.&nbsp; No more clicking and dragging unless you want to, or if you need to learn a new recipe.&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>You can open up the containers either with a Right Click, or with a CTRL Right Click to toggle back and forth between the </DIV>
<DIV>two views.&nbsp; Using the tradeskill view you can even make combines without emptying the container.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>

				Thanks for the reminder, it's been a while (I was Philosopher on my other account).  Which means that a normal < a href= > would have worked to shorten the link.  In which case, I will beg for a halfling to edit it down - there is no way I can read this thread with all the sidescrolling now required, which is a shame, as it looked useful.

				Very nice thread for the returning player. Thanks. I will be returning and bringing my wife, and we will be starting new characters. It's been so long. With all the new content can anyone give an idea on how we should progress through the game?<br><br>I hear there's a new tutorial that takes you through level 11. Then where? Just regular experience? Should I focus on LDON at all? If so, starting at what level and when should I head to something else? Should I focus on the DoN expansion? If so, from what levels. Same with the new DoD expansion? What levels are these newer expansions made for?<br><br>Also, with all the new equipment I don't really know whats the best gear to be going after. Should I focus on LDON gear, DoN gear, is their any gear in DoD or is that for higher levels? I have a little money from playing previously, so should I just buy some gear on the bazaar?<br><br>If you guys could also give some advice in these areas, I would sure appreciate as I am sure others would too.

				<DIV>Most of the newer expansion zones are primarily for those over 45.&nbsp; There are some exceptions.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Do start with the tutorial.&nbsp; While you are in there you are given "tasks" which result in some various pieces of armor.&nbsp; Then when you get out of the tutorial, you are sent to PoK where you are given more tasks for more armor, if you chose to do them.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Many of the old time zones are empty.&nbsp; Oasis for example.&nbsp; Many people do chose to go to the fastest leveling zones, for those fresh out of the tutorial those are usually Kurn's Tower in the Field of Bone, or Paludal Caverns on Luclin.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>People are spread out and while there are lower level characters, it can be hard to find other starting newbies and not alts that are being power leveled or seriously twinked and a brand new player just can't keep up with them.&nbsp; One of the best things for returning people to do is to do a /who all level 10 15 or some other level or range to find where people are and check out those zones.&nbsp; And don't forget the LFG tool (or just /lfg ON)</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>There are a lot of returning players and there are people to play with that are only doing older expansions.&nbsp; You might have to look around a bit but you should find some people.&nbsp; One of the things the lack of players is good for is that you learn that you can do many things with less than "optimal" or at least not trinity groups.</DIV>

				<div></div><p>This is a great post and has me wanting to come back. I have been thinking about coming back to EQ for the past week, ever since I saw the EQ Titanium pack. I have a couple characters scattered around at different levels, however I would probably start off new to get the feel for the game back.</p><p>I have a few reservations/questions before I purchase this. I did a search on the forums and did not find anything about solo content. Yeah I know solo content, please keep the flames to yourselves. The reason I ask is im affaid that starting new I'd be one of very few new characters LFG on server full of level 60-70+ players, thus soloing alot or stuck grouping with a twink doing all the work for me, which is just leeching IMHO and not much fun.</p><p>Please any info to help with these feelings I have would really be appreciated. Also I am sorry if this is not where I should be asking this, its just the OPer and replies seemed to have alot of knowledge on recent changes.</p>

				<div></div>There are now vendor sold haste, heal over time, direct heal, and mana regen potions.  They are also player made and sometimes available cheap in the bazaar.   They are slightly weaker than player spells of the same level.   Also there is bazaar gear available cheap that will make almost any old world content easy.  Pets zone, so even enchanters and shadowknights can get Goner temp, HoS, and brell's(depending on level).  The only challenge to soloing older content is to restrain yourself from getting so twinked you get bored.  Hey <em>G</em>, try a character on Stromm.  We still get genuine newbies here as well as returnees.  Pop the lfg and see who comes to play.  I will be at work another week or so but I am sure you will find some action.

<P><BR>Just under the Name window in the second page of the character creation is a button that says "Start Tutorial" and its default is 'on'. Click it off and you will spawn in front of your guild master.</P>
<P>However, I advise you to go into the tutorial sometime before you are level 10, do the Basic Training tasks&nbsp;and get the Kobold Skull Charm. It will take you about 3 minutes and it's the best pre-level 50 charm you can get. +5 to all resists, STR and STA and +10 to WIS and INT.</P>

				<div></div><p>Quick question. I have been gone since right after GoD release. I also bought a new computer (man is it a hotty LOL). I dont have my discs anymore so today I downloaded and started the patcher. After it did the initial download (thank goodness for cable) I had time to do the advanced and start all the expansions to downloading. My question is: I have all the expansions up to GoD. I have all the expansions downloaded. Is there a way I can buy the expansions from SOE where I can get the keys this morning and upgrade? I dont need the discs right now. Just need the keys. Also I only need the ones for post GoD.</p><p>PS. I will be going to the store later for the new boxed set so that I will have all the discs. I really dont mind buying the game twice<img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0>.

<P>The best way has no downloads, the best way is the Titanium package which for $20 will bring you fully up to date except for Prophecy of Ro coming out this week.</P>
<P>BTW, you can download expansions you don't have yet so you will be all ready to play once you have your registration key.</P>

				One other important thing that i don't think i saw mentioned.   Cleric HP buffs(Temp, Virtue, Conviction) don't cost Peridots to cast any more.   So bumming temp for a new toon is a viable option if you need it.<br><div></div>

				Hmmm. Lots of good info but a lot of missing info too.<br><br>Tribute masters in PoK. By donating equipment and plat to tribute masters, you get access to a variety of buffs. This is a boon to people who solo and duo. There are personal tribute masters and ones that apply to the entire guild.<br><br>Newbie zones are full of tumbleweeds. All the players are in the tutorial until L10. Don't expect too many people to be LFG pre-20. Also, don't expect to find many people in the cities. Everyone congregates in PoK.<br><br>Many zones were vamped and revamped. Beyond those previously mentioned are Splitpaw and Mistmoor.<br><br>For tradeskillers, GoD and the Abysmal sea added a lot of recipes.<br><br>OoW introduced a whole new line of powerful augments (e.g. +11 to individual stats).<br><br>With DoN, very nice cultural armors were added. They supercede the newbie quest gear at L15 in their quality. Some are not too hard to obtain whereas others require encounters that severely outweigh the gear. With these cultural armors come cultural augments, which make the armor much better than the old newbie quest gear. These armors and augments are crafted through tradeskills.<br><br>DoN also introduced corpse summoning altars just off PoK and guild halls that contain guild banks, altars with porting capability, and mana/hp regen pools.<br><br>I will add more as I discover them... returning after a year abroad myself.<p>Message Edited by ether_sphynx on <span class="date_text">03-19-2006</span><span class="time_text">09:39 PM</span></p>

<P>The only free /movelogs were available to people actively playing their accounts during the merger period.&nbsp; The period only lasted 30 days after&nbsp;your server&nbsp;merged.&nbsp; If you waited until day 35 to decide you were out of luck.</P>
<P>As your friend is out of luck for a free move.&nbsp; The characters will be on the merged server and your friend can pay to move them.&nbsp; However, depending on what level they were it might be just as easy with your help to start over.&nbsp;Let him know that it is not as slow as in the old days and remember that you can shroud down to join him.&nbsp; Before I would fork over money, I'd go through the tutorial and the related PoK armor quests.&nbsp; I know that the gear is better than anything I had at 20 during the velious era.&nbsp; Go go bronze age!&nbsp; Even with top levels and top of the line Velious gear, your friend is going to have to do some serious upgrade anyway.</P>
<P>Although selling plat is against the EULA, you can see if there is someone interested in trading plat.&nbsp; I'd go to the server I want to play on offering to trade XX plat from the other server for XX plat on the current server.&nbsp; Sometimes there are other people in similar circumstances who either have alts or friends or on other servers.&nbsp; Of course, these sorts of transactions are honor system and once you click trade it is final, even if you get scammed in the process so be careful.</P>
