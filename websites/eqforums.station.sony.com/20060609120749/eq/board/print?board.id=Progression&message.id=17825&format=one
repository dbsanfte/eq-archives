That was pretty common practice for casters to bind themselves at the "safe spot" before vox, so if they died they could remem spells, and charge back in.&nbsp; <br><br>with enough wizards you could probably do it without any tanks...&nbsp; granted enough wizards might be 20 or more... <span><img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-wink.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0><br><br>not that I'm advocating that...
