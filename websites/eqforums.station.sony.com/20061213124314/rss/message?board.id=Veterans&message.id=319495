      <description>Plane of Hate is one of my favorite exp zones in the game.&amp;nbsp; The risk vs. reward and the isolation of it is wonderful.&lt;br&gt;Please change it to use the 30 second regen.&amp;nbsp; Currently the entire zone is set for raid, 5 minute.&lt;br&gt;There are two raid encounters there but perhaps you can do what you did in StoneHive and only make the 5 minute regen kick in when you are engaged with those encounters or are in the prep areas?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>The real reason is this:&amp;nbsp; Hunting in Plane of Hate now makes you angry.&amp;nbsp; You hate the new system.&amp;nbsp; This all brings in revenue for Inny.&amp;nbsp; Also it'll stop a lot of people from exping there, which makes him even happier because he hates the sight of you, and you leave your rubbish in the streets. &lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>There is something to be said for trying to keep zones worth going to in relation to other zones though. I feel that this zone was flagged as a raid zone for the benefit of the progression server, but the devs have already set their stance on this issue, so PoHate will go unused.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

...you know, others have said it, but wth?&amp;nbsp; "oh i used to solo just fine there before OOC regen, but now i cant use OOC regen there and it sucks!"&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;dang people, stop whining just for the sake of whining!&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;There is nothing logical about that.&amp;nbsp; I mean if they had increased mana regen rates in every exp zone but poh you wouldnt go "oh clearly your still just as good to go to poh".&amp;nbsp; If they had removed HP from every mob in the game but those of PoH you wouldnt tell us how PoH was still just as good.&amp;nbsp; How about this if one day you logged in and it was harder to get mana back in PoH than every other exp zone in the game you wouldnt say PoH was still just as good would you?&amp;nbsp; Thats pretty much what happened...&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Its relative.&amp;nbsp; When you retune the ENTIRE exp game and leave off one zone that some people liked to use for some what arbitrary and imprecisely applied reasons you do in fact change plane of hate by virtue of leaving it "old school" while every other zone got "easier small group and solo mode".&amp;nbsp; In the end an inefficient play zone is detirmined by its peers and not by itself.&amp;nbsp; By themselves each zone is perfectly tuned.&amp;nbsp; Relative to others is where they get screwed.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>There has never been ooc regen in pohate so if you did fine in there before you will do fine in there now.&amp;nbsp; People soloed in there because of the # of mobs and the ease of kills.&amp;nbsp; Most raid zones have trash that gives you the 5 min ooc and this should not be changed.&amp;nbsp; It is still a raid zone even if thats not how people use it anymore. &lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;because now all the mobs are grey to green, so there realy is no exp there anymore. and because why would anyone in their right mind go some place that now penalizes them to go there, compared to everything else now? yeah oh sure its no worse then it was before ooc regen, but thats not the point to you all oh so whiners that have to try and whine and call everyone else whiners. was there a penalty for going there pre TSS? nope, notta zero zilch zip, but now there is a masive penalty.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;also for sake of arguement i used to bring up all alts through here to level and exp up through to like 55-60ish, why would anyone in their right mind now want to even consider that when you can go anywhere else in the game at that level and not get penalized?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;come on bring on the flames you oh so whiners that whine constantly calling everyone whiners. you do know you guys whine more then the people you complain about right? nah probably not, still in denial i take it.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;You're missing the point even thought you include the reason right there in your post.&amp;nbsp; "It's original eq".&amp;nbsp; That's not quite true, but the point remains the same.&amp;nbsp; The reason its easy now is because you're taking characters that are far more advanced than the zone was built for...but that doesn't mean its a non-raid zone anymore than Anguish will be a non-raid zone&amp;nbsp;when people&amp;nbsp;can single group all the bosses there.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Also, XP in the zone hasn't changed one whit.&amp;nbsp; It's the same as its ever been.&amp;nbsp; Of course, as you level up, the XP they give is going to be less because the NPCs levels aren't going up while yours are...same as everywhere else.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

I thought people were pulling my leg when they said tier 4 named gave 9% aaxp per kill in a full group at level 65, but then I killed a few pre-Omens and watched the exp bar jump 9% and couldn't believe it. I don't think there was ever a single group mob that gave more exp than those.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;God I miss hunting there. :) Kinda pointless at 75 now. All light blue.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Rashere&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;You're assuming people only go to a zone based on how much exp it gives over time, while NOT comparing to how fast they can gain exp in other zones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;I personally don't care about whether PoHate gets changed or not.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Whether or not an NPC is a raid NPC is based on the original intent of the content.&amp;nbsp; The planes were raid zones originally and therefore the NPCs in there are considered raid NPCs for the purposes of regen.&amp;nbsp; That you can solo there now is irrelevant.&amp;nbsp; That's due to the&amp;nbsp;progress and advancement of your character in relation to the content.&amp;nbsp; At worst, the&amp;nbsp;5 minute timer just ensures that raid content remains at least slightly more difficult than equivalent non-raid content even as time marches on.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Then increase the xp! It's original eq, there is no justifiable reason, after 12 expansions and 25 levels increased,&amp;nbsp;to still consider this a raid zone, as it hasn't been such past the first few expansions which made it obsolete, with the exception of a few epic raids. Prior to the con/xp change, the trash mobs gave MORE xp than equivalent non-raid mobs, than they do now and with no penalty, puting in the penalty while&amp;nbsp;lessoning their xp, yet still considering them raid content,&amp;nbsp;is just obtuse.&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;You're missing the point even thought you include the reason right there in your post.&amp;nbsp; "It's original eq".&amp;nbsp; That's not quite true, but the point remains the same.&amp;nbsp; The reason its easy now is because you're taking characters that are far more advanced than the zone was built for...but that doesn't mean its a non-raid zone anymore than Anguish will be a non-raid zone&amp;nbsp;when people&amp;nbsp;can single group all the bosses there.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Also, XP in the zone hasn't changed one whit.&amp;nbsp; It's the same as its ever been.&amp;nbsp; Of course, as you level up, the XP they give is going to be less because the NPCs levels aren't going up while yours are...same as everywhere else.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;You're correct, "It's original eq" isn't quite true, the zone was revamped so it's not original. And I wrote that totally wrong, it doesn't convey the point I was trying to make. That no longer matters though, another poster addressed the revamp quite well. The intent of that zone was changed long ago with the revamp, so the original intent of the content no longer applies in the first place.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;As to the xp, the con change did indeed change the xp in this zone. You can compare the current xp off light blue/green at 75 to any equivalent non-raid mobs in other zones and find them equal. In the past, any time raid level mobs became groupable/soloable due to increase in level etc, the xp those fewer people then got was significantly more than any equivalent non-raid flagged mob, which should be the case here yet isn't. I hope this now conveys my point better.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;The zone gives exactly the same XP since TSS that it did before TSS.&amp;nbsp; The con color change was exactly that...a change to colors.&amp;nbsp; It didn't affect XP at all and we haven't altered XP in that zone in many years.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;p&gt;Rashere&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;I would say that just due to the design changes to the zone changed it from a raid zone to a XP zone.&amp;nbsp; In the old zone, you had risks on porting up, on pathing, and on 2nd floor aggro to deal with.&amp;nbsp; That is one hting that made Hate a dangerous place and that is gone now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, the Skylance group instances (Library/Oubilette/Labratory) have their mobs flagged as riad mobs.&amp;nbsp; This includes the mites in Oub.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>While on the subject of raid flags on mobs that shouldn't be - are you&#xD;
aware that the gray mobs in ldons (ie the trash you hit for a pet, for&#xD;
adds popping, for a mana refresh, for a hp refresh, etc) are conning as&#xD;
a raid mob and giving 5min lockouts?&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
I have a picture up in the thread here with one of the mobs in question&#xD;
-&#xD;

- along the same lines, LDoN zone-outs arn't working in alot of cases.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
