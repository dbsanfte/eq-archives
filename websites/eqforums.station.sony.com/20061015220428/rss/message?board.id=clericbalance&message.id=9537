    <description>Soooo, did the progression missions to get my first DoDH spell - Desperate Renewal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have to say, even though I had already seen the spell info on Lucy, I didn't understand how much this spell truly stunk until I looked at it up close and in my spellbook.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let's compare it to ancient holy light:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Desperate Renewal:  1375 mana, 3/1.8 sec cast time (1.8 with max spell haste), heals just under 5k and (in theory, since no one has seen it to this yet) has a chance to cure stuff.  Max mana pres on it is 20%.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;AHL:  775 mana, 3.8/2.3 sec cast time (2.3 with max spell haste), heals 4150.  Max mana pres on it is 25%.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There may be some very specialized encounters when DR would be useful.  However, for the vast majority of the time, it's not even worth wasting a spell gem on it.

DR, on the other hand, should just be scrapped and a replacement added.  At the very least lower the mana cost or increase the curing potential.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'll rant about AA in another thread!</description>

      <description>They just need to make a couple minor changes to make this spell useful and wonderful:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) Change it to a buff, not a heal.&lt;br&gt;2) Make it di, group version.&lt;br&gt;3) Set duration to 1 hour and let it fire 5 times before fading.</description>

      <description>Lucy has not been updated it seems, but it has been said DesRen is now:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1: Increase HP by 4935&lt;br&gt;2: Decrease Poison Counter by 18&lt;br&gt;3: Decrease Disease Counter by 18&lt;br&gt;4: Decrease Curse Counter by 18&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why was this change not ever mentioned in the patch message?</description>

      <description>I've been using this spell for over a month now. I've given it a fair try and for a time I did manage to make a use for it but really I had to make the situation happen. I had to see GoM proc and then underheal so that DR would make some sense. To use this spell it had to cost zero mana and I had to heal badly. That isn't even situational, that is just silly. I lose a spell slot if I want it too. It isn't a good spell.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I finally got this spell today and I tried using it.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The good news:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;OL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;the 30 second recast time is not as big a deal as I would have thought.&amp;nbsp; I used DesRen in place of Pious Remedy, and it was always available when I "needed" it.&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;the HPs healed was excellent (averaged a little over 8k per cast)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The bad news:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;OL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;since I do not have&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;general or&amp;nbsp;beneficial&amp;nbsp;spell haste (I have detrimental spell haste), the cast time on DesRen for me is&amp;nbsp;not the 2.0sec best it could be - it worked out to be 2.7sec (10% spell haste from Aura of Devotion).&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;the mana cost was &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;EM&gt;OBSCENE&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; even with the 10.8k mana pool I have.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;if this is supposed to be an emergency large heal, I'm not impressed.&amp;nbsp; The mana cost does not balance with the cast time and HPs healed.&amp;nbsp; I agree with maebe, this is a situational spell, that does not fit into enough "situations" to warrant a continuous spell slot.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>Most caster classes got a "GoM spell" - one with a prohibitive mana cost, but with bells and whistles. This is ours. The problem is that, unlike DPS versions, the likelihood that we will need Desperate Renewal when GoM fires is rare.  Nonetheless, I intend to use it, as I find that if I am using Pious Light, it's usually because there's an unslowed MOB on the MA and the chanter is gettin pounded on by an unexpected add, and it will usually take me 2 casts of PL to get the tank up to the point where I can use another less mana-intensive spell effectively (unless, of course, I crit). DR gives me time to deal with the chanter, wait until the tank is dangerously low on health, then pop him with DR.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course, I can use the epic clicky or DvA as well,  but I find DR a useful addition to my toolkit.</description>

&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;And that is the major problem with this spell. It is totally 100% worthless as a general use spell, and if GOM goes off, say 1/10 of all spells you cast, the likelyhood of needing to heal someone fast for big hp is VERY low.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I got this spell on day 2 that the expansion came out, and my opinion then was that it sucked, and my opinion now is that it sucks. I have not memmed or used it since that first day.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Yes, this is the problem; cut/paste from "GoM spell" idea from other classes.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Remember they did the same thing a&amp;nbsp;long time ago for CH hate change? They found out CH was not giving appropriate hate value so they increased it dramatically, saying "wizards do aggro control, so should clerics". But nuking and healing are two completely different things. You can wait before you nuke but most of the time heal can't wait. They finally agreed and capped CH hate to a certain value.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I'm really disappointed that, again,&amp;nbsp;they didn't think deeply enough.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I saw this spell on Beta and loved it.&amp;nbsp; I mean I LOVED it!! Of course that was before the "tweeked" it.&amp;nbsp; They put it on beta then lowered the amount of HP healed not once but twice and kept everything else the exact same.&amp;nbsp; I'm so extremely upset over this spell I just shake my head when I think about it lol.&amp;nbsp; The amount of mana it costs is just too insane for me to utilize it as one of the spells I keep mem'd.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I hope they fix it.&amp;nbsp; I've been waiting since they first "tweeked" it to see if they'd put it back to how it was when it first came out.&amp;nbsp; Maybe they were afraid it'd make the clerics too powerful.&amp;nbsp; (as it was when it first came out, it probably would have but still...)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I mean if they'd make the spell not only heal but also renew the melee's endurance then maybe just maybe the mana cost would be worth it.&amp;nbsp; Since we used to have a spell that renewed melee stamina and now that they work on endurance instead of stamina - those spells can be filed back in the book with true north.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I think the fatal flaw in this spell is that they designed it along the same lines as the DD spells that were awarded: High mana cost High HP effecting but intended to be used when Gift Of Mana procs.&amp;nbsp; There are two&amp;nbsp;problems in this design: 1) the combo of GoM and AH has deep coding issues and therefore we don't get GoM to proc as often and 2) even when GoM does proc what is the likelyhood that DesRen will be needed in the 12 seconds GoM lasts, since GoM probably procced on a previous "Light" heal?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I have tried using this spell in a number of groups and raids and although it is great for cast time and HP healed, the mana cost is too prohibitive.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;to the Devs...lower the mana cost to 1000 and this spell might replace Pious Remedy for&amp;nbsp;end game raiding clerics&amp;nbsp;(who have Ancient Hallowed Light) and might be&amp;nbsp;viable easier to get version of Ancient Hallowed Light for every other cleric.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

I have noticed that since I grabbed both of those aa's that GoM only fires when I use a nuke, and I have yet to notice it go off from heals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for DR it's worthless how it is now.  As for using it when GoM actually does fire, I would use my group heal for GoM over DR.</description>

      <description>Got this spell awhile back and it just sits in my spell book, no way am I going to cast a single target heal that costs that much mana over my ancient.  Maybe there is something ahead of us we have yet to see where this spell might be used, but I havent ran into it yet.</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;Not only is the cost prohibitive&amp;nbsp; for the amount of healing,&amp;nbsp; I am not going to tie up one of my 9 precious spell gems for a spell with a 30 second recast.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Desparate renewal doesn't even make it to my spell gem.&amp;nbsp; I can't see any use for it with such a high mana cost and low usefulness.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;desperate renewal is rubbish :) it is far too situational. The only time it really shines is when gift of mana is up AND someone is very low on health. Also I have no idea why it has such a long recast timer, not that I care cause i never have it memmed.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Its still better than the DOD nukes though, er in a never mem any of these spells kind of way.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;WRU group valiance and group vie??&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;I have to disagree slightly with regard to the DDs from DoDh.&amp;nbsp; Chromastrike is useful in highly magic resistent content (if you can nuke).&amp;nbsp; I would ratrher do 1200 constantly than 1700 (on average) that is resisted 30% of the time or more.&amp;nbsp; The Undead DD is a different story I have not used it yet so I do not know, but from what I have heard the "snare" effect does not proc enough and is basically meaningless since undead don't run.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;But I do have to agree group vie and/or group AC would be greatly appreciated.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>I mem DR on raids now, just in case I need a "save-the-raid-heal". I still have to test it more to see if it is real useful.</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;I tried that a couple of times recently, hoping to take advantage of GOM. I found out that GOM seldom (almost never) fires when I need to use this spell, and that it takes so much mana I am better off using other heals. So it went to the back of the book again.</description>
