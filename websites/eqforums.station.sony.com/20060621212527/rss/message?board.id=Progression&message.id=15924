      <title>Vambraces of Ro quest concern</title>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;This is kinda the wrong place for this and at the same time maybe a really good place for it. Ive been doin the armor of ro quests out of boredom and i think the plague shark spawn is broken. I killed em once found em with ease, since then every time i check he isnt in the locs ive been givin or anywhere on track when i bring trackers to the zone. Have em swim, run over the water, roam over the island and coasts and he never pops up anymore. I highly doubt it's being farmed for anything or being constantly killed for the quest so it leads me to believe the spawn is broke. I sent in a feedback but i dunno if they will do anything about it seeing as its an outdated quest... which brings me here. If it's broke on the live servers is it gonna be broke on the combine too? Just hoping this could get checked on soon.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
