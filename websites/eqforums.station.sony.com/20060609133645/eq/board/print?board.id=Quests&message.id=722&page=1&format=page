				I'm sorry if this has been mentioned elsewhere...<br><br>Four of us decided to do a mission, Death Comes Swiftly (see other post about other issues), with 4 people: levels 70, 70, 70 and 66. Just after starting a fifth person tries to join us, level 65. I was unable to add her to the shared task because she was too low level (got a nasty red message saying so). We all quit the mission and as a group of 5 people, we were able to get the mission without a problem. How would a level 65 be too low to group with level 70's?

<DIV>Do you happen to have the exact message that you received when you tried to add the level 65 to your group?&nbsp; Adding someone to your mission should only fail if it would drop the average level of the group below the minimum level for the mission.&nbsp; Otherwise there shouldn't be any problem.&nbsp; If you have that message or can find it again, let me know and I'll look further into it.</DIV>

				I wish that I got a screenshot of it <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-sad.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0><br><br>Something like: You can not add this person to your shared task as they would lower the average level of the group below that of the mission.<br><br>Not those exact words, but I listed the levels of the others, here are the specifics:<br>70 warrior (got the mission)<br>70 druid<br>70 shaman<br>66 cleric<br><br>the person to be added:<br>65 enchanter<br><br>The average of the first 4 people: 69<br>The average if the fifth was added: 68.2<br><br>I believe this was a 33-shard mission, so it can't be too high level.

				The message given is "You can not add this player because you would fall below the minimum average level for this shared task.", and I have seen the exact same thing when trying to add a lower level member to a task it fails, but if I invite the lower member to the group and we all leave the task and request the task again it works fine. One of the tasks where this has happened to me is the Children of Gimblax task.

				<DIV>We had a similar odd problem on&nbsp;a mission, group was 70 SK, 70 Necro, 70 druid, 69 Paladin, 68 Enchanter and 67 Cleric, we tried to add a 6th person (friend logged on) who was a 68 Cleric, but when we did we got the "your group average will fall below the limit" message too, odd because we dropped the 67 Cleric (who was a bot) for the 68 so we were actualy increasing the average....</DIV>

				<DIV>I had in issue while tring to join a DoN mission and this seems to be a good spot. While I was zoneing a leader of a task tried to add me to task. When I finished zoneing I got no message asking me if I wanted to join. He tried to add me to task after i zoned and it said it could be added to task because I was already in one.</DIV>
