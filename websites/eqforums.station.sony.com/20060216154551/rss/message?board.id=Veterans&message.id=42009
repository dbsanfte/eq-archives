    <description>Hi there. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking for myself only, I'd like to see auto-attack for ranged weapons added to EverQuest. Clearly the community wants it or it wouldn't be in the ranger's top-10 list. I don't personally see why it should be a big deal to add. But that's just my opinion, which isn't enough to make this happen because this sort of thing requires several key people to agree that it's something we want to do. I have raised the subject on several occasions in the past couple weeks and hopefully the decision making folks will come to a conclusion before too long. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stuff like this is important to get team discussion and agreement on because it's easy for one person to overlook potential problems (code and/or design) of the side effects of what might otherwise appear to be a simple change, so I don't mind waiting until people come to their own conclusions about it we should do it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;cheers</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I am so very glad to know that there are programmers who enjoy helping the players to the point they spend extra time working on these kinds of nice enhancements. You guys have done so many nice extra things and they are all appreciated. And ignore the silly people arguing against /melody, some people just can’t be happy no matter how much you try to help them.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;If you find yourself looking for another project like that, could you look into adding an auto-range attack, similar to /melody? I find it really difficult to chat with my friends while constantly pressing the range button. And that is a lot of the reason I play, so I can goof off and have fun with all my EQ buddies. Lol, so many people would be SO VERY happy if you make an auto-range. Hehe, I’ll even name the hotkey I make using it “Grumbuk Power.” We have asked for this before, but we realize there are so many other things you programmers have to do. If it is too much trouble to do, I understand. No worries.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Thank you for your time, Asrayjr&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Lol, to Klonn and the others calling for negative additions to auto-range to "keep it balanced" because of cheaters:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The people who would make "ranger bots" already do, they just use game pads or macros. This new ability just helps the honest people. Please stop calling for nerfs to things. Did I mention you should stop calling for nerfs to things? Oh btw, it isn't nice to call for nerfs to things. Why? Because it only starts flames instead of having nice discussions. And then Ash has to be mean and lock the post even though she doesn't like having to do that. So don't stress out Ash by starting flames.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;1) Sarcasm should be based on intelligence. A least act intelligently enough to use the term "nerf" correctly. You can't "nerf" something you don't already have. Since you don't have auto-ranged-attack, it could not possibly be nerfed. The *whine* of "nerf" often originates from children who know what they want, but it is suggested by anybody else that they should not get exactly that. It is part of shouting down the opposition, especially when used with the "you promised never to nerf" statement from SOE. The flames are from the children screaming "nerf", not the reasonable people looking for a solution suitible for everybody.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;2) I suggested a limiting factor in response to others that said it would be too powerful. That makes it an attempt to compromise, not an attack on your class, not a personal&amp;nbsp;attempt to limit the power of anybody. Disrespect me for a lot of things, but attempting to find middle ground is an attack on neither side and not deserving of that accusation.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;That is exactly the kind of reply I mean when I say you are being unwise with your posting verbage. Calling people children (I am 35 years old) will generally cause flames. /Em wonders age of Klonn. But back to topic. Auto-range has only 1 down-side, and that is possible "bot" abuse. That is not an issue though because people are already doing this with gamepads and macros. It just helps the HONEST people. It is not appropriate to call for negative addons like snaring someone or poofing arrows/shurikens/etc. for those who would use auto-range. This is asking to nerf something from our top 10 list that is going on (is already on?) test. Grumbuk has offered to add this new feature as is without any negative features. Just like auto-melee, auto-run, auto-twist. There is no logical reason that people should have to mash a button for hours on end, and be unable to chat with their friends without losing dps. It is unbalancing to NOT have auto-range. Not the other way around.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;The second part of you post is very good and objective. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Believe it or not, I actually agree with you. My prior main was a Pally that spent a lot of time pulling. My Archery sucked (capped at 70), but I used it a lot for pulling. I often wanted an auto-fire so I could actually control where I was going rather than whacking the fire key (or move and fire).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;on the other point... I am a lot older than you are, I have children almost your age. And yes, child has little to do with age, except that some people grow out of it.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Archery not being auto fire seems one of those old legacy issues, that the only reason its not auto fire, is because it hasn't been auto fire...&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;While there will be arguements about automating anything, since really EQ is just "pressing buttons at right time" however I dont think pressing archery every time it pops up really compares to something that is time depdent when you press it.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Should be added , if nothing else because simply its already done&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Yes autofire is so unbalancing, to automatically replace the skill needed to continually press the same button is obviously impossible.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Thank you for the info Grumbuk.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;To the other folks. There are a number of third party programs and game pads that are in use today by rangers to prevent repedative stress injuries.&amp;nbsp; This does would not "trivalize" anything. People who want to cheat using macroquest I think was the name surly already have the tools to do it.&amp;nbsp; It&amp;nbsp;also does not make soloing "trival" or some such either.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Form my point of view its about letting folks be able to chat and for many rangers to not have to choose between a third party add on or a repdative stress injury.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;For those concerned with it trivalizing events:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Todays high end ranger with good buffs&amp;nbsp;does ~280dps in melee, ~200dps with a bow on&amp;nbsp;a non moving non rooted target, ~350-400dps for 2min every 67 with trueshot, and about ~80dps on anything soloed with a bow since the mob is rooted or moving.Qvic + level ranger.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Todays high end rogue with good buffs does about ~350-400dps in melee before discs, 500-625dps with melee and discs, ~400-525dps expected 450dps with thrown disc 1 min every 20. Qvic+ level rogue. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If someone wanted to bot a ranger 1) they could do it today easily 2) there are a lot better choices to bot for damage or utility.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Heck a necro in 2 spells Prye of Mori + Desecrating Darkness can do 515dmg a tic (85.6dps) before focus items and a 75%snare. Thats already comperable damage&amp;nbsp;to what a ranger can do on a rooted or moving mob and a much better snare (shoter but its got a resist adjust that lets it land without nearly as many casts). Then add in pet and nukes and other dots. Boting a necro would be just as much and probly a lot more dps and utility then boting a ranger. Boting a rogue would be way more damage.&amp;nbsp; Those are not even the "easy" choices like a shaman bot etc.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If autoarchery does go live please make sure its still easy to fire off just one arrow. Perhapse&amp;nbsp;a /autofire on|off|toggle type command to turn it on, off of flip its state?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Thanks again for posting about this Grumbuk even if the powers that be shoot down&amp;nbsp;ranged autofire you have brightend a lot of rangers days just by letting us know you looked at it.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;Klonn,&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I am not sure how "endless quiver" would factor into this. I could definitely see the exploit of bot rangers - especially if they get their requested improved healing - stading off on auto-fire while the main tanks the MOB. Ranger doing damage from range, SoWing, healing. That would be Bad.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;In my post below yours I was referencing this part.&amp;nbsp; When I am bowing I can still sow and heal believe it or not.&amp;nbsp; Your implying people just hit auto attack and walk away hense a bot.&amp;nbsp; But even a well played bot can still scroll through there bots and do all the things the class is capable of.&amp;nbsp; I know quite a few people that play there own groups and go and do tipt and vxed all the time because they are bored.&amp;nbsp; One person 6 accounts 6 toons.&amp;nbsp; I sure if they were just doing your standing around with auto attack or auto whatever on that would not be possible.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;I am not sure how "endless quiver" would factor into this. I could definitely see the exploit of bot rangers - especially if they get their requested improved healing - stading off on auto-fire while the main tanks the MOB. Ranger doing damage from range, SoWing, healing. That would be Bad.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;In my post below yours I was referencing this part.&amp;nbsp; When I am bowing I can still sow and heal believe it or not.&amp;nbsp; Your implying people just hit auto attack and walk away hense a bot.&amp;nbsp; But even a well played bot can still scroll through there bots and do all the things the class is capable of.&amp;nbsp; I know quite a few people that play there own groups and go and do tipt and vxed all the time because they are bored.&amp;nbsp; One person 6 accounts 6 toons.&amp;nbsp; I sure if they were just doing your standing around with auto attack or auto whatever on that would not be possible.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;My thought, and it was a pure blue sky thought, was that the limiting factor could be quiver capacity. Essentially, the auto-attack would fire until you run out of arrows. If you consider arrows in the quiver to be "equipped" as well, then you add more value to the quiver.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;My comment about Endless Quiver was that it breaks that idea, in that there is an unlimited supply of arrows. Makes my initial idea a Bad One.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Thank you very much for taking on the role of champion for auto-archery within your group.&amp;nbsp; You will make many rangers happy, as, well, I assume, as other who have ranged attacks.&amp;nbsp; I hope the dev team lets you provide this very nice improvement to the life of a ranger.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Thanks,&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Howdy folks,&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Please remember that these are Grumbuks views and not necessarily the views of the team as a whole.&amp;nbsp; Auto-archery may or may not happen and is actually in very early stages of discussion.&amp;nbsp; Once a decision has been made, either for or against, I will let you all know.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Thanks folks.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;quit with the PR spin-doctor bullshtuff Brenlo. Grum probably knows far more bout the game you could ever know, if you played for a hundred years. You have already proven you know nothing about the game rangers play time and again. So just go away.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;(hit submit by accident)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Brenlo, there is apost floating around here, where you actually state that one reason we cant have it, is it cant be programmed (someone dig up that post please before it gets deleted). Yet now it seems to not be the case (again, as we told you before...anything can be coded if you have the balls to actually do the work involved), since bards are going to be able to get twisting help.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
