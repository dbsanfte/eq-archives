Barkspur is also suspectible to other factors, like oor, running mobs, change in targets etc etc. Whats the harm in upping it to 15minutes to ensure full damage occurs. Leave the recast at 12s and the functionality remains the same.<BR><BR>Would like to see the community thoughts on it, as well if possible to add to our top 10, brought up to the dev's in fan fair etc etc.<BR>

<P>This would allow you to pre-buff an entire raid&nbsp;with Barkspur before engaging.&nbsp; An AE rampage mob could take over 90 thousand unresistable damage from Barkspur&nbsp;within seconds.&nbsp; Sorry, but this isn't going to happen.</P><BR>

<P>Sure 90k if every&nbsp;silk class and priest class in the raid runs into melee range to get smacked.&nbsp; Last time i checked that seems like a pretty poor strategy to win.&nbsp; You figure thats about half your raid.&nbsp; So you could feesably do a 45k barkspur.&nbsp; Thats what 2&nbsp;mana burns? and its going to involve half your raid getting smacked 8 times by AE ramp which involves a risk of death.&nbsp; Also its going to involve a lot of cordination and time from multiple druids.&nbsp; Use of precious buff slots and be unusable on any raid with adds or no AE ramp.&nbsp; <BR></P>
<P>A couple AAs spent on 2 wizards has the same effect and it has much less risk and management involved to complete.&nbsp; I doubt by raid leader would even endorse such a tactic and probably laugh at me for suggesting it.&nbsp; In exchange this spell is now useful in groups - because right now i only use it for powerleveling.</P>
