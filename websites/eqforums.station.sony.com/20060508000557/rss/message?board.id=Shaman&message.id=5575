Zoned into PoSky, had Potion of Sustenance on me. Got to Pegasus Island and found the Eternal spirit, and handed him the potion. Heard the quest ding, but no Blessed Talisman, and no script from the spirit. I was freaking out, so i petitioned it. While waiting i had this insane idea to &lt;b&gt;go back and repeat the last script to the Enlightened Spirit in freeport.&lt;/b&gt; So i jumped off the island and made my way to the spirit in North freeport.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Guess what? That's right, it worked. So now i had gotten the potion back. YAY!! Went back to sky and tried turn in again, and bada bing there it was, the blessed talisman was given and the script went off. Go figure. I withdrew my petition also at that point. I'm not sure if the quest was setup so if there was a goof you could fix it, but apparently that is what happened. I have no idea if it would work again, and have no desire to go screwing up my script, but maybe after i get 1.5 i'll go back and see if you can still get the potion from the spirit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aye, i encountered the same bug, from what i've seen and talked about, it comes from not doing the complete dialoge. i went stright to the part where the spirit gave me the potion and then went to sky and he ate the potion just as yours. then &lt;b&gt;went back and went through complete dialoge and it went jsut like it should.&lt;/b&gt; is kinda screwy =(</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;It happened to me once when Idid the turn in.  I petitioned and had the potion returned.  I did the turn in again and had no problem.  I suggest waiting until the Eternal Spirit is not moving before doing the turn in.  It does pause in its pathing once in a while and that seemed to work for me.</description>
