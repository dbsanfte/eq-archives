These volunteers dedicate their own time and energy to enrich the world of Norrath. As a Thank you to them Guides of the month have and will be chosen for their exemplary contributions.  &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/gom/yourang-cshome.jpg"&gt;&lt;img border="0" width="152" height="200" src="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/gom/yourang-cshome_sm.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff" size="5"&gt;Senior Guide Yourang&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;1. Why did you become a Guide?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;Probably for the oddest reason -- an offhand comment from a dear EQ friend -- a ranger, of course :-). I am a Guild Leader of a large guild on one of our servers ... and one day a member of my guild made a brief comment that, &amp;quot;You should be a GM the way you like to help people.&amp;quot; It got me to thinking about the guides I had met along the way. Almost all of them seemed to me to have a real happiness in what they were doing. (I tell people who are interested in being a guide -- that if you just want to for the &amp;quot;uber&amp;quot; equipment and the &amp;quot;wizzy&amp;quot; commands -- you probably will be gone in a month -- but if you like people, have patience and a sense of humor, then this is an awesome thing to do!) It got me thinking. On a whim, I applied and was lucky enough to make it to Prexus with a great bunch of appies, where a couple of ancient guides (Aeegir and Juxtaron) unlocked the fun of both helping and role-playing.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;2. What games do you guide on? For how long?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;I have only been a guide on EQ -- and that not much over a year now.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;3. What is your guide race and class?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;I am a wuss mage! High elf, of course!! :-)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;4. What is your favorite color? &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;ROFL!!! GREEN! The guide photo would not show it because I changed the look of my guide toon to be different from my play toons! But my play main has been dark green from day one!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;5. What is your favorite land (zone)? Why?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;No question -- Charasis! I think the combination of the puzzles, the wings, and the complexity make this one of the best the developers ever did! When it was a hot zone, it was an awesome place to play. And when fabled --- WOW!!!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;6. What has been your best or favorite moment as a Guide?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;No doubt --- another small thing. After trying for 2-3 weeks to help a player who was having trouble with a quest -- I finally figured out what he was doing wrong. The /petitions and asking guildies had failed. I was baffled. When I finally figured it out (in the library you had to duck down and see just the edge of a drop) it took me a day before I could figure out a fair hint for him. 3-4 weeks later he found me in PoK and thanked me, and told me it meant so much to him that he had sent a letter to Sony! I doubt he actually did, but it made my day to hear how much that help meant to him!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;7. What is your favorite quest, event, or knowledge circle? What do you do the most of?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;Lost Item! Sooooo much fun for newbies. 3/4 of the time you get excited players. I have a huge set of hot buttons set up now from all I have learned about doing it. It is a great quest for Unrest or Crushbone, but if these zones are empty Kurns is usually a great place for old quest #111!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;8. What has been your worst of least favorite moment as being a Guide?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;I hate it when re is a problem and I am convinced the player has a good point, but I can not find an appropriate way to help the player. The P&amp;amp;P guidelines, much as I wish I could stretch them on occasion, make a great deal of sense to me. But as an active player myself, running out of legal ideas and having to refer to /petition is always frustrating. Fortunately, a few months into guiding I discovered something that made that a ton better. If I could let the &amp;quot;player&amp;quot; side of me show (&amp;quot;Aaargh! I hate it when something like that happens to me...&amp;quot;), sympathize, and try my best to provide legal hints and workarounds before I refer to /petition -- I was stunned how much the players loved that approach! I could introduce the need for a /petition with something like &amp;quot;ooooo! For that one we need the help of the big kids in San Diego, way over my head...&amp;quot; I would even suggest how to phrase the /petition and what to include, and might be able to suggest workarounds. Literally 95 out of 100 times, the player was so grateful for the sympathy, being pointed in the right direction, etc ... that they left the PST as very happy campers even for very frustrating problems! And, if I set expectations that it might take 2-3 days for someone to get back to them &amp;quot;unless they were very lucky...&amp;quot; then often I would get a PST the next day &amp;quot;Wow! I already heard!&amp;quot; People really like it when you really listen, and try to help, even if your options are limited.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;  &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;9. As a player have you every run into any Guides and events?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;Yes -- a few times. It is fun to watch and learn from other guides ... and quietly be able to, sort of, help the guide without the guide knowing he or she is being helped by setting a tone of fun in responding. And best, I learn a lot about better ways to do things by being able to see how members of my group are responding in /gsay or guild to the guide's efforts.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;10. What is your favorite thing about this Game?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;I love the quests and exploring! I am a role-player at heart. As a player -- a dear friend and I love to explore new areas for our guild -- die often, learn enough to take the rest of the guild there.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;  &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;11. What do you plan to do in the future as a Guide? Any goals?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;I don't have a clue!!! My short term goal is to make better use of the Persistent Characters. I don't have enough experience with them yet, but since I am on solo a lot, I am convinced they are the answer to trying to find better interactions with senior players that the quests sometimes do not do for solo events. Longer term, I need to find more solo quests that are good matches for level 50+ players. At some point in the distant future, I would like to qualify to help out on the personnel or policy teams. Oh yes -- and I need to figure out if Sony will sue me if I name my new dog Fippy! :-)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>
