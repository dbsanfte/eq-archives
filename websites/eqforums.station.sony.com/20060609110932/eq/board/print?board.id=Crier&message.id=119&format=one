<DIV>It's day one at The Electronic Entertainment Expo or E3.&nbsp; Brenlo and I board the bus that will take us to the Los Angelas convention center, traffic is a bit on the nasty side and it takes us nearly an hour to go just over 3 miles, thank goodness we don't live here in LA.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>We arrive at the show and push our way through the crowds of people waiting to get into the exhibit halls when the doors officially open, we run into the folks from EQ Interface, we wave hello as we pass by.&nbsp; Once we get inside there is loud music, bright flashing lights and tons of signage.&nbsp; The SOE booth is unlike anything I've ever seen before.&nbsp; It's a large castle with a huge video screen that is running a video that features most of SOE's titles.&nbsp; We plan to have the EverQuest portion featured on EQLive soon.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>There are a few "Booth Babes," with PSP's attached to their belts, Antonia Bayle is posing for pictures and the SOE employees at the counter are handing out stickers.&nbsp; We have people walking around the show asking "Did you know type questions that correspond with posters around the outside of the booth, these our questions about our various games, those that answer correctly win a prize.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The inside of our closed booth is rather large..&nbsp; It features various meeting rooms, PCs with demos of most of our titles, and some really cool looking posters on the wall.&nbsp; There is alo a smoothie bar and a few refreshments.&nbsp; Unfortunately there wasn't any pie in sight, Brenlo and I consoled each other with a walk around the show floor to check out the other booths in the area.&nbsp; There are lots of exciting things to see.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>We return and Sylvene from stratics stops in.&nbsp; We chat for a bit, take a few pictures and then Brenlo rushes off to one of those meeting rooms.&nbsp; A bit later Gemdiver stops by to say hello.&nbsp; Rashere, Chris Lena, and I chat with him for a bit.&nbsp; It's great to see some familiar faces!</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>It's time to leave the how for the day, our feet are tired and sitting down to take the bus home feels like a gift from Karana.&nbsp; Until tomorrow, this has been Ashlanne Barefoot, your official E3 correspondent.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>P.S.&nbsp; We hope to have pictures to post tomorrow.</DIV><p>Message Edited by Ashlanne on <span class=date_text>05-19-2005</span> <span class=time_text>03:15 PM</span>
