&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;I'm not wrong I'm saying what you want isn't feasible. they had to give people new levels and new aa's. this by default is going to make old content outdated, thats the nature of online rpgs.&amp;nbsp; and it's not like the new content immediatly triviliazed the old content. people were still hitting seblis when PoP was out. Guk truly didn't become empty until the release of luclin. Your talking 3 expansions later and a lot of time in between. Why shouldn't old content become trivilized eventually?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;People want a progessive server becuse new content made old content obsolete huh? Funny I'm here because a) I want a fresh server. And b) I like the idea of people moving through expansion one at a time. I don't want te classic server and more what your talking about is a classic server because the only way not to make old content obsolete is not to make new content. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;But that's just me and even though I do know others who feel the same way as me we don't count I guess because we don't want what your saying everybody wants a progressive server for.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;I've been playing since just before Kunark was released and I've noticed several fluctuations in population.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;The first expansion Kunark was by far the most popular simply because Norath was so overcrowded with Lower Guk waiting lists and single zones with over 100 people. Not only did it create a little more breathing space for everyone, but we received 10 more excruciatingly slow levels, new spells, Iksars, and high end content of Sebilis and VP.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The second expansion Velious introduced lots of mid to high end content to keep everyone busy for a long time without unbalancing the rest of the game minus Swiftblade of zek, horn of hsagra, and blade of carnage. This expansion almost forced you to choose a faction and stick with it.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The third expansion Luclin unbalanced the game with easy to attain items such as Centi SS and LS, paludal caverns, and too much land mass. Lower guk, solusek dungeons, karanas, and the kunark dungeons emptied almost immediately for the easy grind in merus seru, dawnshroud peaks, and fungus grove. This expansion did add Vah Shir, beastlords, Nexus Scions, and the bazaar.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Out of the next several expansions except for those after Dragons of Norath, which I had nothing to do with, certain similarities brought out the retired players. One LoY and the addionion of frogloks. This was the first time the old world has been modified so much. Trolls are sent to Neriak, the Frogloks start in Innothule Swamp, and a newbie zone has more than 100 people in it.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The biggest innovation; however, had to be Lost Dungeons of Norrath. Many of my friends reactivated their accounts to see the new additions to the old world. The unfortunate thing is there we so few new players that finding a full group below the 50s was quite a challenge. My cousin and I playing a monk and a ranger twinked out with fungi, cof, etc would have a hard time finding just a random character of similar lvl to meet the three player requirement.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;After the release of expansions such as Omens of War and Gates of Discord I saw most of my friends and guildies leave for new games. This is simply because each expansion felt like a brand new game and very little was done to expand on the game we all grew to love and know like the back of our hands.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;In conclusion, my experiences lead me to believe additions to the old world, new classes, and new races were the most successful in reviving retired accounts. I don’t feel as though SOE has let my friends or I down because the loudest voices are those of us that raid almost daily, have one or more characters that solo kunark/velious dragons, and have no particular need for the old world..The unfortunate effect is the casual gamer that keeps our economy going, is still lvling up, and is always strapped for a descent group can just as easily play the newest MMORPG as they can grind by themselves in the dreadlands. This is the one game that had so many people in the beginning that a tutorial wasn’t even needed because there was always at least one person in say range that would take you to the bank, join your group, and give you some of their old gear to help you start out.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sorry but you talk like very many people are low level. If you pull sever pops the truth is the majority of characters (excluding all level 10 or below chars) are level 65+ and a huge majority at 70.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;It's not like there are lots of low levels. even casuals these days are high level because of how much more xp a lot of new zones give.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>nnodal you're completely missing the point&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
new content that completely trivialized (and made pointless) old&#xD;
content was bad for the game and is one of the reasons so many people&#xD;
want a progressive server.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
simply put, items/exp/things to do in new zones made even visiting old&#xD;
zones a complete waste of time, especially around luclin.&amp;nbsp; can&#xD;
anything be done about this?&amp;nbsp; probably not without a revamp of&#xD;
zones as new expansions are introduced.&amp;nbsp; is this practical?&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
probably not.&amp;nbsp; in fact the only way i can see content not&#xD;
eventually becoming totally trivial is on a server where content doesnt&#xD;
matter too much anyway, like an old-world only server or discord&#xD;
server, which i dont think will happen.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>actually... it's more that the majority of players are lvl 65+, so&#xD;
they're not going to have alot of motivation to camp mobs in Lower Guk.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
