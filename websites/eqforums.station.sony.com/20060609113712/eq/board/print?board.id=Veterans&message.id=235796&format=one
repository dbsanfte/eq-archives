<div>A good number of the weekly questions have come directly to me, since the queries tend to be related to&nbsp;the spell system&nbsp;that I've recently been handed the keys to.&nbsp; I'm not going to have a solid answer for any of them yet, and I'd rather give out a real answer later when I have a firm grasp on the system and what I want to do with it instead of an "I'll look into it" now, but since there's a need for feedback:</div>

<div><em>Q: Our class has utility spell X and the recast time makes it inconvenient to use.</em></div>

<div>A: I'm all in favor of changing spells that are inconvenient simply for the sake of being inconvenient, but if it a change would allow you to gain aggro faster, absorb damage faster, cure counters faster, heal damage faster, or kill mobs faster... then there's going to be&nbsp;a&nbsp;shift in power, and the end result of the change&nbsp;would need to be considered carefully.<br></div><hr></blockquote><br>A number of wizard gate, portal and translocate spells have very long cast and recast times without any justifiable reason. They don't serve any purpose in the balance of power other than helping people travel around the world. They really are just inconvenient for the sake of being inconvenient.<br></div>
