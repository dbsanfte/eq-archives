				<div></div>Not really a wizard spending those AA's is going to be out of Mana using them....and probably be more worthless then the melee taking those 8 ramp hits if not dead from aggro. Also to mention the 1 minute rule for mana burn is still in effect. <br><br>8 AoE ramp hits isn't going to kill a lot of your melees so much as long as your healers are paying attention, and they still can back off to get a heal and then step back in. Ramp usually hits most melee till they get the ranged downed anyhoo. Takes about 2 to 3 ramp rounds to finish the buff off I would imagine, being 2 to 3 hits in a ramp.<br><br>It isn't unheard off back in the zerging mob days to use DS this way somewhat.<br><br>Don't get me wrong the scenerio is somewhat far fetched in todays game, but not as much as using the 2 wizards mana burn AA's.....considering they will do more alive then with mana burn. Mana burn, flare and blaze is last resort sort of stuff.<br><br><p>Message Edited by Shamno on <span class=date_text>11-08-2006</span> <span class=time_text>09:17 AM</span>
