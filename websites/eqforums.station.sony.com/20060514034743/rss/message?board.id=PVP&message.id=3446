      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;For years, EQ has been pretty secure - exploits did exist, but they were fixed soon. Nowadays, plat dupes abound, people warp all over the place, ghosting is common practice, now I see people even summoning their own corpses to other zones and I get attacked by peeps who do not even show up on /who. It is getting old. Is it the end of EQ - are we going the diable way?&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;3 Of the main hackers on SZ where banned recently. Good job BUT keep it on and dont unbann them again after 1 month like the last time.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I remeber other games like UO who also had a hacking problem. The GMs did care alot and worked there ass off the chatch them. Why not in EQ ? Need to many man houres to do that? Since you canot fix it patchwise do it with your own eyes. Get a staff for this who can monitor 24/7 Not only during us times. During euro times no GM is on, they can do what they want. BANN HACKERS&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;The way to stop the "GM" visible hack is simple.. have the gm's run normal (buffed/geared to hell) toons around.. &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Here is a c &amp;amp; p from a discussion about eq hacks.&amp;nbsp; This is the crap i am talking about&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;(link)you will find the source code for one of the “high level” plugins for MacroQuest. It adds the following commands to Everquest:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;/gate – gates to bind point&lt;BR&gt;/warp succor – warps you to the safe location of the current zone&lt;BR&gt;/warp target – warps you to the location of your target&lt;BR&gt;/warp loc x y z – warps you to the location specified by x y z&lt;BR&gt;/warp last – warps you to the location where you last warped&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Feel free to do with it whatever you want.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;(Editor's note: This is extremely against the EULA, so use it at your own risk. If you're not careful, "...do with it whatever you want." might mean being banned.) &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;and from what i read this has been going on for 5 years. I asked the devs about this once already and my post was deleted, go figure&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Tonight I had my first visable hacking experince on Sullon Zek. I was hanging with my higher upper class shadowknight freind when suddenly A bunch of goodies zonned in ( all of the same guild) Me and my freind saw this an opertunity for my to practice on my Pking skills. I saw a group aproaching us, they where all red to me, and I was pumped, although sure that I was going to die, when suddenly they all dissapear. we turn around to see that the whole group had not only just warped, but also "ghosted" behind the zone line. The where still in the zone, and every once and a while we would see one of thier heads pop around a corner. They said it was a bug, but when more joined and did the same thing I realized that it was no bug, since me and my freind could not do it, and thier guild magically could. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Now I have heard people greifing anbout warping, and ghosting, but never understood why they would give so much grief untill tonight. It is just stupid, mainly because they probally would have killed me anyways. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Now I am not saying that the good team is the only one that does it, I have heard of of evil and newtral guilds doing it too, so my only question is "When will it stop?"&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;All the PvP changes and improvements are Null and Void until the warping issue had been addressed and fixed.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Day after the patch and already the resident Good aligned hacking guild is warping all over like crazy. &amp;lt;Black Prophecy&amp;gt; of course :) They are getting away with it with no incentive to stop. It is quite pathetic.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Hacking/warping has killed PvP in everquest (just ahead of training :smileywink:).&amp;nbsp; Unless warp-hacking is eliminated, or those using warps, there is no PvP improvements.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I really do think they need to do something about hacking - if they fixed nothing else in PvP but fixed that, sooooo many of the complaints would go away. When I was newly learning to play I was very confused about the abilities of many classes before I learned to recognize that the players were in fact doing things their class could not, because they were hacking.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;You can pull all the GMs you want and these people would behave til they left.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The hackers have programs that detect GMs.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I would like, at least, to know what is the most correct way to handle this. I petition, but my petitions go unanswered and I am unable to open new tickets - and bugs do abound, more than one at the time. Report, similarly, has never had an effect. Is there anyone out there to give us an answer on how to tackle this problem?&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I am under the impression that sony would rather have their 12.95 a month from the offending player rather than make a few other players happy, as while they always threaten to leave EQ it seems rare that they actually do.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;What they &lt;EM&gt;ought to do &lt;/EM&gt;is pull a few GMs from other servers, and have all of them just run around the PvP servers for a week or 2 in perma-GM invis mode, and make a list of everyone they can catch hacking during that time.&amp;nbsp; Then suspend every single known hacker's account at the exact same time, call it a bonus to the PvP changes.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;August XX patch message:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;............................................&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;In&amp;nbsp;line with&amp;nbsp;our efforts to make Everquest PvP better, we have taken most of the cheater off of the PvP servers.&amp;nbsp; Honest players may now leave the Bazaar without fear!&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;I believe that the problem is insanely easy to fix, if SOE actually cared about stopping cheaters all they have to do is make a slight modification to the EQgame.exe every night and put out a new one in the morning, its crude but effective.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;The best way to deal with cheating is having a dedicated server GM who understands what cheats are being used and what they do, but I think those days are done.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Even so, a&amp;nbsp;little bit of monitoring and banning cheaters would go a long way.&amp;nbsp; The depressing thing about Sullon is that the same people who were hacking two years ago are still doing it.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I logged into SZ a bit today (I basically do not play anymore since the hacking is taking the fun out of it) just to get involved in a fight with som Black Prophecy in the Great Divide. Interesting experience, I saw some new warp hacks. Rather than improving, seems that the situation is degenerating. I left the zone understanding I was powerless, they sent me tells asking me to get some friends for a good fight - I told them I would not, since they were hackig, to which I was told that all guilds do. I logged off in disgust. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;On a side not, it would be nice to know what to do with all those hackers. Petitioning is a pain in the butt with the new UI, nor does it seem to hold any results ( over time, I have petitioned a couple hundred times, including the names of the most recent offenders - the result? they are still around and hacking). I am not sure how to use /report, since nothing in the text of my chat window does point to them hacking. &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Hacking, ghosting and training. Seems to me that these are the things that have #¤"%¤ up PvP. Resist-adjustments, melee-adjustments, PvP killpoints........... To me it give absolutely no meaning, when all i see in PvP is someone bringing a train to me or warping all around the zone when i chase em. Biggest problem isnt SoE, its the people who take advantage of the flaws in the game.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Aye it is a problem.&amp;nbsp; I did the bezerker snare on (yes i will say her name) DRUBI and she was snared, but somehow she did a continuous shadowstep like movement and i couldn't catch up to her, the thing is the shadowstep type movement was controlled meaning she could go in the direction she wanted, naturally i did a /report but to no avail as i still see her on.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
