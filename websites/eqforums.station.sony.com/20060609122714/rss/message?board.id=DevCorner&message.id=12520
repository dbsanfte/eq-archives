    <title>DirectX 9.0c update on Test and is going Live with the next update</title>
    <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=DevCorner&amp;message.id=12520</link>
    <description>This post is just another reminder to folks that we've updated the Test server to use the April release DirectX 9.0c. Note there is a little bit of confusion about which specific version of DX9.0c you need; there happens to be a couple of different versions of DX9.0c and to make a long story short if you aren't sure which specific version of DirectX 9.0c you have installed, please just &lt;a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=56513&amp;amp;clcid=0x409" target=_blank&gt;visit the microsoft DirectX update site&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=56513&amp;amp;clcid=0x409" target=_blank&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to be sure your system is fully up to date. While it's a little confusing to everyone that there are multiple releases of DirectX 9.0c, it is a thankfully simple process to just go to the microsoft site and update automatically (I have no idea why Microsoft didn't update the visible version numbers, sorry).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please note that with the next update to live servers players will be required to use a version of DirectX released in April or later.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For anyone interested in why we are updating, it is because there have been a good number of bug fixes in DirectX 9 since the version currently in use on Live servers. The latest version also provides some very useful diagnostic tools to help us continue to improve the stability &amp;amp; performance of EverQuest. This is not a significant update to the code; pretty much all that had to change from a code standpoint to support the latest DX was shader API related. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our compatibility lab spent a lot of time testing all the the permutations of supported hardware (which is a lot of time &amp;amp; hardware) and so far neither QA or the players on Test have reported any problems with the DirectX update. That said, if you want to be certain your system will not have any problems related to the DirectX update when we patch live servers, I recommend you log in to the Test server and verify your system allows you to log in and play with no obvious visual artifacts. To the best of our knowledge, updating DirectX to the latest version will not affect your ability to play on Live servers and in fact we believe a significant portion of the player base is already using the correct version. We are optimistic this will be a smooth update, but it's always good to get more people confirming the results so if you're able to get on Test to check it out please do. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks-&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

      <description>It just came to my attention there can be issues with using the Microsoft update page. Please check out the following post for more information about how to properly update your DirectX: &lt;a href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Crier&amp;amp;message.id=314" target=_blank&gt;http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Crier&amp;amp;message.id=314&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>
