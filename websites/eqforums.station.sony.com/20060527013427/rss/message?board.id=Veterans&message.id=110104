      <description>It seems that petitioning does little on my server (7th hammer).  There are known cheaters/exploiters on the server getting past certain areas of certain zones without defeating the encounters.  Rumor has it that this guild has friends that are guides/GMs and things are getting swept under the rug.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When it comes to instanced zones, there's no way to report anything, and besides.. report doesnt really work well when you witness something that no one is close enough for you to see spells etc. (ie... seeing someone at a zone line and /assist them and they have a boss mob on target and its health is going down)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I wish there was a better policing system to stop cheating, something needs to be done, especially on my server.</description>

      <description>Not just the ACLU will get involved, the player base doesn't like it either.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;http://news.zdnet.com/2100-1040_22-5830718.html - WoW players up in arms over Blizzard scanning their machines.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway, as I said in my initial post, its hard to /report a cheater when they are in an instanced zone, but when people are (by more than one person) accused of cheating and some /reports have gone in, then why not investigate that person in the game?  Eventually he/she will slip up and make an error.</description>

      <description>I'm not going to bother to quote and add another color, since I only have one relevant block of text to respond to.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As far as I know, EQ still uses that encryption.  For this reason, ShowEQ does &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; packet sniff anymore.  It reads from EQ's memory space, then an external program connects to it across TCP (same or any other computer).  It updates that program, which interprets everything and basically acts as the front end.  That's what a ShowEQ user is going to be looking at.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On a side note, regular ShowEQ runs on Linux.  A quick google of "MySEQ" will turn up the Windows version.</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;EQ does use encryption.&amp;nbsp;Most of my information comes from a slashdot article done at the time the encryption was changed and from searching thier message board, at around PoP, they went to a public/private key. It forced ShowEQ to go to a keysniffer that ran on the EQ machine and sent the key back to the linux machine. At some point, EQ changed back to the old style&amp;nbsp;encryption which allowed them to brute force the key and did not need the external program any more. It does sniff the packets, and decrypts them on the fly so it is totally passive again.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;A href="http://features.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/12/01/1558220&amp;amp;tid=9&amp;amp;tid=10" target=_blank&gt;http://features.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/12/01/1558220&amp;amp;tid=9&amp;amp;tid=10&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;That is the slashdot article from Dec '02.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;ShowEQ looks pretty much dead now. It still functions, but a lot of its features have been incorporated into EQ already and doesn't seem to have much activity any more.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;As a side note, my quote about having Sony pay me came off wrong. What I was trying to say, I will provide them with what is freely available, if there are any costs, like that one site selling plugins or to gain access to the "VIP" section of MQ, that they pay me for the expenses occured to get them any additional plugins/scripts.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;The sites/software make no difference. The people writing this are not breaking any laws.. however if you can nail an exploiter/macro'er like the previous poster... do it. Websites don't do anything, petitioning an exploiter might.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;The mq devs do not care.. i found mq in about 4 minutes, I could download it in about 5 minutes and if i used it they would not get banned from eq.. i would. The developers and the game makers are interested in making money and going through a bajillion lines of code and working through more hacks than either of us probably know about is not profitable. What a player needs to ask themself is "Why do I play everquest". Also "if someone is macroing, how is it directly affecting MY gameplay?". For me I play because this game is exactly the game I have been wanting to play since I first started playing "fps" roleplaying. And the macro'ers haven't affected me yet so I really do not care. What I'd like to know is how many people are directly affected by the exploiters/cheaters/macro'ers. &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>To the people investigating that image...don't bother.  Somebody on The Seventh Hammer (the one who started that flame thread) photoshopped the screenshot on my guild's homepage, http://www.savagearms.org&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was done as a joke, because The Dark Exile did &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; kill High Priest Nkosi Bakari, or, in fact, Ixt Hsek Syat, before killing Zun`Muram Tkarish Zyk for access to Tacvi.</description>

      <description>Thats what I dont get about the griping.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most of the time the MQ users dont even directly affect others.   The ones ive heard about use it mostly for automation of mundance tasks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SoE isnt gonna bother with people using MQ for 1 simple reasons, They can't afford to.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If they banned every person that use or has used MQ/SEQ, they would be out about 25% of their subscribers.</description>

      <description>and then of course you have things like that.. that arent even software related, but can do macros =p&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/products/details/US/EN,CRID=2166,CONTENTID=10717&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Logitech® G15 keyboard offers gamers an unprecedented level of in-game information, programmability and control. Its adjustable-tilt, backlit LCD display shows you crucial information during game play, and lets you set timers to keep track of game events. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The 18 programmable "G Keys" allow you to execute macros—like casting spells in World of Warcraft—with a single button press, and the backlit keys are great for lights-out play. The G15 also features a switch that turns off the 'Windows' key, so hitting that button accidentally won't end your game.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Logitech® G15 keyboard is completely customizable to help you play better. Try it and you'll never go back to a standard keyboard.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    * View game stats. Use the GamePanel™ LCD to view game stats, create new macros, and keep track of important system information without leaving the game. The LCD panel closes completely for transport and storage.&lt;br&gt;    * Play in the dark. Illuminated characters are easily visible in both bright- and low-light conditions, with three levels of backlighting for late-night gaming sessions.&lt;br&gt;    ----&gt;* Create and save macros with a press of a button. 18 fully programmable “G Keys” have three shift states each, for 54 possible custom macros per game &lt;----&lt;br&gt;    * Eliminate cable hassles! Intelligently route mouse, headset, or other cables using convenient channels under the keyboard.&lt;br&gt;    ----&gt;* Record custom key sequences. Make on-the-fly additions to your key programming set with Macro Record button.&lt;----&lt;br&gt;    * Watch and listen. Convenient media keys for easy management of audio and video playback.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;The GMs don't have to ban half a server to make the hacking stop. They just have to ban enough prominent cheaters to make the rest stop.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If you are a guild leader or officer and are using cheats during raids, expect to be banned first.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Has anyone whining about these programs actually looked at them... Not used them.. looked at the site and or the code?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Looks like macroquest parses the data before it hits your eqclient and then outputs the data the way you want it. It also looks like it just uses the commands eq would send anyway except it automates it. This would make it damn near impossible to detect it electronically. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;/Rant/&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;People whine about this stuff and expect the devs and gms to take care of the evil &amp;lt;evil doer name&amp;gt; guys because they make the game less fun for me. They do more than enough fixing the actual bugs, issues and removing exploits when they find them (so stop griping about patches already).&amp;nbsp;If you really want to make plat and get stuff, play more and figure out how. I know people that have made&amp;nbsp;millions of&amp;nbsp;plat (god knows why since most of the high end gear is quest/non tradeable) without breaking a rule or using an exploit. And before i get a slew of "how did they do this i want plat too" questions.. go figure out a way yourself.&amp;nbsp; My personal favorite was the trep quest (do it 100 times and you got 3k plat in profit and xp,buy and sell in bazaar and your 3k becomes more).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;/Rant off/&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;But back to finding out how to fix this, sony really cannot DO anything to the creators of macroquest. What they do is not illegal it is against the eula. And figuring out which character standing at XXXX brewing barrel is macroing or which is standing there getting carpal tunnel is probably going to be damn near impossible (At least they made it easier than it used to be.. of course after I made it to 150+ on all of them ;P ).So here is my solution, if it makes you feel that bad that other people are playing a video game and they have a special tool that helps them and you just CANNOT GO ON LIVING WITH THIS.. stop playing this game and go to the everquest anonymous website for help. Meanwhile I will be playing this game until they shut down the servers because I really enjoy it. Good job sony and for me I'll keep on questing.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

However the commands sent back leave a unique signature that is different from what would be sent through your eq client (linux can be used to work around this in some cases, but I think it's only client side stuff like showEQ). It's kind of like how microsoft claimed there was no way to trace information back to the sender when those viruses were floating around but because of shoddy programming there was provided you got down and dirty with the code. The problem from Sony's perspective is the sheer magnitude of code we're talking about which is why it can take them several weeks after suspending an account to confirm whether or not third party software was being used even when they can pinpoint the event through in game observation. Personally, i don't understand why they can't put in a censor that looks specifically for those signitures and documents them every time they are used, but that is probably due to my lack of understanding of the programming and would more than likely require significant resources and hamper game play in some cases.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;just my 2cp, and I only dabble with the stuff so feel free to correct anything i mistated.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;what's funny about the MQ code, if any programmers have taken a look at it&amp;nbsp;out of curiosity's sake, is that it utilizes built in game features. It seems peculiar that as easy at it is for anyone to grab the source-code, and as simple as the design of the code, that a fix could not be developed somewhat quickly. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Perhaps they are not looking for a way to block/catch people using the program, but rather fix the ability to allow programs like these to do things they aren't supposed to...&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I, like others, just find it very difficult to believe that they don't have this code at SoE. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If they truely don't, it&amp;nbsp; really makes me question their&amp;nbsp;Professionalism, even more so than before.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>Ashlanne was just encouraging people to send in detailed bug reports when they know about something going on. It doesn't necesarrily mean that they don't have the MQ code at their disposal, but there are purchased macros for MQ as well as alternative programs that they may not have access to.</description>

      <description>These aren't things that get done publically over the internet. Many exploiters/plat farmers have a business relationship with programmers that do the work for them and others like them for a monthly fee.</description>

&lt;P&gt;everything is 'public' over the internet in the sense that there's a way to get it. the macro's the are more obviously cheating as opposed to automation are harder to find but not so hard an IT employee should not be able to get them within 48 hours of searching. Took me less than a day to find both MQ and Warp sourcecode.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

There are versions of the programming and add ons that aren't available for downloading over the internet. Through a rather weird series of events I've ended up being close to several plat farmers without actually playing with them, exploiting, ect. and they've all mentioned having a "guy" that programmed macros for them and customized a version of the software for their use.</description>

&lt;P&gt;They might not be available for public download, but the macro programs are not rocket science. Been a while since I looked at it, but as I recall the macros themselves are nothing but XML files, which is not even programming - just a text file with macro steps in it. I read the boards there from time to time to get ideas on what to look for in a cheater, and from what I see very few really understand enough about the program itself to do any real programming [just as an aside, a few&amp;nbsp;weeks ago some idiot posted there bragging about how he was auto-farming, and gave his in-game name and server].&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;What SOE needs to do to stop it is to make it so that MQ2 cannot intercept, or cannot understand or translate what is sent back and forth. The real programming is in the MQ2 program itself, not in the macros. I am not a code guru - I can barely manage "hello world" in Javascript - but from what I see is that of those using MQ2, about 3% are "hackers" and 97% are script kiddies. If you can find a way to stop the script kiddies, that is a huge chuck of cheating taken out of the equation.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

As far as the macros, you're right that it isn't usually actual code, but it still takes a lot of work to cater them to specific situations. Programs that for instance ch at a certain % unless the cleric gets hit with an ae fd in which case it auto-stands and then casts a quick heal, ect.&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Maddar_Xegony on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;08-12-2005&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;04:07 PM&lt;/span&gt;</description>
