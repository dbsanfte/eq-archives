    <title>Tipt: Rikabi the Riddler</title>
    <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Veterans&amp;message.id=68361</link>
    <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Two nights ago, I was leading an expedition through Tipt. After many hours of the climb up the mountain, we had finally made it to the Riddler. It was gettin late and we were so close to finishing and flagging some more guildies. We asked for our riddle. We recieved this as our riddle: "I help to mature your spirits. When I moisten I fulfill my purpose. Should I dry out, my task will fail and my quary may be worthless." Of the possible answers (the items strewn about the floor) we surmised the item the Riddler requested was for the Cork. To check we enlisted the help of other members from our guild and friends we knew. We also confirmed the answer on Allakhazam.com's spoiler site. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Great we thought. Handing in the Cork produced the right message we were looking for, denoting that the gate, in yellow,&amp;nbsp;behind the Riddler had opened (paraphrasing) "You hear squeeling gears as the gate begins to open". But right underneath this, the Riddler also stated the message (again paraphrasing) "I do not require this item. Here you can take it back." Acting as if the Cork was not the item he required, and doing what the Riddler does when you turn in the wrong item: spawned 5 'a mountain pooka' on the group completely wiping us after a near 3 hour crawl up the mountain already&amp;nbsp;littered with our corpses.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I had /petition'ed in game and recieved a message back stating I should /bug the problem and/or post here.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I tried /bug'ing but for some reason I could not state exactly what happened - I was unable to type in the /bug box.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So I am resorting to posting here in hopes that A) this is not a widespread problem, B) If it is, let it be known and possibly fixed, C) help my guildies find closure on this issue and not have to find some other ways in going around a possible broken Riddler. D) Find out if this has happened to anyone else.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Thank you,&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;~Keur Darkbones&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;PS. This happened on the Druzzil Ro server, and I have not been back to Tipt since this occured because I just have not had the desire to go back yet and find out if this is to happen again.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;No,&amp;nbsp;I was not invis. We had just finished killin a hynid and I was talking to the Riddler, requesting the riddle from him. My faction was amiable when I conned him. I had no intention of invissing past him.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;My guess is someone in your group hosed you by giving him something just prior to your giving the cork.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The door opens whether or not you get the riddle right.&amp;nbsp; Getting the riddle right only opens the door without the adds.&amp;nbsp; That being said, next time have your group move back to the safe area after the clear and let only one person answer the riddle (preferrably a monk or other FD capable class).&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;That way, if you get a buggy response you can better handle the situation if the Pookas spawn.&amp;nbsp; Sorry to hear of your wipe, but next time keep the group WAY back and a wipe right there won't happen again.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;As a matter of fact.. He gave me back the cork.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I was the only one around the Riddler, and the cork was on my cursor. I gave the Riddler the Cork and there were only the two emotes I mentioned. The first the door opening, the next him throwing the cork back in my face. At this moment there exists a corpse outside tipt with nothing on it but the Cork. How you ask. Well.. I had died with the cork on my cursor. Upon looting my body, I did not find the cork. I logged in later to find a body with only the cork on it. It rests there now outside Tipt.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;spawned 5 'a mountain pooka' on the group completely wiping us&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;If you were the only one around the Riddler, the only person the pooka's would've agroed on was you - your group would've been safe. The pookas spawn just inside the door, unagro. Given that clearly there were other people with agro range, and therefore within hail range, you probably had someone else trigger the ground items, causing a double spawn where you answered the wrong question. That said, Riddler is kinda buggy sometimes, but I've only had him foul up once in 30+ Tipt runs, that wasn't directly attributable to an easily identifiable user error.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Worst case, keep everyone well back, send in someone to trigger the door who can run a little way with 5 pookas on them, and just have them train inside to the left while the rest of your group runs in to the right.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I had&amp;nbsp;a similar&amp;nbsp;thing happen several months ago. (I mean like back in September or so.) We gave the correct item to the riddler&amp;nbsp;and got slain by all the pookas. We assumed it was because we had somehow messed it up by having the leader switched a couple of times in the middle of the instance, and that we had the wrong person handing in the item. We just did it all over again the next night. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I was SO glad to be finished with tipt and vxed instances, I can't TELL you how glad I am, I never have to go back, never ever ever ever. &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;Are you saying that a specific person must hand in the item? Not anyone on the expedition can hand in the item?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Is it the leader of the expedition?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Is it the person who requests the riddle?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Is it the group leader?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;That time around, I was none of the above. We also didn't play around with leadership changes on either the group or the expedition. The previous times I ran through Tipt, it was not necessarily any of the above that handed in the item but rather the person with enough room in their packs to hold the 15 items that are dropped by the riddler.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The second time you ran through it.. who handed in the item the first time? and who handed in the second time?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;For a fact, I remember a successful Tipt run where I had requested a riddle, but the tank handed in the item. The said tank also recieved the item back, but the Riddler did not trigger the pookas. It is just very wierd.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>I've witnessed it myself; handing in the correct item, then having pookas spawn anyway, while no other party members were nearby, and it was a known answer carefully given. While certainly at times people make mistakes, I've heard enough from reliable sources (and firsthand experience) to think that sometimes, perhaps on certain riddles, the riddler just doesn't like us.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I did a Tipt last night. At the Riddler, we gave the correct item (grapes in this case), and the door opened without pookas. However, I'm pretty sure I saw the riddler also say "I'm sorry Hrendra, I don't want this item, you can have it back" (or whatever that text is). Hren, did you see the same thing?&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;As to your questions, we didn't know. We just assumed it was something like that, that the leader had to answer the riddle, or that the person who had initially been the leader had to answer the riddle, or something. Since the person who had started the instance had given over leadership to someone else and gone to bed himself, and we had replaced him with a new member, and in the interim the leadership had changed hands a few times, we just figured that had to be why the riddler hated us... since we couldn't imagine the script being so CRUEL as to sometimes just not work for NO reason at all.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;But, maybe it was that way. Capricious riddler.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;hr&gt;HyI3I2iD wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;Two nights ago, I was leading an expedition through Tipt. After many hours of the climb up the mountain, we had finally made it to the Riddler. It was gettin late and we were so close to finishing and flagging some more guildies. We asked for our riddle. We recieved this as our riddle: "I help to mature your spirits. When I moisten I fulfill my purpose. Should I dry out, my task will fail and my quary may be worthless." Of the possible answers (the items strewn about the floor) we surmised the item the Riddler requested was for the Cork. To check we enlisted the help of other members from our guild and friends we knew. We also confirmed the answer on Allakhazam.com's spoiler site. &lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt; &lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;Great we thought. Handing in the Cork produced the right message we were looking for, denoting that the gate, in yellow, behind the Riddler had opened (paraphrasing) "You hear squeeling gears as the gate begins to open". But right underneath this, the Riddler also stated the message (again paraphrasing) "I do not require this item. Here you can take it back." Acting as if the Cork was not the item he required, and doing what the Riddler does when you turn in the wrong item: spawned 5 'a mountain pooka' on the group completely wiping us after a near 3 hour crawl up the mountain already littered with our corpses.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt; &lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;I had /petition'ed in game and recieved a message back stating I should /bug the problem and/or post here.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt; &lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;I tried /bug'ing but for some reason I could not state exactly what happened - I was unable to type in the /bug box.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt; &lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;So I am resorting to posting here in hopes that A) this is not a widespread problem, B) If it is, let it be known and possibly fixed, C) help my guildies find closure on this issue and not have to find some other ways in going around a possible broken Riddler. D) Find out if this has happened to anyone else.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt; &lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;Thank you,&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;~Keur Darkbones&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt; &lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;PS. This happened on the Druzzil Ro server, and I have not been back to Tipt since this occured because I just have not had the desire to go back yet and find out if this is to happen again.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;i did tipt 2 weeks ago with that exact riddle and it worked fine, i did not get cork back and no pooka's spawned.  maybe it was a bug after one of those patches?  you were not invis when you did turn in were you?&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Nedrom on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;03-11-2005&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;06:08 PM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;/bug used to be&amp;nbsp;a small little text window like /feedback is, but now is a larger window with pull down menus and buttons.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;You'll have to stretch out the window in order to see all of the options.&amp;nbsp; You'll find out that where you were trying to type is isn't a text entry area.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
