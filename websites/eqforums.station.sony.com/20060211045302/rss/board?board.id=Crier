&lt;P class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"&gt;Waitangi day is held each year on February 6&lt;SUP&gt;th&lt;/SUP&gt; to celebrate the Treaty of Waitangi, which is &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"&gt;â€™s founding document. The treaty was signed on &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"&gt;February 6&lt;SUP&gt;th&lt;/SUP&gt; 1840&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"&gt;!&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"&gt;History&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"&gt;The Treaty of Waitangi was signed on &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"&gt;February 6, 1840&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"&gt; in a marquee erected in the grounds of James Busby's house at Waitangi in the &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"&gt;Bay&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"&gt; of &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"&gt;Islands&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"&gt;. A draft of the treaty had been presented to the local Maori chiefs the previous day and Governor William Hobson had returned to his ship, HMS Herald, anchored in the bay, expecting the Maori to discuss the treaty for a day and possibly sign it on the morning of February 7. However, Maori had debated signing the treaty later into the night and appeared to have presumed the treaty would be signed in the morning of February 6 and did not have enough food to wait another day. Hobson was called ashore to sign the treaty just after &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"&gt;noon&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"&gt;, still dressed in his civilian clothes and only carried his uniform hat.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"&gt;Early Celebrations&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"&gt;The first Waitangi Day was not celebrated until 1934. In 1932, Governor-General, Lord Bledisloe and his wife had purchased and gifted to the nation the run-down house of James Busby, where the Treaty was signed. It was restored and the 1934 celebrations were a commemoration of the restoration.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"&gt;In 1940, the Waitangi treaty house and grounds featured prominently in the Centennial celebrations and annual celebrations were held there during the 1950s.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"&gt;Public &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"&gt;Holiday&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"&gt;Waitangi Day was proposed as a public holiday by the Labour Party in their 1957 party manifesto. After Labour won the election they were reluctant to create a new public holiday, so legislation was first passed in 1960 making it possible for a locality to substitute Waitangi Day as an alternative to an existing public holiday. In 1963, after a change in government, Waitangi Day was substituted for Auckland Anniversary Day as the provincial holiday in Northland.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"&gt; Day&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"&gt;Controversy and Protest&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"&gt;Although this is &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"&gt;'s national day, the commemoration has often been the focus of protest by Maori activists, and is often marred by controversy. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, Waitangi, and Waitangi Day became a focus of protest concerning treaty injustices. Claiming the "Treaty is a fraud" Maori activists called for the holiday not to be celebrated until the treaty was "honoured".&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"&gt;Several hundred protestors often gather at Waitangi. Although not part of the official celebrations, Maori sovereignty activists often attempt to fly the Maori Sovereignty flag from the flagstaff. These protests are generally contained by the Police, though few arrests are normally made. Attempts at vandalism of the flagstaff are often an objective of these protests, carrying on a tradition that dates from the 19th century when Maori chopped down flagstaffs as protests to land disputes.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"&gt;In 2004, protestors succeeded in flying the Maori Sovereignty flag above the other flags on the flagstaff by flying it from the top of a nearby tree. Some commentators described this gesture as audacious and bold.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"&gt;Celebrations&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"&gt;Most recently in 2003 and 2004 the anniversary was again officially commemorated at the treaty house at Waitangi where the treaty was first signed.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"&gt;There has also been a tendency in recent years for emphasis to shift from the Governor-General, as representative of the Crown, to the Prime Minister, as political leader. This however is contrary to the basic nature of the commemoration, which is of a treaty between the Crown and Maori.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"&gt;At Waitangi&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"&gt;Celebrations at Waitangi often commence the previous day, February 5th, at the Ngapuhi's Te Tii marae, where political dignatories are "welcomed" onto the marae and hear speeches from the local iwi. These speeches often deal with the issues of the day and vigorous and robust debate occurs.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"&gt;On Waitangi Day itself, at dawn, the New Zealand Navy raises the New Zealand Flag, Union Jack and White Ensign on the &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"&gt;Flagstaff&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"&gt; in the treaty grounds.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"&gt;The ceremonies during the day generally include a church service and cultural displays such as dance and song. Several waka and a navy ship also re-enact the calling ashore of Governor Hobson to sign the treaty.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"&gt;The day closes with the flags being lowered by the navy in a traditional ceremony.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"&gt;Elsewhere in &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"&gt;In recent years, communities throughout &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"&gt; have been celebrating Waitangi Day in a variety of ways. These often take the form of public concerts and festivals.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"&gt;Some marae use the day as an open day and an educational experience for their local communities, giving them the opportunity to experience Maori culture and protocol. Other marae use the day as an opportunity to explain where they see Maori are and the way forward for Maori in &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;Sprite -&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; Welcome to another great Stratics house of commons with the developers of EverQuest! Tonight's topic is the upcoming expansion: Prophecy of Ro. So please keep your questions to this topic. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sprite -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Please send those questions to [QT]Cale or [QT]Brekkee - to do so type /msg [QT]NICKNAME My question here. Please only send questions to our QT's as those sent to myself or the developers will not make it into the lineup. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sprite -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; The full logs will be posted on http://eq.stratics.com after the chat. We'll begin with a quick intro from our guests...now would be a good time to send in those questions! &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Rashere -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Good evening everyone. I'm Travis McGeathy, Lead Designer for EverQuest. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Maddoc -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Welcome everyone, I'm Jason Mash, an Assistant Lead Designer on the EverQuest Team. :) &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Vahlar -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Good evening! I'm Holly Longdale, EQ Designer. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Raghnell -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Hey everybody, I am Chris Lena, still Producer of EverQuest &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Rytan -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Hey everyone, Iâ€™m Ryan Barker assistant lead for the EverQuest design team. Generally responsible for spell and game system design and developement. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Ngreth -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Hello! Adam Bell - Associate Designer in charge of Tradeskills :) &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Vahlar -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Oh ya. Some call me the Lore Lady... &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sprite -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *Jenico* will this be the last expansion and how high do you forsee the level cap going up to? things...even things never tried in MMOs before. The level cap is always something we're looking as far as character advancement is concerned, so I can pretty safely say that we'll take players beyond level 70 at some point. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sprite -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *Kyden_ZEK* whats going on to prevent the use of MacroQuest2 on zek and other servers &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Rytan -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Although Zek is usually the place where much of the macroquest and other hacking issues are first seen, itâ€™s not the only place those types of exploits are happening. We have several members of the coding staff that spent a great deal of their time foiling hacker programs that can come up on any of the servers.. I canâ€™t speak to the specifics of our action plan, but I can tell you that we are committed to making EverQuest as hack free as w &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Raghnell -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Is Rytan ok? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Rytan -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Speaking from my personal PvP experience, nothing makes me madder then player using a hacker program to gain the upperhand. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Rytan -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; sorry guess I got cut off there "I canâ€™t speak to the specifics of our action plan, but I can tell you that we are committed to making EverQuest as hack free as we possibly can." &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sprite -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *jisahl_fennin* will the new mount have the same speed as the boar mount, or will this one be faster &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Rashere -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; For the Prophecy of Ro warhorse, I'm planning to allow you to turn in the claim item along with a normal bridle and receive a warhorse that moves at the speed of the horse summoned by that normal bridle. So, you can either use the base speed warhorse or get yourself a faster one through the turn in. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sprite -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *Croix_FV* Will progression through PoR be mainly instanced with some static content, like DoD, or mostly static content, like the PoP model? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Vahlar -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; The progression through this expansion is a pretty interesting blend. We've taken a different approach this time as there will be some competition in some access and progression quests mixed with instanced content so that at any given time guilds and players can advance in several different ways. You won't always need a raid to complete all parts of the progression. Groups will also find content that will allow them to progress and acce &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sprite -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *Adraun_Xegony* regarding the abilty to destroy walls. How exactly is this going to enhance gameplay. What purpose is in mind for destroyable walls? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Rashere -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; These new destructible terrain features are really all about interaction with the environment and letting players get more involved with the world around them. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Rashere -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; For instance, in one of the news zones, you can take out entire enemy encampments, tearing down their walls, tents, and even destroying their siege weapons as you drive them off the battlefield. You'll also find yourself assaulting a great keep, fending off enemies while you work to destroy the doors to the keep and gain access to the inner courtyard. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Rytan -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; plus kicking in a door is just cool. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sprite -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *Nemorath* Will PoR contain any new PC races? Specifically are there any plans for new athropomorphic races like the Vah Shir? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Vahlar -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; We're always looking at options to liven up the game and bring new content to new players and new options for our existing ones. So, yes, somewhere down the road it may happen, though we couldn't stick a date on it. As for the type of race, another race that's not strictly humanoid is always an option. Believe me, every time the subject comes up, there's a huge variety of suggestions. I won't tell you my favorite except to say that it &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Rytan -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; is bixies! &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Vahlar -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; ticked...and tocked. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sprite -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *Dexar* How many spells can we expect to see in PoR per casting class, and what level range will they be? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Rytan -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Each class is getting between 2-3 new spells and/or abilities in PoR. Several of these spells will be examples of the new trap and sphere of influence system that is also a part of this expansion. The method of acquisition will be similar to the one used in DoDH and will all be for level 70 characters. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sprite -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *Obsqura_AB* What kind of different high end raid type missions/tasks/expeditions will there be from the Theater of Blood? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Rashere -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; We're actually going old school with Theater of Blood. The zone is set up to be reminiscent of the old Plane of Fear, a zone that requires several groups to succeed in, but greatly rewards success. In addition, there are a number of raid encounters through the other expansion zones and several mini-boss encounters in Theater itself that lead up to the actual final raid instance in Deathknell. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sprite -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *Shroudy* Many of us are reaching the limits of shrouds and their abilities. To extend their usefullness and give us more reason to continue to play them, will Prophecy of Ro provide any expansion paths for Shrouds in the form of Gear or other abilities? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Rytan -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; We donâ€™t have any new shroud features planed for PoR, but we would like to expand their functionality in the near future. This would probably take the form of new shrouds that could be unlocked as higher tier shrouds, or even as quest rewards in some cases. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Rytan -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; There are however several new monster missions that are planned for PoR that use a variety of new monster types that we think players will very much enjoy. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sprite -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *Jenico* is it true that the skill level trival rate is going to be raised? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Ngreth -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; If you mean, will the tradeskill level cap be increased, we currently have no active plans to do so. That does not mean we will never raise the cap... &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sprite -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *Dexar* With monster missions making exp so easy to get, shouldn't we get more aa's in PoR? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Rashere -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; The XP gain from monster missions is tuned around them taking about an hour to complete and rewarding about an AA to someone at level 70. In that time, you could gain several AAs in other zones. The xp gain in a properly tuned monster mission is less than you'd get elsewhere. The problem we've run into is players finding ways to complete these missions far faster than intended. We're addressing those specific instances and will be adj &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Rashere -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; We're addressing those specific instances and will be adjusting the xp per mission to better fit how long they are actually taking. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sprite -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *ocher* What do raiding guilds have to look forward to in this new expansion?, and are the raids geared for anguish+ guilds ? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Vahlar -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; With each expansion we continue push the limits of the raiding guilds as much as we can to provide new challenges and events to conquer. And provide rewards. PoR is no different in that respect. Each expansion's end-content will always take you that next step in difficulty. You won't be disappointed. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sprite -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *slacklikeme-DB-DRo* Is the buff filter going to be similar to setup like the audio triggers? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Rashere -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; In order to block a future buff, all you'll need to do is click a buff you have on you and choose the "Block this buff in the future" option. From that point forward, that buff will not be able to land on you anymore. There's another window you can bring up that lists all the buffs you've blocked, so you can allow them to land again in the future if you like. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sprite -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *Tet* Some middle range players might feel a tad overwhelmed with the current number of AAs in the game and the levels, are you holding back on AAs because of this? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Rashere -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; In general, we try to do AAs every other expansion to allow time for people to catch up a bit. It's definitely intimidating to look at the ever growing list of AAs and realize how far you have to go to get them all. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sprite -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *oiingo* With the new expansion's release just around the corner, can we expect that the current version of the Demiplane of Blood is likely how the zone will remain? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Vahlar -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Yes, the zone will remain that way as part of the storyline for DoD. I will say though that PoR is an extension of the DoD storyline and Mayong's influence on the world is only just beginning. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sprite -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *chellethecat* Rumor had been that we would be seeing new a new class and possibly a new race with this expansion, but as this is not the case, is this something we might be able to look forward to at some point later on? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Rytan -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; A new race is definitely a possibility in the future, but I very much doubt that weâ€™ll be adding any more classes to EQ. Current class balance issues are complicated enough without adding yet another facet to an already incredibly complex system. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sprite -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *Yaxa* Lore question: Wasn'T Druzzil Ro orginally a Demi-God? When did she ascend to full godhood? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Vahlar -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Yes, Druzzil Ro was a demi-god, but through a variety of acts and developments over time that I don't have time to discuss here, she earned herself higher status. I will try to discuss this on the EQ Live lore boards if you want to post your question there as well. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sprite -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *[PVP]Pinhedd_ZS* the overall size of this expansion seems somewhat small, is there anything else being done in order to entice players into purchasing it? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Raghnell -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; With instancing the old way of using zone count as a measure of expansion size is becoming less accurate. There is a lot of content in this expansion. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Raghnell -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; That being said we are also adding entire new ways to use this content with traps and destructable objects. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Raghnell -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; We want to be careful about expanding the world too much in zone size and try to concentrate of adding depth. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sprite -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *Obsqura_AB* Are there any plans to put any alternate advancement points the Prophecy of Ro? I noticed that there was a post saying there might be a few. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Rashere -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; I'm considering adding a few new AAs to support and enhance the new features, like the player-set traps, but that would be the extent of it. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sprite -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *dendory* do you plan to redo all of the old world / kunark / velious? and increase the rate, since at the current pace we're looking at a 30 years process? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Rytan -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; We do plan to redo as many of the old zones as possible when we have time. However, we also feel that players also want new areas to explore, so itâ€™s a question of balancing resources. I think youâ€™ll be very happy with the improvements weâ€™ve made in the Ro desert for PoR. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Raghnell -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; I would like to add one thing. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Rytan -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Moving forward weâ€™ll most likely use that zone as the basis for what a revamp should look like. Assuming the feedback from the player base is as good as it has been so far in beta. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Raghnell -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Heck yeah we want to redo the whole world...but it might take a while. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Raghnell -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; But definitely expect more revamps this year &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sprite -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *Llaffer* Is something going to be done to make DoN Cultural silk tailoring more in-line with the rest of the materials? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Ngreth -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Yes. On the top of my "As soon as I have time" list, is the DoN cultural drop rate issue. So it will be the first thing I work on when I get a bit of time. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sprite -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *Kyvthulhu* It's been stated that Prophecy of Ro is going to feature the "come back of the gods", noteably mentioning Rallos Zek and Druzzil Ro, Rallos specifically asking for your aid against Sullon. Will there be advances in the story explaining Sullon's personal background? And will players who have factioned and now have maximum Mayong Mistmoore faction be allowed to aid him? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Vahlar -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; The gods have turned their attention back to their children and the mortals, but in the face of a threat to them and the world. You don't actually have the entire story in your question. What Norrathians are going to be asked to do is to make right what they made wrong. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Vahlar -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; This story goes far beyond Sullon Zek. It's a really interesting and involved story. And there are no plans to have anyone be able to side with Mayong in the near term. He's a threat to the future of Norrath for the moment and even though you might consider yourself an ally, he certainly doesn't see you the same way. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sprite -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *KyrosKran* Following up on Rashere's comment, will allowances be made for knights with holy/unholy steeds to obtain the new warhorse model? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Rashere -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; I'm hoping to be able to give knights a special upgrade to their signature mounts, but I'm not sure its going to work out yet so it will have to be a nice surprise if it does. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sprite -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *GneissGuy-Rathe* How does Prophecy of Ro fit in with the lore of the prior expansion? Where are these new lands and missions in relation to the rest of Norrath, and what's it got to do with Freeport? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Vahlar -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; This expansion was actually created a little differently than others in that it is a direct extension of the DoD story. Mayong's ascension is a great threat to all and parts of that story involve every zone in this expansion. Freeport was a good focal point for this story to launch from with a connection between the Academy of Arcane Sciences and Druzzil Ro and her Plane of Magic. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sprite -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *Egras_Zek* You mentioed a way to turn in old horse for new style with /claim. Is this also the case for the Glowing Drogmor and Seru Horse? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Rashere -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; I'm still debating on those. Those are loot items that represent a very specific creature, namely the fastest drogmor and horse available to most players, so I'm not sure if you should be able to turn those in and get a really fast warhorse instead. If you have a strong feeling about it either way, I'd encourage you to start up a thread on the EQLive forums and voice your opinion. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sprite -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *KyrosKran* PoP included the seer to allow you to track your progression. GoD and later do not have such a tool. Will there be some way to track your PoR progression, and do you plan to add in such methods of tracking for prior expansions? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Rashere -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; I'm still debating on those. Those are loot items that represent a very specific creature, namely the fastest drogmor and horse available to most players, so I'm not sure if you should be able to turn those in and get a really fast warhorse instead. If you have a strong feeling about it either way, I'd encourage you to start up a thread on the EQLive forums and voice your opinion. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Rashere -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; lets try a different one... &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Rashere -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; I don't think we've done anything nearly as complex as the PoP progression recently. It's a good idea, though, and something we'll look into. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sprite -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *knight1b* HIi what would be some reasons for me to buy PoR being a Non level 70 as it seems so far that all the content and new items/ablitys are going to be restriced to level 70 players &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Rashere -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; There's actually a sizeable amount of content in PoR for people below level 70. While the new zones themselves start at around level 50, we've also added quite a bit of new content to instances within Freeport that cater to a lower level crowd. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sprite -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *Elddar_Heart* question: How will the Elddar Forest be accessible? Isnt the former Forest now the desert? Thanks (love the lore in PoR keep it up) &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Vahlar -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; With Druzzil Ro actively intervening in the affairs of mortals, she has used her arcane power with the help of Tunare, to open a portal through time to the pristine Elddar Forest that existed prior to Solusek Ro raising the world and creating the Serpentspine Mountains and dry the forest. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sprite -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *Leni* hi, i played eq pre velious, and stopped around discord. when i left my char was deleted but i kept a 40ish sk on. i tried to come back but i found leveling nearly impossible, espically since i've moved onto wow. Has the level up progression to 60 (70 now i guess) been simplied towards more solo players, and is the game still gear based? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Rytan -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Seeing as how youâ€™ve been gone a while I think youâ€™ll find that thereâ€™s a number of features that weâ€™ve added along the way to make the game more enjoyable and in many ways easier to find a group. The monster mission and shroud system with DoDH is one thing youâ€™ll definitely want to look at as an option for grouping and gaining experience when you canâ€™t find like level players. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Rytan -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; In addition, we realize that there is a gap in the progression curve between 20 and 50 that we very much need to remedy. Weâ€™d like to provide a new progression path for players to move towards the upper levels of the game more easily and with more enjoyment. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Rytan -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; It's definitely a resource management issue, but we feel that it's very important to show new players all of the more advanced features that we've added to make EQ a better game over the years. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sprite -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; That will wrap it up for tonight. Iâ€™d like to thank the developers for coming! The log for tonightâ€™s chat will be up shortly on http://eq.stratics.com &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sprite -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Thank you all for joining us! You can join #EverQuest to chat more about the game. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Raghnell -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Thanks everybody! &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Ngreth -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Bye! Have a great evening! &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Vahlar -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Thanks! &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>Chinese New Year  - "Year of the Dog" - Starts Sunday January 29th</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Crier&amp;message.id=273#M273</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Chinese New Year starts with the New Moon on the first day of the new year and ends on the full moon 15 days later. The 15th day of the new year is called the Lantern Festival, which is celebrated at night with lantern displays and children carrying lanterns in a parade. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The Chinese calendar is based on a combination of lunar and solar movements. The lunar cycle is about 29.5 days. In order to "catch up" with the solar calendar the Chinese insert an extra month once every few years (seven years out of a 19-yearcycle). This is the same as adding an extra day on leap year. This is why, according to the solar calendar, the Chinese New Year falls on a different date each year.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;New Year's Eve and New Year's Day are celebrated as a family affair, a time of reunion and thanksgiving. The celebration was traditionally highlighted with a religious ceremony given in honor of Heaven and Earth, the gods of the household and the family ancestors. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The sacrifice to the ancestors, the most vital of all the rituals, united the living members with those who had passed away. Departed relatives are remembered with great respect because they were responsible for laying the foundations for the fortune and glory of the family. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The presence of the ancestors is acknowledged on New Year's Eve with a dinner arranged for them at the family banquet table. The spirits of the ancestors, together with the living, celebrate the onset of the New Year as one great community. The communal feast called "surrounding the stove" or weilu.

&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The 1st day of the Lunar New Year is "the welcoming of the gods of the heavens and earth".&amp;nbsp; Many people abstain from meat on the first day of the new year because it is believed that this will ensure long and happy lives for them.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;On the 2nd day, the Chinese pray to their ancestors as well as to all the gods. They are extra kind to dogs and feed them well as it is believed that the second day is the birthday of all dogs.&amp;nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;The 3rd and 4th days are for the sons-in-laws to pay respect to their parents-in-law. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The 5th day is called Po Woo. On that day people stay home to welcome the God of Wealth. No one visits families and friends on the fifth day because it will bring both parties bad luck. &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;On the 6th to the 10th day, the Chinese visit their relatives and friends freely. They also visit the temples to pray for good fortune and health. &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;The 7th day of the New Year is the day for farmers to display their produce. These farmers make a drink from seven types of vegetables to celebrate the occasion. The seventh day is also considered the birthday of human beings. Noodles are eaten to promote longevity and raw fish for success. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;On the 8th day the Fujian people have another family reunion dinner, and at midnight they pray to Tian Gong, the God of Heaven. &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;The 9th day is to make offerings to the Jade Emperor. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The 10th through the 12th are days that friends and relatives should be invited for dinner. After so much rich food, on the 13th day you should have simple rice congee and mustard greens (choi sum) to cleanse the system. &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;The 14th day should be for preparations to celebrate the Lantern Festival which is to be held on the 15th night.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV align=center&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV align=center&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT size=4&gt;***Taboos and Superstitions of Chinese New Year***&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;U&gt;House Cleaning&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The entire house should be cleaned before New Year's Day. On New Year's Eve, all brooms, brushes, dusters, dust pans and other cleaning equipment are put away. Sweeping or dusting should not be done on New Year's Day for fear that good fortune will be swept away. After New Year's Day, the floors may be swept. Beginning at the door, the dust and rubbish are swept to the middle of the parlor, then placed in the corners and not taken or thrown out until the fifth day. At no time should the rubbish in the corners be trampled upon. In sweeping, there is a superstition that if you sweep the dirt out over the threshold, you will sweep one of the family away. Also, to sweep the dust and dirt out of your house by the front entrance is to sweep away the good fortune of the family; it must always be swept inwards and then carried out, then no harm will follow. All dirt and rubbish must be taken out the back door. &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;U&gt;Bringing In the New Year and Expelling the Old&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Shooting off firecrackers on New Year's Eve is the Chinese way of sending out the old year and welcoming in the New Year. On the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve, every door in the house, and even windows, have to be open to allow the old year to go out. &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;EM&gt;New Year Activities Set Precedent&lt;/EM&gt; &lt;/U&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;All debts had to paid by this time. Nothing should be lent on this day, as anyone who does so will be lending all the year. Back when tinder and flint were used, no one would lend them on this day or give a light to others. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Everyone should refrain from using foul language and bad or unlucky words. Negative terms and the word "four" (Ssu), which sounds like the word for death, are not to be uttered. Death and dying are never mentioned and ghost stories are totally taboo. References to the past year are also avoided as everything should be turned toward the New Year and a new beginning. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If you cry on New Year's day, you will cry all through the year. Therefore, children are tolerated and are not spanked, even though they are mischievous. &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;U&gt;Personal Appearance and Cleanliness&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;On New Year's Day, we are not suppose to wash our hair because it would mean we would have washed away good luck for the New Year. Red clothing is preferred during this festive occasion. Red is considered a bright, happy color, sure to bring the wearer a sunny and bright future. It is believed that appearance and attitude during New Year's sets the tone for the rest of the year. Children and unmarried friends, as well as close relatives are given lai see, little red envelopes with crisp one dollar bills inserted, for good fortune. &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;U&gt;More New Year Superstitions&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;For those most superstitious, before leaving the house to call on others, the Almanac should be consulted to find the best time to leave the home and the direction which is most auspicious to head out.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The first person one meets and the first words heard are significant as to what the fortunes would be for the entire year. It is a lucky sign to see or hear songbirds or red-colored birds or swallows.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;It is considered unlucky to greet anyone in their bedroom so that is why everyone, even the sick, should get dressed and sit in the living room.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Do not use knives or scissors on New Year's Day as this may cut off fortune.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;While many Chinese people today may not believe in these do's and don'ts, these traditions and customs are still practiced. These traditions and customs are kept because most families realize that it is these very traditions, whether believed or not, that provide continuity with the past and provide the family with an identity.&amp;nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV align=center&gt;&lt;FONT size=4&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;***Traditional New Year Foods&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; ***&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Probably more food is consumed during the New Year celebrations than any other time of the year. Vast amounts of traditional food is prepared for family and friends, as well as those close to us who have died.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;On New Year's Day, the Chinese family will eat a vegetarian dish called jai. Although the various ingredients in jai are root vegetables or fibrous vegetables, many people attribute various superstitious aspects to them: &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;* Lotus seed - signify having many male offspring &lt;BR&gt;* Ginkgo nut - represents silver ingots &lt;BR&gt;* Black moss seaweed - is a homonym for exceeding in wealth&lt;BR&gt;* Dried bean curd is another homonym for fulfillment of wealth and happiness &lt;BR&gt;* Bamboo shoots - is a term which sounds like "wishing that everything would be well"&lt;BR&gt;* Fresh bean curd or tofu is not included as it is white and unlucky for New Year as the color signifies death and misfortune. &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Other foods include a whole fish, to represent togetherness and abundance, and a chicken for prosperity. The chicken must be presented with a head, tail and feet to symbolize completeness. Noodles should be uncut, as they represent long life. &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;In south China, the favorite and most typical dishes were nian gao, sweet steamed glutinous rice pudding and zong zi (glutinous rice wrapped up in reed leaves), another popular delicacy. &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;In the north, steamed-wheat bread (man tou) and small meat dumplings were the preferred food. The tremendous amount of food prepared at this time was meant to symbolize abundance and wealth for the household. &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV align=center&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT size=4&gt;***Chinese New Year Decorations***&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Prior to New Year's Day, Chinese families decorate their living rooms with vases of pretty blossoms, platters of oranges and tangerines and a candy tray with eight varieties of dried sweet fruit. On walls and doors are poetic couplets, happy wishes written on red paper. These messages sound better than the typical fortune cookie messages. For instance, "May you enjoy continuous good health" and "May the Star of Happiness, the Star of Wealth and the Star of Longevity shine on you" are especially positive couplets. &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;U&gt;Plants and Flowers&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Every traditional Chinese household should also have live blooming plants to symbolize rebirth and new growth. Flowers are believed to be symbolic of wealth and high positions in one's career. Lucky is the home with a plant that blooms on New Year's Day, for that foretells a year of prosperity. In more elaborate settings, plum blossoms just starting to bloom are arranged with bamboo and pine sprigs, the grouping symbolizing friends &amp;amp;endash; the plum blossom also signifies reliability and perseverance; the bamboo is known for its compatibility, its utility and its flexible stems for furniture and other articles;the evergreen pine evokes longevity and steadiness. Other highly prized flowers are the pussy willow,azalea, peony and water lily or narcissus.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The Chinese firmly believe that without flowers, there would be no formation of any fruits. Therefore, it is of the utmost importance to have flowers and floral decorations.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;They are the emblems of reawakening of nature, they are also intimately connected with superstition and with the wish for happiness during the ensuing year. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;U&gt;Oranges and Tangerines&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Etiquette dictates that you must bring a bag of oranges and tangerines and enclose a lai see when visiting family or friends anytime during the two-week long Chinese New Year celebration. Tangerines with leaves intact assure that one's relationship with the other remains secure. For newlyweds, this represents the branching of the couple into a family with many children. Oranges and tangerines are symbols for abundant happiness. &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;U&gt;Candy Tray&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The candy tray arranged in either a circle or octagon is called "The Tray of Togetherness" and has a dazzling array of candy to start the New Year sweetly. After taking several pieces of candy from the tray, adults places a red envelope (lai see) on the center compartment of the tray. Each item represents some kind of good fortune. &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;* Candied melon - growth and good health&lt;BR&gt;* Red melon seed - dyed red to symbolize joy,happiness, truth and sincerity &lt;BR&gt;* Lychee nut - strong family relationships&lt;BR&gt;* Cumquat - prosperity (gold)&lt;BR&gt;* Coconut - togetherness&lt;BR&gt;* Peanuts - long life&lt;BR&gt;* Longnan - many good sons&lt;BR&gt;* Lotus seed - many children &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt"&gt;January 26th is Australia Day!&amp;nbsp; This national holiday is the biggest holiday in Australia.&amp;nbsp; On this day, Australians celebrate their national heritage, remembering what is great about their culture, their community and to make a commitment for the future.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;As described on the official site:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt"&gt;During the early nineteenth century the anniversary was called 'Foundation Day' and was usually marked by sporting events. Horseracing was popular in the 1820s, whilst regattas became popular in the 1830s.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;One of these, the Anniversary Regatta which was first held in 1836, is still held on Sydney Harbor on January 26 each year. Now called the Australia Day Regatta it is the oldest continuous regatta in the world.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A growing sense of patriotism was also being expressed in other ways. In 1824 Charles Tompson, reputed to be our first Australia-born poet, composed Wild Notes from the Lyre of a Native Minstrel.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Fifty years after Phillip landed Australia's first public holiday was announced to celebrate Foundation Day 1838. The inaugural holiday became an annual event and has continued to be held on or around January 26.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Hello,&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;We sincerely apologize again for the problems caused in response to Wednesdayâ€™s update.&amp;nbsp; We do understand that many characters were rolled back due to actions beyond their control along with those that took direct advantage of the situation.&amp;nbsp; We also understand that many other players that were not rolled back were also affected in indirect ways.&amp;nbsp; This weekend we will be offering double experience to all players.&amp;nbsp; This will require us to take down the servers early tomorrow morning and they should be up and offering the modified experience at 9am PST.&amp;nbsp; This event will run until Monday morning at 10am PST.&amp;nbsp; Once again please accept our apologies for any interruptions this has caused in your playtime.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;Hello everyone,&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;We have now completed our last group of character restores in regards to the update issue that occurred on the morning of January 18th.&amp;nbsp; Before I go into the details let me start by giving our apologies to all of those that were unknowingly affected by the correction of our error.&amp;nbsp; We did feel that we needed to be aggressive in dealing with this issue.&amp;nbsp; I also hope that everyone can understand that we needed to be vague on the details while our actions were being taken.&amp;nbsp; However, now that it is complete let me take a moment and explain our solutions.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;The summary is that we rolled back any character that had traded with the Beta merchants from our Prophecy of Ro testing server.&amp;nbsp; We also rolled back characters that had traded with those ground zero characters as well as any subsequent traders along down the line. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;Taking a step back I will start with the morning of the update.&amp;nbsp; During the beta testing of an expansion we will have a number of NPCs available to facilitate the testing of new tradeskill recipes.&amp;nbsp; Since the point is to actually test recipes and combines the items are free or extremely cheap.&amp;nbsp; Unfortunately, due to a data error, these 25 NPCs with 1,530 items ended up on the live servers.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; As soon as we realized the issue we removed the NPCs from the Plane of Knowledge.&amp;nbsp; We decided not to take down the servers until we fully understood the situation and its ramifications.&amp;nbsp; This was the approach that we continued to take throughout the day â€“ slow, steady, and methodical.&amp;nbsp; After researching and tracking both the players and items we crafted a solution that would not require server downtime and would only affect a small percentage of our overall population.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;We began with the characters that purchased items directly from the Beta merchants taking the time to exclude those people that only purchased harmless items such as water.&amp;nbsp; We also excluded anyone who only sold to those merchants.&amp;nbsp; After that we expanded to those that traded with those characters and iterated down the chain to include all trades.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; We felt that we had to widen the web in this way to prevent a number of secondary methods of dealing with these ill-gotten items such as trading the results of tradeskill combines.&amp;nbsp; At this point we understand that we are directly affecting players that might have had no knowledge of the source of these items or results of these items.&amp;nbsp; However, we believe it was necessary to take this aggressive step to maintain the integrity of the economy.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;Soon thereafter we expanded our investigation to the other sources such as guild bank, shared bank, bazaar transactions, and other more obscure possibilities.&amp;nbsp; This afternoon we ended with a final sweep of all areas to ensure that we conducted as thorough of a clean up as possible.&amp;nbsp; We did this in a step by step manner so that we could keep an eye on the number of characters affected, maintain a high level of thoroughness, and minimize any chance of errors.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;I have also seen a number of people suggest that we should have taken down the servers and rolled back every active character on every server.&amp;nbsp; That was my first thought as well but once you get into the details you can see that this would not have been the best course of action.&amp;nbsp; Primarily, every character would have lost their play time instead of the small percentage that was involved.&amp;nbsp; Also, keep in mind that any rollback or restore has a small chance of an error and rolling back that number of characters would have magnified those exceptions to an unacceptable degree.&amp;nbsp; After going through this process over the last 24 hours and seeing the results I am confident that we took the best course of action under the circumstances.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;The result is that the integrity of the economy has been maintained while touching less than 1% of the character population of EverQuest.&amp;nbsp; The majority of the EverQuest population was able to enjoy the game normally with zero server downtime and no loss of play time.&amp;nbsp; We do understand that this might not matter to those of you that were rolled back and for that we apologize.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;In conclusion, there are two known issues with the rollbacks regarding guild membership status and missing corpse issues that may have affected some customers.&amp;nbsp; Customer Service will be assisting with these specific known issues, but will not be assisting with requests for reimbursement of items, coin, experience, AAâ€™s, or flags that were removed due to the character rollbacks.&amp;nbsp; If your character is having problems joining or being removed from a guild or if your character appears to be missing a corpse, please submit a petition under the appropriate category and they will assist you as quickly as possible.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;Thank you for your patience,&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;This morning we had an error with the update that resulted in merchants, and subsequent items, in the Plane of Knowledge that should not have been appearing in the world. &amp;nbsp;In order to address this we will be performing selective and aggressive rollbacks of certain characters throughout the day. &amp;nbsp;There will be multiple phases and some characters may be subject to multiple adjustments. &amp;nbsp;If you believe that you have been involved in any way (even indirectly) then please consider holding off your playtime until tomorrow. &amp;nbsp;We apologize for the inconvenience and we are resolving this in the most complete way possible while minimizing the impact on the majority of the customers.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
