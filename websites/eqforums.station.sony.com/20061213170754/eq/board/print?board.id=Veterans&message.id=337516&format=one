<P>I'm not sure if you're referring to the raids or the single-group trials.</P>
<P>As someone mentioned earlier, "trials" wouldn't necessarily make sense in every expansion because the lore doesn't always&nbsp;center around an individual that poses challenges&nbsp;to those who wish to prove themselves.&nbsp; That said, we do&nbsp;have scripted raid encounters every expansion with mechanics that aren't dissimilar to the MPG raids.&nbsp; The difference between Hatchet the Torturer and the Trial of Adaptation is primarily lore. <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0></P>
<P>I liked <EM>almost</EM> everything about the single-group&nbsp;MPG trials.&nbsp; They were challenging, hand-crafted, unique events that required careful and sometimes unusual tactics.&nbsp; My problem with them was that the rewards were substantial... maybe a little too substantial.&nbsp; High level spells, a permanent increase to the resistances hardcap and some incredibly good gear.&nbsp; And I suspect this spike in itemization is one of the main reasons why they were so fondly remembered.&nbsp; Ask yourself, and be completely honest, if the events would have been so popular if the rewards were a shade or two less powerful.</P><BR>

<P><BR>However, the beauty lied in that the gear was one of the draws, and imho, not completely out of line with the difficulty. The gear was also only three items per trial, and didn't have massive mods or anything. I thought they were exceptionally well thought out and would love to see ideas like this continue.</P>
<P>I've completed all six individual trials, and probably the only one which I felt needed to be more difficult at the time was destruction.&nbsp;The raid trials are.. well, Hatred is too easy, simply put. Considering it drops the best visible slot (legs) its considerably easier than all the other trials (with the possible exception of Foresight if your raid pays attention easily, or specialization if you have a bunch of good group healers).</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Of course, i'm biased, since oow is my favourite expansion =p</P>
