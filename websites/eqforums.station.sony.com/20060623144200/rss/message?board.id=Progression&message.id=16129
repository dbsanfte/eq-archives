    <title>Rambling on the Combine mindset</title>

    <description>The combine boads started out with some real positive sentiments that we seem to be losing.&amp;nbsp; The number of confrontational rather than constructive posts seem to be growing in the past week or so.&amp;nbsp; Not so good to see.&amp;nbsp; A lot of it seems to be coming out of frustration where the 'vision' of combine isn't what some want/hoped to see.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think the mindset needed for tackling the beta, and thinking if the Combine server is for you is that&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0033"&gt;This is a new player (non-transfer) server with a twist.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is &lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;not classic eq&lt;/font&gt;, nor is it a zek, or an RP server.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yes the first month or two is likely to see the server with only the original zones, but this will change pretty rapidly, and the further expansions will be opened.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;My guess is that the expansion openings will happen at the rate of the guild(s) with the highest level of organisation and playtime.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;I think it true that all semblence to 'classic' eq will have a pretty short lifespan.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;I think that those who really enjoy the original zones have the option on every single server of concentrating their playtime of playing where they want to play, using whatever restrictions they enjoy.&amp;nbsp; What I suspect I see in some posts is a call to force everyone into a particular playstyle to fit the 'vision' of a few individuals, based on the premise that this server is some 'second-chance' at progressing with the content rather than playing 'catch-up' all the time.&amp;nbsp; It probably will be for some, but I think its inevitable that quite a few of those approaching this game with a 'classic-eq' mindset are in for a dissappointment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I really hope that people enjoy the Combine for what it will be, and help test it so that the balance in PvE is about right, and not trivialised with the odd over/under powered encounter/loot/class ability.&amp;nbsp; I suspect that those who are logging in to re-live some earlier 'original-eq' experience are probably selling themselves a bit short.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Combine has the promise of something a whole lot more than that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;Don't worry about it.&amp;nbsp; These boards are just an outlet for bored people.&amp;nbsp; Look at my post count, lol!&amp;nbsp; All of em made on this board within the last 5 weeks or so.&amp;nbsp; When the server is released, am I ever gonna post here again?&amp;nbsp; I strongly doubt it.</description>

      <description>I'm here to be able to play EQ on equal footing with everyone else instead of being 6 years behind. The "classicness" of the server is unimportant to me. Having the opportunity to play through content that most people had long since abandoned by the time that I originally came into the game is the icing on the cake. :)</description>
