    <title>Did circle strafe backstabbing get nerfed?</title>
    <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=roguebalance&amp;message.id=4773</link>
    <description>I quit a while back, and I'm not back into EQ.&amp;nbsp; I recently decided&#xD;
to play one of my old rogues.&amp;nbsp; I tried to "circle strafe backstab"&#xD;
some mobs, but found I couldn't do it anymore.&amp;nbsp; Did they nerf this&#xD;
(i.e. prevent it) or am I just screwing it up (it's been a while, so&#xD;
this is also possible)?&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
If you don't know what I'm talking about, it's a form of circling&#xD;
around a mob so that you're always facing it, but if you do it fast&#xD;
enough you can backstab mobs that are attacking you.&amp;nbsp; I used to do&#xD;
it before I quit, and I know a couple of friends who used to do it as&#xD;
well (but they aren't playing anymore either).&lt;br&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I know what you're talking about Garebear. I used to use this tactic as well back in the day (recently returned to playing myself). I've noticed that it doesn't work the way it used to. As I understand/understood the tactic, the idea is to get into a position that exposes a weakened AC area on the MOB. Used to be this "weakened" area was easy to hit either by skilled positioning, or lag... you pick.&amp;nbsp;Not so anymore, at least thats been my experience. I've played my 44 SK and started several new melees, including a Rogue, and they all show the same results. Circle Strafe just doesn't work any longer.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Mmmm, I'll try that.&amp;nbsp; Although I think I used to do it on melees (although it was a LONG time ago that I last played a rogue, so my memory may be tricking me).&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;that wouldn't make sense in eq, melee npc's are always facing you, they wouldn't just stand there and wait for you to stab them in the back like a caster.&amp;nbsp; casters stand there till the spell they are casting goes off then either casts another one or goes back to facing you and swinging there fists.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Guess I was maybe mistaken.&amp;nbsp; I thought I was able to do it to melees because of the semi-glitchy movement where they don't rotate as you move around them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
