    <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I spoke with Raghnell and Rashere today.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;It is looking more like I just have not addressed it properly to the correct people.&amp;nbsp; I have not yet been promised some time to do this, but I have communicated that it is important, and I got indication that they will consider allocating some time for it when they make the upcoming schedule.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;So It does look like it is a good portion my fault for not addressing it properly.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;As I have indicated, I still do not have an ETA yet, but I wanted to keep you up to date on this because I believe it is important.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Unfortunately I have no ETA, and will no longer be giving an ETA, nor answering questions about it (I don't have time to answer the same question over and over again, even if it is phrased differently).&amp;nbsp; I will no longer say anything until the work is actually done and awaiting&amp;nbsp;a patch so that I am no longer getting any hopes up.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I want to fix this.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I believe it is important to fix.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I have failed to convince my bosses of this.&amp;nbsp; This may be my fault at not presenting my case properly.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I will continue to try and get some time to fix this, as I do want to fix it.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ngreth,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Is it just me? or is there NOONE complaining about Expert or Journeyman material drop rates?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    There's nothing wrong with GM material drop rates ... sure, GM armors may have a skillup mod, but how many people actually attempt GM armors expecting a higher skillup chance? IMHO, increased (10%?) skillup chance on GM armors is moot ... people only make them for 2 reasons ,,, profit or friends.  And there's NOTHING wrong with coarse silk drop rates, even requiring 2 to make a swatch .... the only problem is that people cannot get others to do spider missions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    As for Master materials, having a plethora of 250+ smiths and tailors ... there's only 2 that really come to mind as far as rarity .... Great Reptile Hides and Storm Volaas Hair.  Sure, I hear if you get a high caliber raid to kill dragon (plus other key parts) you can get into Veeshan's Peak and get hides and teeth readily.  What other Master materials require access to a keyed zone which requires a raid to access?  Yes, I know teeth were added to PoN and PoE crocs (at a much lower frequency as stated in the patch msg when they went Live) ... and that hides were also added to CT raptors (all 6 mobs?) at the same reduced alternate access rate.  As for volaas hairs, Master armor is designed for lvl 55-60 ... and to even find a group capable of farming PoS water giants in that lvl range ,,, &amp;lt;chuckle&amp;gt; ,,,  otherwise, I see no problem with Master drop rates for the most part ... yes, they aren't intended as a skillup route (at least not a universally equal one, as based on drop rates) but for some races they are.   We've got a Joe_Trader with over 130 pile of gravel for sale ... now, if he also didn't sell cultural made from it, it'd be easy to write him off as another random markup artist. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Personally, I see noone complaining about Journeyman or Expert material drop rates .... all the complaints really boil down into 2 categories ,,, I) Master materials don't drop as often for my race as for others, so I'm restricted on DoN Master as a skillup route ... or II) GM materials (MDS/GDH) drop too rarely for me to attempt armor to sell for a profit or make cheaply for personal use (just search for 'grandmaster' in Bazaar, sometime, if you wanna laugh at 'low drop rates').   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   Love your work and contributions, Ngreth .. just FYI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EW&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I have seen plenty of complaints about it, and it is on my list :)&amp;nbsp; I will be evaluating the WHOLE range... that is the reason I need so much time to work on it.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>personally, I've found tha coarse silk is quite a bit better drop rate than the scales/hides, but since noone does those missions they sell for more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;for quite a while we were farming to sell and buying Metallic drake scales&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;my only beef is with the inaccassibility of the great reptile teeth with the stupidly rare drop on the accessable ones.. &lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;hr&gt;Morkai_AlMandragon wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;i hate to be an ass but **SMURF** cant you push out the things that are so glaringly obvious its just plain STUPID.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Coarse silk for example.

This should be a priority fix since in addition to two silks need per swatch, they are also used for cultural pottery charms. The demand is high but the supply is very low, and something should be done about it soon. I've heard many ideas about fixing them, but I'll add my own. Have them drop off Lavaspinners in Lavaspinners Lair. Hunting there for my grandmaster symbol quest, I do not recall seeing one drop off those spiders either.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Matthyas on &lt;span class="date_text"&gt;04-22-2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;09:15 PM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;well Jay, if youve had more luck than every tradeskiller i know in EQ, thats great, care to share where the hell your getting them at a decent drop raite. Ive done almost every DoN mission there is for goups, and have seen ONE silk, EVER.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I have made all of 4 GM silk items, and DOZENS of plate items.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;yup, it was DCS.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We averaged pretty much one drop for each mission, as opposed to getting a every 2nd or 3rd Blackwing or Creator.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I only did one or 2 of the missions; mage in the guild did them regularily for a bit, and after making her robe was the one suggesting that we sell them and buy scales.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;hr&gt;Wyora wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;hr&gt;Morkai_AlMandragon wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;well Jay, if youve had more luck than every tradeskiller i know in EQ, thats great, care to share where the hell your getting them at a decent drop raite.

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Given some of the implementations I have seen, particularly recently, as well as the feedback both from Ngreth and from other tradeskill Dev's as well as other Dev's, I do blame the bosses.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I am losing faith in their ability to make sound judgements. The fact that SoE is looking for a new itemization chief suggests that those bosses' bosses may recognize that too, since tradeskills are very much tied in with itemization.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Pure speculation of course, but it is quite possible that there is some sort of moritorium on any changes, pending the hiring&amp;nbsp;of someone to the new post.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Ngreth? Regardless of whatever the politics are behind all this, hang in there, be brave, and keep up the good work as best you can. I've not agreed with everything you have done as a Dev, but frankly very much appreciate your candor and your work overall.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;How could it not be an itemization issue? If item design and frequency are treated as independant, on what basis are they balanced? &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;As I recall, the job description called for someone to cover all aspects of itemization, ie, the kind of holistic approach that should have been there all along. If that is not the case, if they are really just looking for someone to 'make pretty items' and let others sort out where they fit in the scheme of things, including drop rates, etc., then this is just more of the same old mess.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
