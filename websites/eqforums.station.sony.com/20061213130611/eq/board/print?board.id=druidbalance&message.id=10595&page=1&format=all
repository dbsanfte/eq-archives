<P>Sure 90k if every&nbsp;silk class and priest class in the raid runs into melee range to get smacked.&nbsp; Last time i checked that seems like a pretty poor strategy to win.&nbsp; You figure thats about half your raid.&nbsp; So you could feesably do a 45k barkspur.&nbsp; Thats what 2&nbsp;mana burns? and its going to involve half your raid getting smacked 8 times by AE ramp which involves a risk of death.&nbsp; Also its going to involve a lot of cordination and time from multiple druids.&nbsp; Use of precious buff slots and be unusable on any raid with adds or no AE ramp.&nbsp; <BR></P>
<P>A couple AAs spent on 2 wizards has the same effect and it has much less risk and management involved to complete.&nbsp; I doubt by raid leader would even endorse such a tactic and probably laugh at me for suggesting it.&nbsp; In exchange this spell is now useful in groups - because right now i only use it for powerleveling.</P>

<P><BR>Two top wizzies in my guild say they&nbsp;rarely run oom anymore, and they regularly are criting for 20-36K.</P>
<P>The more I thought of it last night, the op was right, you are not going to get your casters in range do do the damage, so realistically the most you are going to do is 45K of damage on a one shot deal.&nbsp;&nbsp; Look at the damage a zerker, monk, shammy's panther, wizzy, nec, mage dishes out in a typical raid 3-7 minute fight and&nbsp;20-25&nbsp;people meleeing&nbsp;x 1680 damage or 45K is not that much damage. I think the person who posted this was not even considering raids when they did so, as I was not until Prathun responded.</P>
<P>Still we got so many issues now, while I'ld like to see the duration and/or the max damage cap eliminated (or some combo thereof (ie 5 minute duration with higher cap, 3 minutes with no cap, whatever),&nbsp; we got so many bug fixes, behind the time spell set, missing spells, aa usefulness and cost issues, debuff&nbsp;and dps issues that I would lke to see those addressed (granted some adjjustment to this spell is in order as it is too limited and wimpy to be used as is 95% of the time.</P>
<P>Don't expect Prathun to respond to the requests guys, just hope he read through the rest of the threads and hopefully past the infighting/vendetta wars to the meat that is in there.</P>
<P>To the shammy who tried to compare SotQ vs Equinox burn, your post was already concisely responded too.&nbsp; Load two different nukes and&nbsp; wahlaa!!!&nbsp; Should we also mention the dot comparison, the fact you got a "decen" pet?</P>

				Just saying the comparison between mana burn and this DS are both far fetched comparisons and not really tactical use things in the manors being suggested. Considering mana burn line of AA's is still real costly and not as productive as actual practical use.<br><br>

<P>Ok, so the community thinks 18s isn't long enough to guarantee full effect, and obviously 15 minutes means buffing entire raids...</P>
<P>so wouldn't the logical step be like... <STRONG>36s</STRONG> so that the most a Druid could buff is two people at a time, while doubling the amount of time the effect will stay in place?</P>

<P>90k wouldnt drop yarlir like a rock.&nbsp; 90k might move her down to 99%.&nbsp; Wizards Pre TSS were criting 20k nukes - over the course of a yarlir fight any wizard worth his snuff is doing well over 90k.</P>

				I understand why Prathun says that, since it is additive dps on top of
what the raid is already executing and will further surpress regen
such, with the combined total, would take AE rampers down much faster
than intended. Don't forget since it stacks with Slot1 (that a mage can
just mgb) and all other slot DSes from clickies/songs, factor in RDS
dps (since its silly not to RDS AE rampers for extra damage), Prat is
right saying it would be too much. Don't get me wrong, I love my damage
shields, but note that he did say "in a matter of seconds" which is
exagerated some, but assuming 25 people on a raid are taking ~4 ae ramp
hits per AE ramp session at a constant, it would only take 4-5 AE ramp
sessions just for 90k damage to happen (and in fact total melees on
raids is likely higher than that in most cases).<br>
<br>
I'm also not arguing that it could become a better spell, but I just want to contradict one statement:<br>
"<i>You know it would be kind of cool if druid could be game affecting on raids in a non healing role once more.</i>"<br>
<br>
You have it, it's called ATK reduction, and this has such an important
role on a magnitude of raid mobs that I am stunned that it would be
said that it is not game affecting in any way on raids- your attack
debuffs cumulatively do more than the majority of any warrior's AC put
together in terms of mitigation benefit, not to mention the resist / ac
debuff components some of them have too, which all help. ATK / AC
reduction should be, and are the druidic definitory unique spells such
that really, you guys should get a cold attack debuff spell/line for
those fire resistants/immunes. Atk moreso, but I'm not kidding. We've
delayed raids when we have had 0 druids online until one logs on just
for their benefit from buffs and debuffs alone (as well as their
healing, but you said, non-healing roles once more).<br>

trial.&nbsp; The reason this spell is so useless has several
factors.&nbsp; Cast time, recast time, capped hit limit,

<DIV><BR>I could understand that as well but the problem is it only answers a suggestion that was probably overblown to begin with.&nbsp;&nbsp; Barkspur doesn't need a 15minute duration, a much lower but better duration would just as fine.&nbsp; Hell adding another 6seconds would go a long way since it makes foci and aa apply.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>But&nbsp;barkspur is 300mana, 210ds with a max 8hits (so 1680dmg unresistable but unmodable dmg) 3 sec cast time 13sec recast...&nbsp; Offhand, what's the bonus of this spell? Low mana, unresistable dmg, fast cast time -- how does that compare though?&nbsp;&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Dmg per cast: Barkspur 1680 | Dawnstrike 2125 (+mods and crits)&nbsp;|&nbsp;Solstice strike 2201 (+mods and crits) | Ancient glacier frost 2042 (+mods and crits)... no bonus for barkspur over any other spell.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Dmg per mana: Barkspur 1680/300 = 5.6 | Dawnstrike 2125/482 = 4.5 ... Dawnstrike needs a 25% bonus to be as effecient as barkspur, max crit rate at the time was&nbsp;over 20% iirc,&nbsp;dragon fire would avg out to 25%, dawnstrike's bonus by itself avg'd out to a 12.5% bonus iirc. | Solstice strike 2201/494 = 4.45 .. same note as Dawnstrike | AGF&nbsp; 2042/405 = 5 .. a 10% mod would make agf rival barkspur's mana effieciency.... Any bonus barkspur has on paper is quickly lost in practice.&nbsp; Again no real advantage to casting that over another spell.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Cast time: 3sec with a 23% haste brings the cast time down to 2.3sec cast time.&nbsp;&nbsp; Dawnstrike 4.7&nbsp; Solstice strike 4.2&nbsp; Ancient glacier frost 4.3 ... as a form of quick dmg the difference is 2 to 2.4 seconds.&nbsp; 8 max hits would suggest it would at best take 2 rounds on a mob that quads and that there be no misses at all under 2seconds to beat a nuke as a form of fast dmg.&nbsp; Again no advantage for barkspur in practice.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Resistability... Barkspur Unresistable | Dawnstrike + solstice vs. fire (can be debuffed 112pts) | AGV vs. cold (could be debuffed 55pts at the time) .. Advantage technically goes to barkspur, how ever in practice the instances where resists are really issue for a class able to debuff vs. their primary elements are limited to mobs that have very strong resists to both fire and cold... Offhand that's like M'sha's, Txevu Zun, PVP, someone mentioned an mpg trial though I never really noticed that.. all in all resists normally aren't that much of an issue so it ends up again, not that much of a practical advantage for barkspur.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>So how else can Barkspur be usefull outside of pvp and txevu zun?&nbsp; If the dev's had a specific plan for it I'd love to hear it (I believe the guy that made the spell isn't around anymore though?) but as a player the only viable use I could see for it in normal grping situations is as concurrent dmg.&nbsp; It does it's dmg over time and doesn't require a mob in camp to be cast so it could be put onto the tank before the mob gets to camp and hopefully do it's dmg as the druid debuffs / starts to nuke.&nbsp;&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>To do that well though you have to cast it 5 secs before the mob arrives.. earlier if you want to cast debuffs as the mob is inc.&nbsp; So say you're really on the ball with timing, you cast bark spur -&gt; 2.25sec gem refresh -&gt; hand of ro on the mob as it's inc (2.5sec) -&gt; 2.25sec gem refresh -&gt; Mob is in camp, tank picks it up and you can start nuking right away for further debuff... but take that situation, by the time the mob is in camp and on the tank 7secs have past.&nbsp;&nbsp; Barkspur lasts 18seconds so 11secs left on it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Lets say your avg mob has a 50% hit rate (the raid parses on my guilds boards offhand look like they lean more towards 40% so that should be more than fair), that would mean it'd take 16swings to actually use all of barkspur.&nbsp;&nbsp; 4 rounds if a mob quads, 6 if it triples, 8 if it doubles.&nbsp;&nbsp; That means those mobs would need a 2.75s / 1.8sec / and 1.38s dly between rounds respectively to fully utilize barkspur as concurrent dmg.&nbsp;&nbsp; How likely really are those situations in grps?</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The easy solution to that is to up the duration on it... does it have to be 15minutes? no.&nbsp;&nbsp; 15mins for 300 mana is dumb.&nbsp;&nbsp; If by chance you cast it and no mobs are inc for 2minutes + for some reason you're not going to mourn losing 300mana after all that time.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ideally I think the duration should end up being around 48sec (the original 18sec +30sec leeway time) to a minute.&nbsp;&nbsp; Bumping it up to 24seconds&nbsp; will go a long way b/c then aa and foci can apply to it that would in effect make it's duration 7 ticks/42sec.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Ultimately I'd say at the very least make it 30seconds duration.. That would mean any druid with the appropriate aa's and I believe any&nbsp;extention mod would get 48seconds (note: mage's equivalent spell has 24seconds + mod to do half the hits required of barkspur) duration on barkspur.&nbsp;&nbsp; A druid with the very best duration would have barkspur last 54seconds.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>If that worst case scenario druid &nbsp;tried using barkspur like prathun suggested he'd at max be able to keep it on&nbsp;4 ppl till engage, and by that time it'd be close to wearing off of the first.&nbsp;&nbsp; So at worst if one of the few negliable ae ramp mobs where to hit all 4 before it wore off on them all that would be 6720 extra dmg from out of combat casting single panther should be about 4k dmg so grp panther would easily out do that already in terms of precedent).&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the mob is engaged casting nukes becomes much better dps.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>If nothing else it just doesn't make sense that our spell be 18secs to get 8 hits while mages be 24 to 32secs to&nbsp; get 4 hits.&nbsp;&nbsp; You'd think double the hits should require double the time.</DIV></DIV>

				The only real use I've found for Barkspur in a group setting is when all three of these conditions are present: 1) I'm main healer, <u><i>and</i></u> 2) the group is low on dps, <u><i>and</i></u> 3) every mob 'enrages' (e.g. ashengate). In such a scenario, stacking the extra DS helps compensate for the tank turning off attack during the last tick or two of combat.<br><br>Otherwise the spell is lackluster -- which means, 99.9% of the time. Honestly, if any of those 3 conditions isn't true, the spell isn't worth keeping memmed. I.E. If I'm not the main healer, I can nuke; if we have plenty of dps in the group, the tank's doesn't matter as much; and if the mobs don't enrage, there's no added urgency to get the mob dead when it gets low health.<br><br>I would much rather have a .5 second nuke similar to Sting of the Queen. Now that spell is a nice quick way to get past an enraging mob ... and what's funny is how, despite how much some shaman have tried to downplay that spell, *every* shaman I've grouped with has already made it a habit of casting every time it pops, quite easily between their other spells. <br><br>Regards,<br><br>Mahzz<br><div></div>

<P>How surprising to hear.&nbsp; =P&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We must be hearling it from the same "shammy" of course, lol. surely there is only one who feels that way.</P>
<P>Its just like panther,&nbsp;&nbsp; my shammy friends had no quams about telling me that they were completely &nbsp;surprised that the shammy got that and not the druid who had a greater need for new utlity, but you will never see that admited on a board in general.&nbsp; Will they take it and are they over poweed without it?&nbsp; No, it is one of the better balanced classes imo.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, due to the fact that SOE seems to have complete blinders as to real in game balance sometimes (clearly from the fact tghat for some reason their "balance formula" shows us as well balanced currently to them even though&nbsp; comparisons show where we have contineud to fall behind in many areas), shammies are afraid that SOE may see them as "overpowered" if they admitted happiness, and the sad thing is, they could potentially be right (I would hope not).&nbsp; Who knows what lurks in the minds of SOE?&nbsp;&nbsp; Only the shadow knows !!"<BR></P>

				<DIV>I think a better way to change this would be to change it to be a&nbsp;low aggro debuff on the mob, kind of like the cleric damage shields. Increase the mana cost, increase the max hits, and slightly increase the duration. That way it could technically work on AE ramp mobs but wouldn't deal too much damage because of the max hits, plus this way it&nbsp;could be taken advantage of by anyone on that mob instead of just the main tank should someone steal aggro or the tank dies, AND could be used on raids since you're not having to worry about the damage shield effecting adds... I think&nbsp;this would be&nbsp;pretty awesome.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Also, in response to the shaman/panther comment, Obi, I think it'd be neat for us to get a group buff&nbsp;similar to panther (in that it's short duration)&nbsp;that increases caster&nbsp;spells by up to&nbsp;10%, decreases mana cost of spells by up to&nbsp;10%,&nbsp;and increase spell crit chance&nbsp;by 3%&nbsp;for 5-6 ticks. It'd probably take some tweaking of numbers or changing/removing/adding of mods,&nbsp;but I think it'd be sweet.&nbsp;All of these mods should work with heals, nukes, and DoTs. It'd be good on raids,&nbsp;it would stack well with our epic click for nukes, and it would&nbsp;give us a whole lot more desirability -period-. </DIV>

				There is desireability to be appreciated in attack debuffs, its just
not helpful that people are rather ignorant about it because the effect
isn't as noticeably visible as a mob hitting fewer times / minute, and
when they do get used those people probably end up thinking "oh that
tank, hes got uber mitigation taking such low damage most of the time"
when really it was mostly the debuffs.<br>
<br>
I play a druid at times with my cleric tanking, I sometimes play a
shaman instead (druid moreso) and I can weigh the options of Slow vs
Attack debuffs just from watching parses, or just the mob rounds
enacted upon me. There's no xp zone that I can't duo with either now,
and whilst slow is obviously best in Ashengate (fire immunity 4tlose),
FC is harsher deeper in than AG by a significant amount- slowed they
can still hurt from spikes but at least its at a lesser rate, unslowed
with debuffs they can hurt but at least the healing is more predictable
with significantly fewer spikes. Which is better? /shrug, I haven't
parsed in that case, but the fact is I manage with either. <br>
<br>
Now its an extreme example yes, but consider the dps of just a cleric
and druid, and just a cleric and shaman. Its pretty low. Now consider a
group managing there... and yes, I would do groups without slowers with
a druid, and yes I would do groups with just a slower, but also I love
groups where slow and attack debuffs are both present- it makes
multipulls much more manageable. <br>
<br>
If I could, I would 3 box and have a druid AND shaman- that would be the real holy trinity <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-very-happy.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0><br>
<br>
Anyways, I'm not thinking the caster buff is a bad idea- I think it
nice, but I have to disagree with statements saying druids aren't
desireable. Its there and you are a desired class very highly by people
who understand the benefits- even if they are decked out in the best
gear (might be thought oh, with high AC attack debuffs aren't worth it.
I still have groups with Igneous and druids still cast attack debuffs,
can't get better than the highest ac warrior, and I still see
benefits), the rest of EQ just needs to stop being stupid and ignorant.<br>

<P>Anyways, I'm not thinking the caster buff is a bad idea- I think it nice, but I have to disagree with statements saying druids aren't desireable. Its there and you are a desired class very highly by people who understand the benefits- even if they are decked out in the best gear (might be thought oh, with high AC attack debuffs aren't worth it. I still have groups with Igneous and druids still cast attack debuffs, can't get better than the highest ac warrior, and I still see benefits), the rest of EQ just needs to stop being stupid and ignorant.<BR></P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>But I never said in my post that druids aren't desirable. I think other classes are more desirable than we are... But that doesn't mean we're not wanted. I don't want this to turn into another long-winded, off-subject threat,I just think we need something else, other than attack debuffs, and was throwing out an idea while I had the chance since what Obi said kind of gave me an idea. If you guys don't like it, cool deal. But I'm honestly quite tired of SoE copying and pasting spells from old expansions, upping the numbers by a preset ratio and changing the name of the spell for our "upgrades." We need something new. Reptile was and is great, but that's not a class-defining role.<BR>

				<DIV>My bad I did misread, it was "and it would&nbsp;give us a whole lot more desirability -period-. ". The undervalueing players do takes place in many forms- "AC above 3k for a tank is useless and pointless! It has no visible gains" is one&nbsp;of&nbsp;them, picked it out since it is essentially the same as people not recognising the worth of your debuffs (and nothing irritates me more than such baseless statements, meh, such is a majority, and one often claimed)- and it should be a reason just to invite druids just like slow is a reason for&nbsp;other classes. Oh well what can you do.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I do understand what it is like to not have desireability in some aspects though (not trying to turn this into a balance debate) but when a shaman or druid can manage perfectly well and offer more then there are little reasons to invite a cleric- such a problem was why Valor was finalised the way it was. Something noticeable doesn't have to be huge, but just be seen and be beneficial, and I agree druids can use help in that regard. How that has to be done though, shrug, I'm not an experienced enough druid to comment.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Anyways sorry for the derails, this was meant to be about improving barkspur.</DIV>

<P><EM>Raid_Leader : </EM></P>
<P><EM>OK all, listen up ... This MoB AE ramps for about 3300 a swing - so its VERY important that we get EVERYBODY in the raid to stand in min melee range to take at LEAST 8 hits from him. This way we can maximize DS damage.</EM></P>
<P>LOL - its thinking like this that explains a lot about the spell upgrades Druids get.</P>
<P>Oh well, at least Barkspur makes tanks feel better ... "Oh look, my DS is like 300 now!" wheeee.</P>
<P>Slighhtly more useful, but memmed as often as:</P>
<P>Anti-Summon, Plant Charm, Aggroless Animal Charm, un-landable stuns, un-landable Skin to Vines, unstackable fire dots, tree form, wolf form, .... and whatever other useless spell line I've long since forgotten about.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>This should be a semi-usable combat "dot" (yeah, I know its a DS). 3-min duration, 16-24 hit max, with appropriate mana use for a 3-5k dot.</P>
