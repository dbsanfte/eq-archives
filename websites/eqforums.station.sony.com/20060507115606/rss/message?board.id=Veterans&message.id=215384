    <description>All bow classes should have the endless quiver aa.  I could see making it cheaper for rangers, but everyone that can use a bow should be able to get it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My 2pc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;How about an AA that summons powerfull arrows no trade/no rent arrows.  That way you control how many are made over whatever timer interval you make as the refresh for the AA.  Or even something that adds 10 dmg and takes away 10 dly to your bow for a set period of time?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The arrows, for instance.  summon 150 arrows with a 90min or so refresh.  those 150 arrows could be used during a disc or HoA or the like and just let a ranger spike massive dmg for the duration of that ability or until the arrows run out.  Maybe 25dmg arrows with a 150-250dmg proc and 250 range or something.  I'm a necro, I dunno what that''d do to their dps..but it's just a for instance thing. That or just make the bows insane via an timer and AA for 30-45seconds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking as a &amp;quot;dps&amp;quot; class, I wouldn't give to smurfs and a smurf if rangers started parsing 800-900dps on midrange fights..they should be there anyway.  Then again, so should beasts, and monks should too.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Fine, give all bow classes Endless Quiver, but make them pay double AA cost for non rangers. I don't think you'd see a whole lot of the other classes paying 18 aa for EQ.</description>

      <description>If you're not a ranger, back off, go away, you're not getting Endless Quiver.&lt;br&gt;Go make a ranger if you want it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;OR.... give me Feign Death or a mezz spell or an evac or.... you get the picture?&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

With the recent changes to Bazu Bellow that make it usable as a tagging tool, I find this much less an issue now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Yep, I dislike posts like this also. Consider for the moment, that ALL classes can put together lists of what they alone have and what other classes got from them. ALL classes can put together lists of abilities that they got from other classes. None of the original classes are the same as they were back in the beginning. If that were the case knights, not warriors, would be the premier raid tanks. If that were the case rangers, not knights, would be the premier group tanks. The game changes over time. The classes change over time. All classes have gained abilities that they did not have before from other classes. Monks are lulling and nuking now. Rogues are mezzing now. Pure melee are casting MGB buffs now (Well AE buffs). Some of these gained abilities are relatively worthless to the receiving class, some of these gained abilities are very popular by the receiving class.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The real question isn't, who got what and when they got it and from who they got it? The real question is, how long we can expect this bluring of class lines to go on? If the answer is indefinately, we can expect some time in the distant future rogues with the ability to function as group healers, warriors with the ability to function as croud control and enchanters having the ability to tank raid MObs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

Though, you mentioning Bazu Bellow kind of makes your point moot. So is your point about inventory slots. Rangers who do not even use Archery that much still carry a fleeting quiver. Do you?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The difference is, those warrior abilities were given to-or farmed out if you prefer- other classes in order to boost their DPS. It could have been accomplished just as well by creating new abilities, naming them differently or changing the damage tables. Though, I am not certain how much difference there is between farming out warrior abilities to other classes or warriors being able to use magic abilities-spells-a lot more freely nowadays.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;/agree Red&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EQ wouldn't change the power/performance/playability/balance/etc of any class you could give it to IMO.  It would purely be a matter of convenience for them.  Making invis potions stack didn't make the invis any better, it just made it more convenient. EQ for classes without archery AA's wont make them archery godS, it will just make archery more convenient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And also agree, its not a bigggie issue for me.  Just pointing out its not the game altering switch in the balance of ranged fighting power that some make it out ot be :)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I have to say endless quiver for a rogue takes something away from rangers.&amp;nbsp; And that you people that are sure that by giving away similiar abilities or directions your not hurting rangers ... i just dont get you.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I mean if you EQ on the stupid little 1 damage arrows youve always used that is one little invasion into the rangers sphere.&amp;nbsp; However if you EQ on the best droppable arrow in the game that starts to matter alot...&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Even so i would be pissed off if anyone got EQ as a ranger if i was one. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I get pissed off that they keep making invis easier and easier to use for other classes and technically all they did was make things more "convenient".&amp;nbsp; It sucks though if you took a class that invised conveniently because it had that invis conveniently.&amp;nbsp; Your right that it didnt change the class however the person chasing convenient invis&amp;nbsp; has more options today then yesterday.&amp;nbsp; So I HAD more options but now im stuck in a class i mgiht not have choose because you all decided i wasnted effected if other people could invis~&amp;nbsp; I stun people with this all the time but the REASON i was a rogue was not DPS it was invis and SoS came along just at the right time to keep that alive for me.&amp;nbsp; But if you hand out invis to everyone and their mother you take some of the core reasons I was a rogue and spread it around and you risk making this not the right class for me in this new world.&amp;nbsp; Now you got a customer whos core values have NOT change but the game changed around them.&amp;nbsp; So that even if they made the correct choice for themselves back in the day the same correct choice mechanics might place them differently today.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;So I apply the same sympathy to rangers and EQ now that EQ is so old and unique for so long.&amp;nbsp; Sure rangers arnt "hurt" when you give away EQ however then again the person behind the ranger might not make a ranger in this brave new world where everyone can EQ.&amp;nbsp; And once you pull out from under them the reason they might have been a ranger that can lead to some dissatisfaction very fast.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;So EQ is retired and sacred imo.&amp;nbsp; Its unfortunate that its only been in play since luclin.&amp;nbsp; But its been 3 years and if someone was in the position that their class would have been decided differently if they had known which were going to get EQ back in the day then thats kind of old news now.&amp;nbsp; On the other hand there might be people that selected rangers in this last 3 years because of EQ.&amp;nbsp; I think we have a much better chance of doing right by them.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>If anything, just make it so you could collect arrows fired at mobs off their corpses in random amounts and make an AA that increases the chance of you being able to recover them (Oblivion lets you collect arrows in this manner, but the rate of it is tweaked in several mods).&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

It's not Endless Quiver that makes rangers the elite archers, it's your DPS with a bow that does it. EQ is important; but it is only there to facilitate sustaining your bow DPS. If other classes were asking for rangerly bow DPS in addition to EQ, then you'd be more justified. EQ won't make other bow classes sit back and use archery DPS in the grind, so rangers would lose nothing defining.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now don't get me wrong, I don't think other classes should get EQ. If it is split into a line of AAs that gradually elminate the consumption of arrows then I wouldn't be so against giving a reduction in arrow consumption to other classes that does not get close to that of 100% reduction but the original post as it stands is, in my mind, totally out of the question.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rangers aren't defined through Endless Quiver, they are (debatably if you scroll up) defined though being a viable archer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

The point was that giving EQ to another class won't make that class even close to quality of archer that the ranger is. EQ just means the ranger can be that elite archer for longer than one quiver of arrows.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

What class will be anywhere near ranger bow DPS if that class gets EQ? I don't think there are any. If they removed EQ completely, guess which class would still be best archers hands down? When you think of a ranger, do you think &amp;quot;wow, they can shoot arrows without emptying their quiver!&amp;quot; or do you think &amp;quot;wow, they are awesome with a bow!&amp;quot;.... awesome with a bow doesn't mean you never run out of ammo like a bad 70's cop show, though it does help you sustain the DPS you have *with or without EQ*. EQ makes archery practical for longer periods of time with less downtime afterwards (ie restocking).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Endless Quiver for other classes will take nothing away from the ranger. I bet you'll hear tanks whine about it wasting a line on the AA window where a better ability could have been though.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

Give up something equal in value.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you are going to accuse me of being uninformed, read all my posts on the thread first. I don't want EQ. I'm a chanter. My one alt that has a bow is certainly not going to be the character I log in if I need ranged DPS.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You really should reread the thread, not just the title, because my post that you took offense to was supporting my comment that endless quiver isn't defining to the ranger class. I honestly can't believe why so many rangers feel that they will have an identity crisis if another class gets EQ. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i&gt;Perhaps you can explain how the archery skill and elemental bows causing grief relates to how you as a ranger will be personally affected if another melee class gets EQ.&lt;/i&gt; And when I say ranger, I don't mean fletcher as that's a whole other can of pretty moot worms. One does not imply the other. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Do you really feel like you are special because you have endless quiver and no other class does? Give your head a shake, rangers bring a great combination of utility and DPS to groups, and another class having EQ isn't going to reduce a ranger's usefulness or attractiveness to groups.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm not arguing for endless quiver, I think at this point nobody is still arguing the OP. I'm really sorry that I think that rangers shouldn't be clinging to EQ as &amp;quot;class defining&amp;quot;. Keep it as something only you have, but for the love of god don't pretend that having exlclusive rights to EQ is central to being a ranger. It's pretty clear to me, a non-ranger, that your gameplay won't suffer if another class gets EQ. Why isn't it so to you?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
