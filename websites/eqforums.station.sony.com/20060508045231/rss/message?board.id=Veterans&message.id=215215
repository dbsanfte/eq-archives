      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;A group of friends did 70.5 tonight.  We did fine up to the dragon looking mob - Fragment of Vishimtar (or something like that).  We had a couple deaths due to missing &lt;font color="#ff3300"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ENRAGE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt; at end and wiped at 2%.  After we regrouped, we killed the named and moved up to the final mob.  Before we could engage named, we started having random mobs spawn on top of us that saw invis and could not be mezzed -- too high for the 70 bard and 70 chanter, both of which have their highest level mezzes.  We lost five in group this time.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We did a CR one more time and while in the first room, we had the same thing happen.  We gave up becuase it was a no-win proposition.  Mobs randomly spawnign on us that saw invis and we couldn't mez made it imposible for us to to continue.  What a waste of time on this mission due to this bug. :(&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Royr_BB on &lt;span class="date_text"&gt;04-09-2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;12:42 AM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;I didn't do this one before PoR came out, so I cannot speak to the &lt;em&gt;change &lt;/em&gt;on how hard the mobs hit. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I do think trash mobs hitting for 2k could be a bit hard for casual players to handle.  Fortunately, our non-raid tank buffs out to 13k.  We've played together for serveral years, and we have a good idea on what our group can handle. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Of the 70 series, I found 70.2 and 70.5 to have the hardest hitting trash mobs.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Mob respawn in this mission has been silly since long before PoR.  Months ago I had a group in this mission who wiped either to fragment of vish or the last mob, I forget which; we took long enough getting back that respawn occured.  As soon as you zoned in, repop would warp onto you.  Not being able to handle trash mob after trash mob warping on the group, we ended up having to restart the mission.&lt;br&gt;Again, this was quite awhile ago, perhaps January.&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Edit: And it was certainly respawn in this case; we had cleared the zone of trash.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Jikshail on &lt;span class="date_text"&gt;04-11-2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;08:40 AM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;We did this again Sunday night.  We didn't have a wipeout like the first time, but we had a couple deaths along the way.  We did get two mobs that spawned/warped on us after we killed the dragon mob and were moving up to the emperor.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We were on the ramp and *poof*, a mob magically spawned on top of our chanter.  Fortunately, the cleric got a fast heal off, and he lived.  We whacked that mob, and pulled the Emperor, when we got another *poof*, random spawn on top of us.  Ranger kited it away and chanter mezzed (fortunately, it was low enough level to mez). &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;At this point, I dont' think it is a respawn issue becuase we were in zone for probably 90 minutes total, and only had two of these mobs.  I think there is some really strange pathing going on or something and mobs just warped to us. I'm glad to be finished with 70.5, and our chanter is happy with his new &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=45301"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did this a couple of days ago for a guildie. It would have been about the fifth time I had done it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We did win with only 1 death from warping (usual issue here) so it is winnable. The main problem was that trash mobs seem to be hitting harder than previously. It was the normal setting and they seemed to be hitting like it was on a hard setting (have completed one hard setting on it previously).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Didn't notice any respawns and we did have to me a while after the one death (which was the cleric) and after the swords&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Additionally the boss MOb's are a lot more resistant to nukes. Our wizzy reported that he could not get a nuke of any type to land even by belly casting. The warping is also something that is difficult to deal with. Why an unagroed MOb would sudden decide to TL itself on top of group member is a mystery. Also one or more of these symtoms are found in other missions even other expansions (as an example that 2.5k hitting drake that randomly appears in the Creator mission).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A couple of things we have noticed. It is not ALL MOb's that hit harder, just some of them. Sometimes it is most, sometimes it is a very few. The number of hard hitters seems to be random.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There was another thread on this very subject. This &amp;quot;change&amp;quot; occured with the release of PoR and quite a few people accused SOE of nerfing older expansions to get people to buy the new expansions (this is a charge that happens every time there is a new expansions). A Dev explained that no changes had been made to those instances that reported harder hitting MOb's and I believe there is no reason to dispute that claim. That being said, there were changes made to some aspects of the game that would affect things outside of PoR. Pathing, Spell Resists, etc. will all have a global effect. This should be examined by the Dev team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
