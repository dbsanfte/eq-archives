<DIV>CLASS: ROGUE</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>As a rogue that is raiding the end game there are only really&nbsp;two things that I look for in loot.&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>1. dps</DIV>
<DIV>How will it increase my dps?&nbsp; My attack is maxed so untill the cap is increased there isn't really anything I can do there.&nbsp;&nbsp; However over on the rogue boards they have parsed that for ever 10 attack I gain roughly 1dps so the more attack the better.</DIV>
<DIV>Accuracy...yes please</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>And the 1 big thing that is important in this area would be +bs damage.&nbsp; It pains me to have to keep my time bp because I am not yet maxed at 125.&nbsp; It was a great start that you guys added 3 items in demi plane with +bs damage on it thank you very much for that, but I just hope that there will be more options in the future.&nbsp; Having to wear gear that is from pop, god, and anguish because I can't afford to replace them due to the decrease in my dps (which is my main role I might add) is very discouraging.&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>So untill my main hand weapon choice is freed up from my 2.0 I will constantly look for other ways to increase my dps.&nbsp; Stagnation isn't good for water and it isn't good for my gear.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>2. Ways to keep my butt alive.</DIV>
<DIV>This would be via hp, or shielding, avoidance, dot shielding, spell shielding, ect....&nbsp; A dead rogue does no dps so I have to avoid agro first, and secondly I have to live through any ae ramp/spell ae that the mobs put out.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Really my stats are maxed so I don't pay attention to them anymore.&nbsp; My resists are very high and untill the cap is raised I won't bother with them.&nbsp; And ac? HA I don't tank there for I care not.</DIV>
