I think I can confidently say that everything in FC#1, except maybe
Shades of Calm, caters to either guild setup.&nbsp; By that I mean,
guilds with low dps should have more support, and vise versa- and that
events are winnable each way.&nbsp; The heavier support should cope
with the various mechanisms better than ours, but your fights will last
longer.&nbsp; I'm a bit concerned about Shades of Calm for a support
guild, because the gain from having more support may not be enough to
overcome low dps - but I know Nodyin is the type to tweak things.&nbsp;
Also, if you just go in with low numbers all around - yea, youre
probably going to have alot more trouble.&nbsp; In most cases though,
they're still winnable with some very good strats.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Of course, this is assuming your guild can develop decent strats, and
just doesn't try the same things over and over.&nbsp; If you go in with
**SMURF**ty strats, you're going to have trouble no matter what you have in
your raid.<br>
<br>
FC#2 - We don't have enough run-throughs on the scripts to say for sure.<br>
<br>
Believe it or not, we have major fears every new expansion because
theres really no other high-dps built guild at this level.&nbsp; I
guess one or two come close, but most of you have alot more
healing/tanks than we do.&nbsp; Theres definatly been points where
we've felt severely disadvantaged, but its all overcomeable (PoR was
even worse for that though- we were stuck for awhile).<br><div></div>
