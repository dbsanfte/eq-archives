      <description>Hill bugging, ghosting, plugging, recharge of AA abilities... fix them all.  Most of us want to see it all gone.  As for pillages, if you get the clickies, it's not really an issue and the clickies aren't that hard to get, seriously.  It's just strategy.  Not being able dispell kinda makes everyone's life hard, but like anything, you just have to learn to deal with it.  I don't find it near as bad a problem as the ones I stated in my first sentence of this post.</description>

      <description>Well, stuns are a real danger.  Even a two second stun with someone who, quite often, triple attacks for 600-700 with a good two hander can be devistating.  It would really depend on the recast time.  That's why I think giving Warriors a more powerful ranged attack PVP attack would be good.  At least they could fight against the targets that give them the most trouble.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Being able to strip movement through an unresistable ability would be severely debilitating, IMHO.</description>

      <description>When I think about this more, the more I don't like it.  Any group with a Warrior in it would have absolutely no problem preventing the escape of a target in an open area.  Speed is life.  With that advantage removed, group gankage (which you guys dislike) would become really, really easy.  At least now, targets have a *chance* at getting away.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I dunno, maybe give Warriors a HIGH delay, heavy damage long range PVP attack?  At least then they could whittle down runners and people who were lev'd.</description>

Though you'd be putting the screws on a target that was trying to get away from a group (grin)... I think something like this... a skill that puts a movement debuff on you that reduces you to normal run speed but does not remove movement buffs... wears off in 25 secs or something and then your target returns to full speed.</description>

Let alone in a group enviornment... it'd be worse than the that massively retarded Zerker slice before the patch.</description>

      <description>We have had several high level warriors in the Curse.  Currently, only one is fully active (Hdaorf).  I've played Warriors in high level PVP before.  You really can't do anything solo, but when played in a group, you can do some serious damage and are a phenominal pain in the butt to kill short of being burned.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Instead of being a **SMURF**, how about you just counter what I'm saying?  I'm trying to add to the original point of the post since it has strayed so far off track.  How about you post something constructive instead of just replying simply because you don't like me.</description>

      <description>In group PVP Warriors are a force to be reconned with, in my opinion.  Solo is where you guys have trouble.  Problem obviously being, your class revolves around the concept that your target sits there, doesn't move, and continues to bang away on you.  Since that's obviously not going to happen, you require group enviornments to operate effectively.  Warriors can inflict some seriousl pain when grouped.  I don't think there's an easy way to give you guys anything more besides maybe making you even more immune to player cast spells.  Every caster would be up in arms though.</description>

There is nothing you could ever say that could justify earning uber gear in a non pvp environment and then taking it with you to RZ and THEN being a 'pk'.&lt;hr&gt;I suppose it's a good thing I really don't care what you think when it comes to this issue.  Your opinion is irrelevant with regards to this issue since I neither need, nor desire your consent in order to have fun playing the game.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;hr&gt;PriD wrote:&lt;br&gt;It is a fact we have different player behavior and polotics on SZ, and I have'nt experienced the situation. But if you don't like the situation, don't play there. Munchkin.&lt;/hr&gt;I played for 2 years on Sullon (Good team) from 1 to 65 as an Enchanter, I know very well what the "politics" are on that server.  There are none, so **SMURF**.  Scrub.</description>

      <description>Well man, I beg to differ.  I've been on the server over a year and I have friends here (that have been here since the start) and I like it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm sorry you feel that I don't deserve to play on the same server but, tough.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I really don't understand the hostility, I'm nice out there when I PK.  People never have a problem with it and I get lots of tells saying "good fight" or "that was a lot of fun".  If your only problem is that I didn't earn my gear, your way... well, too bad.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'd like to also point out that I don't try and alter server policy, as you imply.  I play my own game, which is PVP and leave you guys to run around the high end content.  Make up your rules as you like.  When I see how some of the top tier guilds treat other guilds, it simply reinforces my view upon the subject.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Volture, to my knowledge, is not ebayed and is 100% RZ.</description>
