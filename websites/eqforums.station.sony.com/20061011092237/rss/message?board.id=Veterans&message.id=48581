    <description>&lt;DIV&gt;All the rewards I've seen to date have been XP and coin.&amp;nbsp; I'd suggest other types of rewards, such as significant faction hits for hard to raise factions after a long task (such as Freeport Militia); possibly item rewards based on a need you have (you could make the person specifically pick the task he wanted based on the reward he needs.)&amp;nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Ideally, the system should check to see if you have the key to a certain zone, before giving you the task for it.&amp;nbsp; Alternatively, you should see the keys required for the task, so you could accept or decline based on that.&amp;nbsp; Another suggestion is to temporarily key someone for the zone while they are doing the step in the task that needs it (but this is open to a bit of abuse.)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;At level 70 I prefer to Solo than to group -- Groups and Raids take up a LOT OF TIME -- whereas when I solo I can get right down to business. I usually don't group but I do Raids and I simply hate raids --They take a long time to set up and actually get going. I have done raids in Time, &amp;nbsp;Uqua, Ikkinz1-4, MPG raid Trials, and RS raids -- hated them all. But if you want gear and spells you have no other avenue and I find this is really bad that SOE only forces you to raid.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I feel that I should have the ability to get&amp;nbsp;my 69-70 spells and High end gear other than by raiding. Why can't these spells and gear be given out to soloers who do particularly difficult tasks? &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The current rewards for soloing are really pathetic. --- also please REMOVE THE NO DROP from GLOWING and GREATER RUNES -- so we can at least buy them instead of spending 6 hours in a raid. -- I really hate the amount of time raiding takes up -- and would so much prefer to do hard tasks solo. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Soloers should have the opportunity -- ( even if more difficult and takes longer) to acquire 69 and 70 spells and upper end gear without being compelled to devote their free time to Raids. At the high end of this game you have to raid and that soaks up a lot of time until EQ seems more like a full time job than a game you play for fun. &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Jiga-jiga posted an idea in another thread that I thought was interesting...&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;He suggested a NO DROP item with a 1-charge Dire Charm that could be used by soloers to get a temporary, NPC hunting partner.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I see all kinds of exploits in that, but...&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;What about hirelings?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Maybe a solution to the soloing problem is to go to a Guild Master and HIRE NPC's to group with.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Yes, they would SUCK and their AI might be poor. But it could very well provide the needed support for certain classes to solo.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;For example, a cleric goes to hire a warrior. Essentially, it because a Warrior pet for the cleric. Comes with a certain level of gear. You let it die without rez, lose faction with the guild master and may not be able to hire another. Takes no loot, but does take a percent of XP.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Perhaps you can "hire" only Tank or Healer and only one at a time.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Would be EXPENSIVE (they take no loot) and should be, maybe, 3-5 levels BELOW the person hiring them. Relatively poorly equipped. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Warrior would have tons of HP, no disciplines, marginal gear. This case is pretty straightforward, EQ already has limited AI for warrior pets.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Healers would be tougher - just healing, no buffs.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Casters could be done, but spell availability, spell selection and mana management might require too much of the existing AI.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Virtually everything else needed for soloing is already available elsewhere - Snare devices (expensive), invis potions, etc.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;It's really the tanking and the healing....&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;[edit - add]&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I'd limit to 1 hireling per group. If there are more than&amp;nbsp;3 in group, hireling leaves (3, including hireling, would allow LDoNs).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The controlling item would be a "contract" that is in your possession.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Klonn_Darkbane on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;01-28-2005&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;03:32 PM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I quit EQ in may '04, and I have come back after trying EQ2 and WoW since they are both lacking. The reason I quit EQ in may '04 was due to waiting 2+ hours for a group anytime I signed on. As a warrior I can't solo, as most classes you can't solo past a certain level. I do not enjoy raids. I enjoy 8 man groups annihilating mobs. When I am not in a group I would like the option of soloing. This task system is a disappointment. Takes me 30 minutes to get a task, and I pray its one I am even able to do. I would love to see something like LDoN instanced task where the mobs are weaker than normal mobs. If I'm going to make it past my first resubscribed month something like this (viable/fun solo for all)&amp;nbsp;needs to be in the works. Just my 2 cents.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I think it would alleviate the "greenie farming" faction timesink if mobs gave faction hits based on their relative level (just like experience). For example, light blue cons give you X faction hits, dark blue cons give you 2X faction hits, white 3X, etc.&amp;nbsp; However if that happened I suspect it would be via reducing the amount of faction you receive from killing lower con mobs rather than increasing faction received from higher con mobs so I'll vote for not doing that.&amp;nbsp; Farming light blues for faction is one of my favorite things to do while waiting for groups or if I just have a little time.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The task system in Everquest was a great step in the right direction to allow something to do "with in an hourto play &amp;nbsp;and still accomplish something." This great idea was to give reward in the form of cash and experiance, but less so than grouping experiance or cash to make sure that grouping was still the prime choice of experiance in Everquest. Yet, this system has been plauged with problems with how long it takes to actually accomplish some tasks, the rewards given for the time, and the overall difficulty of the tasks for some classes to accomplish.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I believe the tasks in and of themselves are fine "as is", but the time constraints are spawned via specifics for quest completion when killing mobs. For example the Droga quests have you slay a specific type of goblin and a moderate number. The problem comes down with classes that lack basic utility spells to miander around that dungeon to specifically find those goblins to accomplish the task. This bogs down the player into either clearing any goblin in hopes of finding the type of goblin she must slay inorder to accomplish her task, buy invis potions to miander around in hopes of finding the specific goblins, or just plain giving up. These tasks were designed for completion within an hour or so, but the specifics in this case bog downt he player for much longer than that. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;In this case changing the specific names of the goblins to "any goblin", would allow the player to slay her specific number of goblins for the quest completion within a short period of time. This would equate the low xp reward and the low monitary reward in terms of I believe true worth for the task system. This example applies to alot of the tasks where specific mobs shouldn't be used, as they create a "camp" for the specific mobs to spawn. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;People enjoy having long term goals, but also want to accomplish short term goals quickly. In terms of quickness I mean an hour or so for a small reward. I would like to ask that this please be looked into as to make the task system truely shine in both ideal and function. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Another aspect of Everquest is the faction system and the questing system as a whole. The common usage with the factions system&amp;nbsp;in Everquest has been go slaughter thousands of green cons with area effect spells for hours on end to maximize efficiency. In all honesty when I envision an intrepid hero trying to make a name for herself trying to become welcomed into a hostile city&amp;nbsp; is doing favors for the locals, protecting the local's interest, and proving herself through sword, fist, or magic on the enemies of the people.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;In this format rather than forcing the "grind" aspect of factioning, an intrepid adventurer tasks a job or in this case a task from a local that is indifferent to outward politics and wants to use a hired mercenary to accomplish a goals. Instead of giving experiance and coin, factions and experiance are given. Eventually with enough tasks the reputation of the intrepid&amp;nbsp;adventurer could give her a more welcome responce by the populous and thus open up new oppertunities for adventure and fame and riches. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;To define this in a game mechanics sort of deal. My thoughts are converting the task system into a faction system that introducing a step stone for kill on sight people or those with dubious or apprehensive faction to gain favor with the city as an intrepid hero. This would I believe strongly add to the flavor of being "evil" or "good" and allow players to immerse themselves into defending their allies. This can be a simple start such as just killing off a small incursion of orc centurions or delivering messages to guard outposts in other zones and other such small "favors." These can scale eventually into harder tasks, or if higher level the person can take these tasks that yield better faction and experiance for the city. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Once a high faction is achieved within the city this leaves new oppertunities for the adventurer to become entagled in political quagmires, stories of espionage, and political assassinations for bigger rewards. People are always looking for fun trinkets such as illusion items or usefull gadgets that make their gaming experiance a little bit better such as invisibility items. Grouped tasks here can be quests that give rewards to add to the flavor of Everquest. Or even soloible quests that give small trinkets that are multi-staged such as the Qeynos Badge series can be expanded upon through expansion material as politics change and new powers are introduced to the gaming world. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I believe that offering quests in Everquest that scale and grow with the intrepid heroes of Norrath is to keep the feeling of "old world" alive and well. The epic quests brought back alot of the old world flavor by bringing alot of us back home. Yet our homes and those places of interest to us are stangated into an ancient time frame that has long since past. Very few seem aware of changes or don't ever seem to age. Legendary kings seem to standstill, forever frozen in a time period long since past. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I believe by updating older content with mixing newer content and offering ways to bridge and bring back the flavor of feeling like players have&amp;nbsp; home they are loyal to is a good way to go. Norrath still has plenty of intrique and mystery left with many factions opposing one another. I believe further their storylines and allowing Everquest players to fully delve back into the older content and mixing it with newer content will bring back memories of slaying orc pawns and allow players to feel as though they are truly the heroes of a people or a scourge upon the land. I appreciate anytime spent reading this.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Anyway reposted here for inclusion into this thread I guess if you're going to reuse this material at the summit? I'll do a much more complex write up this quest issue and so forth latter =p&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>The XP rate on these needs to be some meaningful fraction of what can be obtained in a group. Presently (at level 70) I find that they are about 1/2 AA/hour, compared to a typical 2-4 AA/hour in pick-up XP group (slightly more in a group of "regulars"). While I can accept SOE's reasons for encouraging grouping, the ratio is so low that this is hardly a "meaningful" option for those that cannot regularly group, for whatever reason. In my opinion, a reasonable "set point" for solo XP activities would be around half that from a solid group. The rate of XP gain should be scaled with level to stay at the same point relative to grouped XP, and should be "the same" for all classes, including those that typically cannot "solo" for XP.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;LDoN points are interesting, but unless the LDoN rewards are reworked, they are outdated and obsoleted in most cases for a large fraction of the player base. Even the HP+40 augs have faded in attractiveness for many. For the few "must have" items remaining (&lt;i&gt;i.e., &lt;/i&gt;GRC, some general-purpose LDoN spells, DPoC, a couple specific non-level-fading augs) I agree that there needs to be incentive to "do" LDoNs again, especially for lower-level players. (Higher-level players have issues beyond LDoN rewards, with 1/2 AA per level 70 expedition being ridiculously low.) Resolution of those issues should, in my opinion, be done outside of the Task system.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The faction issues with Tasks need to be addressed. In some cases, completing a Task lowers the faction required to "safely" access the Taskmaster that gives you the quest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tasks to raise specific factions, either as an alternative to mass genocide of "greenies," or for factions that are difficult or impossible to improve, would be very interesting. Even though I don't roleplay, I would, for example, love to be able to go back and just stroll NToV with a friend, just to see it again and share memories. (Issues with faction-based exploits ignored in that last comment.) Such Tasks should be identified if they yielded less XP that other Tasks that required comparable time/effort.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tasks should not involve dispelling mobs as this heavily penalizes those without "the best" gear, which are often the players most able to benefit from an alternative to grouping play.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Summoning mobs, in my opinion, are not an issue. There are plenty of "soloable" mobs out there that do not summon. Even those that do, if the rewards are great enough, become soloing targets (&lt;i&gt;e.g., &lt;/i&gt;NC named for runes).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alternatives to "soloing for XP" should, in my opinion, be expanded. Quests of any wide and significant value seem to have evaporated from the landscape after the Coldain Shawl/Ring quests (there were significant access and/or reward problems with things like Power of the Planes, Aid Grimel, BiC, GoD tongues, etc.). These should be available to a wide range of players without the need for raid encounters (which remove the VP quests from the discussion).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Edit -- One of the issues with "soloing" is the potential for death. Risk is good, within reason. With Tasks sending you to basically unused zones, the penalties for running out of HP are much higher than in populated zones. One possible way to mitigate this would be to allow players to drag corpses across zone lines, allowing them to bring their corpse to a more populated area for a rez. I haven't thought through possible exploits that might limit this.&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by itchyban on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;12-29-2004&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;11:36 AM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

      <description>I just completed a task with my level 10 berserker.  It rewarded me nearly 80% of my level in experience (taking me dangerously close to 11, I don't want to go up to 11).  The cash reward was low compared to the lucrative butcherblock green goblin cash flow, but the experience reward was quite nice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's too bad the armor quests don't fit into a system like this.  I found the newbie armor quests a lot more difficult than tasks mainly from writing down all of the items needed and remembering the steps.  The task system is wonderful at walking you through each step.</description>

      <description>These are some good discussions and I like a lot of the ideas I hear.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One thing that concerns me is the idea that adding more solo content is a fix for people having trouble finding a group.  If SOE were to follow through with that idea, we'd all be playing Fable.  Solo content is important, there will always be times when one cannot get a group or doesn't have enough time, but it should always be more efficient to group than to solo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rather than attempt to fix grouping problems by adding more and better rewards for solo contet, SOE should look for ways for groups to get togehter faster, hunt faster, and offer ways to help people leave a group when they need to without harming themselves or the group.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As far as tasks go I would like to see the following things:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Turn the task system into the quest journal for EQ.  Add a lot of older quests to the task system.  Allow people to select more than one task at a time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Offer item rewards for tasks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Use the task system as motivation for exploration.  Offer more tasks that send players around from landmark to landmark.  In the early levels, this can do a lot to help players expand out into those unused zones we all complain about.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Add group tasks intended for somewhere between 3 and 6 people.  The leader picks a task sort of like an expedition and the group completes the task within 30 to 90 minutes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Fix any solo-friendly task that requires killing more than 10 mobbos.  Some of the tasks I attempted with my cleric, rogue, and berskerker (all different levels) took far longer than 90 minutes simply because I had to kill between 20 and 30 mobs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- I like the idea of LDON tasks offering points, but it should always be more efficient to get a group together and go into the dungeons.  Offer perhaps half of the points they would normally get for the same amount of time.  60 minutes of hunting alone should give you 25 points at level 65 or above.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Add in level 20 and level 40 armor quest tasks for a new set of nice armor at these levels.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Add in level 40 "epic" tasks for a new epic-lite item doable with a single group at level 40.  The task can have a lot of steps and require a group to complete, but the task system is a perfect interface for such an event.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Add in new task types other than collect, explore, kill, or hail. Add in tasks to slay one particular evil (not necessarily a rare spawn, but some sort of boss).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Add in taskmasters in the newbie areas and add level 5 tasks so brand new players understand that the task system isn't just something to ignore but something they can continually work on throughout their career.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The task system has a lot of potential to bridge the gap between EQ1's bracket-based quest system and the EQ2 quest journal.  Instead of being a smaller feature of a single expansion, SOE could expand this system into a core line of progression from level 5 to 70.  The system itself seems to work just fine.  All it needs now are tweaks to existing content and new content.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Again, however, I don't want to see the task system being a solo-only system.  The fix for people who have trouble finding groups is to make it easier and faster to find groups, not to send them off by themselves.</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;I think we also need to get away from equating "soloing" from "solo hunting".&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;We have a lot of soloing capability and every class can do it, but we need more. Soloing is everything I can do without involving anybody else. It includes not only solo hunting, but tradeskills and a lot of quests.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I think there could be a LOT more.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I think of soloing, in part, as things to do while LFG. Sometimes soloing is a specific goal, sometimes it is just a hobby, sometimes a time sink while waiting for your guild raid to form, whatever. We just need even more.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;More tasks is a great step in that direction.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;Heck,&amp;nbsp;scattering more vaiuable ground spawn around the world would be another step :) Certainly would encourage people to wander around.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>I'd much prefer better ways to make groups, as I'll take a group over soloing almost every time.  Unfortunately, the game simply isn't made that way... some classes are extemely valuable in regards to grouping (like shamen, clerics) while others are much less so (necros, mages).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ideally what I'd like to see is a necro, rogue, ranger, magician, wizard and beastlord be able to group together and go to the same kinds of places a warrior, cleric, shaman, and (pick two DPS classes here) could hunt at.  But honestly, I don't see that happening.  What I think would be possible is if *any* class can't get a group (regardless of the reason) they have a way to get experience.  Doesn't have to be a lot of experience, but forward progress nonetheless.  Tasks could be the answer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh, and not to nitpick Klonn, but necros do have a slow, although against undead only.  It's a 30-something spell called Shackle of Spirit.  :)</description>

&lt;P&gt;But most zones contain such a mix of undead and non-undead that devoting a spell gem while soloing is not worth it. There are zones, or areas of zones, that it is, but most do not.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Pallies &amp;amp; SK's have the same problem. WIth all of their anti-undead capability, they should be able to solo undead not too badly, but there are few, if any, zones where they can effectively use them. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;My Pally tried soloing in Vexsar when it first came out. IF he could get to the right place, he was fine, with a fair amount of downtime while he waited for the 6-8 undead mobs in the area to respawn. I am sure there are other places as well.&lt;/P&gt;</description>
