      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I was pleasantly suprised that SOE would do this to Shaman. I found out rather quickly how fast you can loose plat by buying herbs that no longer combine and then trying to sell them back to vendor for half price. Would it have hurt SOE to at least give us the formulary of potions that were already made? As a Master Alchemist who has made just about every combine there is, I find it very revolting to have to start all over again with trying to figure out what herbs combine with what to make a potion, not to mention that if you have buyers that are waiting for your potions, will now have to wait much longer until the combinations are figured out. Could not even figure out 1 combine in a little over an hour last night which infuriated me much futher. You would think that after spending as much plat as Shaman have to attain the Mastery of the skill that even making the herbs cheaper will offset the fact that now you can't even make potions that you use to be able too. Somehow I find that this is not what I was looking forward too and am no longer happy with my Shaman's skills. Guess its time to move on to something different. Good luck to those of you that have patience enough to figure out the combines and the patience to live with SOE's decision to revamp a whole tradeskill.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Didn't you find any tradeskill book up to date with the new receipes ? I did not try myself yet my server being down for 27 hours now.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;In Absymal Sea, they have Jonas Notes 1 - 6 that have some details on the new recipes. I am still trying to decipher them on my alt shammy.  Like 4 budrock will help wisdom. There are several different forms budrock come in. Also, does the combine need a vial + cork +??.  Things like that remain sketchy in the books.&lt;/div&gt;</description>
