<P>I am not as prolific as Ashlanne is (I keep telling her she is full of hot air) so be warned. Just about everything Ashlanne reported coincides with my experiences so I will focus on the Live Quests. </P>
<P>The EQ Live Quest story... </P>
<P>Xanise Furrytoes was planning a surprise birthday party for her brother, Dynon Furrytoes. Because she was trying to keep it as a surprise she needed help placing orders with the merchants around town so that Dynon didn’t figure out what was going on. She had a list of 6 merchants she needed things from for the party. She asked the adventurers to go talk to each of them and return with each merchant’s signature on the party planning list. </P>
<P>Shion Irontummy asked each group to collect some ingredients she needed to make cake and ice cream as well as place an order with Pertabi Treebender for an ice cream churn. </P>
<P>Kelawe Irontummy, who was making the food for the party, also needed some ingredients picked up so she would to be able to make the food. Because she wanted a new party dress, she asked the adventurers to place an order with Kalryyn Goldenneedle for a dress while they were out and about. </P>
<P>Olderi Irontummy had the pleasure of brewing up fine drinks for the party, and much like her sisters, needed some ingredients collected to be able to do so. She was also in charge of obtaining transportation to the party for her sisters and herself so she asked the adventurers to speak to Miale Travelquick. </P>
<P>Gnomish Fireworks were the plan for party favors and these were to be ordered from Thersden Sparkleshot. Thersden, who was taking a class in History &amp; Lore needed some help with a homework assignment so she would have time to create the party favors. </P>
<P>Of course all good parties also need good entertainment which was to be provided by Miskey Silvertongue. Unfortunately Miskey was troubled by writer's block and needed assistance writing a song for the party and then asked each group to perform their masterpiece for him so he could "See" the song. </P>
<P>Xanise, trying to make this a memorable day for her brother, wanted to give him a unique sculpture as a gift and so she sent the adventurers to Cheque Amberhaze, a well known and much recommended artist. Unbeknownst to her though, Cheque was a fraud who offered to buy a sculpture from each group so he could continue living his lie. </P>
<P>Pertabi, who the ice cream churn was ordered from, agreed to make the churn in return for dancing lessons from the adventurers. </P>
<P>Kalryyn needed assistance with a puzzle in order to obtain some patterns from an acquaintance after a freak accident occurred in his shop (in a fit of anger one day he tore up all his patterns). The puzzle was given to him by the acquaintance who did not really want to help and though the puzzle would stump him. </P>
<P>Miale Travelquick had recently taken a blow to the head and could not recall the spell for teleportation. He had the spell in his spell book but could no longer read the magical script, so he asked the adventurers to help decipher the magical runes. </P>
<P>And then there was Ancer Arrowspring who was desperately in love with Xanise Furrytoes. Being shy he was not sure how to express his desire to Xanise that she attend the party as his date so he asked the adventurers to help him come up with way to ask threatening to tell Dynon about the party and ruin the surprise if they did not help him. To complete the quest, each group had to get signatures from the 6 party merchants who each had their own tasks they needed help with. </P>
<P>Each merchant was also willing to give "platinum" for good RP interaction. Ah yes the "platinum" I nearly forgot the Shady Swashbuckler who was nearby and urging the fine adventurers to wager their hard earned plat in a game of chance. He managed to make quite a killing in his endeavors to part the adventurers from their coin too! The winning group was determined by completion of the signature list as well as having the most platinum by the end of the quest. Each member of the winning group received a gift card for $100 to Best buy. </P>
