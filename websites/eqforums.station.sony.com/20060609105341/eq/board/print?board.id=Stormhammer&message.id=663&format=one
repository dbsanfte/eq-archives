				<DIV>I think the issue with that is it requires spending a programmer's time to code new tools and more data to be stored on a per-character basis.&nbsp; Dpending on how the data is stored it may require a re-build of every character's data file on stormhammer, cause issues with moving characters to and from stormhammer, and would take a lot of time to wirte the tools in the first place and QA them and push them live.&nbsp;&nbsp; I dont really think sony is willing to spend the resouces needed for an endevor such as that when there are expansions to be worked on and new content to be deveolped etc.&nbsp; While it's a good idea, i dont forsee any of it's like being undertaken in the forseeable future.</DIV>
