      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;The only one I can think of was during my early days of playing EQ.&amp;nbsp; I had my Ranger in Blackburrow for the first time and was hunting near the zoneline to Qeynos Hills.&amp;nbsp; I was chasing a Scrawny Gnoll and knocked him into the big hole.&amp;nbsp; I didn't know where he had gotten to, as I had no idea of the layout of the zone.&amp;nbsp; Not long after I lost my Gnoll, I see shouts of "Train to zone".&amp;nbsp; My little lost Gnoll apparently landed in the water at the bottom of the hole and decided to bring a few friends back upstairs to meet me.&amp;nbsp; On the way they decided to say "Hi" to all the folks who where hunting downstairs.&amp;nbsp; This being my first jaunt into a dungeon, I had no idea what a train was.&amp;nbsp; I stood watching as other players came running by me headed for the zoneline.&amp;nbsp; Then I saw my first train.&amp;nbsp; Soon after I was at my bind point.&amp;nbsp; I don't know how many folks I were run over by the train but I do remember seeing a few naked players headed downstairs.&amp;nbsp; I didn't realize I had caused the train until a few days later after having agro and trains explained to me by some other players.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I can't remember&amp;nbsp; a time i got my grouped wiped, but i remember another character in our group. I was around the 35th level doing a BB Ldon and all was going well.&amp;nbsp; While fighting i noticed the pally casted Flash of Light (or something like it) which if you don't know acts like a fear. The mob ran of and of course came back with many of his best friends. There was like 5 at first but it seemed like they kept coming and coming. We did the best we could but the pally dropped then the chanter and a couple others. I was chasing the druid around trying to get argo and we eventually killed them all. That wasnt the end though.&amp;nbsp; About 10 min later the Sk i think it was pulled not paying attention to adds and got a few people killed, luckily not me again.&amp;nbsp; These are what make EQ a fun game, seriously.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Once I had joined an LDoN adventure in guk.&amp;nbsp; We zoned in, I was designated the puller.&amp;nbsp; I go off and get the first mob and head back to the group (who was at the zi).&amp;nbsp; I turn around and wait and no mob.&amp;nbsp; So I go back up, and the mob isn't there either.&amp;nbsp; I'm thinking...ok...this is strange.&amp;nbsp; So I let the group know that the mob disappeared, and I go back to the group, trying to think what I should do, if I should continue to pull or what.&amp;nbsp; Then I get a sinking feeling, and say to myself..."I think it would be a good idea to zone out to clear aggro".&amp;nbsp; About that time I turn around, and see what must have been every single mob in&amp;nbsp;the entire freaking zone.&amp;nbsp; The entire group wiped, 2 feet from the zoneout.&amp;nbsp; Most never even had a chance to stand up.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I had just come back to the game after a 6 month break and was trying to get back into the guild that I had been in when I left (their rules had changed a bit it seemed in my absence). We were deep in PoEb surrounded by 6 Rathe Councilmen. 5 others were currently being tanked by various brave souls. My job as an enchanter at the time was to see that the Rathe Councilman at my feet was keep under control. Normally during this event, I chat very little and keep my eyes glued to my timer mod. But I was involved in a small conversation with a cleric at the time regarding a buff they did or did not have / want / need. My eye saw the message that my mez spell had been resisted but it didn't reach my brain. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;After 40 more seconds, my Councilman's mez wore off and he proceeded to&amp;nbsp;reduce me, and my 5 other enchanter friends into enchanter paste on the dirt floor of the cavern. Of course, this started a chain reaction that eventually killed everyone in the guild that couldn't escape or feign death. Wipes like this are fairly common when a guild is learning a new encounter, as we were. But this was the first time we had 11 under control, we were just about to kill the 12th one that would allow us to kill the ones we were holding. Had I not missed the message, we would have had our first Rathe kill that and entered PoTime that night instead of weeks later.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;My guild says I am not allowed to speak about the times my being inherently curious (Gee. The area here must be clear. I wonder what it looks like around that corner/over that hill?) has caused issues.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;They stopped taking: "but I just wanted to see what was there" as an excuse when I turned 55.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I think the leader still has a hot key that she uses cause the "OK. We will pull to here. Ready?" (very small pause) "Ranger SIT" comes too quickly to be typed.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I zoned into Fear early once (when the epic mob was&amp;nbsp;pathing past the zoneline. It said hello and it was an all night corpse run) misinterpreting the raid chat.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Camo dropped.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Camo dropped.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The shammy said "DONT HELP THE SHADOW KNIGHT!! LET HIM DIE! HE HAS FEIGN DEATH!" (I only saw two mobs. Rooted one and then there were 4. Oopsie just doesnt cover it.)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The MT switched between identically named&amp;nbsp;mobs and I didnt. Then the enchie mezzed and hooooo boy!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Its a wonder they still let me play :smileysurprised:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>Our Guild was gathering for a Plane of Fire raid just behind first castle, where those 2 phoenix like bird names fly (if up). They have some kind of charm proc. Had my main on autorun, and turned my head to my second char, to get it safe across the wall. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Turned back my head and saw that i somehow came to close to the birds. Tried to stop, but was charmed right away. At once i told my guild, and they kinda laughed... till both birds started to attack the camp. &lt;br&gt;Without the full force and not buffed it was a short fight :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most PPL never really realized what happened and complained that i should have just died, instead of training the camp. Took a while to explain that i had no choice at the time.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Well I hold my head everytime i think of this but hey iwas new to EQ and newer to ldon. I was in a good group in our low 20's and we were blazing a trail through the mistmoore catacombs and talking about getting our next adventure after we finish this one off. Well we were medding in a little corner and me being eternally enthusiastic I was looking around and hiding and sneaking and found this thing in the corner.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I clicked on it and it said something like Spider egg sack&amp;nbsp;and i thought hmmm, wonder what this is. I actually put it in group /shakes head and then clicked on it again and...........BANG!!!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;LOADING PLEASE WAIT...........&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Holy **SMURF**balls batman - end up in butcherblock with 3 other members of my group all asking WTH as happened and me apologising profusely. Everyone died in the end apart from the cleric who managed to keep herself alive. Well not spectacular on a raid scale but it was all my fault. hehe :smileyvery-happy:&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;When&amp;nbsp;I was in the beta (6 years ago... daaaaang), I was playing a warrior in a level-12ish group killing mammoth calves in Everfrost. I pulled one back to the group, then turned around to face it and start&amp;nbsp;laying the smackdown with my uber store-bought halberd. Everyone else was behind the calf or on either side.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;All was well as we carved up the mammoth, until I noticed something approaching us from behind the calf.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Its mom.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Followed closely by its dad&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;The only thing I could type was... "Oh, s***". We were all skewered within seconds. No one else saw it coming. My butt is still sore from the verbal abuse I took... &lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by SubterFuge_7th on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;10-15-2004&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;03:28 PM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;In our guild, we have a Dwarf Paladin named Bordulmer.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;On one of our recent Tuesday&amp;nbsp;Night hunts we had 2 full groups camping outside the Ry'gorr fort in EW. We were not in Raid mode and each group was doing it's own pulls.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;My group was off to the side of the fort killing critters of various kinds. Bordulmer was in the other group who was camping out in front of the fort gates.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Guild chat goes something like this:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;Them: Help!&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;Us: What's happening?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;Them: We're dying!&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So off we go to the rescue. When we got there all I remember seeing is about 5 really big orcs dancing on my corpse just before &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp; appeared in my main chat.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;There were ony 2 survivors. The Froglok Paladin in my group managed to survive by training the Orcs to the Thurg outpost, where the thurg guards only mamaged to slow them down just enough for the frog to make it to the zone line. And I believe the Druid in the other group managed to evac herself but was too late to save her group, they died that fast. The other group contained our only cleric and chanter (they are always in the same group because they are two-boxed).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Bordulmer is now referred to in our guild as Deathpuller as this was not the first time his group had wiped, nor&amp;nbsp;would it be&amp;nbsp;the last. But this was special as he managed to wipe not only his group but ours as well.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;And yet, we still let him pull.... ;)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;There also seems to be a general feeling in my guild for some reason that the night is not complete until the Gnome dies. Dunno why that is... :smileymad:&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Maybe not my greatest wipe and not a wipe I caused, but one of the best times I ever had wiping was a year or so ago, one of the last low-level raids my guild did before it broke up.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;We went to the zone CT and just cleared it like butter.&amp;nbsp; Running through, killing everything in sight, having a good time.&amp;nbsp; Then something bad happened on the way out.&amp;nbsp; I don't know what it was, overconfidence, inattention or what.&amp;nbsp; But there we are in the temple courtyard and suddenly seem to be dozens of critters attacking from all sides.&amp;nbsp; The main enchanter falls over.&amp;nbsp; The main tank.&amp;nbsp; The main cleric.&amp;nbsp; The secondary tank.&amp;nbsp; It was like dominoes, people dropping left and right.&amp;nbsp; Somehow I was low on the agro list and although I am doing what I can as the Jr. Shaman, fighting and healing&amp;nbsp;and announcing the deaths as they happened for those already dead, I made it until about the last 5 people.&amp;nbsp; We all wiped except for the one person (forgetting now if necro, SK or Monk) that managed to avoid agro and FD.&amp;nbsp; There are heaps and piles of bodies everywhere, ours, the mobs... &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;It was great and glorious and we all died fighting valiantly, no one panicked, no one swore, no one got upset.&amp;nbsp; We had a great little naked mini-raid/corpse recovery and laughed and joked at our own expense.&amp;nbsp; It was a good day to die.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Hmm. Was my first major raid with my guild. Forget who we were doing, but my pet got caught in an aoe and I didn't realize it. He went chasing whatever aggroed him, and next thing I know here comes 30 mobs. Wiped out all 56 of us. Was so embarrassed I /q out and didn't log back on for 2 days.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
