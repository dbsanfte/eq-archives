&lt;DIV&gt;EverQuest's 6th Anniversary&lt;BR&gt;--------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;To help celebrate the 6th Anniversary of EverQuest, a fresh scavenger hunt has been added. Check in Firiona Vie, Overthere, or Dreadlands for more on this quest. Finish this challenging hunt and you will receive a potion that doubles your experience for 30 minutes and comes with 10 charges.&lt;BR&gt;Your old friends, the Fabled NPCs have returned to Norrath and bring the fabled versions of their items with them. Look for new Fabled NPCs in your favorite Kunark zones.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;General&lt;BR&gt;--------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;- Increased the spell rune drop rates for Greater Muramite Runes and Glowing Muramite Runes in Muramite Proving Grounds and Riftseeker's Sanctum. &lt;BR&gt;- Reduced the number of mobs that will summon in Veksar.&lt;BR&gt;- Volkara in the Volkara's bite mission has been made a little more challenging.&lt;BR&gt;- The fight against Vishimtar has been made more challenging.&lt;BR&gt;- The Citrine Spell Stone has been renamed to Citrine Spell Bauble.&lt;BR&gt;- Level 20, 40 and 60 Tradeskill Pattern Book Quests for Wood Elves, Kelethin Half-Elves, Dwarves, High Elves and Gnomes have been altered slightly to make them a bit friendlier to complete.&lt;BR&gt;- The encounter with Grinbik in Bloodfields for the Ranger epic has been made a bit less confusing.&lt;BR&gt;- "A shady Highpass citizen" in Highpass will look kindly on you and spread the word on your increased friendship if you complete his tasks.&lt;BR&gt;- Several missions have been tuned to bring their completion time on par with the other DoN missions:&lt;BR&gt;Diving for Lavarocks&lt;BR&gt;Dragon Eggs&lt;BR&gt;Diseased Pumas&lt;BR&gt;- When the task "Keeping the Goblins Out" has been finished you should now get the completion text.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Items&lt;BR&gt;--------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;- The Icefloe Hammer is no longer a 1 handed piercing weapon, it is now 1 handed blunt and the bonus to backstab has been removed.&lt;BR&gt;- The Lance of Engulfing Flame now has a proc instead of a worn spell.&lt;BR&gt;- The Robe of Transcendent Thought has been changed to Drape of Transcendent Thought.&lt;BR&gt;- Various Anguish class leg pieces have been altered.&lt;BR&gt;- Academic's Pants of the Arcanists now has the focus effect "Frost of Anguish".&lt;BR&gt;- The mana preservation focus on several Tacvi chest pieces has been increased slightly.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
