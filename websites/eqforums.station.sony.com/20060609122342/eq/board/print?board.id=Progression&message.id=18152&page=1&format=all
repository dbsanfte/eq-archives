				So what you're saying is "If you want PVP raise your hand, and if you don't like PVP you're not allowed to post here" Well guess what, just like every other monotinous PVP topic you people keep making over and over and over, this one is going to have opposing viewpoints. Deal with it.<p>Message Edited by Cougra on <span class=date_text>06-08-2006</span> <span class=time_text>10:00 PM</span>

				<P>For me EQ is my PVE game and if I want PvP I play SWG or WoW. But of the PvP servers I liked the ruleset for Sullon Zek, I had a Beastlord 40ish lvl and a Ranger 30ish lvl there.</P>
<P>As far as people against PvP posting in the PvP topics I dont care, do what I do in any topic I read. If its a flame or negative statement then I just scroll through it and dont respond to it. Focusing on the relevant information.</P>

<P><BR>&nbsp;</P>Actually, I think that turning in the books is a great idea providing that there are enough folks out there that want to play the pvp game.&nbsp; It would certainly show the Devs that there is enough interest to make a new server for it worthwhile and if there really is enlough players that want to PvP in combine then the red players will still have no problem finding grps with other red players.&nbsp; Therewould only be problems finding grps if there are not enough players to make it a viable way to play the game and that seems to be the crux of the issue.&nbsp; So make a statement, when combine goes live, all the pvpers should turn in their books and see if there are really enough of you to warrant another server.
