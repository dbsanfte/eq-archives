      <title>For the last time, good night King of Dreams</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Morell&amp;message.id=214#M214</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I got surprisingly emotional here in the last hours.&amp;nbsp; I know that I will wake up tomorrow and when I log in, all my characters will be exactly where I left them, but it doesn't feel that way.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;MT has been my home for 5 years.&amp;nbsp; It has taken me up and down and around and round.&amp;nbsp; It led me to my RL husband, and RL friends, and many many game friends.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Almost exactly to the day, 5 years ago Ice ran from Halas to freeport with her friends, Mictian the warrior, and the rogue Saedrianna.&amp;nbsp; We were all around 10.&amp;nbsp; For those that don't remember, there were corpse runs at that age then, we (what we?&amp;nbsp; I was the only caster) also had to stare at our spell books to mem.&amp;nbsp; Mictian suffered under the curse of the Player Killer and had been given the task to make the run, picking up certain things along the way.&amp;nbsp; Since he was a red name, no buffs would land on him.&amp;nbsp; So, although Ice had SoW we couldn't use it.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;We had to fight our way to Blackburrow and through Blackburrow.&amp;nbsp; Zoning into West Karana we were attacked by a werewolf and died.&amp;nbsp; So then three blind naked barbs had to run to West Karana again.&amp;nbsp; I think it was a Griff that got us in East Karana.&amp;nbsp; At High Keep I paid for binds for the rogue and I.&amp;nbsp; We managed to run through orcs and into Kithicor, funny how it was always night when you came to Kithicor.&amp;nbsp; But not to fear, we had sense heading to spam and friends to talk to.&amp;nbsp; We made it to Freeport eventually, the run took us about 5 hours all told.&amp;nbsp; At least that's what the memory says.&amp;nbsp; Lirus him/herself came to remove the curse from Mictian, for those that don't remember in those days we had server GMs and Lirus was ours.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Tonight Mictian and Ice made the run again.&amp;nbsp; It was much easier this time, we are older&amp;nbsp;now and&amp;nbsp;know the way like the back of our hands.&amp;nbsp; We went with no buffs, running at&amp;nbsp;warrior speed.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Saedrianna is long gone from the server.&amp;nbsp; First she turned into the shaman Cassandramarie and then the bard Aching.&amp;nbsp; Then she left the server for Tallon Zek and from there left the game.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Along the run we remember our many friends who have left the game.&amp;nbsp; Honest Onpur/Squiggle, Brodee, Crichton, Gaelioth, Amergyn, Thyil, Thaleson, Fenrick, the Fumbles, so many to name and remember.&amp;nbsp; I miss you all (even the many I did not mention here).&amp;nbsp; We also took joy in our friends that are stil with us.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I look forward to new memories and new friends.&amp;nbsp; But I will forever cherish my time on Morell-Thule.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Good night to all, and good morning to Erollisi Marr. Tomorrow will be a brand new day for all of us.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp; It is with a sad &amp;amp; heavy heart that I post this message. With the server merging with E-Marr I find myself weighing what will happen to both servers once the merger happens. I have played on MT for over 5 years, it was my 1st &amp;amp; only home for years. I agree with Tayana that the dynamics will be totaly wrong for me &amp;amp; that I have no choice but to leave MT after the server merger. I too will be moving to Maelin Starpyre as I have found it to be shades of MT past &amp;amp; everytime I play there I keep having flashbacks to when I 1st started playing Everquest. Kinda like a War vet when he comes home, but in a good &amp;amp; familiar way. I am going to miss everyone I have been lucky enough to meet &amp;amp; had the pleasure of training in the ways of the druid. You are all good friends &amp;amp; will NEVER be forgotten. That being said, I want to thank all those that have given me help in the past with my epic &amp;amp; Misc. other quest that I could not do alone. I will always give help on my new home, as I always have. I am Tyrg, I will help you.&amp;nbsp;I DO hope I see old friends on Maelin Starpyre after the server merger but nevertheless I will remember &amp;amp; miss you all. &amp;nbsp;With that, I bid thee all good hunting &amp;amp; safe be the journey&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;I have played on Mt faithfully for 5 years and it is a sad day when it will no longer exist. I have enjoyed all the people i have met and played with , laughed with, cryed with, and cared for over the past 5 years. You guys were my first and only experiance in eq for so many years. You are like a second family to me and i will always cherish my time on MT.&amp;nbsp; Since the server merger, I have taken time to try the different servers out to see which i like the best.&amp;nbsp; I didn't really care for the player dynamics on Emarr and have decided that the best course for me would be to opt for the character transfer to a new server. I have chosen Maelin Starpyre for my new home as i have played there and met alot of great people. it has nice dynamics, a freindly server, and lots of great people as well. I will miss you all and maybe i will see a few familiar faces on Maelin after May 16th. I would like to thank you all for being there for me, for helping when it was needed and for being a great family. You will all be in my hearts.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;I have a web site up with a Morell-Thule Tribute movie - please give it a try at:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#22229c&gt;www.flyinguineapig.com/mt_trib/about.html&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Be sure to turn your sound on. Kind of dull without it.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If you have any problems with viewing the movie, please let me know a bit about what went wrong - what browser you were using, and if you have Microsoft Windows Media Player installed. I've tried it on a few different systems, but there's always some bugs lurking.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I got stuff from quite a few different folks - those in Rev include Gibb, Asmo, Appox and Skylight. Got a lot of help from Crystilla of PE, Naad, and Solicia of Eye of Darkness. Carlissa and Tressia sent in a great pic or two as well. There are a few more folks as well (my apologies if I left you off the list).&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Enjoy - if you like, make a posting in the Guestbook.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>With again the advent of Fabled and lack of ability to get any help, I canceled my account.  As I logged my chars in to dress them up in what was best I had, last in was my cleric.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;I logged her in, looked over the bank and selected all my Ethereal armor drops from plane of hate, beautiful it still is. I then looked took a few screen shots, sat, hit the camp button. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With 15 seconds to go i burst out crying and had some pretty hefty chest pains that lasted about 3 hours. those did go away but not the heartack of so much time and wonder put into getting the cleric where she is and now its all gone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With the merger, its kind of fitting, to say goodbyes here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So long everquest, I did love you, prehaps a little too much...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-- played since dec 1999.</description>

      <description>Ello Mates,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ghorgon Toejammer here lvl 66 warr of mt, i been away for a few months and was hopin to know how things on mt are going. I have many friends that i hope are still there. And plan on if not joining then starting my own guild. No name for it yet, The guild will be a guild that will have raids but they will be scheduled after I speak with the members of the guild to see where and at what time would be best for them to raid. The guild will not be Tolerant of mischeif and officers will be chosen by me. Far as level cap, there has not been one set for the time being. But in the guild I would like to see peeps that help others regardless of lvl and or if they are in the guild or not. That be the short and sweet of it for this time thank you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ghorgon Toejammer ;v; 66 warrior of morrell thule</description>

      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Morell&amp;message.id=199#M199</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Maybe it was a function of everyone running around trying to do the anniversery events but I played everyday this weekend and the biggest group I got was&amp;nbsp; duo with a member of my guild, and even that was only for about an hour.&amp;nbsp; I get just over an hour a night to play and have spent many nights lately sitting on my duff in PoK for 30 minutes then sucking it up and soloing for the remaining hour for lousy XP just so I get some playing in.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I&amp;nbsp;would like to try some of the instanced zones of DoN and the missions systems to start earning crystals but you can't get a group on MT to go in to DoN.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I have had DoN since release day and have yet to try a mission as very few people seem to head out there and&amp;nbsp;it won't let me try a mission with less than 3 (if like LDoN&amp;nbsp; even a well rounded group of 3 that are used to playing together would get wiped anyway so do you really wanna try with out a full group?).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Perpetually LFG on MT. &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>Last month worked out pretty well I think, so I'll try it again for January.  If you didn't win last month, or even if you did, you can try again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So again, post why I should give you 20kpp, and what you would do with it.  There's no judgement here, and no particular reason is better than another.  You can write a little, or you can write a lot; however, the better it's written the better your chances.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The rules are:&lt;br&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's my contest, so I reserve the right to change the rules.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You must post your toon name.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That toon has to meet me (or my proxy) in Rivervale to pick up the prize.  If you are kos we'll work something out.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Your post has to be dated before 12:00am PST, February 1st.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you can't use paragraphs, then you'd better only post a few lines.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br&gt;Again, this is for real, and don't send me tells in game.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Good luck,&lt;br&gt;Fenny Frenzy</description>

      <title>Incoming Summit</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Morell&amp;message.id=145#M145</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Hey there MTers.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I was thrilled to be offered an invite to the upcoming January Summit. I've already expressed my main interests and concerns in a post on the Veteran's Board.&amp;nbsp; Briefly, I am most concerned about the mid level game and in getting and keeping new players in the game, particularly "casual" players.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;But...&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I do have friends all across the server, including the high end game.&amp;nbsp; I know the general concerns they have, on the message boards here, and follow a couple other forums as well.&amp;nbsp; Still, please let me know if you have any particular issues or concerns.&amp;nbsp; I can't say that I personally might share those issues, but I am trying to have a wide range of comments and concerns to draw upon.&amp;nbsp; I do believe strongly that there is a place for all classes and all levels and all play styles and there should be content for all.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I'd prefer to get MT feedback in this thread or in private tells.&amp;nbsp; Or, I can be contacted in game although it might not always be a good time.&amp;nbsp; I am most likely to be in game weekends (pretty much off and on all weekend), evenings Pacific time, although sometimes I am on weekdays morning (8-2ish pacific time).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Currently, other than Iceblossom, the most likely to be played alts are Twyggie, Mewlin, Shezi, and Gemjoy, although that list is subject to change without notice :p&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;You can also pop into the /join serverwide.eqlive:TNZ chat channel, if I am in the game in any character on any server, I will be in channel 99% of the time.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>I don't do anything with my plat so I thought I'd see if someone else would.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Post here why I should give you 20kpp, and what you would do with it.  I don't really care what your reasons are, but the better its written the better.  You can post a little, or you can post a lot.  I'm the judge here so if I like your post then you're the winner.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some rules:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1.  This is my contest, I reserve the right to change the rules.  I'm pretty fair though.&lt;br&gt;2.  You must post your toon name.&lt;br&gt;3.  That toon has to meet me (or my proxy) at the Rivervale bank to pick up the 20kpp.&lt;br&gt;4.  You must post before the end of the month; I will make a post stating that no further posts will be considered.&lt;br&gt;5.  If you can't use paragraphs, then you'd better only post a few lines.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yes this is for real, and don't send me tells in game.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Good luck,&lt;br&gt;Fenny Frenzy</description>

      <title>Another guild has fallen to the flagging grind direction EQ has taken</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Morell&amp;message.id=124#M124</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Exiled Gatekeepers is disbanding.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The direction of the game itself has discouraged me. EQ with its flagging requirements in order to advance into the zones and in the game is tough on the casual gamer and tough on the family guild who wants to share in that high end game experience.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Not having access to the zones that I have paid for because I don't have the time to put in the grind required to get there has taken away from the fun of the game.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Many of us have seen the ugliness of guild competition to get to those flagging mobs required to advance. Gathering enough of a force to try to beat some other guild to the rare spawn mob __001 has brought out the worst in some people. Just look at rants once in a while and you can see what I mean.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In order to succeed, you must be able to commit to a ton of raiding hours and if you cant, then you stagnate. The game, in my opinion works well for those who can commit those hours but it discourages those who can't.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This is only my opinion and does not neccessarily reflect that of the other members of EG but I feel that strategy is lost in everquest. Anyone who can commit to the hours and the grind will succeed, but if you cant commit, then it doesnt matter how skilled you are at your class, or how nice of a person you are, or how well intentioned you are, you will not advance.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;My epic was the perfect example. The last drop I needed was the shattered emerald in hate. I led raid after raid and did not get the drop. When the zone revamped I managed to gather groups on a consistant basis and led people in killing place holder after place holder.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Five months later, I got the drop. Persistance was the key. It had nothing to do with my skill or abilities, nothing to do with leadership or strategy. It was all about the grind. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Play the lottery long enough and eventually you should win something but in the end you will most likely find that you put in more than you got back.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Again I'm only speaking for myself but I suspect many others feel the same.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Exiled Gatekeepers. Thank you for letting me be a part of your history. Thank you for all your understanding when real life issues took me away from the game. We had our share of fights, quarrels and squabbles, but we also had some very rewarding victories and memories.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;/Salute officers and members of a very fine guild&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Norag&lt;BR&gt;Sanaty&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;It's probably a silly question, but is Ezboards down?&amp;nbsp; Does someone have a direct link to the calendar for checking planes reservations?&amp;nbsp; I would appreciate it very much, thank you &amp;nbsp;:)&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
