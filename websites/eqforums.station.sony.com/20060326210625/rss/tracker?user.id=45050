      <description>The game does thrive off great variety in group content. You can not sit there and expect to be stuck choosing from one class to fill one needed role. The trinity is dead and that is good. As far as casolidation....well that is just putting it back into the game by elminating that variety and might as well go play Diablo 2 because that is what your class choices are put at.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THe thing with unstandard groups is that they can be based off the skill of the players in the group and the content. All content does need to be based off a standard. As it was Cleric, Warrior, chanter/shaman back in the day it has turned into tank, healer, and slower....far more balanced now then it was back in Velious days imo and getting 3 classes to fill a role isn't that hard and allows for greater flexability in game play imo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SOE has always designed content around the need of these roles, with exception of slower but is a standard now and may or may not be a standard later.....something else might take its place like puller. All classes do need to see content to be somewhat valuable in but not "needed", need is to restrictive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unconventional groups aren't trying to be elimanated, they just weren't ever designed towards to begin with. It is like soloing really....soloing content was never designed it just came out of other class power and older content.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

      <description>That sounds like a community issue not an actual class balance issue. Sorry if a casual warrior wants a BoBB equivalant then he is going to have to put a little more work into it then just DoN's that don't shell out much better gear then elementals. *shrug* &lt;br&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I am pretty sure he took most of that into account. The problem I think raid warriors face inparticualr is that they have to go high hp compared to AC on the bases of you can only mitagate so much. Don't get me wrong AC is really nice and I am not trying to through out the benefits at all, but&amp;nbsp;as mobss start hitting harder the need to the hp so you&amp;nbsp;can have enough of a hp pool for a heal to land. I don't think translate well to group environment where the extra hp buffer isn't as needed and AC gets some good value back.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;For mobs that hit for 5k or more the hp buffer starts to become very valueable becuase there is only so far AC can go before that hp buffer needs to start to&amp;nbsp;get bigger. Because of the warrior DI advantage this works out well in raid areas. Knights don't really worry about this issue because they aren't thrown against such mobs. You go towards the group environment where warriors have made their armor reflect the need for higher hp buffer against the AC buffers knights build becuase htey don't need much and you see some problems.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Again this is not saying AC is not important, in fact it is quite the opposite....but hp does mean a lot on the buffer because AC only goes so far.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Really, for anyone doing itemization they will have a hard time trying to come up with a good system unless they have knowledge of the environments and needs of each class. EQ rookies needs not apply&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;No they don't... they just need a difficulty scale.&amp;nbsp; Give a mob a difficulty rating, then take an item from a different mob, and copy/paste their loot table, adding or subtracting ratio, ac, stats, resists,&amp;nbsp;and effects based on the comparative difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Class specific items would need more focus, but you just need to compare the popular class items that already exist, and try to follow a trend....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Even taken those in consideation that will not solve much of anything really, people still complain that it is to much, not enough, total clueless itemization, want somehting different, etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No matter how well you do itemization people will complain because how useful an item is because it is subjective to the indivdual.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think the person who did itemization is only human and idd some mistakes, but other then that did quite well. It is just mainly no mater how you approach it or how oyu handle it people will complain about the risk vs reward, beneifit to the class, and bias gear on other class.....you know sort of like class balancing but your being judged by every single peice of itemization with every different view of the classes roles, abilties, and strengths.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>I would consider that most aggro generation in general needs some work, from those who generate to much and those whoe don't who don't generate enough.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THough I do think the reasonable solution to the casual warrior is itemization, although some would disagree.....cause currently if the CoA monk, ranger is taking aggrto well they are usually tanking over the casual warrior or/and knight. Usually a casaul tank is tanking for most people in progression *shrug* &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Think there needs to be some open access to at least some Time quality hate focus effects, and I mean make them common through Tradeskills (be it augs or what have you) of via DoN. Symbol of the Plainmaster warrior only clicky, common drop in some area. Smaller, cheaper but quicker reuse hate discs...the Slice type discs need a little twinking with hate (about 400 to 500 hate, about as much as a hybrids nuke hate) to be almost a good solution. If anything it needs to also be something that scales back to 50.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;High end warriors I don't think have many issues, but an upgradde to BBoB is needed. Though fixing taunt will help all tank classes in the long run more then anything.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rangers in general need some detaunting help, jolt does not cut compared to what they dish out in swing hate....it is ungodly how much aggro they can generate at any level of the game. It literally becomes&amp;nbsp; a hinderance for some. I almost say they need melee concussions and a heavy spell detaunt with a high resist mod to do the job.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Monks just need to learn stun procs bad and to dragon fang less often :P&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most caster classes usually have a good handle on their aggro, except for a few over zealous ones that need beaten with a stick. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In many ways though I think the hate on Tash line of spells need seriously reduced for chanters. It like malo is what keeps them and shaman from beastlords slow and should remain their advantage. Not much of an advantage if it is more of a hinderance to cast then it is a helpful spell, do to the high aggro it generates.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wizards need some serious work of course in hate deaggro abilities, but a solution escapes me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

Nearly to the point of uselessness. The enchanter class has changed from almost a necessary position in a group to a sacrifice spot when you can't find a beastlord or shaman. The latter two generate a great deal more DPS than an enchanter could ever hope to possess while still managing to slow a mob. Granted, I do not know much about the enchanter class anymore. Such is what happens when I get better use out of Elemer's shaman....&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;I haven't really meet anyone who thought getting a chanter was a sacrifice over a beastlord or shaman, nor have I meet anyone who thought it was a sacrifice to take any of the slow classes over the other, DPS or no DPS. Each one of the 3 classes make this claim but yet I have never seen it myself. Course with DoDH and PoR I have seen a lot of content having a chanter is very useful in the CC department....course I always did a lot of content where CC was useful even in OOW and DoDH.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am not saying chanters don't have issues but I am saying that SOE more and likely won't be fixing them by eliminating the abilities all together cause of&amp;nbsp; wording in the class description. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>My point is that the "definitions" aren't the total some of the classes nor are they really a clear cut definition of the classes as much as a very brief description. There is more to each class and more abilities that each one can due that can be summed up into 2 paragraphs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They could have put a lot of the brief class decriptions in better terms and point some of the stronger points out on a lot of them, but all in short I doubt these descriptions really change the focus of the classes as much as peopel amke them out to be.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

      <description>Mock shouldn't really be a hard press upgrade to bazu, people are looking at the difference in expansions but should be looking at level you get the abilities. Hardly any class gets a upgrade to an ability right at the next level. Bazu is at 69 and Mock is 70.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now I think Mock should be a more instant grap hate disc over bazus over time. Mock should be more of a group disc but in order for that to be somewhat effective they need a few more discs that they can throw in on top of this with little extra cost.....think it would be good to throw in discs that are already on test, discs such as &lt;a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4605&amp;amp;source=Live" target=_blank&gt;Slice&lt;/a&gt; or do somehting with the recourse effect on Mock to make it a bit more applicable. But anything there should be a downgrade version of mock through out the warrior history starting about level 50 to even out some aggro issues those levels can have.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

      <description>Looking at most of the descriptions I think they just tried to keep them all down in 2 paragraphs. It would be hard to list all an enchanter let alone what a lot of classes can do in 2 paragraphs and not leave anything out. Course they can choose better things to mention then say illusions *shrug*&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even though they left alot fo stuff out of class descriptions I am sure alot of classes won't lose traits they haev been known for a while. I mean you see solo gone from a lot of classes well known for it but doubtful you will see these classes lose the ability to solo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

      <description>Well considering orignally the aura was 5% every tick and capped, a straight 3% has more potential really.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;Yeah Shamno but Sony has again snapped the rubber band back the other way too far.&amp;nbsp; Knights are tanking group content better than warriors.&amp;nbsp; Low, mid, high end.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;And B, Lets not spout some crap that its impossible to balance the high end toons.&amp;nbsp; If warriors really were tanking so much better in group content than knights at the high end, you'd be screaming bloody murder to balance the classes.&amp;nbsp; I don't really want to go check GoD threads for anything you posted but I suppose I could look around if you were playing then.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Warriors need enough raw mitigation to have a noticeable yet not insurmountable tanking advantage over a knight's net tank/spellbook mitigation.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

while others see it as a catch phrase for warrior only tanking in all&#xD;
content."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There's no alternative meaning for "unmatched survivability". Which word are you having problems with Shammo? "Unmatched"? Unmatched means without equal. "Survivability"? The ability to not die.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So in words that even you ought to be capable of understanding it menas that the ability of Warriors not to die when tanking the most dangerous creatures is unequaled.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It doesn't mean simply taking less damage with no other effect than that. It means not &lt;u&gt;dying&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It doesn't mean Warriors are the only tanks, just that when facing harder hitting opponents, we &lt;u&gt;die&lt;/u&gt; less frequently - we're easisr to keep &lt;u&gt;alive&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's no more immaterial than the statement that Warriors can use all weapons and Knights many weapons. Many does not equal all. The capability to stand in front of a mob and obtaining aggro does not preclude Knights from having &lt;u&gt;less ability to survive&lt;/u&gt; that experiance than Warriors. The ability of Knights to use many weapons is not the same as the ability of Warriors to use all weapons.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Git'it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;What I get is the explanation explained after this post. What I understand is that the warrior definition has changed as well...read it and you will see a good key phrase missing sir.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://everquest.station.sony.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
