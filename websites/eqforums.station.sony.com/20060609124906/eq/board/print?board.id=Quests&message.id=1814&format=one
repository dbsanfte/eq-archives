Maybe you could replace or update the current low mid range (what level are they now anyway) class quests we have now, anyone remember crafted armor, as well as add more for higher up. This was sorta brought up in the summit but maybe you can put it into the number 2 spot since we have no consensus here (I think we had a good consensus there).

<P>I don't know.&nbsp; I think it's better to wing the people off of the armor progression quests about at 20 or so because that's about the time in which they can actually start getting their own upgrades&nbsp; as well as gain money reasonably fast enough to start buying or making better armor.&nbsp; Having these quests go all the way to lvl 50 would be more harmful than helpful.&nbsp; People would start getting to 50 and hit a brick wall when it comes to how to upgrade their character.&nbsp; Post 50 the upgrades are more sensitive to how well you preform than they are from 20-50.&nbsp; I'd rather have 20 or 30 levels to spend actually learning how to best to choose what is a good upgrade when making bad choices isn't going to be nearly as costly as it will no be if you don't have to start learning until you're over lvl 50 when many&nbsp;armor upgrades cost more than most level 50-60 players can make in a week while playing normally.</P>

I think more quests that go into the task system would be awesome, id love to see moving/adding more quest into the task system. At least as a replacement for having to use the journal or notes for simple stuff like what was it that guy said again.<BR>

<DIV>The main thing I have against the task window is that eliminates completely the need to solve anything.&nbsp; The task quests are simply presolved quests with ingame walk throughs.&nbsp; There is nothing at all to figure out.&nbsp; Tasks are tasks not quests.&nbsp; In case someone doesn't understand what I mean, tasks are a list of things that someone told you what exactly to do and you go do them.&nbsp; But a quest is something that you get asked to go do, but you have to figure out some of what needs to be done yourself, yes you're told some things directly but other things you have to think out yourself or solve a riddle or make a jump of faith based on a subtle hint in the text.&nbsp; The best quests have always been the ones which the community had to help each other to solve each step.&nbsp; So unless they include something that requires players to figure something particular out at a variety of steps anything moved or added to the task system will not be a quest&nbsp;but a task. </DIV>
