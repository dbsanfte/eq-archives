      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;/rant on&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a &lt;b&gt;combat zone&lt;/b&gt; that is why you are getting hit with AE spells, that is why you died. Go to POK and AFK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will still get your reward and will have time to run back for a chest drop if you get one. Get out of the way this is a &lt;b&gt;Combat zone&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;/rant off&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those of you that do not know it there is a DOD mission that can be soloed by certain classes and the full group still gets the rewards. People seem to be not stop farming this mission lately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is of the few areas that at level 70. I can solo at while LFG or in short periods of time and still make some decent AA experience. For over a week now it has been almost impossible to solo here because of all the toons standing around AFK waiting for their reward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if you would AFK up on the wall away from quest NPC you will still get your reward. Please to not stand in the middle of the only open area in zone. Also when you are standing by the quest npc you are in pull path. The area is not large enough to pull AE casters away from you. They stay there and cast because they can hit me with spells from that distance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am loosing my patience with you AFk farmers and am liable to start fighting there again. I also would like to bring group there to fight too, but it’s hard to do with all the AFK people standing in the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;font face="Arial" size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This post was in no way promoting training nor was it a threat to train anybody.  I was just asking people to be a little considerate of others while farming these missions.  When to many show up and get in the way I just leave and find something else to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I am asking is that you people that are farming this mission to please be considerate and not AFK in others way.   I have had complaints about me fighting there had have been ask  to leave, even though I was there fighting before they showed up. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

A nice AoE and a bard to AFK tank? Sweet. If you kept your DPS down you would be able to kill the mobs before he died. You could always leave him there, thats not training, that nature taking it's course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would not be an training incident, he obviously started the AoE song to tag mobs. Why not help him get those faction hits and contribute to DPS. Sure you can have a rez, just do it again, and again, and again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I thought bards learned not to AoE in the wrong place at first or second level?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I've seen this happen in a few zones.  It somewhat reminds me of the numerous times I've been kiting, only to have someone else come to my camp area, and attempt to kite beside me--and then complain when a pull gets crossed and 1) they die, or 2) their mob gets killed for attacking our group. I often wonder how many people do this in real life: Go to a restaurant where there are 20 open tables, and sit down at the one table that already has an occupant, claiming that it's their world, and they can go where they want to.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Back to the AFK thing, likely at the Sabotage mission in Stoneroot:  What's amusing is that people will spend quite awhile arguing about someone training them, yet won't take the three seconds to move to a safe location along the wall before AFK'ing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some people just have a complaint quota, I guess.  They aren't happy unless they're being persecuted for lacking foresight or intelligence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;A thought occurred to me (yes, it happens :P)... are the victims really even afk though?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;As if the trainers check to see how long someone has been sitting there before training....&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;If these people are kiting these spots regularly as part of routine hunting, then either the people being trained have to have been there first, or had to have arrived after the kiting started? If the former, then why does the kiter have the right to kite over them? If the latter, then they are not AFK are they? Unless you are going to try to argue that they got there while afk too, and that they always manage to travel about in EQ while afk...&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;It is easy to say someone you just&amp;nbsp;trained 'must have been afk' ... how do they disprove it after the fact?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Oh, and as for 'playing the game'... RL happens. Are you going to try to tell me that you log out every time you have to use the washroom? Or heat up some leftovers to eat while playing? Or answer the door? There is some risk in going AFK, but that risk is not normally considered to be that someone will knowingly train you not merely to avoid death but because they think their right to kite is greater than your right to stand in an otherwise safe place while AFK.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The implication that the AFK people are 'soaking up xps.' is again, just an assumption. If it is a task or mission, then they could be in PoK and get the xps (or if an MM, they would have to loot a crystal from in mission and could not be afk to do that). If they are being PL'd conventionally, the source of the xps has to be close, and would also likely be hit by the train. It can be argued that being PL'd is also 'not playing the game' but that arguement only appiles to those being PL'd not those doing the PL'ing, and also would not apply in boxing situations.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;So again, just rationalizations on the part of the trainer as to why the zone is 'theirs,' and why (in their opinion) they should be able to train anyone they wish who gets in their way.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;First off, they're not being "trained".&amp;nbsp; In general this discussion is about people going AFK in places commonly used for kiting, or PvE in general.&amp;nbsp; If they happen to get agro for being stupidly AFK and die, they weren't trained.&amp;nbsp; If you go AFK at a zone in, by now you should know that accidental trains can occur, and if you're trained the ONLY complaint you might have for going AFK at a zone in spot, is IF the person leading the train didn't happen to /shout Train to zone, but of course, you were AFK anyway so you wouldn't of seen it, so does it really matter?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
If these people are kiting these spots regularly as part of routine hunting, then either the people being trained have to have been there first, or had to have arrived after the kiting started? If the former, then why does the kiter have the right to kite over them? If the latter, then they are not AFK are they? Unless you are going to try to argue that they got there while afk too, and that they always manage to travel about in EQ while afk...&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;If I'm kiting/quadding anywhere and you're stupid enough to stop right in my path, you are a dumb ass and deserve any amount of death this game can inflict upon you.&amp;nbsp; If you stop in the middle of a well known kiting area and do nothing for an extended period of time, 30 seconds to minutes to hours, if you're not doing anything not even pulling, then I --will-- pull mobs and kite that area.&amp;nbsp; If you're not AFK, it's no big deal unless something unexpected happens and I have to leave, if that happens, you're not AFK anyway so you can deal with the situation appropriately, so it's a wash.&amp;nbsp; However, if you expect anyone to pass up a prime kiting area because you happen to be in the middle of it doing nothing, you're sadly mistaken.&amp;nbsp; Trust me, your presence, or lack there of, in a kiting area makes ZERO difference to the decision making process of whether or not I will kite that area when you're obviously doing absolutely NOTHING with the area.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
It is easy to say someone you just&amp;nbsp;trained 'must have been afk' ... how do they disprove it after the fact?&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The fact that tells were sent with no response is a good indicator.&amp;nbsp; Another good indicator would be having had several kite's pass over them without issue, or their moving, or any tells from them, would be a good indicator.&amp;nbsp; Also, perhaps standing there getting beat on by mobs easily escapable by anyone with runspeed 5, or a sow potion, doing nothing to defend themselves or making ANY attempt at getting away would ALSO be another indicator.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
Oh, and as for 'playing the game'... RL happens. Are you going to try to tell me that you log out every time you have to use the washroom? Or heat up some leftovers to eat while playing? Or answer the door? There is some risk in going AFK, but that risk is not normally considered to be that someone will knowingly train you not merely to avoid death but because they think their right to kite is greater than your right to stand in an otherwise safe place while AFK.&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;One thing I DON'T do is stop in the middle of a PvE zone.&amp;nbsp; I'll park my butt in the closest obscure corner available that I can, make sure I'm invis, put up my AFK tag (cause it's a blue server).&amp;nbsp; If I can't find one, I have other options, INCLUDING options available to EVERYONE else, a GATE potion for example.&amp;nbsp; If I happen to be with a group, I'll put one of them on autofollow, let my group know I have to afk for a moment and take my chances.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;See it's not up to EVERYONE ELSE around you to garuntee your safety just because YOUR reallife happens to impose on EVERYONE ELSE'S play time.&amp;nbsp; You're not allowed to be that self-centered.&amp;nbsp; There is no "King of Earth" and even if there was such a position, I doubt the "King of Earth" would bother playing EQ.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;Except that perspective ignores the converse view, which is that people are kiting in otherwise essentially safe AFK/gathering/group rally spots. After all this is not about people going AFK in the middle of a zone and getting killed by a wanderer. The implication being made is that the kiter has more right to be there than the person going AFK. On what basis?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;

&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Only true if the mobs normally path through that area. If they were brought be someone else, they were trained. That is what 'trained' means. Even if noone is hit, it is still a train....&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp; If you go AFK at a zone in, by now you should know that accidental trains can occur, and if you're trained the ONLY complaint you might have for going AFK at a zone in spot, is IF the person leading the train didn't happen to /shout Train to zone, but of course, you were AFK anyway so you wouldn't of seen it, so does it really matter?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Zone ins are a separate case... Zones do have 'train tracks,' and I do not have much sympathy for anyone who is on one but killed... unless the train contains see invis mobs.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The reality is that happens rarely, yet is being presented here like that is what is the case in most such deaths.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp; If you stop in the middle of a well known kiting area and do nothing for an extended period of time, 30 seconds to minutes to hours, if you're not doing anything not even pulling, then I --will-- pull mobs and kite that area.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;You end that with 'hours' but start with '30 seconds'.. which implies you do not care, you just start kiting.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp; If you're not AFK, it's no big deal unless something unexpected happens and I have to leave, if that happens, you're not AFK anyway so you can deal with the situation appropriately, so it's a wash.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P **SMURF**"MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P **SMURF**"MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"&gt;You are not afk.. you suddenly get blindsided by one more more mobs in any of the newer zones. Unless you are VERY well geared, or can FD/escape successfully (not a given considering lag and the fact you were blindsided), 'deal with the situation appropriately' likely means 'summon corpse at lobby and curse a lot.' But since it is not you being blindsided, that doesn't bother you at all, I guess?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P **SMURF**"MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp; However, if you expect anyone to pass up a prime kiting area because you happen to be in the middle of it doing nothing, you're sadly mistaken.&amp;nbsp; Trust me, your presence, or lack there of, in a kiting area makes ZERO difference to the decision making process of whether or not I will kite that area when you're obviously doing absolutely NOTHING with the area.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Translation, irrespective of who else is there, if they do not pull immediately (30 seconds) the spot is yours, and and anyone else there, even if there deserve anything they get for not playing your way? Even if they were just there waiting for the rest of a party to get there to pull and kill conventionally? In other words, other people mean 'NOTHING' to you? How your actions affect others make 'ZERO difference to you', because that is 'your' spot? You are right of course.... how dare anyone interfere with your 'prime kiting....' Who do they think they are? Fellow players or something?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;A bit earlier you said you would base your decision to kite over them on whether you thought they were afk too long or not (which can appearantly be as short as 30 seconds!). You say nothing about sending them tells, or giving them a reasonable amount of time to respond.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Where are these mobs 'easily escapable with a sow potion' though? You kiting in a newbie zone? You also again discount lag and the disadvantage of being hit by surprise.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;If this was happening 'in the middle of a PVE zone' as you suggest, then kiting would not likely be an issue. Wanderers would be killing them off. So please, quit misrepresenting the situation. Kiters look for 'safe' areas where there will not be unwanted adds. Coincidentally, the same kinds of places where it would otherwise be good to gather and form up a party, or to afk if needed. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;It is up to everyone else to take into account the fact that they are not playing EQ alone. You seem to feel that it is ok for you to impose on someone else, because appearantly if you do not impose on everyone else, if you actually care about the well being of anyone besides yourself, then appearantly that means they are 'imposing' on you.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;No, they do not own the zone either. But my point was that such people are not going to be parking themselves in some random dangerous spot. They do not need to. It is counter-productive. Why would they travel all the way to a dangerous zone to afk for something they could have waited in PoK for? Or if being conventionally PL'd, then why is the person PLing them strangely absent? They cannot get conventional xps if they are too far away from the fight and/or puller.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The more I think about this, the more unlikely the claim that such people were afk at all seems.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;That is like saying that if a car runs a red light or is speeding and cannot stop in time that is entirely my fault I was hit, since driving is otherwise ok, and I should have known better than to cross the street, even if the light was in my favour.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Or if someone started shooting randomly (deliberately) at a rifle range and I got hit, that it was&amp;nbsp;entirely my fault for being at a rifle range, even if I was in the lodge, and not even outdoors, that the shooter is not guilty at all.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;Alternatively, if they started repeatedly training you, and a GM managed to witness that (they use GM stealth functions for such purposes), that would nail him too.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;You missed a scenario though... what if he sets up next to you, he has a bad pull, dies too close to your camp, and effectively trains you? Would&amp;nbsp;you consider that&amp;nbsp;your fault because you should have moved out of his way?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;Like I said, respecting camp areas is a two way street.&amp;nbsp; You should respect camp areas by not pulling too close to other people, and you should respect areas where people are pulling to.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The way I see it...&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;If you're pulling through or very close to another group, you're endangering them and being disrespectful.&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;if you&amp;nbsp;go AFK&amp;nbsp;or set yourself up in an active kite/pull area, you're endangering yourself and being disrespectful.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;You keep acting like people shouldn't&amp;nbsp;be designating kite/pull areas where it might be dangerous to AFK.... but who gave you or any amount of the community the right to designate safe areas where people can't play?&lt;/P&gt;</description>
