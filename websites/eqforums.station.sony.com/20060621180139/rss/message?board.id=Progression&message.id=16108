      <description>&lt;div&gt;It wont be classic/progression server unless it has them. I mean come on, even the supposedly ultra casual WOW has you waiting for boats sometimes. The gnomes are rubbish they smack of laziness. Did Frodo ever wander up to a gnome and say 'mordor'? no he didn't and the book would have been a lot shorter if he did.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Getting from Freeport to Butcherblock will be very dangerous for evil races at low levels.  The dock in OoT has a lovely NPC that likes to attack evil folk.  She hits pretty hard (well, not really..but to someone less than level 10 and not expecting it, she does.)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I reccomend setting up the transporting phrase once the server goes live if you plan to travel.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;The boats are the worst thing ever placed in the game they always suxed and never worked right. The gnome translations on the other hand are great. They are not only very quick they are great source of protein and vitamin A,B,C,D,E, etc&amp;nbsp;(not to mention great tasting snack while waiting for the port)</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I loved the boats in Eq1 and was very sad to see the bells in EQ2. The boats added a sense of realism to the world of Norath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I really did not know they had been taken out. It makes me very sad to hear that. :smileysad:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;Instead of boats, just make all ports take 20 min to activate, and everyone in the porting processing has a Loading please wait logo sit on their screen for the duration. It will be the new oldschool.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Pardon my ignorance here.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;My playing time in EQLive has been limited to a few zones since playing again after like 2 years of EQ2 (among other games).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The boats are gone?&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>There are no longer boats that carry players from either East Freeport to Butcherblock, no from Firiona Vie to Kunark lands.  In their stead, they have been replaced with Gnome translocators.  You approach said Gnome and say &amp;quot;butcherblock&amp;quot;, and off you are wisked. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a noobie fighting in east freeport, I would see /shouts of &amp;quot;Boats here&amp;quot;, and there would be a mad scramble to get on before it left.  From the newbie yard I was fighting in you could see the large mast and sail of the boat.  It added much intrigue until finally one day, I took the boat just to see where it went.  I planned to never get off, for fear Id never find my way back.   I encountered much curious banter from higher level players in the ocean of tears.  Thye must have been setting up tents, becasue they talked alot about camping with Gornit,and an AC.  Once there was a dinosaur that got loose.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;the above proved to add mystique and suspense, and later on during travels across that ocean, met and talked with people Imay have never ran into before.  Especially the higher level toons.  Boats were equalizers for the level gap amongst players.  I would see and admire characters and have the oppurtunity to visit with them that may have otherwise never been afforded.  Unless you knew a druid or a wizard they would tell me, getting a port would be expensive. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The boats are more than a means of mere travel, they were a social aspect of the game, missing for some time, and certainly worth the effort to fix&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

I think building a coherent, flowing world is a given requirement for any RPG that wants to be immersive.&lt;br&gt;Think about it. There is currently no way to cross from continent to continent without the use of magic to teleport you, or mysteriously warping to an alternate plane of existence by reading a book and warping back down to Norrath on a different continent than you left from.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Does that make sense to anyone?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Additionally, the entire lore system was violated by translocators.&lt;br&gt;I am almost positive that it was stated in EQ lore that during the Combine Empire, great wizard spires and druid rings were built, and they harnessed immense magical energy. And that although the power to build locations like that had been lost, druids and wizards were able to tap into those great centres of power to transport themselves and others to there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is no reason why a gnomish wizard can arbitrarily move you to different docks, given that lore.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But, I don't think attention to things like that are where priorities currently are. They haven't been there in a long, long time.&lt;br&gt;It upsets me, but I don't think it can be changed. All I can do is cheer for the games that do get things like that right, and smile every time they rise to the top of the market.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Boats were equalizers for the level gap amongst players.  I would see and admire characters and have the oppurtunity to visit with them that may have otherwise never been afforded. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is quite true.  Though I was the high level toon that folks often asked questions of.  It was an important bonding experience, waiting there on the docks with others.  And yes, hearing &amp;quot;BOAT&amp;quot; and seeing the mast in the distance; and seeing the mobs from the boat in OOT added zounds to the immersion factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interesting question about why the boats do not work.  Is it (1) direct x issues or (2) complex coding issues.  I presumed it was (2) and that Sony prioritized fixing the boats very low compared to new content.  With this progression server, perhaps the issue will be reprioritized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I do recall trying to use the boats a couple years ago.  The one to Erud worked fine; but the one to Kunark did not; that is, the little floaties that took you from the dock to the Kunark boat never made it to the boat; they just floated around and got stuck!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I'm not sure that bringing back the boats is feasible, however there is one significant point to address - port-in spots for the translocators. In several instances, they dump you smack in the aggro range of KoS guards, especially for the "evil" characters. With the boats, you always had the option to jump ship and swim ashore. With the gnomes, they might as well give you a casket before porting you.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;They should fix the boats just out of embarrasment.  It is sad that they just gave up and put in the translocators. They should also add some tradeskill containers and make it so you can fish on the boat(you could but it was really hard to do). Take some people off the next expansion and work on the current game. We don't need more zones to spread the populations out even more. While it will likely be crowded at first with just original EQ it will be great when two-thirds of the zones are not sitting empty.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;I believe one of the major motivators for people creating characters on the Combine server is going to be nostalgia.&amp;nbsp; Boats were a big part of that nostalgia, in fact it's one of the things players who are now playing EQ2 mention they miss the most.&amp;nbsp; It's certainly nice to have an alternative method for getting from point A to point B, but nothing replaces the roleplaying and nostalgic fun of sitting on the deck of a boat...or jumping off to explore an island and then wondering if another boat will ever come along.&amp;nbsp; :)</description>
