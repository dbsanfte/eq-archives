&lt;P&gt;I would think its more of a case of losing faith with a legal system that allows anyone to even consider filing a claim in such circumstances. Doesn't the US system allow for such things as 'reasonable force' to stop a crime being committed? Isn't there such as thing as being able to defend yourself against the possibility of being shot / killed?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Actually it does, as it was explained to me when I was SP in the Navy: You are allowed to use as much force as necessary to subdue your opponent, but not use greater than what they demonstrate.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;To explain, if a person has a knife, you are justified in knifing him, but not shooting him, if he has a gun, you are justified in shooting him. if he has no weapon at all, basically you are not allowed to shoot, OR knife him.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Yep I know all about reasonable force - I use it every single day (UK Police) - your definition is virtually the same as our law (well its actually three laws - Common Law, Criminal Law Act 1967 and Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984) - all three govern the use of 'reasonable' force and when force can be used (the last Act - PACE 1984 is only useable by Police Officers).&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;It just boggles my mind that that you can have a legal system where someone can file a claim against&amp;nbsp;a person&amp;nbsp;defending themselves. I obviously don't know the full ins and outs of the case but hitting someone that is holding a gun to you with a pipe seems very reasonable in the circumstances.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;We have a legal system where someone can break into your store, hurt themselves doing it and sue you. And win.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have&amp;nbsp; legal system where you can buy a product, do something increadibly stupid with it, hurt yourself, and sue the manufacturer for failing to warn you not to be increadibily stupid. And win.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have a society in which a large segment of thinks any slight inconvience is an excuse to sue for millions. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2 words a lot of people here have no understanding of at all: personal responsibility.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sigh.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;oh man, i'm trying to find it, but there 2 different awards given out.&amp;nbsp; one is the darwin award, the other is for the stupidest lawsuits.&amp;nbsp; it described people getting locked into garages they were robbing while the person was away on vacation, the infamous mcdonalds hot coffee lawsuits, and my favorite, the person who put his winnebago on cruise control, went to the bathroom, and sued the mfr for not telling him he couldn't do that and not get in an accident.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The sad thing is not just the lawsuits, but the fact that there are jurors that award HUGE sums of money because people were stupid.&amp;nbsp; there's no law against people being stupid in USA.&amp;nbsp; just laws that let them get rewarded&amp;nbsp;because of&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;It irks me when people throw out the McD's case as being stupid. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The woman suffered 3rd degree burns to 6% of her body, due to the coffee being betwen 185 F and 195 F. That's 40 degrees hotter than anyone else in fast food served it at the time, and&amp;nbsp; 50 degrees hotter than coffee pots in the home make coffee at.&amp;nbsp; McDonald's knew that from their own research, not to mention the 700 other people who had filed reports, some of which were third degree burns much like those suffered by Mrs. Liebeck. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The quality control manager admitted while under oath that he and the company knew that human skin will suffer 3rd degree burns in 1 to 2 seconds from liquids hotter than 180F, and still ordered that the coffee be kept at temps higher than that. Had they served it at the normal 140 to 150 that most places serve it at, she wouldn't have been burned. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this case McD's acted with willful neligance against its customers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

him off with my hands despite tipping the scales at roughly 130. The&#xD;
way I see it, I should be able to use whatever level of force *I* deem&#xD;
necessary, and should not be questioned for it. It's simple, really. If&#xD;
you don't want to be shot, don't break into someone's house.&amp;nbsp; And&#xD;
if you do, I consider it well within my moral right, even if the US&#xD;
doesn't agree, to send you to hell before you can hurt me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
