&lt;DIV&gt;Well you have selective memory then, I'm not a mind reader&amp;nbsp;I can't say what you think you saw based on what&amp;nbsp;I may or may not have written down. I tanked RSS in Ldon gear and lived,&amp;nbsp;that's it, did you?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;In fact have you ever been able to tank anywhere I have had to tank undergeared as I was then?&amp;nbsp;If I was in fact&amp;nbsp;able to tank with out the right progression gear, then no wonder you fear my tanking prowess now that I'm starting to aquire it.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>how some one [BB] with so little AC for their progression level can&#xD;
complain about how well other tanks take damage is beyond me.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
i have around 3.4k ac buffed [and 15.5k hp]...WITHOUT my shield on .. how much u got BB?&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
cause i know im way behind in progression compared to BB ..., i even still have atleast 2 slots with potime gear in em ...&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
hows that spell shield coming BB ?&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
and you take more damage then knights? what a shock.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;I had all ldon gear then, and tanked in RSS with it. Sure it was scary but like I said before, I had my defensive aa's maxed wich helped considerably. That and clerics who were on thier toes.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Not a lucky guess Sharbreena. I remembered your gear and your complaint. Just like Darkysss's modern day LDoN gear and his whine about 68.3 is etched in my memory (he's actually improved it quite a bit since that complaint - a Wariror must be PLing him, 'cause as we all know 68.3 is toooo haaaaard.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Battleblade-Xegony on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;07-02-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;10:00 AM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;BB, I claimed rss was tankable by me before&amp;nbsp;I was in a raid guild when I had barely 11k hps maxed buff with maybe 2300 ac. That my aa's allowed me to tank there particularly since those coupled with my spells allowed me an appearence of 'phantom" hps. Wich got several other warriors aggitated, I even talk in emails with several of them.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;So I'm at a loss about "this too hard" bit since the fact I was able to tank undergeared as I was ruffled far more feathers than complaining about something being too hard. I do remember being somewhat concerend about how fast they seemed to be, that bugged me more than anything..stupid mob would hit me 9 times a round, thats pretty fast.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Giggle Sharbreena. I remember your post and I remember Knights telling you that you were undergeared. I wish I had made a screen shot of your gear when OoW came out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Come on Sharbreena - truth. Were you wearing an LDoN BP?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You did however remind me of this posted by Naubi:&lt;br&gt;"A 1k heal&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Yea BB, your "prefered tank" &amp;nbsp;tends to mean "exclusive tank". It's very difficult to have 16 classes built around a group game with 6 slots when certain classes exclude others from joining based purely on "they must be there to win".&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;That's like saying a Basketball team must have a Dominant center to win. Now it's true haveing such a center makes it easier to win, like the&amp;nbsp; Miami Heat.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Still, teams can win with out one. The Bulls won 6 titles without a dominant center. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Sharbreena on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;07-02-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;09:13 AM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Nope,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Geared past is Knight propaganda - it never happened. Geared appropriately is what happend and those woh weren't complained.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I seem to recall Sharbreena complaining about RSS. A couple of weeks later that stopped.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See your level Darknyss - it say 70. But level doesn't mean jack in this game without the gear appropriate to it. Didn't you whine about 68.3 Darknyss? I KNOW you did - at level 70 too. &lt;span&gt;:smileyvery-happy:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm glad you are geared better now than you were then.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;I love your underlined coment. It is almost verbatim from somewthing a n00b wrote on of all places the Veteran's Forum. I went somthing like It shouldn't matter what gear a player has, it should be skill that determines who is the bestest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sorry Swiss Army Knife, you are not the right tool for the hardest hitting cutting edge content and never will be. The Knights with the gear and the skill beat the GoD Mt. Trials &lt;u&gt;before&lt;/u&gt; adjusment. They didn't need a fish ladder to swim upstream.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;SoE really needs to convert both of you into Warriors. You believe we are not entitled to what is written in our Class Description but Knights should have full access to their every ability. Who would you blame if you were Warriors? Hmmmmmm? I know, you'd be claiming "It's the UBERS keeeping players with the skillz down."

&lt;P&gt;Was there are wasn't there "Warrior preferred" cutting edge content?&amp;nbsp; First there was (and you bring up KC, Kriegers, and some old-school raid content)... now there wasn't, it was just that every Knight in the game was undergeared for it... (go go Knight conspiracy theory!!!)&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Who exactly is looking for improvements here?&amp;nbsp; First you rant on and off about how much trouble the Warrior class is in, and then you call ME out for whining and blaming people?&amp;nbsp; I'm happy with my success.&amp;nbsp; I enjoy my character and what he's accomplished with the limited playing time I have.&amp;nbsp; YOU are the one whining about the tanking gap being "toooo smaaaallll".&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;Regarding slower... kind of got left off the CC/puller&amp;nbsp;line of things.&amp;nbsp; Generally speaking, if I have a monk, he's the dps puller, while I bring a chanter/shaman to slow.&amp;nbsp; Generally speaking, I am fine though with nothing more than a bard slower though.</description>

      <description>If you experiance a little of the game Darknyys you'd realize what I posted was the case. There had always been Wariror preferred content that some Knights could tank right off the bat and &lt;u&gt;undergeared&lt;/u&gt; Knights whined like Baby Real Tears(tm) was Toooooo Haaaaard(tm) (and still do - as you did vis-a-vis 68.3).&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;My argument was over a LESSER geared Warrior completing the mission after I left the first few failed attempts.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;But according to you, none of that exists... any case of a lesser geared/aa'd Warrior utilizing his raid tools to compensate for lesser gear/progression doesn't actually exist...&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;it's all lies and conspiracies coughed up through Knight propoganda and evil Knight-loving devs... you still playing with those "invisible gnomes"?&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Yes Frodlin, I do try to get what ever is available. I do have a tendency to go tank heavy or solo heavy, I.E. I try to get classes that can surive tanking or can outright solo much of the content because it frees up how much we can take on. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Dps is nice but&amp;nbsp;I find dps is far more important in raids that it really is&amp;nbsp;in groups, least for me. I think more along the lines of, "we will take losses so I better build a group that can suffer a lost trooper or two and still survive". Some of those dps heavy groups, if thier one soul tank dies the group wipes, and recovering a whole group wipe takes longer than rezing one or two.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I don't buy into BB's idea of one primary tank at all and never did. I see three primary tank classes each with certain attributes that help them in certain enviroments, now maybe they need to tweek the balance here or there.&amp;nbsp;However, I do think the three primary tank idea is more healthy for the game as a whole than haveing just 1. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Yes BB I did have a warrior pull while I tanked, that has happened a few times. Yes I am crazy, I'm pretty well known on Povar as a screwball. I just happen to be very good at what I do.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;I have actually invited a warrior for dps Frodlin, sure it's rare but I do actually value warrior dps because to me its decent dps and if we get too many mobs it's an extra tank. I have been in groups with 4 tanks, two paladins a warrior and me and we basically attacked everything. I also did a MM ldon with 3 clerics. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I've been in a group where&amp;nbsp;I tanked and the warrior pulled while the bard did mezz duty, this was at the wishes of the warrior. Although my 3000 extra hps and 700 higher ac probably had something to do with it as well.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;So in other words, you didn't really value the DPS as DPS, but you will, not unlike me, put together groups based on who's available.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;As a suggestion; Get two groups or so, maybe three, keep them unraided but have a common channle. I was the main puller in Devestation because&amp;nbsp;I didn't mess around trying to split, I just taged something and brought what ever else came along.&amp;nbsp;3 to 5 would be normal, sometimes 2 and sometimes 6. It was awsome xp because the mobs are so numerous, and with several groups killing mobs you could hang around the harder part of the zone where most the mobs are yellow or red cons.&amp;nbsp;That&amp;nbsp;would&amp;nbsp;get alot of skins.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I did get descrepid skin last night, used properly I managed to take less damge and not have to use my lifetaps so much. The main difference I think, at least against mobs that hit for 1500 or so was that it generally evened out my health spikes. It was valuable against white and yellow cons that were group mobs I would have to agree with that. I do still think it's something sk's would naturaly do with magic, find another way to replace, mitigate or avoid damage.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The spells danger issue is will they give me caster aa to enhance it's effectiveness. I have aa that increase my damageshields so logically they could have aa that increased my rune shields. That is where the real balance would shift, because then a shield that absorbed so much before now absorbs much more, if they did do that.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Now if the rune effect is the same thing as the warrior version but warriors have a much longer reuse timer I can see looking at dropping the timer.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;I have been in the nest maybe 3 times since it came out. Those named in BoT I was able to practically solo by the time I had ldon gear on. In fact when&amp;nbsp;I raided bot towers with my old family guild, back when BoT towers was actually a raid, I was the MT for the sand named. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Kriegers were only a threat because of thier 1500 dd proc, that was it, they didn't hit much harder than anything else in bot.&amp;nbsp;I have noticed that most critters are not much of a threat once you reach 16k hps and 3k ac anyway..least in the areas I been in so far.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I was tanking many of those same things you were supposedly "prefered" forwhen I was still &amp;nbsp;a casual player. It could be shaky sometimes but&amp;nbsp;I&amp;nbsp; managed, that included RSS. Now those places are pretty much cake, I can solo pof, pov, pot, wos, nc, don't know bout mpg..prolly getting close. BB, SoE doesn't agree with you and hasn't for many years. By the way, pet pulling isn't intended, and isn't a factor in balance. &lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I'm glad im not a warrior, I'd be embarrsed to have BB share my class.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
anyway BB, by your logic, everything is fine.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
you "surive" the hardest mobs [raid bosses] while i "overpower" everything else, all is as it should be,right?&amp;nbsp; ;)&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
it has always been the case that as content is comparitivly weaker, im&#xD;
comparitivly better at tanking it then you are, there is nothing new&#xD;
about that and never a time in which it was untrue.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
so based on YOUR logic, it should stay that way.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
anyone im off to overpower more stuff ...&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
edit:&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
forgot to add that my description says "slow and cripple".&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
go and ask anyone what "slow and cripple" means when talking about mobs and you'll get teh same answer most fo the time.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
because we're taking descriptions word for word, black and white.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
slow means not only should i be able to reduce the run speed, but i should also be able to reduce the attack speed.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
cripple is pretty clear too, i shouldnt just be making it a bit weaker&#xD;
[infact using sk current debuffs u cant even parse the difference] but&#xD;
instead i should be effectivly making the mobs limbs useless...it&#xD;
should be a cripple ...not just slightly pissed off, but it should be&#xD;
imobilsed from the neck down.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
thats how SK's should be, by YOUR logic.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Sharbreena,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm not talking about doing this content LATE in the expansions, but early in them. It's pretty darned clear that Knights almost universally whining about the Mt. Trials when they were &lt;u&gt;only&lt;/u&gt; 5 levels too difficult, they didn't tank like Warirors. You've been caught out - don't tell that "story" again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I remember you complaining about RSS being Tooooo Haaaard(tm) when I was long done with it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr size="2" width="100%"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I can solo pof, pov, pot, wos, nc, don't know bout&#xD;
mpg..prolly getting close.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;hr size="2" width="100%"&gt;Pfft. You are being FAR too modest (you left out RSS a year ago, Arcstone, and dozens of other places), but it still makes the point. Knights are terribly overpowered vs. dark blue experiance content.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Grinder,&lt;br&gt;Warriors are just as entitled to have their class distinguishing characteristc apply to group content as Knights. In fact, with both Knight classes SOLOING gods and dark blue experiance content it's laughable that Knights would continue the fiction that Wariror preferred high DI content would be unfair to them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr size="2" width="100%"&gt;Grinder posted:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I'm glad im not a warrior, I'd be embarrsed to have BB share my class.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;hr size="2" width="100%"&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm glad you aren't a Warrior too sir - very.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;From the BB mailbag:&lt;br&gt;"&lt;b&gt;&lt;span **smurf="" font-size="" 10pt=""&gt;As a warrior i would like to say thanks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#xD;
As a long time warrior who played this game to tank, i would like to&#xD;
thank you for your great commitment on furthering our class. I feel&#xD;
many of the issues you bring up are the same as mine and am proud to&#xD;
have you as a voice in our community. Thank you and keep up the great&#xD;
