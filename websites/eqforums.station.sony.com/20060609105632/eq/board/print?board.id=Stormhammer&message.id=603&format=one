<P>I'm going to alter my answer a bit from earlier. The events that would support this are the ones where multiple GM's participate. It doesn't fit very well from a roleplay perspective if the guy you're trying to kill is also trying to control the loot distribution. Honestly, if its a free-for-all roll, I don't see why a GM would be needed, as I've never seen a problem with one of our raid leaders managing the rolls.</P>
<P>When it comes to loot, no one will ever be happy.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Level 50ish players get frustrated when high end raiders get items that would be of more benefit to them</LI>
<LI>Players who attend lots of events seem to get frustrated when first timers get nice items</LI>
<LI>First timers get upset if it seems like only long time players are getting items</LI>
<LI>Level 65ish players get upset if a level 49 character tags along, and then rolls heavily on items</LI></UL>
<P>Here's my position: </P>
<P>First and foremost GM Events are about roleplay and interactive fun, whether it be a raid, scavenger hunt, or a dungeon crawl. If you're worried about "gearing up", join a guild, its the best possible way to accomplish this. Now, I don't support the argument that GM events are not at all about the loot either, because as long as nice items are dropping, people will want to participate for a chance to win those items, lets try be realistic about this fact. Personally, I have no problem at all with a full out "greed" roll, once you win, you can't roll on another item in the event (naturally, rolling on the "best" items last). It is really the only "fair" way to handle distribution for "dropped"/tradeable items (you shouldn't be denied a reward for your participation, just because you have good gear already). I also think it would be appropriate if the GM's would "hand out" occasional items as rewards, based on participation. </P>
<P>I think that with OoW coming out soon and the level cap going up, you'll see fewer issues with lower level players tagging along on events that are designed for higher level players. However, try to keep things in perspective, we have a low population server, especially at lower levels, so if someone is trying to tag along on an event that they might be 3-5 levels away from the minimum on, let them. <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-wink.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0></P>
