&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Probably because there has never been a rational logical discussion of customer service on this board or on a board that is run by a company.

Since most CS departments do not read nor respond to allegaions on open boards, even private ones like this one, the forum is useless and only used to vent. CS quality is in the eye of the beholder also, one person may feel they recieved great cs because their issue was resolved in exactly the manner they thought it should be, but another may get upset and vent becasue they could not get their items back becasue they gave the uid and password to a "friend" who gave it to another, who gave it to the neighborhor dog who stole they sword of uber most striking and destruction.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The CS posts are locked for a valid reason, be the discussion good, bad or indifferent. I am not sure of how many that post here remember the time when SoE actually had a unmoderated series of forums, the flamefest, cursing, and general insenstive postings by members concerning issues in the game and with CS that the boards where actually pulled and taken away for a period of time with the possiblity of them not coming back.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

I was curious to fiond out exactly what is the issue, so went baclk and looked at your post record, the earliest post I can find is from 01/19/06 at 09:26am(some time zone) and it was about boycotting Sony products.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;i am pretty sure, that it is possible to implement a customer service for a mmporg AND using boards as one appropriate channel. hard moderated boards, of course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;but it is poosible. i just dont see any mmporg provider using this chance to get closer to it customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;sony blocks on forums. blizzard has no channel and vanguard already announced to close forums with launch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;thats all. sad but the truth about this glorious industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;It is not by my particular choice that CS issues are not discussed here.&amp;nbsp; CS has asked that we refrain from permitting issues to be discussed here.&amp;nbsp; CS does not browse the forums so offering suggestions, feedback, praise and even criticism regarding CS will not be seen by the people the statements are meant for.&amp;nbsp; For in game issues there is a system to receive help.&amp;nbsp; Currently it is the only system in place to receive assistance.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

Yes I appreciate a lot of the criticism of CS is unwarranted, but to have a Customer Service department that doesn't even acknowledge or look at customer feedback is rather disconcerting. I wonder if Ford, General Motors, Microsoft etc do the same thing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any department of a company must take the rough with the smooth. If they screw up then they should be able to take the flak and learn from their mistakes, thereby getting better at their job/handling the situation. If they do an excellent job, they should be exposed to the praise - it makes people proud of their job and their achievements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I acknowledge that CS probably have a rather strict set of guidelines as to what they can and cannot do, thats fair enough, but I am sure there are many cases that don't fit this rigid set of rules and should perhaps be handled more sympathetically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem most people have with CS Kytherea is the /petition system. It is being touted as the only way that we can request help - fair enough, but you of all people must realise that with the amount of posts on these forums complaining about it, there is something rather wrong with the /petition system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will grant that the Forums have a large number of posts from those complaining rather than those that have had a satisfactory result. Some of them are unwarranted, but there are enough complaint posts to give your company some idea of what the main problems are. Solve the reason why these complaints are happening and you have an improved Customer Support/Customer relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customer service should be firm. However it should also be fair and able on occasion to have a degree of flexibility when it is called for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Murril Merryweather&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Rathe&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;This may be very true that it makes people feel better just to post nd know that 1 person will see it, but they will expect a response and when none is given then it will end up a flamefest because now I am ignoring the issue.&amp;nbsp; I do not have any authority over CS issues or how CS handles petitions.&amp;nbsp; When I&amp;nbsp;see feedback, suggestions and praise on the boards I forward those comments on to CS.&amp;nbsp; But once it leaves my hands there is nothing further I can do.&amp;nbsp; I am not going to get a response from CS to post here.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Yes, currently the only method I have to give you in regards to discussing CS is to petition.&amp;nbsp; Is it a perfect method? No, but it is the only method there currently is.&amp;nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Kytherea on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;02-02-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;10:10 AM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

      <description>I see a couple of civil CS discussion threads on the board not locked.  Now is Kyth would just grab one of those illusive CS peeps by the scruff of the neck and have them look  for a few here for a bit. &lt;span&gt;:smileywink:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Personally, what I think might be worth while would be to have a special edition Halfling Hodgepodge Q&amp;A thread for a CS special edition. Strictly moderated, no specific nor thinly veiled 'theoretical' examples, but it would provide a chance to get some feedback back to the players from CS about the process in general, and some improvements that could (should) be made.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Well said Murril, now..if you could only get CS to read your post, and that of others here then maybe we could all rest easy in the knowlege that sony does care about us....maybe?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Ismott Ironwill 70 Druid of the Rathe&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>To me the best question would be &amp;quot;Why isnt everyone involved in producing EQ from CS to devs to coders, etc made to spend some time reading the boards? Maybe they would be a bit more in tune with the community they serve if they did....&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the CSR's never read this stuff, then what's this forum for?  Simply a place for us to come vent?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My best CS story regards having been swept off of one of the shuttles zoning from Timorous Deep into Butcherblock.  Upon completion of zoning, I found myself about 50 feet UNDER the world.  This being the year 2000 and /petition actually eliciting a response from a Human Being, a kindly GM came over and proceeded to summon me out of that geometry trap for which I was eternally grateful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then of course come the times when the Avatar of Wind in PoA would blow half the guild over the wall, trapping them in between it and the zone wall - when another sympathetic GM came over and summoned us out of yet another geometry trap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My worst story comes from last Saturday night.  Raiding in OOW zones, our guild encountered one of those extremely rare spawns - the Overtly Obnoxious Ninja Looter.  He failed miserably in his attempts to steal our lewts, but the total absence of any GM anywhere in the game - even in the chat rooms - leaves us to resorting to our own means of dispensing justice to this guy....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which in turn opens us up to loss of reputation or even disciplinary action - but what alternative has SoE left us?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, we could make it a point to make this one person's life in EQ miserable without even bringing the guild name into it - we all have plenty of unguilded alts to do the job with - if one were so inclined....but this is what this total lack of Customer Service has left us with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>This forum in particular is for discussion SOE and SOE games, without having to fill up Off Topic. Those types of discussions tend to be borderline on topic for Vet's/TNZ, but not quite on topci, yet not really off topic enough for Off Topic. So this SOE board was made to draw that in.</description>
