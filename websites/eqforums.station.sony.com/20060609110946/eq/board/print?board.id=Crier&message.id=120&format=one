<DIV>Day 2 - </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>It's way too early to be awake, ok ok so it's only ten minutes after 8 AM...&nbsp; I am sitting in our hotel lobby sipping my vanilla latte and munching on a croissant, once again not a slice of pie in sight, oh well at least I have coffee.&nbsp; The bus should be here soon, I hope traffic isn't as bad as yesterday...</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Later in the day -</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>It's almost 3:30 in the afternoon now.&nbsp; Today seems longer then yesterday, perhaps thats due to staying up too late and partying last night <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-wink.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I have stayed pretty close to the SOE booth so far but we've had a ton of visitors today.&nbsp; The folks from EQ Interface stopped in first thing this morning.&nbsp; I chatted with them for a few minutes.&nbsp; I saw Gemdiver again for a bit as well.&nbsp; Allakhazam and Illia from &nbsp;Allakhazam's Magical Realm were poking around I think I saw Rashere talking to them.&nbsp; Zorillius is in the booth today as well, I waved hello to him earlier.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Thats all I have for now except a little birdie told me that we may have information regarding the next expansion for EverQuest available at Fan Faire in June.&nbsp; I am very excited to hear this news...</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I am working to get pictures up for you, in fact right now Brenlo is out looking for someone that has the proper USB attachment for the camera.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>See ya later,</DIV>
