&lt;P&gt;I still claim that Shieldmate weapons and Warrior 2Hand aggro weapons with improved procratemods make the most sense and are least likely to be "abusive". The weapons Warriors can obtain at various levels and progressions can requlate our hate per minute so long as we can interceed with an at-will aggro capability every 20 seconds or so if the randomness of procs is letting us down - at a reasonably high endurance cost to prevent using such a capability constantly.&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;And if you weren't so paranoid, you'd see that many Knights agree that there's a problem with shields for Warriors, and agree that the fixes you mention would be appropriate.&amp;nbsp; The only thing we're concerned with is the amount of the increase you claim.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;For example, &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;Now, while Sharbreena can so eloquently claim that the biggest fear of giving Warriors practical use of shields would be bad because they'd *gasp* use shields... the REAL concern is that with NO potential significant&amp;nbsp;downgrade to ANYTHING when&amp;nbsp;using a Shield, it'll be the ONLY thing Warriors use, and will lead to eventual balance issues in the future, where to make even group&amp;nbsp;content difficult for a Warrior will be based on a Warrior with a shield.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I'm tired of fixes that just wind up swinging the pendulum in a different direction... and I'm sure neither of us want it to keep swinging with each "re-envisioning" they come up with.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Since when were mobs that hit and AE for 5-7k considered one-group mobs?&amp;nbsp; The complaint about the AC on these items is from Anguish/Vish/Demi-plane guilds that are killing the hardest Fabled mobs out there, and receiving gear that's less impressive than if they were to just hit up some GoD zones.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Nobody's upset with Fabled Fippy's Paw cause it doesn't have raid stats... the problem is raid level mobs dropping less than group-worthy AC'd gear.... 1% DoT shielding isn't going to make up for that.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;No class is "useless" without their 69/70 spells.&amp;nbsp; Enchanters can't mezz until they get their FIRST one, but it doesn't make them useless.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;2. Not everyone has 6-10 hrs at a time to spend camping for runes. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Statue and RS camp have between 2 and 3 named spawns per cycle... you don't need to spend 6+ hours to get your groups some runes....&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;3. I haven't had a grp invite to anywhere that drops runes in i don't know how long.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Don't blame the game for your own misfortune and lack of ability to make friends.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;And trust me, it is no easier for a slower or healer to get a grp then anyone else. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Most grps need multi dps where as you only need 1 slower and 1 healer.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;It's no harder either... with 2 available slowing classes and 3 possible healing classes, you far outweigh the chances of getting a group than the multiple DPS classes.&amp;nbsp; You look for a healer, you try to find a Cleric or Druid.... you look for a DPS, it's whoever's closest to the zone.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;As far as the DOD and POR spells, a lot of people dont have the time to go thru mission thats last 1/2 the day lol. It would be nice to increase the drop rate a lil more and make at least a spell or 2 somewhat easy to get.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Complain about DoD and PoR missions when you've done some... cause none of the ones I did ever took more than a couple hours, of which those were mostly spent on wiping and coming up with a strategy for our success.&lt;/FONT&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;Hmm seems like there's lots of ways to introduce additional tankability to warriors to offset knight spell book effects on tanking keeping warriors noticeably but not omniciently better at tanking.&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;What most people see is black and white.&amp;nbsp; They see spell and no-spell.&amp;nbsp; I don't have my last glowing rune... so I lifetap for around 600-700 damage instead of 700-800.... Granted it's a clear upgrade from my last spell, but it's a marginal improvement to something I only tend to use when a damage spike puts me in a dangerous position, or when soloing.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Warriors see Aura of Runes and say, "this skill sucks, it doesn't do anything, it's marginal at best," and then complain about Knight spells, when the difference between expansions is indeed marginal.&amp;nbsp; Keep adding marginal improvements and when everything's put together, along with actual in-game situations, and I don't think we'd be having all these arguments.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;But everybody wants to compare a DoN Warrior to a Time geared Knight, and talk about utility as if it's still the crutch it once was.... and worst of all, act as if a base parse of mitigation differences can be interpreted to how well a class performs under real circumstances.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;There just isn't as much value in having 2 tanks in a 6 person group as there is in having 2 priests, a slower and a boat load of DPS, adding a second tank more often than not costs you a healer, a puller (who has substantial DPS) or a raw DPS class.&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Add a ShadowKnight who can also pull, a Paladin who can also heal, or a Warrior who will add some DPS... I love having Warriors and Paladins around... a second tank is more often than not a much safer option when attempting anything where 2 or 3 mobs can be a real strain on the group.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I did Elder Longshadow 1 with a Paladin who (even though he didn't have any slay AAs) tanked the undead adds very well while I kept the main mob busy.&amp;nbsp; I did 70.1 with a Warrior who handled the Guardian of the Pit and let me pull and tank the undead till they turned into Shades (which we alternated tanking).&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;While many of us see each other in direct competition, there's no doubt that together we make some great teams....&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Wait a minute...they're wielding shields... very likely Tae Ew type shields or slightly better at 55AC, which actually&amp;nbsp;represents just as large a percentage of their total AC that the 135AC shields do when they're equipped, and it's just as much above the softcap yet both classes are still considerably closer to the softcap, thus they get more benefit.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Um, how is 55 AC under the softcap even close to 135 AC under the softcap?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;But this is what kills me on this one.&amp;nbsp; You simply cannot isolate "tanking" and eliminate fear kiting, because it's VERY valid and VERY strong at that level which you specifically chose, level 60, and only one of the tank classes can do it, and thrive while doing it.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Yes, I most certainly can eliminate fear kiting, because it has nothing to do with tanking.&amp;nbsp; Necros can fear kite, their ability to do heavy DPS and twitch others isn't taken away because of it.&amp;nbsp; Clerics can stun and have better undead DPS, their healing power isn't reduced because of it.&amp;nbsp; In a discussion about GROUP desirability, and BASE tanking mitigation, solo tools and abilities that have NOTHING to do with mitigation are irrelevant.... or else Druids fighting snareable mobs that don't summon would be the most 'desirable tank' in the game.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Fear kiting is indeed a method in which your class can and does gain experience while killing an NPC and taking very litle damage (if it works right, it's no damage, but accounting for resists and the process, very little will do).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; You simply cannot just toss it out as though that's some kind of a "toy" that you have an inherent right to posess without a correspondingly similar one by other classes with whom you are claiming a grievance against.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;But your defensive abilities that let you raid tank in content appropriate for you doesn't count?&amp;nbsp; Only solo tools that are limited to areas in which a mob won't run into other social mobs?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;We are if equally equipped at a much lower rate, and actually... because of common and extremely cheap&amp;nbsp;Knight "twink items", being "equally equipped" is an absurd notion.&amp;nbsp; Warriors at level 60 really don't have a DW setup available to them equally cheap that is as effective as say.. a BoD which we all know is dirt cheap that enables them to do their job of aggro AND DPS at anywhere near the rate that Knights can.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Oh for Pete's sake, we all know how broken the BoD is for its availability.... and you're also ignoring that most mob DPS at that time is negligible enough for both classes to utilize 2-handers, which is&amp;nbsp;a much more significant boost to Warrior DPS than it is to Knights at that level.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Darknyss, you're travelling down a path that you REALLY don't want to travel down, because it's a TON worse than you are thinking, I'd suggest a U-Turn before you get totally burned.&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;No, I'm completely serious about this.&amp;nbsp; I'm not willing to accept&amp;nbsp;a parse that states a 13% difference in mitigation between 135AC shield Knight and a 100AC shield Warrior, and a 5% difference in mitigation while one class is in its greatest DPS setup&amp;nbsp;as a possibly game-breaking unacceptable gap that exists across all levels of the game.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;and if there's a problem at that level, that needs to be addressed, I don't see why you WOULDN'T want to bring something like this to light.&amp;nbsp; My guess is that at the lower levels, the gap is appropriate and only at the higher end of the spectrum, where mob damage ramps up, does the gap narrow...&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;BB's "I want to be able to tank raid bosses w/ 2-handers" is no different than Knights wanting Shield-Block on their epic 2-handers.... and three guesses as to BB's position on that...&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;And flag Mock to be "shieldmate only" right?&amp;nbsp; Because you'd be adding a heckuva nice amount of your already superior sustained aggro in raids.&amp;nbsp; Not&amp;nbsp;every fix to&amp;nbsp;"Warrior Shield"&amp;nbsp;fixes can ignore what it will bring outside of using shields.</description>

&lt;P&gt;I'm just glad the Fabled's are up longer than the double exp.... cause I love to maximize my grinding in some good exp zones, especially when working on the more expensive AAs.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;But to be honest, I'm probably only interested in finding a few random items from the Fabled Velioius mobs, and perhaps getting some old Kunark Fableds to drop some nice stuff for my Enchanter... who will also be taking advantage of double exp weekend to gain some levels.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;I'll take into consideration&amp;nbsp;some of the suggestions in this thread. However, I don't believe we will be&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;U&gt;item patching&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; in a while, so any changes that occur will have to wait.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Thanks for the feedback so far&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;really hate to point this out sir but as of right now 8:55 AM east we are definately patching&amp;nbsp; lol&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;Not all patches include itemization changes.&lt;BR&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;I agree.&amp;nbsp; I didnt mind having a few needing to be drops but with the current system in place, it just makes more people fall behind in the game.&amp;nbsp; Gear does me no good if i dont have my spells.&amp;nbsp; Spells are the most important thing.&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;That's funny, cause I'm pretty sure the stun resist, mana regen, avoidance, and FOCUS effects on&lt;STRONG&gt; gear&lt;/STRONG&gt; are pretty large improvements in power to most casters.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Considering the only people who have true gripes are Enchanters, who only need to be lucky enough to get 1 Greater before they're fine... and &lt;EM&gt;possibly&lt;/EM&gt; Bards, since Bards can also provide many other functions besides mezzing.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;You have 2 sources of power, and while obtaining both might seem like a handicap, ALL classes have multiple sources of power they must try to obtain.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Try being a hybrid tank... who needs gear with AC, hps, the correct foci, AND those same runes.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;But you are a whiner if you don't take into account the&lt;STRONG&gt; intended rarity&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&amp;nbsp; The devs have made it clear that they want spells to be desirable upgrades for casters as much as weapons and armor drops are for melees.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;There's gear I want that I don't have yet... and there's spells I want, but don't have yet.&amp;nbsp; Other than not having what I want, I don't see this as a problem.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;BTW:&amp;nbsp; I did see 2 greater runes drop in a row off Odi and Kuroun in MPG, but lost the rolls...&amp;nbsp; also saw two greaters while I spent some time in WoS... rare, but not impossible.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;What's your problem here? That someone who puts more effort into this game gets the same results, independent of his choice to play?&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;No, see, to be a Paris Hilton dragalong for a raid, you need to at least be likeable enough to have the rest of the raid want you there.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;If a "casual" player can't even get 5 other people to like him enough to want to group with him, he's surely not putting out enough effort....&amp;nbsp; :smileytongue:&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;If you multiply those out (0 * 33.5% + 1 * 40.2% + 2 * 20.1% + 3 * 5.4% + 4 * 0.8% + 5 * 0.06% + 6 * 0.002%) you will get the expected value of runes which is in fact 1.&amp;nbsp; But that doesn't mean you are "guaranteed" one drop when rolling against 6 other people each time&amp;nbsp;if you get a total of 6 runes.&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;In a 6 person group, with 6 rune drops, you're '&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;guaranteed&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;' a rune unless your group is a bunch of greedy tards that roll on runes again after they get one AND everybody in the group still needs them.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
