<P>The argument here seems to be to reduce the trash mobs in Hate/Fear/whatever down to the 30 second timer and only leave the actual raid level mobs be the 5 minute timer.&nbsp; I can certainly understand and appreciate the desire to have that happen, but on the other hand you are using having been able to solo or group in these same zones easily 2 years ago as your argument.</P>
<P>This is 2 years ago when you did not have Out of Combat regen available to you.&nbsp; Granted it would be nice and much easier if you had the 30 second version, but you are already confirming to us that you didn't need it in the first place to solo there.&nbsp; Why do you need it now?</P><p>Message Edited by Edimas on <span class=date_text>11-01-2006</span> <span class=time_text>12:23 PM</span>
