    <description>&lt;P&gt;Although its been well over two years since i was in what would been defined as an UBER guild....I like your thoughts&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I left the UBER guild scene and never looked back.... way to much drama for my taste as well as too much "required" time commitments.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I still play as much or more as I ever did however ..... &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;My thoughts on the subject ....&amp;nbsp; I say yes to what you propose with the exception of time as there would be no need for one group encounters there...&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <title>Single group quest access to Elemental Planes? Yay/Nay</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Veterans&amp;message.id=1118#M1118</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I brought this topic up on the unofficial message board of the server I play on.&amp;nbsp; As expected, there were the typical lines drawn in the sand of the guilded folks that currently have access and don't want others having the possibility of getting it, and those who are either unguilded or in smaller guilds that do not have access that think this is a good idea.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Before it goes any further, this is a single group quest based experience only flag I am talking about.&amp;nbsp; It is not openning up the Elemental Planes to anyone of a certain level and/or AA count.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Why?&amp;nbsp; Well...&amp;nbsp; I have been playing for 5 years now.&amp;nbsp; I have never been in a guild (and have no desire to be in one), and have been on only 1 raid (and&amp;nbsp;did not enjoy&amp;nbsp;it).&amp;nbsp; I typically play for 5 to 8 hours every evening, and more than that on weekends.&amp;nbsp; My home life is fabulous (my wife likes that I play, as I am doing something I enjoy).&amp;nbsp; I have GM'd all tradeskills, and I have multiple level 65 characters with many, many hundreds of AA points.&amp;nbsp; My group of friends and I (3 people that 2 box and another&amp;nbsp;6&amp;nbsp;that single box) have been playing together for years.&amp;nbsp; The "oldest" member of our little group I have been playing with for the entire 5 years.&amp;nbsp; The newest member has been with the group for a little over 2 years now.&amp;nbsp; None of us are guilded, and we all share the same goals and desires in the game.&amp;nbsp; To play simply for the fun of doing so, without worrying about being the best or having the best.&amp;nbsp; EQ is just a game to us.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Things that were brought up on the unofficial server message board were things such as skill level (or lack there of), and&amp;nbsp;gear level.&amp;nbsp; On the skill front, my group&amp;nbsp;of friends and I were hunting in Crypt of Decay via the "backdoor" flag when the second and third place guilds on the server were there.&amp;nbsp; Those guilds have long moved on (obviously) finishing the Elementals and Time.&amp;nbsp; We had done many of the "backdoor" flags for Tier 2+ zones before access was modified to allow entry based on level.&amp;nbsp;I don't think there is a huge disparity in skill level, at least on a group level (and that IS what I'm brining up; group based quest experience only access).&amp;nbsp; We regularily do Barindu/Ferubi/GoD instanced zones with as few as 3 characters.&amp;nbsp; These zones, as I have been led to believe are roughly equivilent to Elemental Planes yard trash.&amp;nbsp; On the gear side of things, a year ago I would have agreed that our gear was not good enough to do the Elemental Planes.&amp;nbsp; Now however, as we have becomed better geared, we are on par or even better geared than those first few guilds that passed into the Elemental Planes.&amp;nbsp; A year ago, anyone would of happily taken an 8k hp tank and a 5k mana cleric with FT 15 into the Elementals.&amp;nbsp; So gear really doesn't seem to be the issue anymore either.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The question of dedication was also raised.&amp;nbsp; I would vehmently argue that I and those that I play with have far more dedication to the game than someone who started playing a year ago and backflagged 6 or so encounters.&amp;nbsp; The question of reward for effort has also been raised.&amp;nbsp; I&amp;nbsp;remember when the top guild on my old play server killed Venril Sathir (example) for the first time.&amp;nbsp; The trial and error involved.&amp;nbsp; The complete wipes of 40+ person raids.&amp;nbsp; That was a LOT of effort.&amp;nbsp; Now a single group or less can just walk in and off him with very little effort.&amp;nbsp; Is it fair to those who first started doing the encounter years ago?&amp;nbsp; I think so, after all, times change.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Now I'm not saying there SHOULD be single group quest access to the Elementals.&amp;nbsp; It's not my game.&amp;nbsp; I am just a player.&amp;nbsp; But how would you, as fellow players, feel about such a thing?&amp;nbsp; If you are against it, why?&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Yay, and I'll explain why, but first character background so you can see where I am coming from:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Started right before GoD's release&amp;nbsp;on my current toon, now a 66 SK with 98 AA's. I'm two flags away from Water/Air/Earth ((Rallos and Agnarr)). Then just Sol Ro for Fire. The Alliance I'm in has done all these, so it's just a matter of getting them.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;First off: Yes, I understand there needs to be raid content, and many guilds would be upset if the raid content would be made groupable, or have group equivalents... but honestly, how old is PoP? Raid guilds have plenty to do.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;And all we're talking is access. NOT flags. So, for example: I get the groupable EP access, should it happen that way. Can I get PoEB access? No. Can I get my Xeg, etc flags? Sure... doesn't mean I can access Time. I'd need to complete the WHOLE deal, and honestly, I think this should be the case. Time is a raid zone, no doubt about it... and even as someone who 9 times out of 10 champion's the casual, I understand the raiders need their content. If you want Time, you need to do the whole shabang. HOWEVER, having EP access up until that point gives two advantages: A) Gear and grinding B) Easier backflagging. And as has been said, if you can do the &lt;U&gt;groupable &lt;/U&gt;content, access should be given. Doesn't mean you get the raid rewards.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;ALso, on the whole skill thing, it's nonexistant. I've met raiders with raid level gear who have not a CLUE what they are doing. I've met people with crap gear who can pull off amazing stunts in group and live. Skill is player dependant. I will say that raiding gives you the &lt;U&gt;chance&lt;/U&gt; to practice/get some skills you just can't with groups.. however, the person behind the toon still needs to be intelligent enough to pick it up, and some of these skills could be explained to and picked up by casuals. I've met some players who, on their first raid, took some tips and picked them up immediately, making them look like an experienced raider.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The reason this needs to be? Well, for years there has been raid and group content, with the raider getting access to both. This is alright, in and of an expansion, because years later, as gear changed, that content could be grouped. However, with keys and flagging, some of this content remained locked. And the longer this has gone on, the more the locked content will begin to climb, and the gap widens.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;All EP access through groupable content would do is the following: A)Make for easier backflagging/gearing of new raid guild members/toons. ((Would likely make getting an alt Time flagged in a Time guild a LOT easier/faster)) B) Allow those who can handle the content access, thus expanding the groupable zones and allowing casuals access to a good few zones. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;For those who are worried the gap will shrink TOO much, and raiding will not be far enough above grouping: Uqua, Qvic, Tacvi, MPG ((Raid trials, and raid guilds got a jump on being effective here)), Riftseekers, and Tier 2 Quest Armor from OoW.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I will say SOME, not all, but SOME casual players need to look into other options. Though the drop rate for the OoW Tier 1 prolly needs a little tweaking ((And I mean MORE drops, not less Devs /eye)), it's good gear, and groupable. There aren't many quests that don't need raid access ((Someone once told me casuals should be glad they have groupable quests like the Veeshan's Peak ones.. though this works on FV, I think he missed the giant dragon Shade somewhere =) )), but the Tier 1 OoW armor is DAMN good.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;In closing, the world of Norrath is soon to be overshadowed by it's future post-apocolyptic version. If it doesn't open up, many will leave.... however.. this MAY be the intentions of the Powers That Be.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Instead of looking in a 6-month old (dead) thread, look in the current one that explains what SOE is really doing.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;SOE is not opening the planes to single groups, with a quest or anything else.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I refer you to other threads for the details, but it looks like (in summary):&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;You can get gimped into a raid like always. A &lt;EM&gt;few &lt;/EM&gt;NO DROP items will drop from the Raid MOB. These items can be used on a quest to get the real flag for the MOB. It does not mean you get all of the flags leading up to it, and you still need to be part of the raid that took it down.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;Haven't revisited this thread for a while... some interesting comments.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I've noticed that BoT is mentioned a lot as a precursor to what the Elemental Planes would be come.&amp;nbsp; Seriously, if you just take a quick moment to think about it, the vast majority of those people probably wouldn't have access to BoT if it wasn't free access at 62 (and those that would will eventually flag for Elemental Planes anyway).&amp;nbsp; Compare BoT to Tactics.&amp;nbsp; There is very little similarity.&amp;nbsp; There are very few problems in Tactics compared to BoT, and the quest to enter Tactics is dead easy.&amp;nbsp; Now if people can't be bothered or are unable to quest into Tactics, why or how would they manage to quest into the Elemental Planes, something that would be exponentially harder?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Bringing up this topic isn't saying "There needs to be a quest to get into Elemental Planes implemented by the end of the week".&amp;nbsp; This is long term.&amp;nbsp; 6 months from now, 1 year from now, 2 years from now.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;2 years from now, I have no reason to believe I won't be playing.&amp;nbsp; Afterall, EQ has held my interest continually for 5 years and my enjoyment continues to grow.&amp;nbsp; 2 years from now, I fully expect that my group will have conquered all single group GoD content, as well as who knows what else from future expansions.&amp;nbsp; Many pieces of gear we will be getting, sooner than later, are pretty close to Time quality.&amp;nbsp; Examples would be items such as Gaunt Veil of Purification (war/mnk/rog/ber, face, ac 50, str 15, dex 10, sta 18, agi 15, hp 175, end 175, fire 17, cold 10, magic 18, poison 15, effect: Corporeal Fury (worn)).&amp;nbsp; Unless I'm wrong, this clocks in at second or third place in top warrior face items with Veil of the Berserker being an unquestioned upgrade (dropped by Rallos Zek in Time) and Faceguard of Frenzy being a possible upgrade (also dropped in Time).&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;So while our gear will be far better than those entering Time (completed Elementals), and we will be accustomed to fighting mobs that hit harder than anything in the Elemental Planes with the exception of raid targets, we would still be unable to even zone into those places.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;While I'm not disagreeing that joining a pickup raid is an alternative to get Elemental flagged, it's not something any of my group has an interest in.&amp;nbsp; If we wanted to raid, we would join a guild.&amp;nbsp; There have been multiple opportunities for all of us to join Elemental/Time guilds in the past, but it's just not a direction we want to go.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Now all of this said, I'm not convinced that quest access would be a good idea.&amp;nbsp; The zones are apparently too small to allow much of a crowd.&amp;nbsp; I think that is an excellent argument against quest access and would tend to agree if the zones are actually that small.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;What I'm not convinced of is the argument that players of too little skill or too poorly geared will gain access to the Elemental Planes.&amp;nbsp; 2 years from now, in all likelyhood, these people who are training in BoT hourly will have gained access to the Elemental Planes and beyond.&amp;nbsp; As was mentioned, pickup raids that result in Elemental flags are becoming much more common.&amp;nbsp; 2 years from now there is no reason to believe there will not be pickup raids for Time flags.&amp;nbsp; Yet 2 years from now, a single, responsible,&amp;nbsp;skilled group of players with Time quality gear or better still will be unable to zone into any of the Elemental Planes.&amp;nbsp; Maybe it makes sense to others, but it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>Don't have to be in an elite guild to get elemental flag. A lot pick up raids around to join and bit by bit build up your elemental flag. I have seen a lot of people doing thins. As for the RZtW which supose to be the hardest of all to kill since the script was nerfed is dead easy now and a lot of pick up raids have succeed to kill him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then again you in danger yourself to waste your time with pick up raids. There is no easy answer on this if you want to get elemental falg then need to invest your time on those pick up raids and you will end up with your elemental flag.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Im in an elemental guild myself (not time yet), and i would stop playing if they opened up the elemetals. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;First off, i been in my guild since the guilds 2nd kael raid (we got into arena, whoa, nasty place), and i spend 2 years building the guild up, and getting places i never thought i would ever see (Sleepers Tomb and Veeshans Peak was 2 zones i knew i would never see when i joined the guild, now i got keys to both). Then we spend 3 months almost solely keying up for Vex Thal so we could get geared there so we were ready for the harder PoP bosses (we killed Grummus and Xene at that point though), then we spend months in VT, then we spend around 4 months getting guild flagged for elementals.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;That was a major guild effort, planning our way to elementals right from PoP release where we decided to do VT first, and finally we got in elementals and got pretty good gear for it due to VT, whereas so many others passed ST and VT.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I STILL do LDoNs and Valor groups for XP, because those are decent XP places. I dont go to BoT because BoT got totally destroyed when they opened it up. I mean, i met tanks in Valor that had NO place there, in gear giving a warrior total of 4K HP unbuffed, our rogue had to play tank. That guy was level 65, and also BoT enabled. That means that someone else in BoT will get a nasty surprise if they group with them, cause they do NOT BELONG THERE. Thats the key, if you do not have the gear to survive in a zone, all you can do there are put your group members and yourself in danger.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Last time i had a BoT group, i headed out after 2 kills, that took 1 death, 20 min, and me going OOM twice, because rest of the group did not belong there. When i go OOM faster on a BoT group that when being healer in elementals, there is a problem.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Im my opinion they should also lock BoT again because we got way too many people there who cant handle it.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;And if they opened elementals, we would have 5K HP tanks and no AAs that would think they could be a great tank there. That would cause massive trains (if the groups survive to train that is), PoEarth and PoFire zoneins would be incredibly dangerous.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;And as many others have mentioned, the XP groups there could cause MASSIVE problems to raids. The people in the elementals now do NOT cause problems like that, because they KNOW what a raid is, and how important it is. At least on Veeshan, elemental groups move so a raid can pass through or pull to the pull spot, because raids &amp;gt; progress for a load of people, &amp;nbsp;whereas an EX group means a little XP to 6 people, who could XP other places too.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Remember that a raid mob up there is on 3-7 day spawn timer, and a guild raiding will have a open raid time window on maybe 3-4 hours on weekdays. If that guild have to spend 2 hours of their raid window fighting with people who quested their way in there and know nothing of progression, and in worst cases maybe even have to get a GM to solve a dispute, there WILL BE NO RAIDS.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Good example of the raid vs XP group problem is RZtW. Hes on what, 3 day spawn. The script take hours to do, and will involve 40-72 people. If that raid should wait and discuss the rights to the zone with a 6 person group XPing in Pit (where they can do any other time, whereas the raid will have 3 days to wait, IF RZtW spawn in their raid time window, it could be weeks or months before they get another shot at him), you can be sure that they would not complete the RZtW script that night, thus destroying the guilds progression.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;And lets say theres 5 guilds on a server fighting for the same progression mobs, and you have 1 group constantly blocking ALL of them (dont know how it is on your server, but we more or less constantly got the same persons in pit farming the piglet), youll destroy the possability of progression.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So a clear NO to quested access to elementals.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;I'm not buying the stuff about elems not being that great for exp.&amp;nbsp; The fact is my friends who have elem access spend almost all their downtime (not raiding or trying to do GoD advancement) exp'ing in the elems or occasionally getting ornate drops to sell from sol ro.&amp;nbsp; There's a reason for it.&amp;nbsp; It beats the hell out of exping in bot, tactics, cod, hoh, etc.&amp;nbsp; And there are 1 groupable targets that drop some great loot.&amp;nbsp; From what they tell me about fighting in elems, if you can take ldon hards, you can exp in the elementals.&amp;nbsp; Ldon hards are often much harder to pull, actually.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;It's a country club, plain and simple.&amp;nbsp; And by the way, I had just as many problems in BoT before they opened it to the masses as&amp;nbsp;I did after.&amp;nbsp; Many of the high end guild people who were in there early seemed to have no respect for camps at all.&amp;nbsp; More than once we would be fighting back to a named and see a high end group go invising past us while we cleared yard trash so they could gank the named.&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp; Stupid trains were common too, just like they are now.&amp;nbsp; Out of control former chanter/mage pets were quite common as well.&amp;nbsp; Other than more ooc chatter and more camps taken, I see little change in BoT.&amp;nbsp; The&amp;nbsp;mobs all dropping specific loot and bosses being on static timers&amp;nbsp;has always brought out the worst in people.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Going back to what should keep people out of zones, look at LDoN hards.&amp;nbsp; There are some nice upgrades there for people who aren't in the elems yet.&amp;nbsp; Yet a lot of groups with L62-65 don't do them.&amp;nbsp; Why?&amp;nbsp; That's obvious.&amp;nbsp; They're hard.&amp;nbsp; A lot of people won't mess with trying to 1 group elementals either if they're sufficiently difficult.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>Whats wrong with them adding a level 75 I hope they do Becuase the people at the front of the pack will always have more people &amp;nbsp;be more powerfull have better loot. I know many people that ask me why play everquest and the only answer I can give them is becuase I can progress and become better than I was. I would love them to add more levels becuase the elite will still have their&amp;nbsp;new country clubs built&amp;nbsp;with all new mobs and&amp;nbsp;new drops. I personally wont buy another expansion unless it actually adds&amp;nbsp;new levels and new pet spells for my beastlord if not I have no motivation to buy it and I extremly regret buying GOD it was a waste of money for me and I bought 2 of them. So if anyone in SOE is listning please keep adding things and raising the bar but dont stop are progression. I play this game because I cant cheat and anything&amp;nbsp;I have I earned NO GUILD GOT ME ANYTHING I HAVE.&amp;nbsp;just my 2cp not worth much but it will add up someday.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;

      <description>I wouldnt be opposed to having one group access to elementals.&amp;nbsp; However I think the quest or requirements should be beyond what the casual or week end warrior type player could do.&amp;nbsp; Take for instance a new recruit from a guild that is past time and is mainly doing ikkinz and uqua now.&amp;nbsp; That person will have little chance to tag along for back flags and their guild will also not backflag for pop but yet their guild overall is good for elementals.&amp;nbsp; Those people should have some sort of way in maybe by using god progress as a meter.&amp;nbsp; If they can get flagged for sewers, vxed, tipt and ikkinz 1-3 then I would agree that they have a spot in elementals.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Have kevren in kod`taz check flags as he flags you for ikkinz trials and have a special flag done there.&amp;nbsp; That keeps progression intact because you are using post elemental benchmarks rather than some boring easy quest in pop.&amp;nbsp; Adding in a side quest now&amp;nbsp; to pop with new aa skills from god though just wouldnt be difficult enough to replace the pop progression and most people would just skip pop flagging altogether.&amp;nbsp;</description>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;No, but look what's happened to the rest of the game - old raid content is now single group, sometimes solable. Why?&amp;nbsp;Mudflation is out of control, and PoP's raising of&amp;nbsp;the level cap only compounds it.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;If SoE continues PoP/Gates style mudflation for the next few expansions,&amp;nbsp;I have no doubt that&amp;nbsp;we'll see lvl 75's with Bazaar loot single-grouping (or maybe even soloing) a good chunk of the current raid content.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Without reading all of the previous enteries - I still have to say YAY - tis a good idea.&amp;nbsp; Main Reason - tradeskill resources.&amp;nbsp; Guilds that have access to these areas are known to destroy the&amp;nbsp;tradeskill items&amp;nbsp;rather than to release it or resale it (seriously).&amp;nbsp; And those that dont destroy, have main looters which focal the items down to specific individials.&amp;nbsp; It wasnt until a specific guild got its time flag on my server that anyone else was even able to camp mobs for stonewood bows.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;OMG NO NO NO!&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;What I would like to see is 1 person per group allowed to zone in w/o flag. Then friends/guildees/recruits who are still working on their back flags could hang out in upper teir zones.&amp;nbsp; I think raid buddying should be handled the same way. 1 per group.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;I have two objections to keys for elementals that I don't think have been raised yet.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Firstly, a lot of people seem to recognise that raiding guilds need some kind of reward for their effort. Several people then go on to say that they've had their reward; they now have Time or GoD to keep them busy. But actually there are many raiding guilds that are not in Time. My guild got into Solro quite recently and should be in Elementals in about a month I guess (just RZ to go&amp;nbsp;=) ). If the planes are suddenly opened up, where's our reward? And once we are done with the Elementals, you can bet there'll be another guild just entering. Raiding guilds aren't all grouped at one level but spread out across the spectrum, with new raiding guilds starting up and beginning the progression even as other raiding guilds get done with it. There is no point in the forseeable future at which opening up the elemental planes will not make the months of work of a guild worthless. Eventually I suppose the loot and experience rewards will be so outdated that the elementals will be obsolete, like VP&amp;nbsp;is now, but not in the near future. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The other objection is server specific, but on Firiona Vie server the keys for the other PoP planes are all droppable and go on keyring, which means everyone has access. Even if the devs intended for elemental keys to be no drop on FV, they would somehow overlook it or leave a bug in it or something, just like they did for the ST key, VP key and VT key (and arguably the PoP keys?). Keys on FV are not&amp;nbsp;secured by no drop.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Lastly, I'd just like to say that I will never get my smithing to 250. It's something I'd like to do, but the fact is that I hate tradeskilling. I recognise that I &lt;EM&gt;could&lt;/EM&gt; get 250 smithing, and the only reason I don't have 250 smithing is because I have &lt;EM&gt;chosen&lt;/EM&gt; not to tradeskill.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The original poster had his choice too. I don't ask for raid mobs to drop GM Smithy Hammers or some kind of magical scroll that will give me 250 skill in smithing =)&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;P&gt;[quote]And by the way EP zones are not for grouping at most you might see one or two groups in Earth or Fire thats all though and all of those toons are from the same guild other than that it's empty or housing a raid. [/quote]&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;This is just plain false.&amp;nbsp; I have a number of friends in higher end guilds who exp in the elementals on a regular basis (and sol ro).&amp;nbsp; There are not just 1-2 groups there, especially in Fire.&amp;nbsp; It's always more than that.&amp;nbsp; And a previous poster said it right, these are country club zones.&amp;nbsp; There's nothing in the difficulty of the 1 groupable stuff there that keeps people like me out, who tank LDoN hards.&amp;nbsp; It's simply the flags.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;It comes to the usual breakdown.&amp;nbsp; Most people who are in elems don't want others to get access and most who aren't want a way to get in.&amp;nbsp; Of course those who are there want to keep their exclusive content.&amp;nbsp; What do we expect?&amp;nbsp; But difficulty should be the main thing that keeps people from grouping in certain zones, not artificial entry blocks.&amp;nbsp; That's where PoP really went wrong.&amp;nbsp; And yes, I know that's what the "ubers" think is the best thing about PoP.&amp;nbsp; Woohoo! We get lots of zones to ourselves without the newbs!&amp;nbsp; That's nice.&amp;nbsp; It's great for the elitist players, but it's not great for anyone else.&amp;nbsp; Have an end zone that requires pain the rear flags and is reserved for only the top guilds.&amp;nbsp; Fine.&amp;nbsp; But too much of PoP has been closed off to everyone else.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;That said, I do think opening the tier 2-3 stuff up based simply on level was a mistake.&amp;nbsp; They should have stuck with the 1 group quests to get in.&amp;nbsp; They also set the min. level too low for tier 2.&amp;nbsp; L55s should not be there.&amp;nbsp; As far as exp groups go, about all they seem to do is go to valor and beg for a group with /roleplay on hoping no one tries to find out what level they are so they can leech some exp. :-P the mobs are too hard for that level range.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;And as a previous poster mentioned, where's the sol ro 1 group entry quest?&amp;nbsp; I know all the ubers want to keep their ornate mold farm so they can make "phat platz" in the bazaar, but there's no reason this zone shouldn't have another way to get in.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Besides, you know if they open it up to more people, they'll nerf the freaking drop rate. :-P&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;P&gt;Personally, I can't see a reason to open EP.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Perhaps the AA there is very good indeed, but unless you have the gear to withstand EP-level damage / spells, you're better off doing, say, BoT, with far less chance of wipes or waiting for a key member to be done of rez effects.&amp;nbsp; Go to BoT, put a nice CD in, and grind.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;From what I read, the minis will likely be out of reach of the casual players that would go to EP if they were opened.&amp;nbsp; And if they aren't casual players, chances are, they have used their time to raid.&amp;nbsp; Not all, but most.&amp;nbsp; Ergo, loot drops won't happen.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Also, many may dream about the EP components for tradeskills.&amp;nbsp; Again, opening them up would spiral down the prices, so that if your goal is to make money, it won't happen.&amp;nbsp; The prices are high BECAUSE they are hard to get to.&amp;nbsp; And, if you want the good tradeskill items for yourself, hoping for a price drop, well, just like the "good" drops off many zones were nerfed in power or in rate when a zone was opened up, so will I expect a massive nerf bat on the EPs soon they are opened up too.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I will say, I'm biased pro-LDON, but if you want drops, do those.&amp;nbsp; Do them hard if you want even better. Some numbers out of the top of my head.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Once you get the hang of things, it can take you 60 min and change to get a win including prep time.&amp;nbsp; (I have friends ready to play when I log on, more often than not).&amp;nbsp; At 30 wins per ldon drop, that's 30 hours.&amp;nbsp; Lets say 36 hours for all the waiting around, longer than normal missions.&amp;nbsp; 36 hours for a guaranteed, written in stone, you won't lose the /random, /dkp, /loot council, 100 percent YOURS drop from LDON.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Say a raid is 6 hours.&amp;nbsp; After 6 raids, you've spent the same 36 hours as LDON guy.&amp;nbsp; Do you get a drop every 6 raids?&amp;nbsp; If yes, or better, than raids &amp;gt; ldon, ergo, get your butt into a guild that flags for EP, and get your drops.&amp;nbsp; If no, then LDON is better for casual play.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;All this to say there's very decent drops in LDON, and you don't really need EPs for drops.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;There's very decent exp groups other than EPs.&amp;nbsp; And, if you got "backdoor flagged" for EP, chances are (not for sure, but chances are) if you can play in the EPs at all, you won't pull at the same raid as a nearly fully EP-geared group, doing some exp.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Finally, if all you want is to visit a new zone, and come home with some pics, and a "I was in Plane of Water" T-shirt, or whatever, that's what the 15% rule is for.&amp;nbsp; Make friends with some high end guildies, ask to be on a raid, say you'll follow everything to the letter, and get your screenshot maker handy.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Whether it's loot, exp or T-shirts, there's no real reason to go to EP.&amp;nbsp; The alternatives aren't "better" but they are far most "cost-effective" for your play time...&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>To me, the fact that this thread has more than 70 answers in it proves that something is wrong with PoP guild flags system.&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Keys have never been a problem to me : you do your key quest, you deserve the right to enter the zone. But I've seen people just joining Elemental guilds getting EP flagged just days after. Which means : 3 days before, no access / 3 days after full access. What happened during those 3 days ? They just joined a guild. To me this is just not fair.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;I'd vote yes for one reason: as time goes on flags and keys are harder and harder to get because less people want and need them.&amp;nbsp; The collective moans heard across the game&amp;nbsp;when any raid leader calls OTM BERTOX is enough to prove my point.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Guild or not, people get tired of doing flagging and keying mobs for the billionth time just to get a few new guildies flagged and soon start requiring flags as guild requirements - catch 22.&amp;nbsp; Want a super simple example?&amp;nbsp; Check out a PoJ trial sometime - which is just a single group flagging...when everyone needed the flag you could get into any number of pickup groups, now that place is quieter than the response someone gets when asking for help to hunt epic mobs in kedge keep.&amp;nbsp; IMO, anyone who think eplanes still need to be locked down has most likely forgotten the pain of the process WHEN EVERYONE WAS DOING IT ALL THE TIME...try&amp;nbsp;re-doing all your flags&amp;nbsp;now&amp;nbsp;that it is VERY unpopular and see what you think.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The flagging system needs to be altered or removed once flags stop being a goal and become a brick wall.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>I not really sure what the real push to get into EP's is unless your in a guild that raids them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If its for the exp, your going to be in for a shock. Yeah its great exp but the mobs are MUCH harder then BoT/Tactics mobs. If your not in a group of EP flagged people your kills are going to be slow. Your healers are going to go through lots of mana and you will have lots of down time. If your a soloer and think np I will just go solo in EP's. The only place you will be soloing is PoFire, The IZ mobs give less exp then HoH and half are immune to snare/root. If you move in past the first castle area the mobs will give more exp but have alot of HP, hit for 900+ and will rip through your mana. There really are not all that many places for exp groups. A zone like BoT can handle 50peolpe, most of the EP's cant. Sure PoW probably can but is usually desirted because no one wants to fight underwater. PoAir is a royal pain to exp in, the first island is hard to get past and most of the mobs are not mezable. PoE can be great but its already crowded with 4 groups in there, PoF also starts to get crowded with 4 groups. PoF has the most room for groups due to the IZ area being so large but why would a group exp their anyway you could get beter exp in HoH, BoT, Tactics and such and it would be easier. I see many zones like HoH empty or just a group at the GY because most people think it to dangerous to wander the zone killing yet you want to try it in EP's?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you want pp from tradeskill items, well many of these tradeskill items are rare drops which means you need to kill many mobs to get them. Your kills will be slow if your not in an EP guild and equiped for it. Even with getting few drops, EP's will be overrun with people. 60+ at a time, Tradeskill items will flood the market and become worthless. There for tradeskill drops will not be making anyone any pp.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;EP's are not the country club many people think they are. The exp is beter in them but not by that much, The groups killing in EP's could make close to the same exp in BoT except they would easily hold an entire wing. These groups still wipe in EP's due to adds. The EP zones are not really based around 1 group outings, they are based around raid groups. Most zones have places for raids and different places for groups. You could have a raid killing every raid named in the zone and still have exp groups. The EP's are not like this. You could not have raids killing say Wandering named and another killing birds and still have exp groups going (Yeah you could at IZ but again WHY?). In PoE if you had people killing the rings then you ahve no room for exp groups. PoA and PoW could have both happening except 99% of the time these zones are empty because they are far to hard for exp groups.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On a side note.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Going from 0 flaggs to fully EP flagged in 3 days would be very close to impossible even if all the mobs happened to be up for you. Some of the events just take to long to do. The majority of backflagging that I have seen is done with guilds working together. Many lower guild agree to flag people for other guilds while they are farming those events in a trade for the higer guilds not ripping though these mobs and giving lower guilds a shot. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for guilds starting to require flags, from my experience the guilds doing this are not looking for people with no raiding experience. They want people who have done these events and are looking for somthing different then the guild they are in or the guild they were in at the time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If early flags are unpopular why are mobs like Bert, Grummus and such killed so quickly? There are guilds that are not in EP's, there are guilds doing ssra still and VT and guilds doing SoRZ and Vindi. They continue to expand the high end game but that doesn't mean that the lower end game has disapeared. As for PoJ trials being empty, thats easy. PoJ trials were REQUIRED for PoV/PoS access, they are not now so they are not needed as badly. If your in a guild, you get a guild group to get those flags so that you can continue to flag. If you are not a guild person you could just exp you have no need for that flag.</description>
