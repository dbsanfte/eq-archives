<P>Sorry for not getting to this sooner.</P>
<P>I've gone ahead and checked the spawning of Mujaki and there was indeed a bug with it that in some situations the Shade wouldn't spawn. I've gone ahead and corrected the issue and it should be Live as of tomorrow.</P>
<P>If you have any additional issues after tomorrow (on 12/13 or later), please feel free to PM me with your character name and server, and any reproduction steps that would help in tracking down the bug.</P>
<P>Thanks,<BR></P>

<DIV>Okay, we tried it tonight, and it's *half* fixed...</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Here's the text of the petition update I submitted a little while ago:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>###### start of inclusion</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>Update: &nbsp;Okay, good news and bad news...<BR><BR>The good news is that after seeing "Zajeer-Dev"'s post on this thread ( <A href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Paladin&amp;message.id=5896#M5896" target=_blank>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Paladin&amp;message.id=5896#M5896</A> ), indicating that the devs had fixed the spawning of "Shade of Mujaki" and pushed the fix live, we repeated the event and the Shade did indeed spawn as it was supposed to. &nbsp;Yay.<BR><BR>The bad news is that after we killed it, I got the following message when I tried to loot the quest drop from his corpse:<BR><BR>[Tue Dec 12 23:57:20 2006] You are not allowed to loot the item: A Soulstone Shard.<BR><BR>Oookay... &nbsp;We tried everything to possibly make the game happy, including camping and returning, but kept getting that message until the corpse finally rotted.<BR><BR>To clarify, I *could* loot the corpse and look at the "things to be looted" window for it, but got that message when I actually tried to "pick up" the drop from the corpse. &nbsp;See screenshot3.zip and screenshot4.zip<BR><BR>I Googled for this message, and apparently this message occurs when the game does not believe that the looter has reached the proper stage of the epic quest yet (in order to prevent twinking, farming/selling epic drops, etc.) &nbsp;However, I *am* at the proper stage of the quest, I have done all of the steps leading up to this part of the quest, I have gone through all the quest conversations (including the initial one with Irak Altil in Halls of Honor), etc.<BR><BR>I strongly suspect that the game code for "can you loot from the Shade" was using exactly the same flag-and-item checks as the "should the Shade spawn when the regular Mujaki dies" checks. &nbsp;This would make sense, you shouldn't be able to loot from the Shade if you're not qualified to spawn the Shade. &nbsp;HOWEVER, as Zajeer-Dev acknowledges in that eqforums post, the Shade-spawning checks were screwed up. &nbsp;If so, it appears that the devs fixed the Shade-spawning checks, but didn't at the same time fix the Shade-looting checks accordingly.<BR><BR>I and a lot of other Paladins would appreciate if you could look into this for us. &nbsp;It's disappointing to complete an epic kill, then not be able to physically loot the required item from it. &nbsp;Thanks.

<DIV><BR>A while later I got the following reply:</DIV>

<DIV>Umm...&nbsp; Am I the only one who gets the impression that this GM didn't really read my update?&nbsp; Yes, the earlier GM had informed me that there was a problem with the NPC, but that was in response to the *spawning* of the NPC, and the recent post by Zajeer-Dev (which came after that message by the GM) indicated that the problem with the NPC had been fixed.&nbsp; My update to the petition involved a *new* problem with the NPC, one I doubt the GMs or devs are aware of yet...&nbsp; I'm concerned that the most recent GM didn't pass on that new information to the devs, since he appears to think that I'm talking about the *old* problem (which is now fixed)...</DIV>
