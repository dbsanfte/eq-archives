    <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;"Every shred of actual game data we have to date reflects that."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Every shred of actual game data shows that skill and ability advantages are intended to determine the difference in our weapon DPS.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warriors ought to do more DPS with a 2Hander. With Erilynne and the +6DMG CS aug, that's likely the case.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ought to do close to but less DPS DWing - after all the disadvantage is you have to acquire and aug TWO weapons.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ought to do close to but less DPS with sword and board - HEAVY melee DPS is one of our defining characteristics and we should do it in &lt;u&gt;every&lt;/u&gt; weapon configurtation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We aren't Knights and we are entitled to our intended advantages. Heavy DPS and being masters of all weapons and tactics is one. Y'all aren't masters of all weapons. Look at your archery DPS.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Knight DPS with sword and board is irrelevant. You aren't identified as a heavy melee DPS class.&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br&gt;"After all of these changes, hybrids will not be able to deal out&#xD;
the damage of a pure melee class, with the possible exception of&#xD;
rangers, who might be able to get close. The warrior, monk and rogue&#xD;
will still out damage hybrids, and by a noticeable margin. That&#xD;

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We're moving away from the top 10 list, and into a weekly question instead. Each week, we'll be able to pick AN issue to ask about.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This week, I picked the hottest issue among warriors in EQ, which is &amp;quot;Where's the warrior weapons?&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is what I asked:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Warrior weaponry has stagnated very badly in the last few expansions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just about all other classes are seeing their time level class specific equivalent weapon or better be available through single group content.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sadly, from a weaponry perspective, our class time weapon is still in the top 2-3 weapons avilable to our class regardless of progression.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We've not seen an upgrade from the BBoB for several expansions, and the BBoB, due to a lack of a procrate mod is only a marginal upgrade from the Darkblade.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There needs to be some serious movement in warrior weaponry just to get us caught up. Warriors at the single group level should really be seeing something a lot closer to the Darkblade than what they currently have, and at the raid level should have already seen an upgrade to the BBoB around the relic/ToB area of progression, and should see ANOTHER one in the Deathknell area.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warriors are not a generic melee DPS class, we're the only dual wielding heavy tank in EQ, and our weaponry needs to reflect that, as we rely on it for most of our aggro. A warrior weapon needs Defensive stats, a high aggro proc and decent Dmg/Dly, we prefer the higher damage, high delay weapons like Darkblade/BBoB over the low delay weapons.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The question is, when will our weapon needs be addressed?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The answer I got is below...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Warriors for the past couple of years had hated the fact that their aggro was tied to weaponry, so what we did was introduce non-weapon related aggro in the form of abilities, disciplines, and even other worn mod effects. We don’t feel we should continue offering high aggro warrior only weapons, but instead offer more generalized weapons with mild aggro procs, such as chaotic stun, as something warriors can pick up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warriors will be locked into their weapon until they realize that their aggro is sufficient with a different weapon with less powerful aggro generation, because we’ve introduced skills and disciplines to compensate for it.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--   / message   --&gt;&lt;!--   sig   --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Actually you answered your on proble BB. While your skill caps are&amp;nbsp;even or higher&amp;nbsp;with rogues and rangers and the like, thier aa's and natural class skills&amp;nbsp;make a huge difference in how effective they are with certain weapons. The same can be said of knights, aa's and certain class skills ( magic) make's a huge difference in how effective they are, particularly when tanking dark blue mobs.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;While you may technically be better at all weapons and tactics and yadda yadda. Those classes, due to class skills and aa's, do in fact &amp;nbsp;surpass you in specific areas. Rangers out dps you with bows, rogues out dps you with daggers, monks out dps you with fists and knights out tank you against inferior dark blue mobs.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;BB, this issue has been talked about for years those long standing tradtions you keep talking about were removed from play basically 5 exspansions or more ago. being as how that would be several years, there can't be any "long held" because they have been gone for a "long time". It's like argueing about how great T Rex was, even though he's been extinct for a "long time" too.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>Actually with all weapon skills monks and warriors share, monks innately out damage warriors.&amp;nbsp; Be it blunts or hand to hand. It just how the class is. So a warrior isn't the best at all weapons and tactics.....there are some monks have surpassed them in thanks to the higher damage tables they recieve, 5% base increase in each hit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

      <description>Incorrect Sharbreena. In fact let's state what is -&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warriors skillcaps and access to weapons short of Epics are on a par with Rangers and their bows, Rogues and their piercers, and Knights with their 2 handers. The &lt;u&gt;only&lt;/u&gt; real difference is class specific offensive disciplines and lower Hand to Hand and Kick skillcaps - these are not "weapon" skills strictly speaking, Verant/SoE has treated them as "empty handed" martial arts skills.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warriors are masters of all weapons and tactics. We are intended to have a high degree of mastery with them and be able to practically use close to the very best available to anyone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That is what is spelled out in the Warrior Class Description and has been the case in-game for many years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Addressing the shield issue is trivial. All it takes is implimenting "Shieldmate" weapons and adding WAR to the list of classes that can use high ration shield appropriate weapons.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not doing so, allowing Knights to have such a large and such an unfair advantage, and flying in the face of long-standing characterisation of Warriors as the masters of all weapons and tactics is &lt;u&gt;reprehensible&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not putting Mock on Cyclone Blade's timer given the demonstrated by parces reduction in Warrior aggro using sword and board and 2Handers ALSO flies in the face of stated (but &lt;u&gt;made up&lt;/u&gt; on the spur of the moment) justifications for intentioanlly disappointing a class that a long anticipated a mainhander upgrade and instead was given a generic mainhander with an aggro proc so weak Rogues, Bards, and Rangers can use it in complete safety.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Remember what that made up on the spot justification was? In order to make you not reliant on random procs you've been given at-will aggro event generation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;BS. If that was the intent, Mock would have been on Cyclone Blade's timer, SoTP/Gloves of the Crimson Sigil would have had a replacement insted of our weapon buff being STAGNANT SINCE POP!!!!, and Warriors would not be building up aggro DWing before swithcing to sword and board, which thanks to inappropriate weapons for use with sowd and board we MUST do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The TRUTH Sharbreena is that for unknown reasons someone is erasing intended warrior advantage, stagnating the class, and telling one story to &lt;u&gt;attempt&lt;/u&gt; to justify giving us Dragonkilller II, while &lt;u&gt;knowing&lt;/u&gt; our aggro generation compromises our ability to effectively use sword and board and 2Handers while tanking.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Warriors not PREFERRED 2 Handers? Do make me laugh. Warriors, the masters of ALL weapons and tactics - we are intended to be preferred EVERYTHING. That's why our Epic 1.0 converted from 2-1Handers to a 2Hander.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The degree of unreasonable pig-headed irrationality being displayed is staggering. Staggering.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt; It's a boreing class, hard to move around, depend on everybody for everything..invis, levitiate, gate, coth, no escape methods at all. Basic manouver is to target mob hit auto attack and go back and forth between taunt and kick....taunt and kick. I played a warrior, hated the whole deal, way to boreing...Waiting for casters to med has to be about the worst thing out there.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Really, with out defensive and the mobs requireing it in raid settings there would be no real reason to play a warrior. Wich is probably why defensive was invented to begin with, even back then they could see the hand writeing on the wall. A no frills grunt type class, was doomed to be obsalete. So in comes this freak discapline that works really well againt freakish High DI mobs and bamo..The one class no body really cared about, now becomes the one class everyone has to have to advance progression wise.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;That would be about the time BB made his switch from paladin to warrior.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;SoE keeps going with the reinsisionment ideal rather than your outdated 'definition' wich no longer really exsists anyway. The point you made about your character technically being older than EQ..as mine is..would seem to explain why you chose paladin first..because you expected it to be what paladins were in the paper game...massively powerful tanks who had spells.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Kunark made knights useless, so you went to warrior since they were given extra tools at that time to make them "prefered" tanks. Now that SoE has actually made knights more knightly ( via the paper version) your annoyed because your&amp;nbsp;not the &amp;nbsp;"prefered tank in everything" anymore.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;WoW, who cares about that?..the game is too boreing for most folks who rejoin us with in a couple months.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;And again, knights feel compelled to tell warriors what needs to be fixed, vs minding their own business (staying on their threads).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;Fabled&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Kahm&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;and all the other knights, need to get banned from the war sections of the threads, so that useful war conversations can ensue.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;Even the majority of warriors know Battleblade is a tard. The fact you seem to be his yes man just makes you look stupid, not the knights you don't want posting here.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Go away. People spouting moronic crap like "ban all knights from posting" contribute even less to the conversation than Battleblade. He at least has a position, stupid though much of it may be.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

And the clerical gap between Paladins and Clerics is a LOT narrower than the one between Paladins and Warriors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Heck, it's narrow enough between Paladins and Clerics that when Druids MH more, Clerics really ought to become the Templars they always really were and be group tanks. They should at least tank as powerfully as Pallies cleric.

&lt;P&gt;According to you, since&amp;nbsp;knights can solo Vindi and warriors can't, paladins are overpowered TANKS, so since clerics soloed him first, I guess their tanking is going pretty good being as its better than warriors and knights.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;You can't even keep consistency in your retarded arguments.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Then if they are already Tanks, you'd have no problem&amp;nbsp; giving the warrior AA's, skillcaps, and a Taunt Button. I'n sure Necros would be VERY happy to recieve those things and plate armor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You can't even keep your silly responces consistant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You know absolutely my point and that I'm right. Tank all the same content as Warriors do and your outside of the tank archetype abilities should be parlor tricks - sparkles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tank Parity nulifies the one and only reason to have made the choice I did - to play a Warrior rather than a Knight.&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Battleblade-Xegony on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;06-12-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;07:42 PM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;The one and only reason you chose to play a Warrior over a Knight was superiority.&amp;nbsp; Removing the notion as well as the effective practice&amp;nbsp;that any class is &lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;superior&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; at character creation is a major step forward.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;You've always wanted to play a Paladin... you say it now, you love self-heals, you love the ability to rez, stuns and retargettable aggro... you gave up everything you cry and whine about now because they gave Warriors some significant game-changing abilities.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;You've never been about ANY type of equality... you've only been about superiority... let's face it, you gave up everything you so obviously desire to be a class based on one class being innately "superior"...&amp;nbsp; &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;U&gt;YOU&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; are the best example of someone who doesn't play the character they want to play based on perceived "class superiority."&amp;nbsp; &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;U&gt;YOU&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; single-handedly explain the reason why Tank Parity THROUGH&amp;nbsp;a balance between both Melee and Spellbook DIS-Parity&amp;nbsp;is far healthier than having the option of superiority based solely on character creation.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Even a broken clock is correct twice a day. But right now your hour arm is set on "Nuts" and your minute arm is set on "Retarded".&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Look up the words "deductive" and "logic", it might be enlightening. You make claims, then make further claims that invalidate those claims. You, hence, are stupid.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;You aren't right often, you are just loud. You may occasionally have a point but in the last few pages of this thread you haven't.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;So what single group mobs during Kunark could knights not tank? Oh wait, there were NONE.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;You rolled&amp;nbsp;a warrior because you couldn't deal with the &lt;STRONG&gt;INEQUITIES&lt;/STRONG&gt; you were facing as a paladin. &lt;STRONG&gt;YOU &lt;/STRONG&gt;are the one that wants "godmode" and you feel you are entitled because you think warriors used to have it, when all they really had was a short window of skill cap gaps, a longer window of hybrid exp penalties and double casting penalties, and an even longer window of &lt;STRONG&gt;PERCEIVED&lt;/STRONG&gt; inferiority.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;You aren't "conan" like you seem to fancy yourself, you are weak and pathetic and took what you thought was the easy way out and you are bitter that you no longer have advantages that were more perception than real in the first place leading to greater desirability.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Let me sum up the problem with all your whining and BS and misdirection:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;WARRIORS ARE NOT PASSED UP FOR SINGLE GROUP SPOTS IN ANY CONTENT&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;You know its true, and all the BS about "knight superiority" leading to "warrior unattractiveness" in single group content is a big fat lie.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I believe most knights have posted they think the tanking gap between warriors and knights is too low, both due to itemization issues and content. You hem and haw and harangue about how sony hates you and loves knights and how overpowered knights are, and almost &lt;STRONG&gt;NEVER SAY WHAT YOU WANT&lt;/STRONG&gt;, you just b*tch and moan and make rediculous generalizations and stupid comments. You have stated what you want before, why not keep asking for it? Because you know people think you are insane. Let me clarify for those that haven't seen your demands with regard to TANKING:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;BATTLEBLADE WANTS A 20-25% MITIGATION ADVANTAGE OVER KNIGHTS, WHICH WORKS OUT TO DEFENSIVE ALL THE TIME + DEFENSIVE TO MAKE IT EVEN WIDER 3/10 MINUTES&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;You're the one that wants godmode, and you think you'll get it by making retarded claims, and trying to get everyone to want to nerf knights.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Its funny that you are constantly yabbering about nerfing knights and knights are constantly arguing for upgrades to warriors. Is it fun to be the resident a-hole for all warriors?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Abazzagaroth, your a guest in the Warrior's Forum, you should not be so rude, even if you strongly disagree with Battleblades rather radical opinions.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;There&amp;nbsp;are very good arguements for some inadequacies of Warrior aggro, of&amp;nbsp;poor weapon upgrades&amp;nbsp;and issues like Shield Block, even if some few exagerate those issues or ask for rediculously broken and overpowered solutions, many of those core issues do still exist on the basic level.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;On the whole Warriors are about as equally desired in groups as they ever have been. There are some flaws that need sorting out, but non of them are breaking Warriors. The only real notable desirability advantage seems to be a very slight preference for SKs when people need a puller, but not enough a preference to really be worried about.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;I'm not a guest here. I'm a paying customer using my privilege as someone with an active station id and password to post my opinions with regard to a video game I pay for on a message board owned and operated by the company I pay for that privilege, operated to allow players of that game to discuss their issues.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;There is no script running when you log in yo check your characters to see where you can and cannot post. I wil post when I want, where I want, and only the mods can tell me what I can or cannot post or how to post.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;You don't like it, don't read my posts. It is inane when paladins whine about warriors on their boards and its inane when warriors whine about paladins on theirs.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
