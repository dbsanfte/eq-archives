Our glorious city was left<br>And I felt my whole life was in vain.<br></span></p><p><span>But I ventured on, through the Shadeweavers Thicket<br>And down to the Caverns. I killed the fiends that dwell<br>There under the surface, I swam in moldy waters,<br>I walked through the streets of the Shadowhaven<br>And I reached Nexus... I saw that everything changed.<br>What happened to our nation, to our children, to our hopes<br>Was everything wasted, am I cursed to travel alone?<br>But still I feel there is no better place than my home.</span></p><div></div>
