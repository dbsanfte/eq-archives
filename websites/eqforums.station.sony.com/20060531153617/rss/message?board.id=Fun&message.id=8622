      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;as much of a sadistic fool as i am i liked the aid grimel quest the best..there was a lot of detail involved and it made it so u had to visit alot of zones and know what u were doing and such</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;For me, has to be Breakdown in Communications.&amp;nbsp; It was long, it was challenging and, yes, at times, tedious, but the reward was well worth it and it made me experience some of the content in the GoD expansion that I might have skipped over. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;2nd would have to be tongue quest in GoD -- mostly 'cause the item rocks and because of my tendency towards being a pack rat, I didn't have much to do once we made it into Tacvi and the final pieces dropped. &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Favorite quest for me was the epic.&amp;nbsp; When I first started I remembered seeing a fellow necro with the 1.0 and thought **SMURF** thats cool, there werent any other particle weapons in game yet.&amp;nbsp; I was never in a truly high end guild back then so I was able to work on the epic all be it extremly slowly as it dragged on for a year or more, the drops were rare as can be, and my guild was finally able to start doing some of the harder fights I got closer and closer, it truly began to feel as I was closing in on finishing something epic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nothing like todays where your assured globes in anguish and all the fights can be done relatively quickly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Habesis on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;04-20-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;08:28 PM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;My favorite quest was doing the Whistling Fists as a human.&amp;nbsp; I was so determined to be one of the first humans and monks to do it that I put in a ton of effort to figure out how to do it.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The most exciting part came by me going into Fear as just a little guy (50somethingish) and sneaking and feign deathing past all the roaming creatures, finding Cazic Thule, figure out where he was going to walk to next, sneak up behind him and do the turn on without being killed.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Talk about blood pumping&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;!&amp;nbsp; Especially since that was long before you could summon your corpse in the Guild Lobby.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Najae on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;04-20-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;06:09 PM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;The qeynos badge of honour quest: it is fun following through the story line, I did it on my shaman&amp;nbsp;solo&amp;nbsp;as I went up level, so it was quite challenging.&amp;nbsp; I especially liked the mini game with the rats!&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>Favorite quest thats a hard one...&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
I really liked the ST key quest. It had alot of lore and it really&#xD;
played well into the history and linking of what we know and what&#xD;
happened. I loved the fact you met jaled dar, whos bones were last&#xD;
expansions "field of bone" and how klandicar is almost glad your&#xD;
killing her. I just like the feeling like this quest is "part" of the&#xD;
world not just there to give you something to do in EQ.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
I also really enjoyed... I dunno if it's a quest... but the "lore" of inktu'ta and choices you make with Jomica.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

      <description>The Spirit of Garzicor (AKA The Ethereal Bladed Naginata)&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
i cannot say enough good things about this quest. it has everything in&#xD;
my opinion. i wish that my 2.0 had as much lore as this quest. &lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
my favorite part, of course, is the moment in which you bring forth the&#xD;
spirit of Garzicor to you the first time, as a bodiless voice, shouting&#xD;
his two desires. for revenge against the kromzek who killed him, and&#xD;
for a way to return home to Veeshan.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
