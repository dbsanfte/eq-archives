    <description>Yeah, I understand your reasoning, but again, doesn't the benefit of getting new blood onto the server outweigh the negatives?&amp;nbsp; The reality is that nobody is going to transfer a naked character.&amp;nbsp; You might just as well roll a new one.&amp;nbsp; I wouldn't be too quick to assume that SOE is allowing transfers now just for the money they may also be hoping that it balances out the server populations some.&amp;nbsp; For every transfer onto zek by someone looking to "wreak havoc" (or by someone like me who is just looking for an extra challenge) you probably have at least one transfer off or quit.&amp;nbsp; Without the infusion of players, the inevitable day when Zek gets merged with a "blue" server or shut down altogether will just come that much faster.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Fixing Level Restricts</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=PVP&amp;message.id=12153#M12153</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I was talking&amp;nbsp;with a guild leader last night who told me that they'd made the decision to stay 65-.&amp;nbsp; Forever.&amp;nbsp; His reasoning (based on experience)&amp;nbsp;was that they woudln't even be allowed to raid PoP content (what, 5 expansions old now?) by the "uber" guilds if they broke that level.&amp;nbsp; That's pretty sad.&amp;nbsp; It seems that a lot of people on zek are 65 forever because 66 means that you're going to get chain-ganked by the "ubers" who hang out around the zone-ins to instanced content and epic encounters/turn-ins.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I've seen talk of changing the level restrictions on zek.&amp;nbsp; I think a better idea would be to replace them altogether with a "power ranking" that would better ensure that PvP is going to be a fight, and some fun, instead of just a one-sided beat-down.&amp;nbsp; Lets face it.&amp;nbsp; A level 66 with 200 resists and 800 AC has absolutely no shot against a level 70 with 2K+ AC and 600 resists.&amp;nbsp; That's not a fight at all.&amp;nbsp; It would be one thing if the "ubers" on the server showed a little sportsmanship and restraint, but that's way too much to ask for.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Instead of level restrictions, how about a "power" rating that takes into account resists, regen, shielding, and HP/mana to determine who should and shouldn't be fighting whom?&amp;nbsp; In reality, 4 up and down is too restrictive in some cases.&amp;nbsp; There are some 62s who would more than hold their own against some 70s.&amp;nbsp; In other cases it's not nearly restrictive enough as in the case of a "fungi" equipped 15 monk vs a non-fungi equipped 15 monk.&amp;nbsp; It would take a developer about a day to come up with a workable formula&amp;nbsp;that would determine whether player X and player&amp;nbsp;Y are at least somewhat evenly matched.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I think it would make for a healthier invironment, and more interest in&amp;nbsp;progressing beyond 65 by many people playing on Zek.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>In response to the original problem posed by this thread: yes and no.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
I think your idea, for the aforementioned reasons, would be extremely hard to implement.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Yes, guilds get killed on sight when they try to break into higher-end&#xD;
content. No, it's not as systematic as some would say. No, it's not as&#xD;
universal as some would say.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Pandemonium is the chief offender in this category.&amp;nbsp; They rarely&#xD;
launch any kind of patrol, they're just likely to show up if they&#xD;
happen to catch wind of something going on and harass/train any raid&#xD;
attempts to death. This is rarely premeditated, though. They tend to do&#xD;
it mostly for fun.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Fortunately, Pandemonium, at this point, seems to be regarded by&#xD;
everyone on the server outside of the guild, as a bunch of worthless&#xD;
griefers. We've seen them defeated pretty soundly by Defiant in mass&#xD;
PvP, calling some of their hegemony on Zek into question.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
And there are guilds, like Defiant, who rarely engage in this kind of&#xD;
behavior. Especially not PoP zones, or anything else similarly dated.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Then there are guilds somewhere in between, like Ascending Dawn, who&#xD;
may or may not harass emerging guilds attempting tougher content,&#xD;
depending on what members are involved, etc. &lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Also, whether a guild gets harassed depends very much on the guild.&#xD;
North Star Avengers/Northern Shadows experiences the problem you're&#xD;
describing, but not only because they're trying to probe the endgame.&#xD;
They employ very loose recruiting standards and as a result, many&#xD;
people have committed fairly stupid acts and offended members of&#xD;
endgame guilds while carrying the NSA guildtag. They're KOS for a&#xD;
reason. Growing guilds should be wary of recruiting in this fashion, as&#xD;
it almost inevitably leads to screwups and KOS status where most of the&#xD;
powerful guilds are concerned.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
There are times, however, when a guild is simply deemed competition and&#xD;
messed with/eliminated for that reason. When Hate's core merged with&#xD;
Pandemonium and the remainder of the guild became Nightmare Walking, by&#xD;
the time they'd navigated a few Ikkinz instances, spies from&#xD;
Pandemonium, Ancient Dawn, and Defiant had all entered the guild. Not&#xD;
because they'd angered anyone, just because they were beginning to draw&#xD;
members away from endgame app/trainer guilds, and so the guilds those&#xD;
app guilds fed began to develop an interest in keeping on/interfering&#xD;
with Nightmare Walking. Guild warfare and espionage is a part of life&#xD;
on Zek. It adds to the intrigue. Members of rising guilds will have to&#xD;
accept that the entrenched powers will always try to remain entrenched.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Can the powers that be on Zek be unseated? Of course. Will it take a&#xD;
miracle? Probably. Is this a bad thing? That could be said. Should this&#xD;
necesitate a rulechange? Absolutely not. Let's focus on getting those&#xD;
members of the endgame community who hack and exploit banned. That&#xD;
would simply be an application of longstanding, stringent EverQuest&#xD;
policies and would likely tip the balance at the top in the process. I&#xD;
can think of only one endgame guild that doesn't turn the other cheek&#xD;
to MacroQuesting, and even that guild has at least one fairly blatant&#xD;
MQ who they leave alone because he fulfills a big need for a critical&#xD;
class.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;I think they're suprised that anyone would want to.&amp;nbsp; I was amazed at how fast they approved it (within hours).&amp;nbsp; I think I understand your reasons for not wanting people to transfer, but doesn't the infusion of new blood on a server whose population is dwindling outweigh the negatives?&amp;nbsp; I'd think you'd want more folks like me coming over, not less.&amp;nbsp;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Wow.&amp;nbsp; That's an extremly well laid out response.&amp;nbsp; I appreciate you taking the time.&amp;nbsp; My experience pretty much tracks with what you've said.&amp;nbsp; It's more ad-hoc harassment than an organized attack usually.&amp;nbsp; Unfortunately with many raids that's all it takes.&amp;nbsp; Personally, if I were trying to bring a guild up (and I'm not) I wouldn't be raiding the planes.&amp;nbsp; There isn't any reason to anymore.&amp;nbsp; Better gear is to be had doing groupable instances that provide other things (like spells 66+) that are needed to progress.&amp;nbsp; There are also instanced raids that can be done harassment free as high as you want to go.&amp;nbsp; Yeah, you might get some folks PKed getting in, but it just takes a little persistance.&amp;nbsp; As for spies and intrigue, I see nothing wrong with that.&amp;nbsp; It's sauce for the goose.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;As far as guilds being KOS goes, I don't know.&amp;nbsp; It seems to me anyway that there is no rhyme or reason to ganking anymore on Zek.&amp;nbsp; You can carry any guild tag, or no guild tag, you can be any race, and it doesn't matter much.&amp;nbsp; Zone into Lavastorm or Undershore or Dranik's Scar and if there's a Pande or a AD or a Defiant there chances are he's going to come after you, for no other reason than because he can.&amp;nbsp; They've got the biggest sticks on the playground, and the temptation to play the bully is just too strong.&amp;nbsp; Few people will remember this, but Pande got to where Pande is because they were the first major guild that "cross-teamed" (allowed both dark and light races) on TZ.&amp;nbsp; In the process they started moving EQ PvP away from being an RPG where there was needed to be some reason (based on game lore) to kill someone&amp;nbsp;and started turning it into a FPS where you just kill anyone you're big enough to kill, anytime, for no reason at all.&amp;nbsp; The only problem with that is that EQ is a really great RPG, but a really crappy FPS, and not an FPS that many people want to play.&amp;nbsp; I don't know if Zek is already the least populated server on the network even after a 4 server merge yet or not, but it's probably close.&amp;nbsp; I know it's far less populated than Maelin where I've also spent some time this year.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The real problem I've seen with Zek&amp;nbsp; is the re-emergence of the " super twinks ".&amp;nbsp; We've all seen these guys, running around in full qvic / tacvi gear at 65 unguilded with 900 aa's ( some of which are required 70 but kept when you de-level ) that use this gear / aa advantage to totally destroy anyone with in range.&amp;nbsp; I've got a lvl 65 of my own now, got some qvic pieces and some DoD cursor loots but only around 45 or so aa's and has never been de-leveled.&amp;nbsp; A pretty stout level 65 with the exception of the aa's of course.&amp;nbsp; What these " super twinks " do to him makes me shiver at the thought of what they do to people that don't have access to the areas I have for gear.&amp;nbsp; They must just get 1 rounded every time cuz even my decently geared 65 stands no chance against these guys.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Suggestion.&amp;nbsp; Put more level restrictions on AA's so that a de-leveled character receives NONE of the benefits of the level 70 aa's he acquired before deleveling.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Better Gear requirement levels on ALL gear on Zek.&amp;nbsp; Items like the "Fabled Tantors&amp;nbsp;Tusk"&amp;nbsp; is the equivalent of many melee 2.0's and in no way should be held by a level 65.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Fungi tunic something like recommended 45 / required 53 or something along those lines.&amp;nbsp; Gear itemization is bad enough at the high end of the game .... but atleast that gear has " required level 70 " on nearly every piece and is difficult enough to get to that only the "hard-core raiding guilds" have access to it.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The bazaar and some " plat for sale "&amp;nbsp;web site and a positive balance on Mommy and Daddy's credit card shouldn't be the proving grounds for a PvP player.&amp;nbsp; These " super twinks " are a very serious problem if we are trying to maintain a healthy PvP environment on our server.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I won't go into the whole " hacking " issue but I would like to challenge the powers that be at SoE to give us " 30 days " of a serious representation on our server and I can guarentee they'd be able to catch and ban nearly 75% of the hackers in one fail swoop and when I say " ban " I mean " permanately ".&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;no offense, but i hate people for hiding behind level caps. im from sullon, the lowest population pvp server of them all. we had no level restrictions, meaning back when 65 was the highest level, they could run into your newbie exp zone and wreck you in seconds. noone complained, those who didnt like it simply left. on this server, oor healers help ruin fights. im not going to say i was good, but if i was winning a 1 v 1 or sometimes 1 v 2 and some random 65 came up and started healin my opponents, what was i to do. in my perfect game, restrictions would be removed altogether or at least widened, i hate fighting a 70 that has a 65 cleric friend. also, you trying to narrow the playing field would make for less pvp then there is now, because it would be so much more difficult to find people that you could fight because you have a few extra regen or what not.</description>

      <description>Well if you would remember that the "Zek" merge was a result of ALL PVP servers becoming depopulated for various reasons one should sit back and really think about what this means in the long term.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Griefing newbs on SZ was probably in the end what killed the server. When a server gains no new blood or gains less new blood than it loses from people quitting then the server is going to head into decline.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The main problem with the way EQ PVP has evolved is because the determining factor in victory or defeat went from a 5-letter word to a 4-letter word... S-K-I-L-L to G-E-A-R...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The reason for the gear thing becoming more prominant is because of MUDFLATION on bluebie servers. Becuse that 20/40 weapon is nolonger 'good' they needed to make a 30/40 weapon and then a 40/40 weapon then a 80/20 weapon... and so on with everything. Eventually even the whole resist system needed to be changed because originally it was designed on a scale where 100-150 was good enough to bounce the 'all or nothing' effects. Sure you needed a good bankroll and a full set of diamond/BD gear to pull it off but it was obtainable for the non-uber player with effort...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The other problem with EQ PVP is/was the Legends server and transfers to/from PVP servers in general. Why play on the PVP server to level up when you can shortcut your way to Legends and get to level 65 with a bunch of AAs and gear up there then come back when you are pimped out and wreak havoc? Why level up on ZEK when you can level up on Blue then transfer over with gear? Needless to say people who did not *EARN* their gear under the same circumstances (RED vs BLUE) should not be able to employ that gear in other settings which they did not earn it. To be completely *#&amp;amp;# honest... PVP was really ruined because SOE wanted to make a few quick and easy $$'s. THE END.&lt;br&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;to the OP:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;While such a system has been discussed in the past, it was found that there would simply be too many loopholes and problems with it. Lets say for example, one group attacks another group, their&amp;nbsp;group is good but they're using a new cleric and hence the cleric cant be attacked, thus providing them with an immortal healer. To counter this, there would have to be some sort of "PvP flagged" setup, which I'm sure would cause more problems than it would solve. As for guilds staying 65 and below, well that's really up to them, my guild has gone from raiding garbage up to Ikkinz4 in&amp;nbsp;GoD,5th tier DoN, DoD,&amp;nbsp; and PoR in only a few months all while being stepped on by the other guilds. It's a matter of how much you're willing to invest in progressing, those who put the time and effort in will get ahead and those that dont will continue to **SMURF** and whine.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Fair enough, but by that reasoning, there shouldn't be level restrictions at all.&amp;nbsp; Changing the range from 4 to 8, as I've seen suggested, won't stop the OOR healer problem, it will just shift it in the other direction.&amp;nbsp; You'll see 70 clerics intervening in fights between 62s.&amp;nbsp; The only way to solve that problem is by removing level restrictions altogether, or adding a check to make it impossible to heal PVP damage if you are OOR.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Level restrictions are supposed to (I think anyway) make it possible to play the game without constantly being attacked by players who are so powerful relative to you that you really have no chance of defending&amp;nbsp;yourself.&amp;nbsp; What I'm saying here is that levels aren't a good indicator anymore.&amp;nbsp; There can be enormous differences in stats (and therefore ability)&amp;nbsp;between players of the same level, let alone a few levels apart.&amp;nbsp; There can also be players that are pretty evenly matched, even though they are a number of levels apart.&amp;nbsp;If there are going to be checks in place to make for relatively fair fights PVP, they should be effective.&amp;nbsp; Yeah, there will be loopholes unless SOE suddenly starts putting a lot more attention into how they design and implement PVP, but the benefits probably outweigh the drawbacks.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;If you remove level restrictions entirely (as one poster here seems to be suggesting) it will just lead to more concentration of power in the hands of fewer and fewer players and probably, ultimately a game that will go away sooner because it's not profitable to operate anymroe.&amp;nbsp; It's good to remember that SOE makes just as much money each moth from someone who logs on 10 hours a month as it does from the "uber" who plays that much in two days.&amp;nbsp; If the 10 hour a month guys all go away rather than facing being chain-ganked, the "uber" is going to find himself without a game to play sooner rather than later.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

To the OP, yeah uber's who run around destroying weaker guild's raids&#xD;
or whatever are kinda stupid -- but what're you gonna do? This is a pvp&#xD;
server, fighting to progress is the whole point of the server. Though&#xD;
really it'd be cooler if you were fighting against guilds of your lvl&#xD;
for zones, rather than getting griefed by guilds years ahead of you in&#xD;
progression. But there's no way to enforce this without ruining pvp&#xD;
across the board -- this is a tough server, keep at it and eventually&#xD;
you'll get through it. You ever try talking to some of the top guilds&#xD;
about an alliance? Someone to help you control the zone while you raid?&#xD;
Or moving to instanced raids? I'm sure there are solutions to this if&#xD;
you're creative (that don't involve hacking).&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Hey, thanks for the reply.&amp;nbsp; I'm not the guild leader, so it's not really my call (about alliances) I, and the woman that I play with most of the time are among the few 65+ players in the guild, and so the effect for us is that we don't have the opportunity to progress (raid wise) as quickly as we'd like.&amp;nbsp; It'll be a long time before we're raiding at the same level that I was before I transferred to Zek.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;FWIW, I agree with you, it's a tough server (I transferred to it for the challenge in the first place) and it should be, and yeah, there's enough instanced content now, even at the very high end, that it's possible to progress if you're really hard-core.&amp;nbsp; It makes me worry a little about the future of the server though.&amp;nbsp; The big numbers aren't hard-core, and big numbers is what SOE wants and needs to keep the game running.&amp;nbsp; If the server population dwindles down to just that hard-core (because it's too tough to play and progress as a casual player since you're cooling your heels in shadowrest as much as you're playing) is it going to die?&amp;nbsp; Level restrictions are supposed to give the non-hard core guy a bit of space to play the game.&amp;nbsp; I guess what I'm saying here is that they aren't doing that anymore, at least not in the 65-70 game, because the top-end gear + Epic 2.0 weapons&amp;nbsp;are so overpowered compared to what you can equip in lower level raids, or by grouping.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;For me personally, it doesn't matter much.&amp;nbsp; 12 minutes in shadowrest once in a while (which is all it costs&amp;nbsp;anymore)&amp;nbsp;gives me natural breaks to do other things.&amp;nbsp; I even use PVP to my advantage sometimes now.&amp;nbsp; Had a rogue stuck in undershore last night without a gate pot.&amp;nbsp; Rather than begging someone to go port her out, I only had to wait about 2 minutes for Mr. Uber to show up and gank her right back to her bind spot.&amp;nbsp; Thank you, Mr. Uber.&lt;/P&gt;</description>
