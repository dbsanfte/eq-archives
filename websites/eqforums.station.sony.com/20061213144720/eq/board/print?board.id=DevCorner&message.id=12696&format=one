				Class:Warrior<br><br>HP: Pretty important to a tank of course but I don't necessarily need more just so mobs can be made to hit harder<br>Mana:meh<br>Endurance: Important for using skills discs but I don;t have any problems with the way it's been itemized so far<br>AC: The most important tank stat gimme more more more.<br><br>HP Regen: meh, not important to me at all unless I'm soloing. I'm getting heals right?<br>Mana Regen: N/A<br>Endurance Regen: *blink**Did you actually just say Endurance Regen? It's the single most deficient part of the entire game and it needs to be addressed, End Regen should be about on par with Mana Regen for casters.<br><br>Strength, Stamina etc: Nothing wrong with the way they are now, no need for more unless the caps get raised again<br><br>Resists: Could use a bit more on these, for example I'm way over the cap on all my physical stuff but I have a hard time getting enough resists. Then again, anything I really need to resist is probably unresistable.<br><br>Attack: meh it adds dps but doesn't really help me do my job as a tank, easily maxxed though.<br>Delay: I want to avoid ripostes and damage shields so higher delay weapons are where it's at for warriors in my opinion, lower delays for offhanders i suppose but I'm really more concerned with aggro than anything else where weapons are concerned.<br>Damage: I want high damage to go with that higher delay<br>Range: Wouldn;t mind having a ranged attack that I don't have to swap aout with my "good" range item. I know bandolier helps but I still don't have enough bandoliers.<br>Haste: Important but there's nothing wrong with the way it's done now except maybe put it on some more items so it's not such a dkp hog.<br><br>Combat Effects: Need more items with it that also have stats like Avoidance, Shielding and AC, I need more CE but I can;t really sacrifice other things for it like i'd like to.<br>Shielding: Big time need for this on items, augs or whatever, we can't sacrifife it.<br>Stun Resist: need more<br>Strikethrough: meh.get rid of ALL the spam though please.<br>Spell Shield: big<br>Avoidance: see shielding<br>Accuracy: meh<br>DoT Shielding: i never notice it but I guess so<br><br>Skill mods: Defensive stuff I like<br>Click effects: I love them, from the useful stuff to illusions or whatever, just need more buff slots to go with them<br>Proc Effects: Static Blow please, better augs weapons with proc rates etc, did I mention Static Blow?<br>Worn effects: defensive stuff<br>Focus effects: give me enough EoA to keep up with other classes' aggro output.<br>Shields: Yes glad you asked we need more good shields and better ways to use them, say a warrior useable weapon similar to what knights get that can only be used with a shield?<br><br><div></div>
