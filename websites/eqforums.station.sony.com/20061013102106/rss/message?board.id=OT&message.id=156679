    <description>Oh yeah, it's FRIDAY!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So what are the weekend plans?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For me, I'll be splitting between EQ and EQII. Been focusing on EQII mostly lately, getting through my EQLive burnout, but coming back in for raids. I am going to try to be in Live though, and help guildies with various flagging and such that I can. I'm both eager and dreading the UCS coming to EQLive; since I'll be able to join my EQLive channels from EQII :), but I won't be able to use EQIM any more :(. Hopefully IM gets updated in time or soon after.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Going to be a rainy, dreary weekend from the sounds of it, so I'm just sticking around home, maybe do some cleaning up. Dust is getting a bit thick all around. :) Mom may come and get me at some point, since my sister is moving out west and mom wants to have one last Family Dinner when my sis comes through. (Ash will be back for XMas and stuff but the distance is a factor)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Was thinking of seeing Cars, but with the rain, I 'll probably hold off till next week. Instead I've got a few DVD's I rented I'll have to finish watching instead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So what about the rest of you?</description>

      <description>I'm planning on a football overdose over the weekend.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Caught the Germany (total mismatch) and England (good match except for some abyssmally bad lack of refereeing in the second half which fortunately didn't make much of a difference) already.&amp;nbsp; Planning on catching Japan/Australia monday night too (should be a good match if Japan can focus - something which they have problems maintaining), which won't bode well for me at the office tuesday morning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Problem is the EARLY matches start 10pm my time zone &amp;gt;.&amp;lt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Oh, and hopefully I can pick up my last hard curse raid (Draygun) and be essentially ready for demiplane.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;I quit playing EQ last week.&amp;nbsp; Not going to play for awhile.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I want to start riding my bike but I've been busy doing other stuff or the weather hasn't co-operated.&amp;nbsp; I &lt;U&gt;need&lt;/U&gt; to make time for it.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Other than that, I haven't made plans.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;With that said, today I spent the afternoon on the phone with mortgage brokers and our bank, and got firm approval for a house up to 220k range for a NEW HOUSE (WOOT), am extremely excited. Thursday we looked at a few houses, and Saturday going to look at a few more, the mortgage payments on a house in this area for that price is fairly expensive, so will probably be looking for a little less expensive house.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;In either case, we are going with the build to suit homes, vs ones already standing, we will pick out our design, and the finishing trim's (carpet, hardwood floor, etc.) over the weekend and into next week. If all goes well, we should be able to move into our brand new house by the end of the year.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Comic Sans MS" color=#993300 size=3&gt;Going to work on Htaed's crafting before they destroy the entire crafting system :womanmad: (and not looking forward to the upcoming summoner nerfage either :womansad: )&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Comic Sans MS" color=#993300 size=3&gt;May get around to working on Ryufus' skills before they nerf that as well (no more soloing Kren to work on combat skills when not even Gloomingdeep will be a safe place to die :womansad: )&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Comic Sans MS" color=#993300 size=3&gt;Will watch The Seven Samurai on Sunday&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Tomorrow my son turns 18.&amp;nbsp; I don't know if he will be around home or not, I should probably ask him tonight.&amp;nbsp; Anyway, I imagine Saturday morning we will be going to the bank to cash the check his grandmom gave him and get some additional money for him.&amp;nbsp; If he doesn't have other plans, I will take him shopping.&amp;nbsp; Apparently he's decided to become fashionable and so none of the stores near us are suitable.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Don't know about EQ plans.&amp;nbsp; As my accounts are shutting down, my spirit goes up and down.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; My secondary account with Shezi the Cleric will be shut down in 3 weeks because of the billing issues I've been fighting.&amp;nbsp; It seems to be not worth doing much in the game since I have an end in sight.&amp;nbsp; I do log in for an hour or so to clear out some saved tradeskill supplies.&amp;nbsp; /sigh.&amp;nbsp; It would be nice to have some fun in the game, maybe our friends will play this weekend and we can finally get Kharl's alt the group temp spell.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;As usual, Kharl has to work OT tonight, and then has to go in early on Sunday so no other plans for the weekend.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Maybe I'll do some sewing stuff Sunday afternoon while he is sleeping instead of the EQ stuff I've been doing.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>Well, this week I have been working 11-12 hours a day since Sunday with maybe 4 or 5 hours of sleep each night at the most.&amp;nbsp; So I'm in no mental state to actually make many plans for the weekend.&amp;nbsp; I do have tomorrow off so I'll be playing EQ for a while.&amp;nbsp; Sunday night (after another 11 hour shift =/ ) I'll be getting together with the guys for an increasingly rare wrestling ppv.&amp;nbsp; Other than that I'll be trying to maintain my sanity in preparation for another week exactly like this one.&amp;nbsp; A month of this is going to kill me if I don't get more rest somehow, but more rest = absolutely no time for anything.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>I had planned on spending the weekend goofing around with Claudia. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately, her boyfriend called defax on her in a fit of rage. To keep them from taking her kids, she had to move away to another town to live with her aunt. It's much to far for either of us to drive right now, so I won't be seeing her for awhile. :(&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;WIll probably just hang around the house. Play a little EQ, do some babysitting, and possibly watch the remake of the Hills Have Eyes. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh, and watch the first 2 seasons of 4400, so I can follow along to Sunday's episode. &lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>No real plans for a change this weekend!&amp;nbsp; I'll probably do some&#xD;
yard work.&amp;nbsp; EQ wise I hope to get my Druid to level 36 in&#xD;
Stonebrundt.&amp;nbsp; Then Possible move to Gunthak since the XP seems to&#xD;
be slowing down.&amp;nbsp; There's a Bank in Gunthak isn't there?&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

      <description>My MOther is visiting, so EQ time will be limited, I hope to make partial raids on Sunday, but only if hubby doesn't have any other plans as it is his birthday.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Work tonight, work Sunday night, so sleep pattern will be all over the place, and Saturday is my daughters jazz recital in the afternoon, and the actual recital is in the evening.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Tonight we're going out to Carabas and then I'm going to suffer through a movie because I said I would if she watched Harry Potter.&amp;nbsp; I'm tempted to set off the fire alarms.&amp;nbsp; I thought the roofers where done but I was wrong, they are now working on the flat deck above the patio and all the **SMURF** is falling into the god **SMURF** pool.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Tomarrow is foot doctor visit #2 with blood test results back.&amp;nbsp; I really want to know what the hell is wrong with my feet.&amp;nbsp; Dropping my summer class gave me more free time but now without work or the gym I'm going insane.&amp;nbsp; Another 25 hours and 15 minutes for my apointment still.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Sunday I'm debating just going to the gym anyways.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
