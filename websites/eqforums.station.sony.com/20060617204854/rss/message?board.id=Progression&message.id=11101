    <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will there be an active enforcement against Macroquesters and other such programs on this server? This type of cheating is detrimental to the gaming experience on current servers, and I for one would like to see a more active role played by the gm's and dev's on this server to prevent such cheating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;My guess is there will be a lot of cheating on The Combine.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;2 groups of players will be doing this. The first are hardcore gamers that want to be the 'first'&amp;nbsp; to kill various mobs. Some of these people will cheat to get ahead. We saw it happen on Stromm no reason it won't happen again here.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The 2nd are 'boxers' playing EQ as a business. I'm sure some of them will see this server as&amp;nbsp; a new opportunity to make real life $$ on a new and no doubt inflated economy. Again Stromm had it's fair share of people doing just this often resorting to any and all tactics to gain a named spawn camp then using macro scripts to farm it constantly.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;My question would be what are the devs going to do specifically to stop this happening? On Stromm we all complained and nothing was done besides some account warnings for the more blatent and stupid among the cheating community.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The person with the most AA's across all servers only has 66 days played. 1755 AAs.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Whats the very least amount of time you could get to 70? Lets say something crazy like 24 hours.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;So he's had 65 days to get 1755 AA's. Thats over 1 AA per hour. Not that hard I suppose if you've never done anything but xp but it's certainly suspicious.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;font size="4"&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;You make it sound like 1 aa per hour is somehow unusual.&amp;nbsp; I can make 2-3 per hour solo at any of 3-4 different places.&amp;nbsp; a good group in MPG will average 3 aa per hour per char.&amp;nbsp; a good group in RSS will average 5 aa per hour per char.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;personally, if hacking can't be completely stopped then sony should try to take a page out of the cops line-up.. Maybe one a month flood the servers with  techs looking for hackers, ban them.. not just temporarily but if it is proven fact that they were cheating ban them permenently.   By flooding the servers with techs now and then with out warning will be like the cops and their dwi check points.  They can't stop people from drinking and driving but they can scary the hack out of people and make them think twice before they do it.  Never know if a check point is right around the corner.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only way to stop all hacking is to turn off the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think SoE does a better job at blocking hackers then you think, they just don't do the Public Executions you see on other games to show how many people are caught and banned. Of course they will never catch everyone, people just using showEq and other packet sniffers to just check if mobs are up in a zone or simple things like that wont be caught, but the ones using warp hacks and such I think are getting caught and banned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also someone mentioned about people &amp;quot;appearing&amp;quot;... This isn't not always an indication of &amp;quot;hacking&amp;quot; ...I two box a lot and I think SoE has over the years introduced code in crowded zones like PoK to not draw idle PCs on your screen, I often will log on one character run it over to another for buffs etc only to not be able to see my other PC. I have to move the other PC a bit and all of a sudden it &amp;quot;pop's&amp;quot; into view.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;They may have something that monitors logs or something if they suspect someone cheating. They are not however able to detect anything like macroquest unless you use it stupidly. If you use warping or something similar that is a memory hack which is very easy to catch. I've had first hand experience with this and they can only suspect. It is really at the GM's discretion. Granted most servers don't even see GM's for days on end and this is what worries me with the new server. If there is a GM pressence they seem to catch things faster. I was on stormhammer where they had 10 GM's. Cheating is everywhere as it was even on stormhammer but I will tell you this....I knew alot of people who got banned on stormhammer for macroquest and using a major exploit with a ranger only because the GM's were very active and they would monitor things.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;As developers, we don't personally monitor these things, however... We do put in as much logging, tracking, and foolproof methods of alerting the appropriate parties when someone is hacking the game client.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I'm just as appalled by hackers as you guys are -- If you have names, feel free to give them to me in a PM, I'll be more than happy to get ahold of the Server Investigations Team&amp;nbsp;and ask them to look into&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Not that this is the place to post...&amp;nbsp; but apparently those "server investigations teams" are corruptible.&amp;nbsp; On Seventh Hammer server we had a guild that was notorious for hacking, would admit it in in-game public channels along with things like "but they won't do anything about it" as well as on third party message boards.&amp;nbsp; /reports were done in game, petitions were submitted with links to the message boards and you know what?&amp;nbsp; Nothing was ever done about it.&amp;nbsp; They even posted screenshots clearly showing their use of MQ &lt;STRONG&gt;on the front page&lt;/STRONG&gt; of their guild website.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;So either those teams are corrupt, or just incompetent.&amp;nbsp; You may be appalled by hackers as much as we are, but apparently the people that are supposed to take care of them aren't.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I see people quite blatantly using macros to forage 24 hours a day, and making a tidy profit from it (dire wolf tufts, drake eggs, that kind of thing). They do this day after day month after month in the same zones, sometimes multiple characters doing the same thing. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;On Zek I encountered blatant hackers repeatedly and they were so many and so annoying that I left the server. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Personally I'm not really against macros, but if I can't do it then neither should they hehe &amp;nbsp;:P &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;A RL friend of mine has been using MQ forever. He also runs some form of ShowEQ (I'm sure its changed often to&amp;nbsp;get by whoever is in charge of the bannings)&amp;nbsp;still that only gets banned about once every 2-3 months, so its no big deal to pick up a new trash account for 20 bucks when it happens. I've played EQ since just before Kunark and he's the only person I know irl that has played longer.&amp;nbsp;The guy is actually crazy skilled. With the programs he uses he boxes 10 people on 3 comps by himself. So yeah, I'd say the stuff isn't monitored very well. Regardless of how illegal it is, its still nutty to watch. What DOES seemed to be monitored is the older forms of MQ that had some obvious hacks in them. When you can set your&amp;nbsp;run speed&amp;nbsp;from 1-10, bard speed being 1, GM speed being 3, and you run from one end of the zone to the other with one push of the key in front of people, you&amp;nbsp; kinda deserve to get banned ;p But shrug,&amp;nbsp;none if it really bothers me. People can play however they want to.</description>

      <description>I don't known which program he use to cheat, if it's a real player on a real server, if it's a GM who just doing fun.

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imo, it would be pointless at this stage on the regular servers to give names. Its so wide spread that I do not believe anything will be done about it on a pure cost basis. Granted this is just my opinion from my observations on my server, but form where I sit… its bad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The progression server would be that much better, if this could be kept under control from the start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</description>

Its so wide spread that I do not believe anything will be done about it on a pure cost basis. Granted this is just my opinion from my observations on my server, but form where I sit… its bad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The progression server would be that much better, if this could be kept under control from the start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's never pointless to root out cheaters. </description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;use of MQ is pretty rampant, especially at the high end of the game...even in guilds that try to stomp it out, people just go /anon and hack away on off raiding times, even if they dont use it on the raids.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;today I find people hacking to kill a mob has pretty much died down completely. Its been a long time since I've seen someone standing at a zone in weilding 2 unequipable items attacking a boss mob whos at the other end of the zone.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;warping still seems to be big though since I imagine its a lot harder to track. I know this one guy on my server does of a lot of warping, but its pretty much impossible to prove it to somone who wasn't watching when it happened.&lt;/div&gt;</description>
