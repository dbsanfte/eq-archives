      <description>Now that all servers are merging, ive decided to make a site for everyone to talk instead of having to check multiple forums to see whats happening after merger. Feel free to check out everquestpvp.com. Its a work in progress and hoping to grow along with the merger.</description>

      <title>Mobhunter rumor: All PVP servers to merge, Sam won't be so lonely anymore.</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Sullon&amp;message.id=741#M741</link>
      <description>http://mobhunter.com/000044.html&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ok, time for the scoop....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Recently, a large group of players from the Zek servers, Tallon, Vallon, Sullon, and Rallos, got together with representatives from SOE to discuss their merger. These servers, being evil red PVP servers, have a much different demographic and player base than the other pansy huggy blue servers. They also, apparently, have many fewer active players.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My vast network of spies tells me that SOE is indeed considering consolidating all four of these servers. While they have no definite plans yet, there are discussions within SOE to consolidate these four servers together. It is easy to consider this a reactionary move, however SOE apparently considered this merger well before EQ2's release and the meeting with the Zek players.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Those same spies did not reveal what the rule set would be for this combined server, so they were all immediately put to death.</description>

      <title>Chat Transcript with a CSR Agent</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Sullon&amp;message.id=705#M705</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV align=left&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Question: Why are character transfers not allowed off of sullon zek? Lack of balance and discipline has caused the server to become more of a cesspool of hackers than anything relating to fun. Currently, there are not enough active players online to raid anything. Why are character transfers not allowed?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;CSR Shane S.: Hello Pinhedd, Thank you for contacting Sony Online Entertainment. One moment please, while I read your question. Thank You!&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Pinhedd: hello&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;CSR Shane S.: The characters cannot be transferred from / to Sullon Zek. I suggest you to submit your feedback for this by /feedback command&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Pinhedd: what I would like to know is why&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Pinhedd: there's no coding issues as Characters can be transfered easily to/from legends and beta servers&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;CSR Shane S.: There is no specific reason for that, this is just a policy that not to transfer any character from this server, we may open the transfer in future.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Pinhedd: that's good to know as having 30 someodd people in PoK, and being unable to group with 25 of them due to hardcoded teams leaves little fun to be had short of soloing&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;CSR Shane S.: Please ask all of them to do feedback so that we can implement this feature infuture soon.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Pinhedd: additionally, is there any ETA on any upcoming PVP changes? the ones that went live in Augest did more harm then good.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;CSR Shane S.: No, there is no ETA for this , just kleep checking the updates on the EQ website &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Pinhedd: thank you, would it be alright if I posted a transcript on the EQLive boards to clear up the confusion?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;CSR Shane S.: Yes, that's fine&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;CSR Shane S.: Is there anything else I can help you with today Pinhedd?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Pinhedd: okay, thank you Shane, have a nice day&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Pinhedd: thats it for now&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;CSR Shane S.: Thank you for visiting SOE chat, Pinhedd. If there is anything else we can do for you please say so now. Otherwise, please end this session. Thank you and have a Good day.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;EDITS: Changed my real name to my chat handle&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;So as you can see, there is NO REASON why characters CANNOT be transfered off the sever, its just policy. If you read this and would like to be moved to a more populated server, please do a /feedback in game. Additionally, there are no planned PvP changes in the immediate future (duh).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <title>On small servers, reduce LDON size to 2.</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Sullon&amp;message.id=701#M701</link>
      <description>2-boxers would be able to do some LDON's without having to scrounge for a 3rd person. It is very hard to get an LDON group on Sullon Zek because of 2 reasons: 1) it is probably the smallest production server. 2) Rule sets prevent 2/3's of the servers population from joining your group.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This would keep me playing for another couple of months SONY they change this.</description>

      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Sullon&amp;message.id=698#M698</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I am having more fun in EQ1 then I ever had, I six box so low population and lfg dosnt really effect me. Zones are open and I can get most any camp I want. 2.5 million plat from selling OoW items heh.. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;But the good team is basically gone, right now there are no Black Prophcey online and its prime time starting saturday. 13 Hate members online and 3 DivCol people online. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Traders have went from 4-5000 items at peak to about 2700 items now... A very accurate indication of server population in my opinion.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Im staying - WoW is way to cartoony for me, and EQ2 dosn't have close to the content that EQ1 has, and i have to much time invested in my characters. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I figure they will allow server moves at some point or merge servers, there is no way they will keep a server up for 200ish people (6 of which are me heh).... &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;step 1 : mailto:EQFeedback@soe.sony.com&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;include - &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If you want to retain customers from SZ, you must do at minimum two &lt;BR&gt;things:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;1) allow transfers on and off of SZ, to and from any other server (blue &lt;BR&gt;or &lt;BR&gt;red)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;2) change the ruleset on SZ to make it guild v. guild, or RZ-type &lt;BR&gt;ruleset, &lt;BR&gt;because having the server populations SO low right now, combined with &lt;BR&gt;the &lt;BR&gt;fact that you can only get groups with people on your OWN team, which &lt;BR&gt;effectively gives you 1/3 of the people to group with that you would on &lt;BR&gt;a &lt;BR&gt;normal server, makes it an impossible server right now.&amp;nbsp; You cant do &lt;BR&gt;anything anymore because you only have 1/3 of the people you can group &lt;BR&gt;with &lt;BR&gt;that are on-line (those that are on your own team), and there just arent&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;enough people on-line anymore when the server is hardcoded with 3 &lt;BR&gt;teams.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I have invested so much time in my character, I hate to quit, but I'm &lt;BR&gt;not &lt;BR&gt;gonna start from scratch again with a new character, and I'm not gonna &lt;BR&gt;keep &lt;BR&gt;paying for a game that is no longer playable because there are not &lt;BR&gt;enough &lt;BR&gt;people that you can group with to do the things that make the game fun.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If you dont do something soon, you are going to see this server go &lt;BR&gt;totally &lt;BR&gt;dead, and lose most of the players to other games.&amp;nbsp; If you guys dont do &lt;BR&gt;something, Im gonna quit, and going to play your competition's game, not&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;totally out of spite, but because if I'm forced to start over, I'm &lt;BR&gt;gonna &lt;BR&gt;start over in a game that is new to me, and has some mystery, and I wont&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;choose one of your games because if you force me to quit because you &lt;BR&gt;wont do &lt;BR&gt;what your customers want in order to enjoy your game, this treatment of &lt;BR&gt;your &lt;BR&gt;customers now makes me reluctant to buy your product again.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Step 2 : once you get your reply , http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_feedback.jsp&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;include the same material as you did in step 1 and hopefully they will save our eq experience.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;ps thanks spyder for the great subject material ;p.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>Sullon Zek, what can be done?</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Sullon&amp;message.id=653#M653</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Hi, &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;just some thoughts from someone who has played this game for years on Sullon Zek. My apologies if words are miss-spelled etc, bare with me please, it's not my first language.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Today, Sullon Zek is empty. There is nothing&amp;nbsp; to do on the server, even less PvP. So, what can be done? I'm honestly not sure, but these are some ideas that comes to mind. I don't say they are the best, but it's just some brainstorming.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Allow Character transfer to and from SZ.&lt;BR&gt;Yes. We need the people. Yes, there are a fair few people who wishes to come to SZ with their characters without having to reroll.&lt;BR&gt;Or at least open up a free server transfer&amp;nbsp;from Sullon Zek&amp;nbsp; so we can play on a server that at least have some people on it.&lt;BR&gt;Legends isn't really an option, since Ubisoft costumers (aka Euro players) aren't allowed to go there cos of rules between Ubisoft and SOE, and a lot of the players on Sullon Zek are European players.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Merge the teams a.k.a Turn Sullon Zek to a blue server.&lt;BR&gt;While I'm not a big fan of this idea, maybe it's the way to go? /shrug. At least then people could play. PvP very rarely happens on Sullon Zek, and if it does, it's broken because none of the supposed PvP changes that was suppose to fix PvP has gone live yet (and will they ever?).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Merge Sullon Zek together with another PvP server.&lt;BR&gt;I'm sure at least one of the other PvP servers could use some fresh blood.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I've heard a number of other suggestions about how to save Sullon Zek, but I honestly forget them all, and a fair few I left out from here since they wouldn't be doable.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Please, do something about Sullon Zek. It is a great server which has always been left a bit behind, since GM's are not a big fan of the server, but it's really an awsome place to play on.&lt;BR&gt;Something needs to happen, and it's soon imo.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>character transfer (remaining on SZ)</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Sullon&amp;message.id=641#M641</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;i'm writeing this in an attempt to understand why players are not allowed to transfer from one account to another on sullon zek. while doing some brainstorming the first thing that jumped into my mind was that this rule was made back when sullon only allowed each account to only have 1 char on it.with that in mind yes i can see why&amp;nbsp;it would be pointless to alow someone to transfer a char to&amp;nbsp;another account.&amp;nbsp;that rule has sence been changed to 3 chars per account. the second thing i came up with was the fact that each account is only alowed to make characters of the same team. so moving a troll SK to an account with 2 druids on it would be in violation, and the customer service people would have to check this befor completeing the move. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <title>Sullon Zek is dying!</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Sullon&amp;message.id=639#M639</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Since I dont know where else to post this, I thought I should still let my feelings be known about this. Sullon Zek is a dying server. If you think otherwise, I'd like to see you justify the fact that there are very few people that play on it anymore, and those that do are deeply involved in one of the major guilds. The bazaar is a joke, and opportunities for grouping are becomming fewer. When I started on the server a year ago, I was excited, but I have seen it gone down hill quickly. Does anyone else think this way? Anyway, something needs to be done to fix this server and make it more exciting and more balanced for all teams to play, and all levels. Thanks&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>A Modest Proposal</title>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Hi,&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 3 days on Sullon Zek and reaching&amp;nbsp;lvl 8 does not qualify me to make suggestions about a server, but I do have one thought.&amp;nbsp; When a team has lost control of it spawn area, the only place in the entire game where newbies can do their armor quest, some ideas for change seem appropriate.&amp;nbsp; In 3 days as a Good I was PvP killed once and PKed 18 times.&amp;nbsp; Define PK as being killed by Reds, usually in the 30-50 range.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; What would be wrong with designating a "home zone" and the next nearest zone needed for newbie armor drops as non-PK areas?&amp;nbsp; I am not asking for a non-PvP zone, just no PK.&amp;nbsp; In my case, no PK in Faydark and Crushbone.&amp;nbsp; PvP is fine, which means I can fight any White I want to, but I will not be&amp;nbsp;PKed by any Reds.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; If Sullon Zek is a PvP server and not&amp;nbsp;simply a&amp;nbsp;PK server, I think this is much more in keeping with the intent.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Beidan&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 8&amp;nbsp; Bard on Sullon Zek&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <title>PVP Server Merge!!!</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Sullon&amp;message.id=628#M628</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Will EVER Quest be around for EVER??? and if so, what the future of the&amp;nbsp;PVP server??? I personally think that EQ will be around and somewhat popular for a long time, but I'm not so sure about the pvp servers. As the&amp;nbsp;EQ population dwendels on both blue and pvp servers I figure there will be merges of some sort. I want to see what everyone thinks about merging one or both of the other pvp servers with Sullon Zek, under Sullen Zek rule sets. Hell, I would even take there rule sets. I just want to see more folks around!!!! This has to happen sooner or later, doesn't it? Or do you think they will try to merge us with a blue server???&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;When EQ2 comes out we are going to loose some of the population of EQ1 arn't we? I was also thinking that EQ2 has more pvp in it? and the PVP servers where going to take the biggest hit in population loss?.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Just throwing that out there. I have to know what you guys think?&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>Former SZ player, just came back to EQ...</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Sullon&amp;message.id=593#M593</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;As the title says, I just came back to EQ after a couple years playing DAoC and Shadowbane.&amp;nbsp; I have been toying around with a necro on a blue server so I could see and do some things that I've never really gotten to do before.&amp;nbsp; I still have characters on SZ though and I've been thinking about starting up again here.&amp;nbsp; I have a couple of questions first though:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;My characters are goods.&amp;nbsp; Is good still in as sad of shape as it was 2.5 years ago when I left?&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Who are the better good team guilds now?&amp;nbsp; I only recognized Sanctus Lumen of the guild names I saw in PoK last night.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Do they take lower level toons?&amp;nbsp; My three characters are between level 23-30&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Is hacking as bad as I'm reading here?&amp;nbsp; If it is I may just say screw it.&amp;nbsp; I don't mind getting ganked but I hate cheaters.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Any answers would be much appreciated.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>The hacking is out of control</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Sullon&amp;message.id=585#M585</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I play on SZ &amp;amp; im about fed up with it.&amp;nbsp; Every single day i play EQ i ran into at least 1 hacker who absolutely ruins the game for me.&amp;nbsp; Sony, im gonna be blunt &amp;amp; honest, your GM team is doing an absolutely terrible job of stopping hackers. It is so bad that there are more ppl on SZ who hack than play fair.&amp;nbsp; Im not trying to be hating on sony, Im just letting you know you need to get your act together.&amp;nbsp; Ive personally petitioned hackers about 10 times &amp;amp; each I get the exact same response saying " we cant do anything at this time"&amp;nbsp; well ive waited long enough its about time you guys get the hackers out of this game.&amp;nbsp; You need to have a GM on 24/7.&amp;nbsp; Its just like any other business being run, when a store or something is open, you need to have someone there working.&amp;nbsp; So why do you have the server on but no GMs on to regulate it?&amp;nbsp; You need to start responding quickly to accusations of hacking.&amp;nbsp; If someone is hacking they arent gonna stay around forever &amp;amp; do it so a GM can see them.&amp;nbsp; When someone reports a hacking a GM needs to be there asap to see whats going on.&amp;nbsp; One of the worst hacks being used on my server is /warp.&amp;nbsp; Heres what i dont understand, In order to use this you must type /warp.&amp;nbsp; So why dont GMs check logs for any account that has the /warp command in it more than like 3 times per day?&amp;nbsp; I honestly dont see how hard that would be to do, but it would greatly reduce the amount of hacking on the server.&amp;nbsp; Im fed up with all the hacking &amp;amp; if something isnt done soon im gonna quit EQ as well as about 25+ members of my guild.&amp;nbsp; If you guys want to keep your paying customers I suggest that you start taking control of the game.&amp;nbsp; Thank you for your time.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>Sullon Zek Manifesto and Survival Guide (for the Newb) by TEH SLOWZ</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Sullon&amp;message.id=583#M583</link>
      <description>Sullon Zek Manifesto and Survival Guide (for the Newb)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Welcome to Sullon Zek. When you start this server you have to be ready for anything. You cant even trust your own team mates although they most likely will not get in your way but dont expect them to go out of their way for you either.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am your worst nightmare. I am level 65 (or whatever the level cap is). I have AAs. I have gear. I have friends. You are an insignifigant level 6 whelp. I dont care what class you are. You are a newb. You are no better than a worm to me. If I do not take a detour to stomp on you like the invertibrate you are then you should consider yourself blessed and be grateful. I will consider myself lucky that I do not have to scrape your rotting decayed flesh off the bottom of my steel cleated boots. Now that the introduction is over now it is time to introduce you to life on Sullon Zek.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sullon Zek is like Mos Eisly of Starwars. It is a wretched hive of scum and villainy. There are none of the rules binding ANYONE to be nice or even courteous to you beyond the standards of No Swearing and no RL Harassment. This means you CAN and WILL be PKed by people 60 levels higher than you. You CAN and WILL be ganked 6+ on 1. You CAN and WILL be corpse camped. You CAN and WILL be trained intentionally. And these are just a few of the things that can go wrong. If you are unable to handle this then pick any other server. I will go into a few ground rules to ensure that you wont be unfairly picked on by the community as a whole.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rule #1 - Do not trash talk.&lt;br&gt;Rule #2 - Do not Whine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The above rules apply DOUBLY if you are now on a Corpse Retrival (CR). They apply QUADRUPLY if the person is now sending you trash talk tells. Silence is GOLDEN, if you are not communicating with your attacker they do not know whether or not you are now calling up a posse that can deal with them and force them into a CR. They do not know if you are coming to get your corpse immediately or not. Most people will try to goad you into tells where you swear and/or threaten them in RL or do other things which will result in your BANNING, do not give in. Sullon Zek is not for the hot headed. If you are a hot head then do not play on Sullon Zek.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now say you level up and kill someone. Congratz, you've taken the first step towards the dark side. Now you have a choice, mercy to your enemy or not. In my experience showing mercy to the enemy is like playing russian roulette except 3 of the 6 chambers have bullets in them. You CAN and WILL shoot yourself in the foot by showing mercy to your enemy. Mercy is for the Weak and for girly men like Rangers (Har har). Sullon Zek is about survival of the fittest. If you are not strong in both will and gear (the former being more important) then you will not survive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lastly you will be griefed mercilessly. You must expect this. You must adapt to this. If level 65s are ganking your leveling grounds every 10 minutes then find new hunting grounds. If you are being trained then find places where it is difficult to train in or out of. To play on Sullon Zek you have to have a masochist personality. You have to LIKE being hurt because people can and will hurt you. If you can laugh it off and turn off the computer for a few hours then you can and will survive. Otherwise pick any other server other than Sullon Zek.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is Sullon Zek For you? I hope so. Be careful which alliance you choose because I CAN and WILL squash any newb that I can like the worms they are simply to stomp out the weak so the strong can thrive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slowmotionz Unstoppable&lt;br&gt;Overlord of Rallos Zek&lt;br&gt;"I am not a freaking shaman!"&lt;br&gt;Sullon Zek Server</description>
