The task quests are simply presolved quests with ingame walk throughs.  There is nothing at all to figure out.  Tasks are tasks not quests.  In case someone doesn't understand what I mean, tasks are a list of things that someone told you what exactly to do and you go do them.  But a quest is something that you get asked to go do, but you have to figure out some of what needs to be done yourself, yes you're told some things directly but other things you have to think out yourself or solve a riddle or make a jump of faith based on a subtle hint in the text.  The best quests have always been the ones which the community had to help each other to solve each step.  So unless they include something that requires players to figure something particular out at a variety of steps anything moved or added to the task system will not be a quest but a task. <hr></blockquote>They don't necessarily have to go into the details they do for many of the armor tasks and the money tasks. They could merely just record the quest text you get while doing/getting the quest. If your suggesting a different method and window, sure, id go for that too. I don't want hand holding in doing the quests, I just want a record of the quests. Would also great to be able to look up past tests i've completed.

				<blockquote><hr>Requiring groups isn't going to make any difference.  It's not a matter of using the bazaar.  In truth there are already quests out there between lvls 21-50 that give armor pieces.  What I'm saying is that by lvl 20 you need to start learning how you get gear normally.  There isn't any need to have NPCs standing around in PoK or where ever handing out tasks, even group tasks, for lvls 21-50 to get their next set of armor from.  Sorry but people are not going to bother learning anything about how to choose what armor is best for them if there's a new set of quests every 5-10 lvls to gear them up.  They will just do the PoK ones and use those till the next set comes along or they run out of tasks they can do to get the gear.  There is no lack of paths for gear between levels 20-50 like there had become for lvls 1-20 (mostly from the rise of rec/req lvls on armor).  What this is asking for is to just make the progression from 20-50 more mindless than it already is.<hr></blockquote>The NPCs for these should definitely _not_ be in PoK. In fact id rather the task givers in POK now were removed and each starting city given the full range of armor quest instead. (If they don't already, cabilis doesn't, but there are alternate armor quest in Ak'anon for the same visible pieces at least.) The whole experience of leaving the tutorial only to end up in POK sucks imo. What's the point of having a starting city again? All those newbie quests wasted. However, I sorta disagree that there are many armor quests in the 21-50 in line with the current progression, especially when you consider iksar warriors who cannot wear most of the plate armor given in those quests. There are quests dont get me wrong, but many are not even close to what you get from the pok quests. The original class quest armors (crafted etc) are good (id maybe retune them a little stat wise to fit with the stat increase in newbie armor and redo the quests), they fill 20-35 slot or at least are suppose to. From 35-50 you have The Twilight Sea quests. What im really suggesting is adding another 1 or 2 alternate paths for these types of class or even race armor sets and tuning them up a little to be at least in line with current progression. There still ample opportunity for a new player to learn to choose armor. I can understand not wanting to give players a free ride through 1-50, but I don't think that’s what would happen.<br><br>Then again maybe you have other armor quest in mind?<br><br><blockquote><hr>They have that it's called the NPC Journal window, not that anyone really uses it.  Lots of people claim it causes more lag when activated, and that it also logs tons of stuff that is useless too (which it does).  The way that the Task windows work is they tell you what to do next after you do the last thing.  So if anything your suggestion of a new window for quests would be the best way to go.  The best way would be for it to work as a mixture of the NPC journal window and the task window.  Have it automatically group the texts that are for certain quests into a grouping instead of having to flag them ourselves as such.  It'd be nice if they had the texts from different npc's go into the correct order.  Like if was doing a quest and you've done part that is at the beginning and then another part that is towards the middle, it would have the texts you got from the first npc's then ??? for the ones you haven't talked to till it comes to the NPCs in the middle that you talked to, then ??? for the ones after that again.  The most important thing in my mind to make them actually quests instead of just tasks would be the fact that they would only update when you get the next set of text from one of the quest NPCs, instead of when you loot quest item_002 off of mob_8347.<br><br>They could also do something to improve the NPC journal by changing it so that the NPCs that give quests are flagged as that, and get listed in like a quest npc listing when you talk to them.

Speaking of which a filter to remove the text that is just flavor text from the NPC journal would be very nice.<hr></blockquote>Totally agree. If they redid the journal window the way you flesh out it'd be exactly what im asking for. Oh and I agree with the filter stuff too, they need to add more filters. I'd love it if I could filter my taunt failures.

				Long involved quests with raids needed get progressively harder to complete as expansions get older. The two biggest ones i can think of are : Breakdown in Communications and Aid Grimel tradeskill quest.<br><br>Breakdown: -- Grand summoner ring (used to be part of progression but now  a standalone target and basicly not raided)<br>           -- Inktu'ta/Txevu are basicly only raided for flagging purposes. The BiC droprate is abysmal compared to the risk/reward issue. Increased droprate/alternative access/drops (maybe rare drop off the Key Tacvi bosses would solve issues)<br>           -- The qinimi group event requires 6 people (u NEED a full group) In current progression this event can be done with less but you still need 6 people IN ZONE to start the event- This can be very annoying as the event is quite easy to beat and quite short. It is rather an inconvenience to drag off a full group<br><br><br>Aid Grimel -- Flagging requirements: With Time being able to be flagged within time thru phase 3 there is less and less need for backflagging the whole pop progression. The same effect on a lower level is achieved with the alternative access quests, Kill God for backflag and level restricted or flagged zones. Basicly the quest looks like dieing out due to flagging which you can;t possibly do with hardly any guilds fully backflagging/flagging. (Maybe tie flags to acces to zone so alternative access quests/entrance flag will automaticly grand you the needed flag for Aid Grimel and/or Time flag flagging you for all phases of aid grimel)<br><br>There are other long involved quests out there but i don;t know which ones of these fall in the same category and might need some tweaking to keep the quests viable/alive

				<div>I think one of our biggest issues atm is our Dire Charm spell.  It is practically useless in all the last two-three expansions.  We either need an upgrade to the Dire Charm spell or increase its level of effectiveness.  What is the use of having a spell if its not going to work.  I think that once u hit level 70 you should be allowed to DC mobs at least up to level 60. </div>
