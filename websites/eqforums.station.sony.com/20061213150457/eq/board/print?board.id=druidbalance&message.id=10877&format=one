				<DIV>Currently, the druid BP from TSS has 70% heal focus to Adrenaline Surge III, and a clicky DS can be targeted on others / tanks.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Reason for posting was to see what the other druids would rather have seen on this BP, or hopfully, get it changed to.&nbsp; In looking for ideas, we do need to remember what we ask for should be in balance with the game, ie, asking for a 10k nuke clicky nuke would be a waste of time.&nbsp; Also, I dont want to come off as we are never happy, and I know that whatever focus / clicky is added there will be those that will want it to be different, cant please all...just curious as to what the other druids was looking for in the BP.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><U>Focus</U></DIV>
<DIV>25% mana preservation to Pure Life III.&nbsp; In the Anguish druid BP, we got 25% mana preservation to Ancient Chlorobon.&nbsp; This was and still is a very popular focus / BP.&nbsp; I personally still use the Anguish BP because of this focus, skiping the Demi BP.&nbsp; I would personally much rather see the mana preservation then the 5% more heal focus.&nbsp; If not get the mana preservation to Pure Life, get the mana preservation for Adrenaline Surge would also be wanted over the heal focus.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><U>Clicky</U></DIV>
<DIV>Not a huge fan of the DS on the clicky, can live with it, just would not be my first choice.&nbsp; If we stay with the DS, could the timer be reduced down from 15 min to 5 min?</DIV>
<DIV>1. My favorite clicky that druids have ever gotten was the clicky heals that we got on the tacvi hammer, and the vishimtar mask.&nbsp; I can see the hesitation to give us a 3rd clicky heal...but maybe give us clicky Pure Life, and have it share the timer with the tacvi hammer?</DIV>
<DIV>2. From Kunark thro PoP, druids on BPs got the latest group hp regen on the BPs, maybe bring that back?</DIV>
<DIV>3. Clicky Direwood Guard Rk. III.&nbsp; Would be great to free up a spell slot getting this spell on the BP.</DIV>
<DIV>4. Clicky Direwild Skin Rk. III.&nbsp; With the recast timer 5 min (longer?), this would not of course replace the need to keep the spell / buff memed, but would be nice to be able to cast this as a mana free buff once in a&nbsp;while.</DIV>
<DIV>5. I am a large fan of the wizard clicky that they get on the BP, radient mana.&nbsp; Again, would like to see that timer changed from 15 min to 5 min.</DIV>
