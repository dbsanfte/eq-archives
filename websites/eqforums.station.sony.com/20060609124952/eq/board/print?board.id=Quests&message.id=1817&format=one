				<blockquote><hr>Requiring groups isn't going to make any difference.  It's not a matter of using the bazaar.  In truth there are already quests out there between lvls 21-50 that give armor pieces.  What I'm saying is that by lvl 20 you need to start learning how you get gear normally.  There isn't any need to have NPCs standing around in PoK or where ever handing out tasks, even group tasks, for lvls 21-50 to get their next set of armor from.  Sorry but people are not going to bother learning anything about how to choose what armor is best for them if there's a new set of quests every 5-10 lvls to gear them up.  They will just do the PoK ones and use those till the next set comes along or they run out of tasks they can do to get the gear.  There is no lack of paths for gear between levels 20-50 like there had become for lvls 1-20 (mostly from the rise of rec/req lvls on armor).  What this is asking for is to just make the progression from 20-50 more mindless than it already is.<hr></blockquote>The NPCs for these should definitely _not_ be in PoK. In fact id rather the task givers in POK now were removed and each starting city given the full range of armor quest instead. (If they don't already, cabilis doesn't, but there are alternate armor quest in Ak'anon for the same visible pieces at least.) The whole experience of leaving the tutorial only to end up in POK sucks imo. What's the point of having a starting city again? All those newbie quests wasted. However, I sorta disagree that there are many armor quests in the 21-50 in line with the current progression, especially when you consider iksar warriors who cannot wear most of the plate armor given in those quests. There are quests dont get me wrong, but many are not even close to what you get from the pok quests. The original class quest armors (crafted etc) are good (id maybe retune them a little stat wise to fit with the stat increase in newbie armor and redo the quests), they fill 20-35 slot or at least are suppose to. From 35-50 you have The Twilight Sea quests. What im really suggesting is adding another 1 or 2 alternate paths for these types of class or even race armor sets and tuning them up a little to be at least in line with current progression. There still ample opportunity for a new player to learn to choose armor. I can understand not wanting to give players a free ride through 1-50, but I don't think thatâ€™s what would happen.<br><br>Then again maybe you have other armor quest in mind?<br><br><blockquote><hr>They have that it's called the NPC Journal window, not that anyone really uses it.  Lots of people claim it causes more lag when activated, and that it also logs tons of stuff that is useless too (which it does).  The way that the Task windows work is they tell you what to do next after you do the last thing.  So if anything your suggestion of a new window for quests would be the best way to go.  The best way would be for it to work as a mixture of the NPC journal window and the task window.  Have it automatically group the texts that are for certain quests into a grouping instead of having to flag them ourselves as such.  It'd be nice if they had the texts from different npc's go into the correct order.  Like if was doing a quest and you've done part that is at the beginning and then another part that is towards the middle, it would have the texts you got from the first npc's then ??? for the ones you haven't talked to till it comes to the NPCs in the middle that you talked to, then ??? for the ones after that again.  The most important thing in my mind to make them actually quests instead of just tasks would be the fact that they would only update when you get the next set of text from one of the quest NPCs, instead of when you loot quest item_002 off of mob_8347.<br><br>They could also do something to improve the NPC journal by changing it so that the NPCs that give quests are flagged as that, and get listed in like a quest npc listing when you talk to them.  Would save loads of time having to wade thru the death messages of the trash mobs you kill that just have flavor text on them.  Speaking of which a filter to remove the text that is just flavor text from the NPC journal would be very nice.<hr></blockquote>Totally agree. If they redid the journal window the way you flesh out it'd be exactly what im asking for. Oh and I agree with the filter stuff too, they need to add more filters. I'd love it if I could filter my taunt failures.
