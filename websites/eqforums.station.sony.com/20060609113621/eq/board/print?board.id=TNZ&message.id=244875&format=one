				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I asked this in another thread, but no one seemed to notice, so I guess I'll start a new thread about it.&nbsp; The formatting isn't quite right because I just sort of copied and
pasted my exact post in another&nbsp; thread, but if you can't tell, I'm
quoting Rashere and asking a question about it:<br><br>_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br><br>Rashere wrote:<br>
<p>The main point in the change was to start introducing death
penalties while players are still in the relatively safe area of
Gloomingdeep.&nbsp; The penalties start out really low, though, and you lose
next to no experience at level 6.&nbsp; It slowly goes up from there.</p>
<p>Rashere</p><br><hr><br><br>Anyone know how
"fast/slow" it "ramps" up?&nbsp; And is max exp loss still 1/2 a yellow
(atleast I think that's what it was before I quit a year and a half ago
or so ...)?&nbsp; And what lvl do you hit "max exp loss per death"?<br><br><br><div></div>
