&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;I myself once enjoyed what everyone calls the original magic of everquest. This being making that 2 hour long journey across the plains of karana HHP EC etc etc, spending 15 minutes&amp;nbsp;learning new language's or randomly joining a guild (as is my case) sitting waiting on the boat from FP to BB. those massive 4 hour CR in POF after wiping several times. So on and so forth, I would love to recapture the original feeling i got from playing this game, but unfortunatily this game can never recreate that feeling!!! No matter how many times you start at level 1 and work your way across the board it will never be the same. Because you already know exactly what is around the next corner, Because you have done it all before.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;The only way to enjoy what you have all once felt is to take a new game and start to play that. Im sorry but EQ will never be the CLASSIC experiance i keep on hearing about. so get over it, the progression server&amp;nbsp;has been made for those who have not managed to keep up with live servers or for those who wish to play content of the game that is available but wouldnt be played on a live server. (which is only going to be experianced for a short while untill the next expansion is unlocked). &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;Everquest will NEVER satisfy the hunger of the people who are looking for that new start feeling again. And i think you will be very lucky to ever experiance it again. everquest was probably the first MMORPG that you ever played as it was for myself so immersing myself so deep into content that overwhelmed me (for the first time) was aweinspiring. But no whater what game developers throw at you, it will not be the same as seeing a massie skeleton on the chess board, or seeing a ghost in unrest or even seeing a god in the PoF. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;I am sorry for all you folks who wish to relive the past as it was, I do wish i could relive the old days of everquest as i loved it, but i have relized you will never look at anything in a game the same way that you may have looked at something in EQ &amp;lt; for the very first time&amp;gt; in amazement. The only thing that can come close is the community that EQ had, it was absolutly amazing compared to alot of other games. This is the only thing that a GD can really do now to encourge a good feeling of playing a MMORPG to try and make sure that there is a good community base in that game.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;EQ will never be as classic as you want it to be, get over it!!!!&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;while that may be true to some extent, a large percentage of the players that i have talked to that are going to this server are players that have been playing around 2 years give or take a bit and have never gotten to experience some of the content because no one does that content anymore.&amp;nbsp; ie hate/fear or north tov.&amp;nbsp; many i have talked to want to see that stuff but on current servers they most likely will not be able to.&amp;nbsp; I belive we will see a decent amount of players on this server, some very old school players trying to relive the old days and some much newer players that wish to experience how it was (to a certain degree) in the old days and to experience content that they would have almost zero chance to experience on the current servers as it stands.</description>
