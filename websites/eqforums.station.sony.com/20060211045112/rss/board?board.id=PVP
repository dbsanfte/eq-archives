      <title>What's a good PVP level?</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=PVP&amp;message.id=11620#M11620</link>
      <description>Hey guys&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;:smileyhappy:&lt;/span&gt; I played EQ for a long time (old school RZ FTW) but quit about two years ago after I realized how messed up high-lvl pvp became (Spells dont land, melees kill casters in 5 hits, ect ect) and how casual players cannot hope to compete with 24/7 raid guilds in PVP. After experimenting with some other games, I still havent found the kind of PVP that old school rallos zek had to offer, like around the velious days/early POP days. Now, I know high lvl pvp is wacky, but i was wondering if there was a decent level pre-60 that offers some decent pvp? I still have my main char and a ton of cash so I would be able to fairly twink out a lower level. What do you guys think?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>4 years retirement and question about where to hunt</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=PVP&amp;message.id=11583#M11583</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;I came back from 4 years and missed 7 expensions. 4 years ago i remember every zone i went to there are at least 20 players in each zone. But now where ever i go there is usually 1 player on the list with my name on it. I am now lvl 30 and same thing still happening. It is very boring to lvl in every zone just myself alone. So i would like to know where do all the ppl gather that hunts except bazaar and plan of knowledge?&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Unlike the other thread, this one is for more &amp;quot;indeapth&amp;quot; changes, things that may or may not be possible without extensive code changes. I dont want to hear whines about certain classes being stupidly overpowered here, that's for the other thread. I want to gather input about balancing PvP in respect to one versus one, group on group and raid on raid, as well as input about rules and level ranges. I want data and input, not whines and moans.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;EDIT for clarification: Think of this as a discussion over wants and wishes, while the other thread is for immediate needs.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Pinhedd_SZ on &lt;span class="date_text"&gt;01-27-2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;07:50 PM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantitative PvP changes discussion</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=PVP&amp;message.id=11575#M11575</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I'd like to gather some ideas on quantitative changes that could be made to PvP in general. These are things that should be simple, such as &amp;quot;change the base resist on spell X from Y to Z&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;raise the cap on A from B to C&amp;quot;. This is NOT a discussion about who owns who, or which class is the most overpowered, or what needs to be nerfed first, I just want to collect some easy balancing ideas after that point I will find a happy medium and see what comes out.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;EDIT for clarification: think of this as a thread for needed changes that can easily be done, put wants and wishes in the other thread.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Pinhedd_SZ on &lt;span class="date_text"&gt;01-27-2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;07:51 PM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Eq2 is releasing 2 US pvp servers, if you want pvp, this is where it's going to be SUPPORTED and Balenced as well as continiously developed. Leave everquest 1, because SoE is just going to dump it soon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why you ask? Because they just revamped the whole everquest 2 class system. You can now pick your class when you create your charecter, also it's alot more funner, easier tradeskills, and easier leveling. Great new system, feels like old eq 1.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Try it out for yourself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;is the single most unbelievable thing on this forum.   it gets updated once a month yet i see all the things are usually the same its like paste and copy the list and that will make it ok cause at least we posted it for that month.   some actions done to these things would be great.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;5)&lt;span&gt;       &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Make “Touch of Innoruuk” and all Shadow Knight Life Taps land more frequently.  Also make the spell Blood of Inruku land more frequently in pvp and perhaps an adjustment to the spell Dread Gaze.  Currently if cast it will aggro any pets etc at the raid.  Would it be possible to make it so that it doesn't affect members of a raid's pets? &lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;this has been on the issues list since 9.24.04  that is 1 year and 4months and in that time it says the exact same thing.   things have been adjusted in pvp like rangers, druids getting new snares, wizards getting new aa as well as mages to help in pvp and in this time you cant fix a simple thing like adding a pvp resist check that isnt 0 to our lifetaps.   Its beyond comphrendable.   Our life tap does 66 percent of max dmg in pvp that is about say 400-500 pts dmg.   now when its resisted 1 outta 4 times, and partially resisted 2 outta those 4 it makes it really darn hard to do anything in pvp, add to this our other spells like spears get resisted about everytime, and our dots even with dot focus's maxed does about 500dmg max a tick if that and this is if the spell lands but they can also be easily dispelled by anyone.    Now when a wizard can click an aa and then click another aa then nuke for crits of 2k + over and over how the heck is an sk supposed to survive.   I know the big arguement of we get ht will be brought up, and i think that is pure bullpoop.    play an sk sometime and see if you can get someone down to 40 percent.    I know we shouldnt just be able to run around killing people at will but at least give us a chance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Bring back, Discord (PVP) Server</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=PVP&amp;message.id=11529#M11529</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;A new server is needed for pvp, but do you remember the Discord server? It was out for about 6 weeks before the discord expansion.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Everyone could attack everyone, no limits&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If you died for any reason: pk, drowned, fall off a cliff, you go back to level 1&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;triple experience all the time&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If a player killed you, they could loot all your gear&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;One character per server&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This was the BEST pvp fun I have ever had on EQ or any other game.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;While it was out, I was a barbarian and hunting in Everfrost with about 140 other barbarians, fighting for each kill, after we starting hitting level 6, a ton of fights, but eventually we worked together to get stronger as a nation, then went into Blackburrow to level, and on out into Qeynos Hills where we fought the humans. It was like a huge world of Risk, where you built up your army then went to attack the next territory.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If this was a permanent server then guilds would have formed and more alliances etc, still it was the most hardcore pvp server ever, and it was the most fun. Talk about a fear of death, you where focused constantly, it was great, and even with newer games out, a server like this would attract alot of players.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>cleric in pvp</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=PVP&amp;message.id=11515#M11515</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;Hi,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; I thought this would be good place to post a thread. I play on stormhammer(for now),and I just recently did a pvp tournament with my cleric. In which I was immediately ganged up on by 2-3ppl,theres more to that situation than, a cleric is  a pain in the ass to fight in pvp..&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;  I never pvp'd before,and I didnt know what to really to do to kill ppl. All I could do was keep healing myself,and piss them off for doing that(took 3 of them at least 15mins or more to kill me; I ran out of mana,and used all my Vet skills). I posted on a clerics forum,but noone seems to really do pvp.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; I was just looking for strats to pvp if the occasion arises. What spell lineups should be used? Im currently lvl 66,and I dont have any 66 spells and very little lvl 65 spells.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; In that pvp I tried stunning and it seems stuns are almost pointless with all the high resist gear,and my highest dd; condemation,is soo slow to cast..All I was doing was debuffing ppl,and  healing myself? Besides using summoned proc hammer what other dps is at clerics disposal,besides pet hammer and ds shield( i only have the 15pt dmg one)..&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; any strats would be great,as I really dont plan to pvp much,but if I like it,I might do it more often..&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>My opinion on that top 10 list</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=PVP&amp;message.id=11510#M11510</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;1)         More people want to see that the people who train all the time and blatenly hack al the time get banned.  There are less MQ2/Showeq users on Zek than on any other server.  But the people who use it and use it all the time and nothing happens to them.  This problem can be fixxed easy.  Go to the big pvp battles annon and watch.  Everyone warping ban them right then and there.  Go to a few raids anon of the top guilds and see who uses the hax and ban them right there.  This will get rid of the top 10 known hackers on the server warning ppl that the developers are watching them and doing thier job.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;2)        The resist on procs is not that major, and developers havent been looking at it for a long while.  Move it down the list to a lower number.   Most people who care about this are over powered melee who want to proc even more stuns.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;3)         Points have meant nothing since day 1 it was implemented.  The turning in of Signets from Sullon Zek made it even more so.  The only real problem I see is that the gear you can buy needs to be updated to about time level gear instead of just VT gear.  Again not a major issue that the devs havent looked at.  Move it down the list.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;4)         Out of range healers and buffers are plain stupid.  The best fix for this is if they heal or buff someone who is pvping they should lose thier status and become pvp enabled.  Again not a major issue, but if the level range was opened to +/- 20 levels pvp would open up and cause more action.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;5)        Poor sks cant tap.  Help them out!  Other than potions its the only way they can heal themselves.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;6)        Rangers are way over powered and thier shooting out thier rear while running oor makes them invincable to all casters.  Casters cant hit them unless they can see thier feet.  Why isnt bowing the same way.  Either make spells the same or fix rangers.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;7)        Bards mana drain does suck.  Only problem is that there are not enough bards to make this a real problem. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;8)        Discord was fun, but only for a few days.  Fix this server before starting a new one.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;9)        Yes monks are over powered with thier chain stuns, but also look at run 8 and tstaff.  Make them resistable and have run 8 be reduced to run 5 on zek.  Run 8 was for pulling mobs, but now a monk can run from just inside my spell casting range with a 30% focus to melee range before i can get a 2.3 second cast spell off.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;10)      What is the point of spells being able to hit more if they dont land?  Both need to be fixed.  They should land for more and land more often.  Also since melee have such a distinct advantage in pvp, casters should get melee avoidance and mitagtion.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>I'm done.  7 years, and I'm finally going to read the credits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sony has butchered PvP to the point it is freaking pointless to hang around.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Caster PvP ( neglecting necro's ) is a joke.&lt;br&gt;PvE is being totally screwed too, EQ is making it's last few laps around the toilet bowl before it's gone.&lt;br&gt;Sony is putting out ANOTHER expansion, but won't fix the 1,000 problems they already have.  I mean nothing like putting out another expansion to add MORE problems to the infinite list of crap they can't figure out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sony pull your heads out of....  well... Stop being gluttons, and provide QUALITY gaming, and you might get out of this with something left over.  Living off the fumes of what Varent had going isn't doing you justice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;EQ is dying, and Sony is trying to squeeze the last penny out now. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For those of you I fought on the battle field, GL to all of you with whatever you do in life, but this is my stop.</description>

      <title>PvP - New Server</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=PVP&amp;message.id=11480#M11480</link>
      <description>SOE needs to make a new PvP server(and probably start a new one every 1-2 years).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-No Transfers&lt;br&gt;-Level Restrictions on all items&lt;br&gt;-No Level Limits (past level 6)&lt;br&gt;-Coin Loot&lt;br&gt;-XP from +/- 4 levels&lt;br&gt;-All other current Zek rules&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The reason why no one new is playing on Zek is because the disparity between the players. Why would want to level to 66 and get murdered by maxed out characters at Level 70 + AAXP. You want to have fun, restart the game. It's Field of Dreams all over again. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Build it and they will come.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Blood &amp; Honor!</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;The traveling factor that was once inside Everquest made PvP mysterious instead of now clicking on a stone and possibly camping the book.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>Hello? This should have been fixed years ago.</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=PVP&amp;message.id=11462#M11462</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Being a hardcore pvper for the most part myself, I've come to notice numerous problem that hinder my class' ability to efficiently compete in pvp with other high end geared players. I browsed some of the threads and saw some of the same problems I've seen, but figured I'd profess my own views on these particular issues myself since nothing appears to be improving, or looks as if it's in the process of being fixed.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So anyways, I play a wizard, but I'm speaking for all casters in general, since it isn't a class specific thing itself exactly. As I already saw, melees have a huge advantage versus casters in pvp. Why, you may ask? There is several reasons. First, there has been nerfs placed on casters over the years to balance casters vs. melee, but it has done the exact opposite. First, no&amp;nbsp;single nuke, for any caster, can do more than 66% of its original damage, not including resists. So, an anguish+ geared melee for example probably has close or above 500+ in all resists unbuffed. If I were to duel a 15k unbuffed warrior with similar resists, and&amp;nbsp; my lure (lands more often for those of you who aren't wizards) spell does about 1500 base damage. 66% of 1500 is roughly 1000 damage. So, if every nuke landed for full damage (which is impossible) I could kill that warrior in 15 nukes. It sounds easy, but it's not. Infact, my best lure usually lands for 400-600 dmg on high geared people. The thing about this I find disturbing is that there is no nerf on melees. Melees dish out 100% of their damage output, while casters dish out 66% of theirs....does that make a bit of sense? Hell no it doesn't. Either nerf melees so their melee is 66% of their regular output, or release the nerf off casters.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Also, another nerf was placed on casters., except this one is a little more fun! The nerf itself does not allow a nuke to do more than 40% of any one person's health per cast. Basically, if I were to attack a lvl 1 wizard in pvp, who had 10 hps, it would take me 3 casts to kill a lvl 1 (keep in mind I'm a lvl 70 wizard). Even if i casted my 5800ish nuke on the lvl one, and it landed, it is not possible for it to do more than 4 dmg to a lvl 1. Fun, huh? Yet, melees can walk up and kill a lvl 1 instantly. My point, however,&amp;nbsp;is not about how long it takes a lvl 1 or not, but rather the issue of nerfs on casters. Specifically, since I'm a wizard, I have the ability manaburn. This nerf does not allow me to do more than 40% of someone's health. Yet, a rogue can walk up and backstab me for a huge amount and do well over 40% of my hps, how is that fair? That's right, it's not, and thus why it needs to be fixed.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Our resists have always been a big part of EQ, but does it disadvantage casters in pvp? See, melees, just like casters, can resist spells in pvp obviously. But, can casters resists hits? Nope, we can't. Infact, I don't see a listing in my inventory saying how high my resists are to 1h blunt, slashing, piercing, etc. Is this fair? I certainly don't think it is. And don't argue that AA's provide dmg avoidance mitigation, because those are not a natural stat from an item like spell resists are. From my point of view, to balance this, either the integration of a new resist listing in our inventories for weapons is needed(which I see as highly unneeded personally), or casters' natural dmg avoidance/mitigation needs to be increased equal to that of how spell resists are, otherwise melees have an outright advantage over casters, and it isn't just a small advantage either.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I've found it increasingly hard to beat high end melees as a wizards because of these issues. I'm anguish geared, and I can barely beat melees who are qvic geared. This is ridiculous, because my skill is far superior to a lot of people I duel or fight in pvp and I still lose most the time to melees simply because of the nerfs on my class that&amp;nbsp;hinder my ability to defeat my opponent efficiently. Pvp isn't like it used to be at the beginning of EQ, where skill was a huge determinant in who would win duels. Skill now adays is basically irrelevant and is all gear and class depedant. But, to basically put this, spells just don't land as they should. Casters in general just cannot land spells to match that of a melees dmg output, and I've listed the reasons why. &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
