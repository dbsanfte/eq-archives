Their blocks of time don't really work for us either.  We are raiding while they are having their recruitment events and it's not very easy for us to have two of our officers not at the raids.  I would have liked to see a little more planning and communication with the guilds before springing this on us so we could have planned the week to be a lower end raiding week or so that we would have been able to have one or two of our officers not with the raids.
