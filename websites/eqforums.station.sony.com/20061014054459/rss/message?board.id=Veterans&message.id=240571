      <description>&lt;div&gt;People left for a lot of reasons. Many of them detest Sony and nothing will bring them back. Others moved on with their lives and don't have the play time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Quite frankly, I don't think anything will bring in new players. I would actively discourage any friend of mine from playing if he wanted to start now as a newbie. The ramp from 1-70, soon to be 75, and all the AA and keys and flags and other stupidity take too long. You could finish Oblivion in the time it takes to make your character useful.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Only one thing in the past year has popped the player population, and that was double exp weekend. They need to bring that back. Permanently, I say.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;hr&gt;Eq2SUCKS wrote:&lt;br&gt;Advertise the next two EQ expansions  on TELEVISION&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;that will increase the playerbase ,  the combine server is more of a bandaid and instead of it bringing new players it , it will just bring old players to that specific server who will eventually hop back out again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the old players that went to WoW / Eq2  went  to a large degree for Graphics and a change of scenary.

&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Maybe because, unlike in sports, "successful" is relative. WoW is successful since it's the largest and most popular MMO on the planet right now. City of Heroes/Villains is successful because it's the largest and most popular MMO in its niche (non-fantasy, comics-genre). EQ1 is successful for neither of those things. It's successful because of its longevity. Tell me, how would you promote and advertise EQ to differentiate it from its more popular and well known competition? What does EQ have that WoW and CoH/V and and Anarchy Online doesn't have? Let's break it down some. AO has a "play for free" (not a trial, PLAY FOR FREE in its base world content, pre-expansion) option that makes it different. City of Heroes is targeted toward comic book fans. WoW has BLIZZARD behind it (along with all the positive goodwill, reputation, and tradition that goes along with it) along with over a hundred servers with localized versions in pretty much every major culture (i.e. the Aussies have their own server as does every timezone in the US and Europe and Asia), and servers bursting at the seams with population (people to group with!). The three games I mentioned have content for "time-starved" people (missions/quests, open zone hunting, etc) as well as for those with more playtime available to them (task &amp;amp; strike forces/trials, instances, group missions). EQ is a very good game but it doesn't have the same mainstream appeal as others on the market. And right now, the "others on the market" have more mainstream gaming options than EQ has. You cite Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons Online obviously without knowing a thing about it. Name the two biggest MMO flops in 2006 so far? Auto Assault and......Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons Online. Forced grouping (DDO) and limited content ("Do each mission 3 times") do not appeal to people when they have games like WoW as options. Do you think Turbine is adding solo content because they WANT to?!? Yes, I've played them all (from WoW all the way down to Hostile Space and SEED) and I can see why they shake out the way they do. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I've said it before, the market has spoken, and the market says "We don't want to have to play a great deal and need a number of other people's help to advance". I don't necessarily agree with that point of view (I've never been a time-starved type of gamer), but to ignore the fact that it has changed the MMO landscape from a business perspective would be moronic. WoW doesn't have 6.5 million people who play 4+ hours a day, 6 days a week. It's probably very much the opposite. You advertise EQ in a mainstream manner (i.e. via television) and you'll expose its warts while also showing you don't know what the market is demanding now. EQ is great in its niche and for folks who can devote the kind of time and dedication it requires to keep your head above water, so to speak. But EQ is not a mainstream gaming property anymore because the mainstream has moved beyond its borders. I'd go so far as to say ojier is more an example of mainstream than many folks in this thread. People just aren't willing to make life changes (even if its something as simple as emailing friends from the game to set up ingame meetings and events) to play some game. They want to log in and be able to DO something that appeals to them. Not sit around and wait to be picked for some event. I don't think EQ should be "WoWified" either since it's the only game of its kind currently on the market (that is, one that requires a fairly significant time investment and socialization skills to advance). IMO, there should be games available that appeal to ALL playstyles (whether PvE or PvP, casual or hardcore, raider or non-raider, killer or socializer, etc) and that's becoming the case slowly but surely. Folks who don't want to have to kill mobs to advance have games like SEED (where socialization is the key to advancement) and A Tale In The Desert (among others) to choose from. EQ is the Last of the Mohicans in this sense and thus, should not be changed to be more in line with WoW. That's what EQ2 is for IMO. That could also explain why EQ2 isn't performing as well as many folks might've thought. It launched head to head with the beast and had some technical issues that made it hard to compete with the juggernaught who couldn't open new servers fast enough to keep up with the demand.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;But I think advertising EQ on TV could do more harm than good. What happens when everyone in the world realizes that, relatively speaking, the Emperor has no clothes?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;

      <description>I compared DnD online to EQ1 because DnD has better graphics  and advertiseing behind it , the problems with the game itself were discovered with people PLAYING the game after hearing about it  from a friend or seeing advertisements for it somewhere.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why not give people a chance to find out if they LIKE Eq by letting them in on the fact that the game is NOT EVEN REMOTELY CLOSE TO BEING DEAD  and still has new content produced for it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Many Rpger's  in WoW lets say don't know anymore about EQ than what they have heard from X Eq players.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Many GAMERS in general don't know anything  whatso ever about Everquest ,  as it hasn't been advertised in nearly 3 years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If they don't like EQ they will stop playing but how does bringing in those people thru advertiseing  make it worse than people that hear about it from a friend and try it then don't like it&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;again your arguement is just weak in general &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;your saying that an EQ comercial would need to tell people that they couldn't progress their charactors without 30-60 other people helping them or 5-6&lt;br&gt;fact is  the advertisements wouldn't need to say that , as it would be rather idiotic to do so&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;just as im sure DnD didn't advertise that it was having technical problems  and forced people to do missions 3 times in a row..........&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Emperor has no Clothes eh ?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;i guess i just don't understand your reasoning  if your reasoning is , advertiseing Everquest is going to bring people that wouldn't otherwise try the game and once they try it and dislike it , its going to hurt the game because people that otherwise wouldn't have tried it , tried it and didn't like it&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;that doesn't make any sense , who cares if  some of the people brought in by marketing decide they dislike the game , is that gonna force you and other long time players to Quit and  kill EQ in the process ? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Unlikely unless you have the metalica  fan mentality</description>

&lt;P&gt;i dont really care what anyone else is saying... from an investment point of view eq has always relied on word of mouth.. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;eq doesnt need to lanch an expensive marketing overhead and at this point its not merited.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Eq is curently in a mishmesh of 7 years of content. soeme o the content is looked upong the same way we would now see the graphics of defender. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Eq is positionting itself and currently undergoing a major makeover&amp;nbsp; it would not make since to invest funding for mass marketing until that game &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;it makes no sense to invest funds to marketing right now.. when the game is doing things that will create better reviiews and increase confidence of players to recommend to their friends&lt;/P&gt;</description>

You cite Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons Online obviously without knowing a thing about it. Name the two biggest MMO flops in 2006 so far? Auto Assault and......Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons Online. Forced grouping (DDO) and limited content ("Do each mission 3 times") do not appeal to people when they have games like WoW as options. Do you think Turbine is adding solo content because they WANT to?!? Yes, I've played them all (from WoW all the way down to Hostile Space and SEED) and I can see why they shake out the way they do. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I've said it before, the market has spoken, and the market says "We don't want to have to play a great deal and need a number of other people's help to advance". I don't necessarily agree with that point of view (I've never been a time-starved type of gamer), but to ignore the fact that it has changed the MMO landscape from a business perspective would be moronic. WoW doesn't have 6.5 million people who play 4+ hours a day, 6 days a week. It's probably very much the opposite. You advertise EQ in a mainstream manner (i.e. via television) and you'll expose its warts while also showing you don't know what the market is demanding now. EQ is great in its niche and for folks who can devote the kind of time and dedication it requires to keep your head above water, so to speak. But EQ is not a mainstream gaming property anymore because the mainstream has moved beyond its borders. I'd go so far as to say ojier is more an example of mainstream than many folks in this thread. People just aren't willing to make life changes (even if its something as simple as emailing friends from the game to set up ingame meetings and events) to play some game. They want to log in and be able to DO something that appeals to them. Not sit around and wait to be picked for some event. I don't think EQ should be "WoWified" either since it's the only game of its kind currently on the market (that is, one that requires a fairly significant time investment and socialization skills to advance). IMO, there should be games available that appeal to ALL playstyles (whether PvE or PvP, casual or hardcore, raider or non-raider, killer or socializer, etc) and that's becoming the case slowly but surely. Folks who don't want to have to kill mobs to advance have games like SEED (where socialization is the key to advancement) and A Tale In The Desert (among others) to choose from. EQ is the Last of the Mohicans in this sense and thus, should not be changed to be more in line with WoW. That's what EQ2 is for IMO. That could also explain why EQ2 isn't performing as well as many folks might've thought. It launched head to head with the beast and had some technical issues that made it hard to compete with the juggernaught who couldn't open new servers fast enough to keep up with the demand.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;But I think advertising EQ on TV could do more harm than good. What happens when everyone in the world realizes that, relatively speaking, the Emperor has no clothes?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by HH-Silver on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;06-23-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;11:24 AM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ok let me get this straight , exposing Everquest to people who don't know about it is going to HURT the game because  the people that play it and are already addicted  will say hey , EQ has television advertisements and the graphics don't look that great on the television advertisements so im going to stop playing due to EQ having comercials ?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How exactly is EQ having advertisement going to HURT  Eq ?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;your basically argueing for the sake of arguement as others have&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;your saying that EQ exists  because of its players and other games magically exist without having to depend on its player base  because ( i guess your logic goes)  people that play WoW  play because of the license and name behind it then quit and a constant surge of new people keep coming in and playing because of the license for a short peroid of time then quit   as  WoW unlike EQ doesn't depend on its playerbase?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I mean are you scared of higher than average amounts of new players being introduced to Everquest thru marketing? Do u want to keep EQ  to the players that currently play and their friends that are brought in thru word of mouth?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Whats the POINT of not advertiseing  EQ 1 when it has more subscribers than eq2?  CoH is an RPG , yea it lends itself to comic book fans but its also advertised so that people who like comic books get to say hey , there is a game for me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;U could advertise EQ as the most massive online roleplaying game due to the amount of content , U could Advertise EQ as the RPG with solid graphics that u can play without blowing 1600 dollars on the latest and greatist system.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;U could advertise EQ as  " Come join a 7 year community of online RPGer's that has stood the test of time and continues to progress both in #'s of players and Amount of content readily available to players"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Its not my job to think up ways to Advertise EQ , nor should i have even had to suggest advertiseing EQ , whats more hiliarious is  the fact im having to defend my stance that the game we all play religiously could benefit from more marketing to bring in new players that AREN"T our pals we talk to about the game and AREN'T long standing players but NEW players .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;your arguement basically holds no merit as what exactly is BAD about advertiseing an already successfull game? I mean  how is it going to Hurt us the players  by having MORE players hear about the game we play?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Are you one of those Metalica fans that stopped being a fan after they became popular and well known outside of their underground tour following?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;i mean is that the mentality your trying to express or are you simply argueing for the sake of arguement because it just doesn't make sense that u would be against EQ  reaching more people than it is cureently.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nearly 1/2 a million people play this game  with no advertisements for the game since Velious came out.....what would that # be if they tried to advertise it .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They don't have to advertise it as the game u can play on old systems .... they don't have to advertise it as anything more than an ONLINE RPG THAT HAS 400,000 players.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;its a friggen game  that people pay to play , the company not advertiseing it is silly at best as they could only stand to make more money from it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Im not talking 100 million dollar marketing campaigne like a film , just the ocassional comercial on G4 TV.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;in short   to say  that im moronic for wanting the game i play to reach a broader audiance is childish at best and indefinately foolish.</description>

      <description>Thank you for highlighting some points Trena.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;EQ is a known quantity.&amp;nbsp; We all follow a genre/nice or have an opinion of a genre/niche based on our experiences.&amp;nbsp; With EQ being a known quantity and with all it's longevity, it is not likely to change too much.&amp;nbsp; Yes, they have gradually improved the game for all playstyles since the release of the GoD(-awful) expansion and with something that has this much longevity, I believe there is a 50/50 proposition.&amp;nbsp; They meet us half way and we meet them half way.&amp;nbsp; They make some changes and in a way we have to adapt to them if this is something we wish to pursue.&amp;nbsp; A complete fullblown change for something that has been around this long would obviously be out of the question.&amp;nbsp; I decided that if I want to make the most of my time grouping with friends or guildmates I should pre-schedule in advance because I have low tolerance for sitting more than 20 minutes trying to get something going.&amp;nbsp; I realized the changes I needed to make to continue enjoying things, or the halfway I needed to go if you will.&amp;nbsp; I did log in one night unscheduled, and found myself logging off after 20 minutes and going to play XBox simply because of limited time and I took a poor gamble logging in unscheduled since most of my friends are in a similar situation as I and without us communicating in advance, I'd probably not find them on or available.&amp;nbsp; Mind you, I'm not teetering on one extreme or the other, but rather I am aware of the EQ quantity, and based on my own situation in EQ I subjected myself to the consequences, so there is some level of adaptation involved.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Knowing this, it is up to us if we decide this is something that will be satisfying to each of us, or perhaps if something else works for us.&amp;nbsp; I personally have sampled in many MMOs just to see what's out there.&amp;nbsp; True, in many cases a small sample can only tell so much, but on that same note with any game you usually find out in a short period of time initially if it will captivate you.&amp;nbsp; I found a balance that worked for me.&amp;nbsp; The reality of anything is things work for some, never for all.&amp;nbsp; If EQ suited every single person at any given point, there would never be any changes, feedback, or motivation for SoE to keep the thinktank going.&amp;nbsp; If I didn't have a way for EQ to suit me satisfactorily, I'd end up quitting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;I agree with the OP, some more advertising would be a good idea, especially when focusing on the strengths this game has with its more than 7 years of content AND community. Looking at more than 6 million WoW-players who MIGHT get interested into other MMORPGS when realizing that WoW is not the only star in the night... well You figure. Just getting 2 percent of this number into EQ (those who want some more conent, a more mature community maybe or just "something else") would equal 120.000 new interested people.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;WoW was not the killer of EQ, in fact it opened up the MMORPG-market into a broader range&amp;nbsp;in which most people never played another game like taht before. They only know EQ as "that game before WoW" instead of realizing it is quite alive and kicking and might even provide them with some fun aside from WoW.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The only way to get into those potential customers minf would be to broaden the advertisement, to aim for people from other games and not only for those who buy every expansion anyway.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;The fact is there is far more solo content in EQ than any other mmorpg. No game has more&amp;nbsp; soloable experience giving mobs. no other mmorpg does a solo player have the resources to make currency and the gear to purchase with that currency. What people object to is solo designed content. it takes away fromg roup content and raid content. and its not really necessary. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;mudflation makes yesterdays group content todays solo content. EQ does not punish soloer it rewards peple who play in groups. the players who sign on to play a group game object to players who think they deserve the same reward for solo content as one would get in group content. Eq has a task system and a tradeskill system as well as a merchant system that allows any player to progress through the game without ever picking up with a group. . it takes longer because it should.&amp;nbsp; by the same token palayer who group but do not raid have o right to expect&amp;nbsp; raid quality gear.. but they can expect to be geared well enough to&amp;nbsp; group the same contnt as those raiders even ifs its a little harder. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

better. I know for a fact (because I've done it) that I can solo a&#xD;
Priest (think: Cleric) to 60 in less than a month in WoW. But this is&#xD;
with focused play. No hanging out at the auction house, no standing&#xD;
around looking for people to group with, and very little travel. Move&#xD;
into an area before you log out and log in ready to tear up stuff&#xD;
immediately.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
People who try to cast aspersions on another game's community without&#xD;
giving the slightest bit of thought to the constitution of that&#xD;
community are funny and sad at the same time. Tell me, do you think&#xD;
that WoW's entire playerbase is composed of former EQ1 players? Fact&#xD;
is, WoW expanded the market exponentially and pulled in people from ALL&#xD;
of the former legacy titles (like EQ1 and Asheron's Call 1 &amp;amp; 2, and&#xD;
DAoC and Anarchy Online, and even UO). It also drew a lot of folks who&#xD;
were Blizzard fans but had never played an MMO before. Unfortunately, a&#xD;
lot of those folks seem to fall into the "bnet kiddies" group but their&#xD;
money spends the same as yours so it doesn't matter, now does it?&#xD;
EverQuest 1 has never had 1.5 million North American subscribers&#xD;
(that's why when writers refer to Blizzard's numbers, they use terms&#xD;
like "a record number" and "never before seen", I guess). You trying to&#xD;
argue which game is better is like a male taking a leak into gale force&#xD;
winds. It's pointless. EverQuest is a good game. World of Warcraft is a&#xD;
good game. The difference being, World of Warcraft is a better game for&#xD;
a larger number of people. And to the folks who sign the checks and&#xD;
make the decisions, that's what matters.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
As far as the topic is concerned, I can't agree with it. I agree with&#xD;
Cenyini. There is no way I'd recommend this game to any of my friends&#xD;
to start from scratch in. The curve is too steep. There's too much&#xD;
they'd have to learn, do, and pick up on just to be 'decent' (not even&#xD;
'good', just 'decent'). I've turned several folks away from EQ1 over&#xD;
the last year or so for that very reason. And as Kneesmasher mentioned,&#xD;
only about 10% of the game's zones get any real use (and most of those&#xD;
are high level) so if they had to do the LFG thing and find that many&#xD;
of the people in their level range are afk in the bazaar, that could&#xD;
leave a very bad impression. I know when I first started playing, the&#xD;
game hooked me within the first 10 or so levels. Now? heh, yeah right.&#xD;
Besides, the friends that I have that used to play EQ and have moved on&#xD;
to other games now make a very good point. I don't exactly agree with&#xD;
it but they basically say that mass advertising for EQ1 would be like&#xD;
polishing a turd. I'd put it more like washing a leisure suit. Yes, it&#xD;
would make the suit much more noticeable.....but it's still a leisure&#xD;
suit. EQ's gameplay and mechanics don't have mass market appeal&#xD;
anymore, since the market has spoken and casual friendly gameplay is&#xD;
what they want. Now before the lynch mob forms, let me just say that&#xD;
casual friendly gameplay does not necessarily mean what you might think&#xD;
it does. What it means, in my view, is that a person can advance their&#xD;
character, no matter what class that character is, whether they have a&#xD;
group or not. There isn't a single class in WoW that cannot be solo'd&#xD;
to max level. Not one. But, from my experience, most folks prefer to&#xD;
group even though they CAN solo. Options. That's what folks want. Can&#xD;
you solo a cleric to 70 + 300+ AA in less than a decade? And solo means&#xD;
just that cleric, not 2-5 other toons supporting them (since some folks&#xD;
think multiboxing = soloing).&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
That's probably the only thing WoW has that EQ does not (not counting&#xD;
the 6+ million subscribers). Options. In EQ1, in order to advance at a&#xD;
decent rate, you must have a support system outside of your one&#xD;
character. In WoW, that is not the case. Advertising EQ1 on a large&#xD;
scale would only serve to make these things more obvious to more people&#xD;
which could result in the exact opposite of the intended effect. That&#xD;
is, driving people further away from EQ1 than bringing folks in&#xD;
longterm.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Don't waste your time, Palanthor. There are folks who are so devoted to EQ that they cannot conceive another game doing &lt;I&gt;&lt;B&gt;ANYTHING&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt; better. I know for a fact (because I've done it) that I can solo a Priest (think: Cleric) to 60 in less than a month in WoW. But this is with focused play. No hanging out at the auction house, no standing around looking for people to group with, and very little travel. Move into an area before you log out and log in ready to tear up stuff immediately.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffff00&gt;And to many of us, this is exactly what is WRONG with WoW, and why people refer to it as easy mode.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;People who try to cast aspersions on another game's community without giving the slightest bit of thought to the constitution of that community are funny and sad at the same time. Tell me, do you think that WoW's entire playerbase is composed of former EQ1 players? Fact is, WoW expanded the market exponentially and pulled in people from ALL of the former legacy titles (like EQ1 and Asheron's Call 1 &amp;amp; 2, and DAoC and Anarchy Online, and even UO). It also drew a lot of folks who were Blizzard fans but had never played an MMO before. Unfortunately, a lot of those folks seem to fall into the "bnet kiddies" group but their money spends the same as yours so it doesn't matter, now does it? EverQuest 1 has never had 1.5 million North American subscribers (that's why when writers refer to Blizzard's numbers, they use terms like "a record number" and "never before seen", I guess). You trying to argue which game is better is like a male taking a leak into gale force winds. It's pointless. EverQuest is a good game. World of Warcraft is a good game. The difference being, World of Warcraft is a better game for a larger number of people. And to the folks who sign the checks and make the decisions, that's what matters.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffff00&gt;The important point to what you say here is, they are different games, and the people who prefer one versus the other, do so FOR the fact they are different. This is why EQ people often get upset when they see someone make suggestions that EQ should be more like WoW. If EQ were made to be more like WoW, it would lose what makes it unique, then it would just be WoW with worse graphics.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As far as the topic is concerned, I can't agree with it. I agree with Cenyini. There is no way I'd recommend this game to any of my friends to start from scratch in. The curve is too steep. There's too much they'd have to learn, do, and pick up on just to be 'decent' (not even 'good', just 'decent'). I've turned several folks away from EQ1 over the last year or so for that very reason. And as Kneesmasher mentioned, only about 10% of the game's zones get any real use (and most of those are high level) so if they had to do the LFG thing and find that many of the people in their level range are afk in the bazaar, that could leave a very bad impression. I know when I first started playing, the game hooked me within the first 10 or so levels. Now? heh, yeah right. Besides, the friends that I have that used to play EQ and have moved on to other games now make a very good point. I don't exactly agree with it but they basically say that mass advertising for EQ1 would be like polishing a turd. I'd put it more like washing a leisure suit. Yes, it would make the suit much more noticeable.....but it's still a leisure suit. EQ's gameplay and mechanics don't have mass market appeal anymore, since the market has spoken and casual friendly gameplay is what they want. Now before the lynch mob forms, let me just say that casual friendly gameplay does not necessarily mean what you might think it does. What it means, in my view, is that a person can advance their character, no matter what class that character is, whether they have a group or not. There isn't a single class in WoW that cannot be solo'd to max level. Not one. But, from my experience, most folks prefer to group even though they CAN solo. Options. That's what folks want. Can you solo a cleric to 70 + 300+ AA in less than a decade? And solo means just that cleric, not 2-5 other toons supporting them (since some folks think multiboxing = soloing).&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffff00&gt;CLerics can actually solo pretty decently now, with the defensive wards. Yes, its slower than WoW, but so is group exp. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;That's probably the only thing WoW has that EQ does not (not counting the 6+ million subscribers). Options. In EQ1, in order to advance at a decent rate, you must have a support system outside of your one character. In WoW, that is not the case. Advertising EQ1 on a large scale would only serve to make these things more obvious to more people which could result in the exact opposite of the intended effect. That is, driving people further away from EQ1 than bringing folks in longterm.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffff00&gt;The argument could also be made that making those changes to EQ would drive off the current players, rather than attracting new ones. After all, there is already a WoW game. If EQ were made wowlike, it would just be the WoW clone with older graphics. The WoW players would not leave for EQ, since they would be the same, and The EQ players would not stay, at least those of us who don't want EZ mode play.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;Sure, the ward helps them solo.&amp;nbsp; However, they'd need to do a bunch of grouping/missions, probably be lvl 70, and do a minor raid to get it.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Or they could buy the level 50 version from Vicar Carean in PoK for 17pp, the level 57 version from the bazaar, or farm it in Ssra temple, or they could farm/buy radiant crystals, and buy the level 61 version from the lavastorm merchant.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I know someone is going to say "what about below level 50"? I know that soloing below 50 is possible, with the proper camp choices, because I did quite a bit of it, back when the gear available was nowhere near as good as todays. High 40s - combine city skeletons in DL, or the skeletons in burning woods, there is a house of static spawn skeletons, that has a safe place to pull to nearby. Low 40s, the other skelly camp in DL, by fv.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;30's i mostly grouped, although I did get one level camping cynthia in Rathe mountains. Below that, any class can solo.&lt;/P&gt;</description>
