      <title>Another Epic 1.0 question Sorry</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=enchantertactics&amp;message.id=861#M861</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I have been camping my chanter epic 1.0 for months now. The mob that seems to be missing is Felcia Goldenwing. I have sat and killed in Skyfire for hours and hours and not seen her once. Finally after months my guild felt bad for me and thought it may help if they all came and killed the whole zone , as killing the named on the named cycle wasnt working( did this for hours and hours for months). I went into Skyfire with a full raid force of level 75`s , we cleared the whole zone over and over for almost 8 hours. We completed 3 cleric epics , got the parts to 2 bard epics , like 8 monk drops, wurm slayer drops out the wazoo, had 3k per person splits. &amp;nbsp;Not 1 time did we get Felcia to spawn , I understand rare mobs but this is silly. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I have been stuck at this point of the epic for months and months. Nothing seems to help , mass killing of the whole zone over and over for hours does nothing. Tracking and running around just killing the named off the named cycle gets nothing. Its sad I sit and watch epics being done all around me but I cant finish mine due to one mob that is a rare spawn, kos to other mobs inzone and never pops.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Is this mob bugged, wont spawn , being killed as soon as it pops so trackers cant even get it up before its dead? Or do I just have the worst luck in Everquest ever?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Any ideas please ?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I just want to get this done so I can do 1.5, 2.0, 2.5 LOL&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>I have read several posts about fighting Solo in High Keep against a prisoner in there by the name of Osargen that it can be great exp for a Solo Enchanter from 20-30. Any insights on this and if so I'd certainly welcome any info you could add to this disussion. Also I am definately interested in Soloing places from level 22-25. Thank You.....&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;A friend of mine is starting to play eq again, and they insist on becoming an enchanter. I was just wondering what the best classes to duo with an enchanter is, i figure priests are pretty good to duo with&amp;nbsp;any classes, but i was looking for other's feedback. I would also appreciate it if i had tips on the places and strategies that could be used, thanks&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Ello everyone.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;My first character some years ago was a enchanter, i have always loved them, but switch to rogue recently. Now with the new progression server, and not having to&amp;nbsp;worry about everyone being twinked out, i was going to make a enchanter to play.. I remember the old world, and even though it is more convient now, with pok and such, I do miss the long boat rides and such.. Anyways i was wondering if anyone can dust off a copy of a charm guide for leveling up, low end to high end. I would go to the runes or what not but my work filtered anything with *games* in there key tag and for some reason eq forums isnt.. You can email it to me as well at &lt;A href="mailto:leland_fallon@yahoo.com" target=_blank&gt;leland_fallon@yahoo.com&lt;/A&gt;. I would appreciate it.. This new progression server is gonna revivied my exciting feeling of being a enchanter all over again.. i currently play on zek, but will be switching when new server comes out... Thanks Guys!!.. ( and ladies) ;)... also if anyone will be joining that server who plays generally around 9pm est let me know, be cool to group with some people also.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=enchantertactics&amp;message.id=827#M827</link>
      <description>I have been adventuring in the worlds of Everquest from until Luclin started and I dropped off for over 5 years. I have managed to get my Enchanter to Level 23&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have been wondering, is it possible for Enchanters to Charm indoors? It might sound basic, but I was wondering. I know they cannot cast their pets indoors, but are they able to charm a Mob for their pet indoors?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was planning to go fighting in the Warrens and grabbing a pet inside for my Solo tank. Any suggestions or advice would be appreciated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;After playing an Illusionist in EQ2 for year, I'm burn out on the content there and decided to play EQ1 and I'm having a blast.  My Chanter is only level 10 so far and I have some questions.  Please excuse me if these have been asked a million times ;)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;1) I finished the tutorial and I'm in PoK.  I bought the Titanium pack so I have everything except the last expansion.  Last night, I did my first trial in Faydark and currently work on an armor quest in Butcherblock.  Am I wasting my time with these?  Should I move on to other areas of the game?  The world is so big and so much has been added.  I don't know if these first few armor quests are outdated now.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;2) Looking forward to working my chanter in groups, but at level 10 there isn't much out there.  So, I'm soloing it for now.  My question is tactics.  I found some (my be outdated) tactics somewhere online and have been following it.  Here is what I do.  First Pull with Tashan.  When the hits me and my pet goes to attack, I hit it with a color spell and back off.  While the color spell is recharging, I hit it with a Spin spell.  I recycle with both those spells and when it gets low on health, I DD it.  Is this the best tactic for my level?  I usually walk away with very little mana from the battle.  Any other tips on soloing at my level?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;3) Where is my gate spell?  I couldn't find it from any of the enchanter spell sellers.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Thanks for the help guys :)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Jullian of the Nameless&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Mezmerization Vs Enthrall</title>

      <description>As a Solo Enchanter, is it better when fighting a Mob to Enthrall them or Mezmerize them to calm things down?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have been reading a great deal of threads about Charming ie. Tashan/Charm to use as a pet, but then when Charm breaks wouldn't it be better Mana effective to use Enthrall because it only uses 50 Mana and remains for as long as 48 seconds vs 70 Mana and 24 seconds for Mez?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Any inputs/suggestions would be appreciated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Powerleveling with an Enchanter</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=enchantertactics&amp;message.id=807#M807</link>
      <description>   I came up with a way to powerlevel with an enchanter (I doubt I'm the first, but I thought I'd share), and I am wondering if anyone has fine tuned this at all or has any suggestions. With an enchanter as the powerleveler I charged a beastlord to level 30 in no time. Here's how I did it:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Project Illusion: Fire Elemental on the twink (must be grouped to do this)&lt;br&gt;Cast Feedback on the twink (the Feedback earring is nice for this)&lt;br&gt;Click epic haste on the twink&lt;br&gt;Cast Rune III on the twink (I opted not to use Rune IV because the peridots get expensive)&lt;br&gt;Cast Berserker Spirit on the twink (for the damage absorbing)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Recast Berserker Spirit / Rune III whenever they drop. The twink should never actually take any damage. Those unfortunately draw a bit of aggro, so the enchanter should never sit to keep the mobs from attacking him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You have to have several stacks of of jaspers for the Rune III, but with the hasted, damage-shielded twink (the damage shields from Illusion: Fire Elemental and Feedback stack), it can tear through mobs pretty quickly. For hybrids you can give them Clarity to practice their casting. You can also give the twink intelligence/wisdom buffs to help make skills go up faster. I did this powerleveling in Paludal Caverns and High Keep. Unfortunately mobs do too much damage above level 30 or so for the damage absorbing spells to be effective. However, if you want to get a twink to level 30 very quickly this tactic might even be faster than a cleric or druid powerleveling because of the haste.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=enchantertactics&amp;message.id=793#M793</link>
      <description>I got the new spell from POR, and I have some comments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mind Shatter is a mana drain 1st, and a DOT 2nd, if the mob has no mana you get &amp;quot;your target has no mana to affect&amp;quot;.   Is this intended?  I thought it was touted as a new DOT, with mana drain attached.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With our last DOT being 185 per tick/342 mana, this upgrade to 435 per tick/525 mana is very nice if you only consider the DOT aspects.  However it has the limitation that your target has to have mana.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The mana drain side is 50 per tick /5 ticks/525 mana, not quite as good as Scryers 50 per tick/10 ticks/5 mana.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The DOT aspect prevents mezzes, where scryers allows them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over all I like the combination except for the prerequisit that the mob has mana.  This limits it's usefullness in a lot of content.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My main question is:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#ff00ff"&gt;Is Mind Statter supposed to be a DOT 1st, or a mana drain 1st? and the 2ndary effect is a bonus?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;If it is a DOT 1st, then its broken because it doesn't work on mobs with no mana, please fix it to allow it to be cast on mobs to take damage THEN have the message about no mana AFTER the damage portion has landed.&lt;br&gt;If it is a mana drain 1st then the ratio is a bit schewed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt; I read the chanter boards here quite a bit and also Therunes.net and i hear this and that about charm soloing(negative comments).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; Im a lvl 70 enchanter, just a tad over 400 aa's, self buffed from spells and various items i have picked up i get about 7k hp and 8700 mana. i find charm soloing to be fairly easy. i am not the best geared enchanter in the world, i have some nice pieces and all but my dod thick skin defense aa's max'd out. but i go into Wall of slaughter and i can charm solo the dragorn tents near the &amp;quot;star gate&amp;quot;(called on my server) with very few problems. i dont mind the charm nerf implemented in OoW at all, i actually find that it makes kills go alot faster once u  come up with a system of how ur going to charm the camp ur charming.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; I dont like to see the negative comments about charm being dead and that enchanters are a dead class. charm in groups may be useless and i agree it kinda is but it really does make an enchanter a good solo class. i have all charm aa's and i can solo a good portion of wos zone and the vast majority of Nobles causeway zone includeing named mobs. i think alot of problems with enchanter saying we cant do X Y and Z  has to do with a bit of a fear factor. just try it..if u get owned up u are probly lacking some aa or some spell that can push u over the edge to be able to win in zones u think u cant. i sit at the star gate and solo alot while other classes look at me like **SMURF**. im not sure if i am able to solo the mobs i do because im that much more advanced now or what, but i do it and its fun. so i guess stop being scared and try..charm is powerfull even in omens of war.but thats just my opinion =)&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;I had my 47 Chanter in Firiona for one of the spell turn ins.  She is a High Elf, and welcome at the Firiona exile camp.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I decided to play with charming a drolvarg and use it some.  Because I was too high a level for this to pay of much, I decided to go back over by the guards preparatory to gating out.  The guards were fine until my charmed pet finished its battle and came back to me.  When the pet arrived, I was summarily attacked and killed by the High Elf guards.  Presumably, my pet did not outlive me by more than seconds.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I recovered the corpse and checked the log.  I had not cast anything on a guard by mistake, and there was no clue what happened other than the guard tellling me that I was going to die.  I went to the guards and checked that I was indeed indifferent to the guards and amiable to the roving scout.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So I charmed another drolvarg and left him parked outside.  I got close to the guards and checked aggro.  Still indifferent.  Then I told pet to follow and as he got close, the guards again attacked us both and killed me again before I could get a gate or escape on foot.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I haven't charmed a lot around places where my pet is KOS to local guards, but I had not seen aggro behavior like this before.  I don't think that the charmed pet should not have drawn aggro.  The guards should have reflected the charmed pet whether it was close to me or not.  The con changing like it did makes it impossible to judge a safe approach.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I didn't see anything searching on pet aggro and guard combinations on these boards.  Is this an expected response and I just never encountered it?  I feedbacked it as a bug, but I wanted to come here and ask if this is normal or not.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Level 20 - Illusion: Iksar Spell</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=enchantertactics&amp;message.id=741#M741</link>
      <description>Good Morning All,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   I was wondering where does one buy the spell?  I've tried in Neriak, West Freeport, and Quynos.  I'm going to try other cities and of course the moon of Luclin.  Any hint where this spell is sold?  BTW....My Enchanter is a dark elf.  :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;HeddyFran</description>

      <title>DC question: how to tell what level mobs are?</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=enchantertactics&amp;message.id=731#M731</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I'm wondering if anyone knows of a table anywhere that lists at what levels mobs are dark blue, light blue, and green. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;For example, say I have DC at 59, what can I tell whether or not a mob is above or below 46 by its con color, or if I'm 63, or 65, etc. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;In other words, at what level do mobs go light blue and green for each character level, starting at char level 59, and ending when 46's go green? (Obviously, once that happens, there is really no way to tell by yourself). A table somewhere that lists this would be awesome. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Thanks&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
