<DIV>Don't try to make your "accomplishments" to be bigger than they really are.&nbsp; They didn't re-tune GoD because of you, they re-tuned it because it needed to be re-tuned.&nbsp; Big woopidy do.&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I was asking about this at the Fan Faire, and GoD's "failure" came from player stubborness, not out of "too hard content".&nbsp; Everything you asked for was there, and you turned it down.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I mean your entire arguement is completely filled with contradiction.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Using charm pets?&nbsp; Are you insane?&nbsp; Maybe that's the method<EM>&nbsp; you</EM> used, doesn't mean it's the right one.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV>I mean, you're being pretty presumptuous to assume that because you didn't like something it "ruined" anything.&nbsp; The whole backlash of people whining about Planes of Power flags didn't come around until about the GoD era, when people were mad they couldn't finally leech onto the old expansion for no effort.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Nothing was "ruined" with any of these expansions, and your unwillingess to actually take advantage of what was given to you doesn't dictate the success or validity of expansions.</DIV>
