    <description>&lt;div&gt;man, whenever I'm in an EXP group I'll always box myslef and one of my friend's paladin's or warriors.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Why?  1) playing a cleric in an EXP group is freaking boring.  2)  I know I get a good tank who's skilled and well geared.  and 3)  I get double the exp for us!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It's a win/win situation.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Although there is plenty of threads scattered throughout the various cleric and druid forums about healing power, group desirability, dps, and basically anything short of what type of cracker goes best with cheez whiz, I think that maybe both classes are missing out what is truly most of the problem... the bot healer.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So what is to be done about it?&amp;nbsp; Is this something that will fade with time as the devs keep adding content that will make bot healers tough, if not impossible, to use as the sole healer in a group?&amp;nbsp; Or is there something that could be changed within the CLR/DRU spellsets and abilities now that would help?&amp;nbsp; The only thing I could come up with is making CHeal&amp;nbsp;non-usable except in raid settings, but I get the feeling that this isn't something that the devs are willing to alter atm... and I am also reluctant to suggest this since I am not starting this thread as flamebait.&amp;nbsp; I just believe if bots could be minimized outside the group that both clerics and druids (maybe shammies too *shrug*) would find themselves with more groups and less to argue over:smileyhappy:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;BTW, my main is a 70 druid.... the reason I posted this in the cleric discussion area is that clerics IMHO would have a better grasp on the various forms of healing that a druid doesn't have access to and thus could provide a better analysis and/or ideas on this topic.&amp;nbsp; Or, you guys could also tell me that I don't know **HALFLING** I am talking about and get the heck out of your forums LOL.&amp;nbsp; Also, any of the druid mains that post over here: Please try and restrict this thread to ideas and/or constructive criticism... there are FAR too many threads in this forum and in the druid forums that have devolved into "you're stoopid! no you're stoopid!" Maybe both classes can&amp;nbsp; have at least one thread we can just be civil with each other and talk rationally :smileyhappy:&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why would SOE try and do away with bots or duals or whatever you want to call them?  A second or third account costs just as much each month as your main account.  People who play multiple accounts have to buy multiple copies of every expansion. Revenue is revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;One of the main reason bots are used is because it is hard to find these "real" players that play certain needed classes.&amp;nbsp; It is not just an issue for healing.&amp;nbsp; CC, pullers, tanks, clerics, and all other classes can all be 2 or 3 boxed in order to give and sense of safety and security to group members(no noobs in key roles).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I don't like alts and bots.&amp;nbsp; Class envisioning is not going to change whether ppl use alts and bots though.&amp;nbsp; Ever try to form a group and could not find a need class(most need a healer tank and slower and many need a puller and cc).&amp;nbsp; If there is no one in your guild lfg for these spots and no one on the lfg list then guess what ppl have no choice but to use bots.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Tis a good question though Kwar.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; and I agree with ya.&amp;nbsp; Would rather have people playing mains getting the group slots.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; question is how to make it happen.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I think that once priest re-envisionment is completed (stances for druid and whatever they decide tod o for shamen), healer botting will be greatly reduced.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I think the bigger issue though is that once a bot is in place, no one in the group is willing to fight to get a "real" character in a "botted" slot, if a "real" player becomes available after the group is formed, regardless of the slot being filled.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;man, whenever I'm in an EXP group I'll always box myslef and one of my friend's paladin's or warriors.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Why?  1) playing a cleric in an EXP group is freaking boring.  2)  I know I get a good tank who's skilled and well geared.  and 3)  I get double the exp for us!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It's a win/win situation.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>I am one of the guilty people who boxes a cleric along with my bard. Now I know I'm just speaking for myself, but the reason I box is because it's very hard to get groups together when I play. And if I have a chance to have a 'real' healer (be it cleric, druid or shaman) in the group, I'll log out my box and make room for them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I do spend a lot of time reading about clerics and have actually played her in groups for a while without the bard to learn the actual class. Note I say I am boxing her and not botting her !&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maybe that's not typical for boxers, though I am sure I am not alone in this... Just to give you some hope that not all people that use boxes or bots are teh ebil reincarnated ;)</description>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Botting is a normal thing, and isnt limited to just the healing class, i know people that bot extra DPS just to make the group move slight faster. This stupid stance they are supose to give was for "group desireability" but in truth, The druids as MHs will be much like clerics, they wont desire the group. which will result STILL in people useing BOTS&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I agree that it's not just healers but any group slot that's available and/or needed.&amp;nbsp; The biggest issue is not in bots themselves (without bots some groups would simply either never form or break up for lack of a missing role filler), but in the fact that once a bot is in a group, no one in that group even considers replacing the bot with a real player later on.&amp;nbsp; I'm just as guilty of it as the next person, I have a druid bot which I use for porting, fixed invis, and DPS.&amp;nbsp; I typically try to get LFG guilmates who can fill the DPS role into my group and I will drop my druid, but chances if I am in RSS and a DPS classes shouts LFG I am vey unlikely to take that pickup person in.&amp;nbsp; It's the "better the devil you know" syndrome - an adequately botted toon is better than an unknown real person.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Actually, the problem is that people think it is of to try to force others into playing the game their way. I frequently bot a warrior to two box, or do easy grinds, like creators and such. Just because someone is looking for group, I see no reason to drop my bot and lose the exp he was gaining. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Now, if it was a close friend, I would do it, but I sure as heck am not going to drop him for some joker off the /lfg screen.&lt;/P&gt;</description>
