      <title>Question Regarding Rogue Stealth</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=roguetactic&amp;message.id=872#M872</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Hey all, complete newb to the eq rogue here. I played a rogue in WoW and fell in love with the class, and have come back for the new servers. I decided to play a rogue instead of playing an SK again, but I find myself, well, clueless. I see rogues get sneak and hide; are they similiar to WoW stealth at all...can eq rogues move fast while sneaking? Any way to move while hiding? What's the difference? When i skill up in sneak/hide, does it improve my stealth level, or speed?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Let's say for example im a DE rogue farming guards in Highhold Keep. If they are a few levels below me, can I just sneak up on em and backstab, no prob? Will mobs "see through" my stealth much?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Any info and explanations would be greatly appreciated! Thanks.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>Rogue Epic 1.0 - FV Server- Renux Herkanor - TLCing</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=roguetactic&amp;message.id=855#M855</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;This may be a bit long winded but I'll try my best to keep it simple.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;u&gt;Overview:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two characters involved&lt;/strong&gt; - Myself , lvl 70 shaman and my rogue, lvl 53.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The problem&lt;/strong&gt; - Renux is TLC'ing the Jagged Diamond Dagger&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;u&gt;A more in-depth explanation:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fight 1&lt;/strong&gt; - I find Yendar, do the turn in, and notice Renux con's light blue to Shaman. I say to myself &amp;quot;Sweet, I can group the rogue and shaman for this fight because light blues do not TLC&amp;quot;.  Apperantly I was wrong. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So I petition to be given the Jagged Diamond Dagger, in hind sight I should of realized Sony could not give that to me because they have no record of it. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I went into Trader Mode for the night and when I woke up I had a response saying &amp;quot;We cannot give you the dagger, but here is the &amp;quot;Scribbled Parchment&amp;quot; back so you can turn that into Yendar.&amp;quot;  I re-petition and explain  &amp;quot;okay, thats fine, but if thats the route we're taking, can I have my Book of Souls back too?&amp;quot; (The petition was more detailed then that,but thats the jist of it).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I leave for work, staying in Trader Mode, and tripled checked my inventory to make sure I had room for them to put the Book of Souls there.   I return home from work with a GM response of &amp;quot;Our records show that you dropped the Book of Souls and someone else picked it up, we can't help you&amp;quot;.  Now *that* made me mad.  It was the GM's fault it dropped, not mine. But I figured at this point, its a trust issue. They don't know that I really didnt drop it.  So I sucked it up, considered myself lucky that I at least got the Scribbled Parchment and went back to Hate and got my book again.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fight 2 - &lt;/strong&gt;Now I return to Steamfont. I decide this time, I'm going to keep the Shaman outside the group and just have her slow and heal and maybe add some Puppy Damage. I spawn Renux, have Puppy attack for a BRIEF amount of time before pulling him off and then slow and heal to keep aggro while my Rogue does damage from the back.  I kill Renux and ~gasp~ this fight was TRIVIAL to me. My Jagged Diamond Dagger has poofed once again.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; Now I look back and forth between my Rogue and Shaman screen. The Shaman did not KS the fight or she would of gotten the TLC message. Only the Rogue got the message. I *know* I did more damage then the Shaman.  So, frustrated, I petition to get my Tattered Parchement and Book of Souls back, then go to bed. I wake up to a GM saying &amp;quot;We can't give you the Tattered Parchment and Book of Souls from Renux because you didnt loot them off her.&amp;quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; ((This is where my jaw hit the keyboard)).  If the GM had read the petition they would know that is *not* what I was saying.   So I  petitioned and gave a very good description of my situation. I'm at work now, so we'll see what the response is when I get home.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Question: &lt;/strong&gt;What am I doing wrong? The first TLC I'm going to chaulk up to having the 70 grouped when I killed Renux. The second fight I am very confused about. My Rogue did the most damage, Renux should not of TLC'd. I've been playing on FV since it was in Beta, I am aware of how the system works and from everything I've seen, this should not of happened. Is it that Puppy did damage, no matter how minimal? Would 1 point of damage make this fight TLC for the Rogue?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Possible Solution: &lt;/strong&gt;Those that play on FV know that going into /raid mode can negate TLC, but I personally have witnessed something TLC even though I was in raid mode, so I am wary of trying. I want to be 100% sure before I try this fight again.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I am frustrated with the petition system, the GM's never seem to really understand what I'm saying and I'm worried that they wont reimburse me the items again because I've asked for them back twice now. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Has anyone else on FV dealt with this?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Thank you for any help.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

Even when it has gone off in my face and rooted me to the spot.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Tried disarm and got no message at all, not even you have not senced any traps. Ended up with a trap on target at one stage  and  got the message you have failed to disarm a trap.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;At the end of the stonebites last raid I was starting to get traps disarmed once I managed to get them targetted, but I'd never seen disarm traps fail like that before.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Any advice on how to deal with traps since the release of PoR greatly appreciated.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;A frustrated rogue who is concidering taking the weekend off.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Starting Rogue Epic 1.5/Vorla Diensk?</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=roguetactic&amp;message.id=836#M836</link>
      <description>&lt;font size="4"&gt;Vorla Diensk is not in fv at all. I have been unable to find any reliable info on her. Search forum after forum. I asked alot of people. I used trackers and still couldn't find them.  Look below.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;Find Vorla Diensk in Firiona Vie at -435, -3300.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You say, 'Hail, Vorla Diensk'&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vorla Diensk stares at you blankly. She is wearing a pendant that resembles a sun occluded by the horizon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You say, 'The sun is setting on the horizon.'&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vorla Diensk nods in your direction, 'He said you would come, ______. Listen closely to what I have to say. We do not have time for dilly-dally and I don't appreciate having to repeat myself to any old Dark Elf. Your services came highly recommended and so I doubt there will be any problems, hm? Our mutual acquaintance, Stanos, has various contacts around Norrath. Through these eyes and ears some disturbing information has surfaced. Word is that someone is attempting to forge a weapon of unmatched prowess - a blade of assassination, potentially capable of slaying even the most powerful creatures. We know the perpetrator is an outsider. They are not a member of any of any rival thieving guild, and we cannot trust such a weapon to exist out in the open without knowing its true purpose. Do you know [how we deduced this information]?'&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You say, 'How did you deduce this information?'&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vorla Diensk leans in closer and continues, 'Thieves guilds have their secrets - this is not in dispute. The most treasured secrets reside in the hands of the most senior members and they guard these secrets carefully. Because of this, an uneasy balance is maintained between the different sects. That balance has been disrupted. What we have discovered is that an unknown party has managed to pry the most guarded information on how best to craft a blade from thieves around the world. To what end this knowledge will be used for is unknown, as is the method they used to coerce these pillars of the community. But it does not bode well. Stanos knew this. Due to his past he no doubt believes that the blade will be used for a dark purpose, and who are we to argue? He has a special insight into such matters. At any rate, this is [where you come in].'&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You say, 'Where do I come in?'&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vorla Diensk says 'You must find these rogues and deal with them.' She chuckles, 'Don't worry, you needn't cause them harm. Deal with them diplomatically. Here, take this pendant so that they recognize your status. Your name is inscribed on the pendant in symbols that they will understand. Many of these individuals are legendary members of the rogue community, or at the very least . . . Infamous. Causing them grief will solve nothing. Find out what they know. We can use this knowledge to [craft another blade]. If you can, find out who they spoke to. Use whatever methods you have at your disposal - these blaggards are not necessarily beneath bribery.'&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You receive an Occluded Sun Pendant, which identifies as &amp;quot;The proof of loyalty.&amp;quot; It raises faction with Miners Guild 628, Deeppockets, Rogues of the White Rose, and Guardians of Shar Vahl.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You say, 'Craft another blade?'&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vorla Diensk says 'We have multiple reasons for wanting to forge a duplicate blade: Firstly, we want to find out what we're up against. Second, it only makes sense to carry comparable weaponry in case you have to tangle with the assassin. Third, it will help us to uncover who was behind the creation of the original.'&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the next steps, if you are of the same race (or under an illusion to be of that race), you can skip the small tasks by handing them a Pouch of Gems instead. It costs 15.8kpp or so from A Shady Highpass Citizen in Highpass Hold at -95, +425, and you can substitute ONE TIME ONLY. He also only sells it once every few hours. It is recommended (required?) that you wear the pendant during all of these steps.&lt;br&gt;-----------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My guess is the npc was nerfed. You tell me. How can i start 1.5 without this crucial part?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Level or AA's</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=roguetactic&amp;message.id=774#M774</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I recently grouped with a lcl 70 rogue in one of the higher end guilds on my server, while grouping with said rogue I announced to group I dinged my 140'th AA at lvl 67 and he wasn't too pleased. Personnaly I care not what others think but it's a reasonable question, AA's or levels? My reasoning behind chosing AA is that NO guild wants a rogue that can't escape and no group wants one that doesn't DPS. As you can see from my magelo all of my AA's are well thought out and invested wisely but what do you fellas think? He made the comment "Levels raise your dps more than AA's do" and I don't think that's anywhere near right. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <title>First Bard fight - epic 1.5</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=roguetactic&amp;message.id=760#M760</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Its time to go Bard Killing :smileytongue: and I wanted some rogue advice :-&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I know this guy mezzes/charms and does not hit particularly hard but I belong to a small guild and will need to find some friends to help out. Was thinking maybe 3 groups of 65+ peeps would be enough??&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Each group with 1 tank, 2 clerics, 3 dps classes (or anyone really). This sound about right. Will be a miss match of gear levels depending on who I can bribe/beg/force into helping me.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Oh and if I can get this together and kill him what would I need to add to do the GF bards?? - thats if anyone will go near the place with all the nasty elves around.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>New Skill Available</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=roguetactic&amp;message.id=754#M754</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp; I created another baby Myce (yes, i'm proliferating on all servers ~ I'm a name hog), so that I could play the tutorial, I love that place!&amp;nbsp; When my new baby Myce hit level 6, I got told that I was now able to use my new skill, pick locks, and by the way, you've gotten better at it, too [Pick Locks (1)] ..... &lt;STRONG&gt;BAD IDEA&lt;/STRONG&gt;... now, I am guaranteed that I'm either going to have to wait until that rogue is lvl 46, so he can train on the invisible lock in Tranquility, OR I have to spend 10 exp points before I'm able to pick a lock (lowest lock that I know of requires a minimum skill of 11)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Rogue &lt;STRONG&gt;must already have&lt;/STRONG&gt; the skill required to pick a lock, or else we're told we don't have the key, or that we lack the skill to pick the lock,&amp;nbsp; Unless we're going to get an alternative way to earn exp points to spend (my *Real Myce* on Saryrn still has about 15 unspent, and unspendable points, at level 70), there should be no nerf that requires I have to spend 10 for a skill ... that's two levels worth of skill points that would have been used in something else ...&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp; I doubt this was an intentional &lt;STRONG&gt;slam&lt;/STRONG&gt; to Rogues&amp;nbsp; (possibly to bards, too .. who knows?), but it needs to be known, and fixed.&amp;nbsp; Just a little thing that will cost our young members some points, and cause some headaches ... &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size=3&gt;Shackleton asked me to post this here :)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Vigdis of Zek aka Sandalfon&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT size=6&gt;Skill modifiers and effects&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;I&gt;Compiled at the Shaman's Cruciblefrom by Vigdis of Zek (with the occasional spot heal by Hamlon of Zek) with information from various sources.&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Contributors who have been ninjaquoted and whose posts have been cornered and tanked for information (in no particular order): &lt;/B&gt;Shackleton/decius1, Payn_Prexus, Hurk, Brohg, Kevagron, Rydeon, Castina Solomnus, The Ranger Forums, Ladwenae, Orruar, Retron, Urdegish, Taraddar, Scowl, Jayabalard, Samanna, Swiftkique. Without you guys this compilation would not have been possible.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;There are 5 Parts of this guide.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;OL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;The first is mostly about effects that have no entry in the spell database and usually stack.&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;The second is mostly about effects that do have a spell entry and don't stack.&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;The third is about Haste.&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;The fourth is about the game mechanics behind damage, AC and Attack.&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;The fifth part contains some notes and tidbits I thought was interesting enough to add.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT size=5&gt;Part 1 - Non spell based effects&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;/B&gt;The first part of the compilation contains effects wich can be a bit cryptic since they have no explanation in lucy. They are not in the spell database and thus cannot be analyzed the same way as focus effects and spells can. They each have their own mechanics and differ from focuses in the way they stack. Also you should pay extra attention to the fact that both AC and Attack have two different parts that have to do with hit chance vs damage. See section about AC, Attack and Damage below for an explanation on some terms used in this part. These effects generally stack up to a cap.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Regeneration: &lt;/B&gt;The number of extra HP regeneration each tick. Cap increases with levels and can be increased with AA.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Mana Regeneration:&lt;/B&gt; Points of extra mana regeneration each tick. Used to be Flowing Thought. Stacks up to 15 and can be increased up to 20 with AA. Mental Clarity 3 stacks. Player cast and clicky buffs generally stack with no cap. Tribute Mana Regen is subject to the worn cap though.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Accuracy:&lt;/B&gt; Improved chance to hit. This adds to the "hit chance" part of your Attack. 15 accuracy would equal to 1% more landed hits on the mob. According to the Safehouse, the cap is at 150 (wich there is no reason to doubt since the information is said to have come from a dev). See below for information on Attack and Accuracy.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Attack: &lt;/B&gt;This used to be called Vengeance wich no longer exists, it's now just "+X attack". 10 attack = around 1% more dps. The +Attack stats on items add to the "Power" part of the whole Attack rating. Caps at 250. We should also note that spells that add to Attack to like Spirit of Bi'Lih and Ferine Avatar does &lt;I&gt;not&lt;/I&gt; count towards this cap while it seems that &lt;I&gt;Avatar procced from Primals/Prismatic weapons infact do count towards this 250 cap&lt;/I&gt;. See explanation below on difference between the "to hit" and "damage" parts of Attack. Paladins love +Attack items more than apple pie.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Avoidance:&lt;/B&gt; According to magelos script, Avoidance adds to the "avoidance" part of the AC. Taraddar also states: "Normally your defense skill and agility contribute to your "avoidance" ac and increase your chance of being missed. AC from gear doesn't effect this at all. The Avoidance stat directly adds to this and therefore increases ac." See details on AC below. Caps at 100. Parsing has shown these rough figures: &lt;I&gt;"10 avoidance = +1% to avoidance. Compare to CA3 = +10% avoidance, LR5=+5% avoidance, RM5=+2.5% avoidance.&lt;/I&gt; I assume that the results of the parse points to total number of evaded hits, and not "evasion AC".&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Combat effects:&lt;/B&gt; Increases your chance of having your weapons proc. Parses show +10 combat effects is equal to 1 level of weapon affinity on normal weapons. Since weapons have different innate proc rate, the effect varies. 10 Combat Effects would have a higher impact on for example the Ethereal Destroyer, with a low innate proc rate of 85 (100 being standard). Bloodfrenzy has an innate proc rate of 155 while Hammer of Holy Vengeance has whooping 630, where adding 10 extra would do little difference. No parses have been made to suggest a cap, since noone has accumulated enough Combat Effects yet, but we can assume that a cap of 100 is realistic. &lt;B&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Damage Shield: &lt;/B&gt;Permanent damage shield. Each point equals to one point of DS. Cap is 15. Stacks with DS spells. You also need to have some kind of spell damage shield spell or effect active in order to use the worn DS to be active. This would probably both include clickies and potions.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Strikethrough:&lt;/B&gt; Percentage chance to ignore a dodge, parry or riposte and thus landing a hit even if the mobs succeds with his skill. Does nothing if you are attacking from behind. Caps at 35%.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Shielding:&lt;/B&gt; Percentage of fixed damage mitigation. Shielding works on the part of the damage that is fixed and not affected by AC. Quote from the ranger boards:&lt;I&gt; "If a mob has a hit range of 500-1000, the damage bonus portion is 500, and 1% shielding would reduce all hits by 5." &lt;/I&gt;This makes Shielding grant a higher percentage of total damage reduction to characters who's AC is high. Charcaters with low AC still get the same reduction in damage per point, but the damage reduced for them less percentably since they take more damage from the non fixed damage portion of each hit. See details about Damage and AC in the corresponding section below. Caps at 35%.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;DoT Shielding:&lt;/B&gt; Percentage of dot damage mitigation. This works on the total amount of incoming damage, not part of it as it does when calculating melee damage. Your percentage on gear indicates exactly how much less each tick does to you in damage. Caps at 35%.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Spellshield:&lt;/B&gt; Percentage of spell damage mitigation. The same thing as with DoT Shielding. The percentage on your gear is the raw damage you miss out on. Caps at 35%. &lt;B&gt;Stun resist&lt;/B&gt; Perentage chance of avoiding being stunned. Caps at 35%.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;"Attack skill" DMG: +XX:&lt;/B&gt; A very good example of this Damage mod is backstab, so I'm going to use the Rogues special skill as the prime example. On the new Rogue epic Nightshade we see two modifiers to backstab. The interesting one in this context is &lt;B&gt;"Backstab DMG: +15"&lt;/B&gt;. This is damage that is directly added to your fixed damage . So if you normally hit for 600, you will hit for 615 with this effect. Sources indicate that this damage is not mitigated, and adds unmodified to your total damage score. As of yet, no rogues have accumulated enough of this gear to verify where the cap is, but one would assume that it might be around 100-150. As another example, Monks have a Flying Kick DMG: +15 on their epic 2.0 wich works the same way.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT size=5&gt;Part 2 - Spell based melee foci and percentual skill mods&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;/B&gt;I name the following entries "spell effects" because their effects are listed in Lucy's spell database. These are in fact focus effects for melee. This also applies to Instrument modifiers and skill modifiers like Alteration and Tradeskills (for example). None of these effects stack, and the highest one always is the only one that takes effect. Note that there is a big difference between direct skill mods and "Improved" skill mods. The "Improved" are spells (or focus) if you like, while percentual skillmods are processed differently since they are not in the skill database. See Improved Dodge below for details. Also, there seems to be a special exception to lockpicking, see Fandele Longtooth's note at the bottom of this guide.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Cleave:&lt;/B&gt; Higher chance of scoring critical hits. Does not stack with other Cleave, only the higher one applies. Cleave I Increases chance by 40% Cleave II Increases chance by 80% Cleave III Increases chance by 120% Cleave IV Increases chance by 160% Cleave V Increases chance by 200%.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Ferocity:&lt;/B&gt; Improved chance to double attack. Does not stack with other Ferocity, only the higher one applies. Ferocity I Increases chance by 3% Ferocity II Increases chance by 6% Ferocity III Increases chance by 9% Ferocity IV Increases chance by 12% Ferocity V Increases chance by 16%.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Improved Dodge: &lt;/B&gt;Improves your chance to dodge. Does not stack with other Improved Dodge, only the higher one applies. Certain sources have expressed displeasure with the usefulness of this effect. See Urdegish's note below concerning the actual effect of Improved Dodge and +% Dodge items. Therefore we assume that Improved Dodge and +% Dodge stack since they are infact two different effects that do two different things. Improved Dodge give different effect to different classes based on that classes innate Dodge cap.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Improved Dodge I Increases chance of attempting a Dodge by 10%&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Improved Dodge II -"- 20%&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Improved Dodge III -"- 30%&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Improved Parry:&lt;/B&gt; Improves your chance of parrying. Only applies to classes who have the parry skill. Does not stack with other Improved Parry, only the higher one applies. We can assume that Improved Parry is similar to Improved Dodge and thus affects the Success rate of the actual parry. Therefore the effect should stack with effects that give a percentage increase to the Parry skill.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Improved Parry I Increases chance of attempting a Parry by 10%&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Improved Parry II -"- 20%&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Improved Parry III -"- 30%&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Improved Block&lt;/B&gt; Improves your chance of blocking. Only applies to classes who have the Block skill. Does not stack with other Improved Block, only the higher one applies. See notes on Improved Parry and and Dodge.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Improved Block I Increases chance of attempting a Block by 10%&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Improved Block II -"- 20%&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Improved Block III -"- 30%&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Furious Bash&lt;/B&gt; Increases the hate generated by the Bash skill from 10% to 70%. It does not affect the hit chance for bash (though I believe there are items that increase this skill separately). Only applies to classes who have the Bash skill. Does not stack with other Furious Bash, only the higher one applies. This skill is for tanks who like to be able to use their shield while retaining a high aggro generation.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Furious Bash I increases aggro generated by the Bash skill by 10%&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Furious Bash II&amp;nbsp;-"-&amp;nbsp;20%&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Furious Bash III -"- 30%&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Furious Bash IV -"- 40%&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Furious Bash V -"-50%&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Furious Bash VI -"-60%&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Furious Bash VII -"-70%&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Skill mod: "Skill" +xx%&lt;/B&gt; For reference I also decided to include one example of a skill modifier that affects one of the characters skills. I'm using rogues as an example again. &lt;B&gt;Skill mod: Backstab +12%&lt;/B&gt; is found on the new rogue epic, and affect the skill, not the damage. This effect thus increases your chance to land a backstab, not do more damage. The effect that increases damage is listed in the previous part of the guide. Since this is a percentual skill modifier, it does not stack with itself. If you have two or more pieces with Skill mod: Backstab +xx%, only the highest one will be in effect. There are numerous items that modify different skills this way, for instance the Shaman PoTime BP has a Skill Mod: Specialize Alteration +8%. See Fandele Longtooth's note on lock picking and stacking below. &lt;B&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT size=5&gt;Part 3 - Haste&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;/B&gt;Haste is the original Melee Focus, and has been in the game since day 1. Haste basicly consists of 3 parts. There are a few exceptions to this, but to put it simply Haste is made up from &lt;B&gt;Worn Haste + Haste Spells/Songs + overcap bardsongs&lt;/B&gt;. Worn Haste and Haste spells/normal bard songs have a haste cap of 100%. Some bard songs ignore the cap and if you check lucy you can identify these capless bardsongs with the denotation &lt;B&gt;v3&lt;/B&gt;. Example for Eriki's Psalm of Power "&lt;I&gt;Slot 2: Increase Haste v3 by 30%". &lt;/I&gt;All Bardsongs with the v3 stacks with worn haste and haste spells. Chanter and Shaman haste spells are generally called "Haste v1".&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;For example: &lt;/B&gt;You have a worn haste of 45% and have Speed of Salik cast upon you wich has 68%. You would hit the cap of 100%. You also find yourself with a bard who is playing Eriki's Psalm of Power that adds another 30% v3 haste wich takes you to a total of 130% haste, wich currently is the highest haste you can recieve.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;There are many false ideas on how haste actually works, so let me explain the correct way to interpret haste. If you consider your normal attack speed without any type of haste to be 100% of your attack speed, then full haste makes your attack speed 230% in total. This means you attack 130% more times than if you had no haste. &lt;B&gt;With 130% haste you get 130% more attacks in the same time it took you to make one attack with no haste.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;An example: You attack your opponent with a Reaver wich has a delay of 40 (4 seconds). With 100% haste you land 100% more attacks in the same amount of time, and your delay will thus be 20. If you had a bard with you who played the v3 haste song you would end up with a delay of 14 (1.4 seconds).&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;There are a few items that add overcap haste like the Symbol of the Overlord from Mata Muram and Silverhoop of Speed from Quarm. These have effects with v3 haste and sources indicate that only the highest v3 haste compontent takes effect, so they would only be beneficial in a group without a bard (even if the other components stack, like regen etc).&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;There is also a third type of Haste wich is called v2, and are from old Velious era bard songs. They are subject to the 100% cap, and could be used to bring people up to the 100% cap even if they had no 41% haste item at the time. V2 haste is now more or less obsoloete, but is still in the game.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;There is one more type of haste wich is a Monk discipline. This directly lowers the delay of weapons and is unaffected by haste stacking rules.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT size=5&gt;Part 4 - Attack, AC and Damage &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;To be able to fully understand how some of these effects work, we need to take a look at how AC and Attack really work, and how Damage is calculated. The first thing you need to know is that AC and Attack &lt;B&gt;both conisists of two parts, one part about damage, and one about hit chance.&lt;/B&gt; But in order to understand this better need to start off with melee damage.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Melee Damage:&lt;/B&gt; Brohg writes the following description of melee damage recieved from mobs: &lt;I&gt;"Mob damage is two parts, DB &lt;/I&gt;(Damage Base/Bonus or Fixed Damage /Vig)&lt;I&gt;, and (1-20)*DI, which is Damage Interval. You can see this by parsing, that there are 20 discrete amounts of damage any mob can deal on a successful hit. It's not quite /random 1 20, because AC makes a big huge difference in how many low hits you have, but you still have the whole range. If a mob has a damage base of 200, and a damage interval of 20, then (once they hit you) they'll deal either 220 damage, or 240, 260... etc ... 580, or 600 damage." "High AC &lt;/I&gt;(from gear /Vig)&lt;I&gt; reduces the damage taken from the (1-20)*DI portion a lot, making many more low #*DI than high."&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;So all melee damage has two parts, one wich is random and affected by the AC on your gear, and one part that is never modified by AC. The Shielding effect in particular is extra interesting heresince Shielding affects only the Fixed Damage (and is the only thing that affects it), not the random Damage Interval.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Armor Class:&lt;/B&gt; Armor Class is what decides how much damage you take and how often you take damage. It mitigates damage and it makes the mob miss it's attacks against you. The first part of the AC is "mitigation AC" wich is calculated from the worn AC you gain from your gear. Taraddar writes: &lt;I&gt;"Your "mitigation" ac comes from the AC on your gear and is what effects the distribution you get in the 1-20 portion of attacks. Higher ac gets more lower hits etc."&lt;/I&gt; This means that the gear you wear decides how much of the random part ie Damage Interval (as described above) of the damage coming your way actually hits you.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The other part of AC is the "avoidance AC" wich is defined by your Defense Skill and your AGI stat. Taraddar writes: &lt;I&gt;"Normally your defense skill and agility contribute to your "avoidance" ac and increase your chance of being missed. AC from gear doesn't effect this at all."&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Attack:&lt;/B&gt; Attack, like AC, is also composed of two parts. One is based on your Strength and wielded weapon to decided how hard you hit the mob when you connect. Let's call this Power. Brohg writes: &lt;I&gt;The Power part of Attack is how hard you hit, when you hit. No amount of power will raise your max hit, but those who are familiar with the (1-20)*DI nature of Everquest damage will understand that shifting your average hits higher on the 1-20 scale will lead to much more overall damage. This is what Power does. Power is modified by Offense skill, Strength score, and +ATK mods on items. In combat, Power is opposed by the target's Mitigation.&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The other part of Attack decides how often you hit. This is based on your weapon skills. We can also safely assume that your Offense skill is also one part of the calculation. Again, Brohg teaches us: &lt;I&gt;"Displayed "Attack" is Accuracy+Power. Accuracy is how likely one is to hit one's target, and in combat is compared to the Avoidance part of AC (more on that later). Accuracy comes from two sources, Weapon Skills and +Accuracy mods on items."&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT size=5&gt;Notes and Trivia&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;B&gt;Taraddar's note on how it used to be in Beta:&lt;/B&gt; On ac (attack too). Each used to be 2 seperate values. One for chance to hit or avoid hit and one for how hard you hit or got hit but apparently in beta they decided that was to confusing and just combined them into one number.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Orruar's note on Percentage mods:&lt;/B&gt; Rule of thumb: Any % mods that affect skills you can find in your skills window do not stack. &lt;B&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Urdegish's note on Improved Dodge and Dodge modifiers:&lt;/B&gt; Improved Dodge increases your chance of triggering a dodge. +% Dodge increases your chance of a sucessful dodge. As Brohg said, the best mod of each works, and they are not the same and therefore both have an affect when worn.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Fandele Longtooth's note on lock pick and stacking:&lt;/B&gt; Lockpick modifiers do indeed stack, but in a very unique way. Modifiers that are equipped will not stack with each other, but a % mod that is HELD on the cursor will stack with worn mods. In order to pick a lock, the rogue needs to have their lockpicks held on their cursor to perform the action. My rogue, with 210 base lockpick skill, raises it to 216 while cheirometric lockpick device (3% mod) is equipped in the hand slot. I can now pick up mechanized lockpicks (2% mod) on to my cursor and go to 220 lockpick skill. Easily seen these days with the new green print in the skill window.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <title>secondary delays</title>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Ok, first off I've heard SEVERAL times that secondary delays dont matter, no problem there. but has anyone noticed a lesser chance to double attack with a high delay secondary, or is it just me?&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>make rogue to get quest items?</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=roguetactic&amp;message.id=724#M724</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I am looking for some quest items specifically royal kromiff blood and read that a rogue can pickpocket it.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;My question is -- if I made a rogue and got him up to level 10 or so and maxxed pickpocketting, what are the odds that I could succeed?&amp;nbsp; zero?&amp;nbsp; one in ten?&amp;nbsp; one in a hundred?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;What stat governs pickpocketting?&amp;nbsp; dex or agility?&amp;nbsp; And, what races/dieties if any would make me non-KOS in Kael?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;thanks&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>General V`Ghera and Stano's head</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=roguetactic&amp;message.id=718#M718</link>
      <description>My little rogue (56) had gotten herself up to the final fight and during my research I came across the Guise of the Coercer quest.  It gave me pause and a question.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If I spawn the general, can I (and others) hand him heads and get multiple masks?  Or does he despawn after the first turnin?</description>
