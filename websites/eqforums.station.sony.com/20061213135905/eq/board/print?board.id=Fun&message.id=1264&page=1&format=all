				<DIV>EQ Romace?&nbsp; How revolting!&nbsp; LOL j/k</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I've met some women on here who've become really close friends of mine, but none I'd date.&nbsp; I find it hard to trust very many ppl I talk to onilne lol.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Probably the closest I got to it was when I was grouped with a Warrior on Bertox.&nbsp; She had just got done helping me kill Maligar.&nbsp; We were having some problems within the guild and we were both pretty mad since we were officers.&nbsp; She logs on her Druid and we group again.&nbsp; She ports us to Grimling Forest and we sit down and just have a long conversation starting with problems in the guild.&nbsp; Then it goes to RL stuff like problems we're having with our significant others or whatnot.&nbsp; Was kinda cool...I never really connected with someone in game like that.&nbsp; But like I said before, we're just satisfied with being good friends since we both have someone we're seeing RL.</DIV>

<DIV><FONT face=Verdana>I started playing in mid 2000 with my then boyfriend, and he was always deciding "when, where, what" to play in game and would get upset if I logged on to get exp. without him.&nbsp; So, still being relatively new to the game and wanting to explore more, I began a new character, a shaman.&nbsp; She rapidly became my main, as I realized I utterly and truly loved the class. It wasn't long before the boyfriend sucked me into his small&nbsp;guild where I made several new friends.&nbsp; As I leveled up and researched more, I was very hopeful that I would&nbsp;to be able to do my epic quest.&nbsp; I tried to recruit the help of some guildmates but everyone was busy and uninterested so I decided to go it alone (being always a very solitary player).&nbsp; Now, back before maps&nbsp;I was <STRONG>constantly </STRONG>(geographical dysfunction is my specialty)&nbsp;getting lost, and when it got to the part where I had to go to Rathe Mountains, I had no idea how to get there, so late one night I asked a fellow guildmate that I did not know well for directions, a ranger about 20 levels higher than myself.&nbsp; </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Verdana></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Verdana>Said ranger and I kept talking and became friends, really seeming to connect.&nbsp; Shortly thereafter, the guild had some problems and&nbsp;fell apart, and I was sorely disallusioned with the leader, who was also good friends with the ranger.&nbsp; After I left guild, the ranger and I&nbsp;had a miscommunication -- I thought he was angry with my comments to the guild leader and so I sadly gave up and stopped talking to him.&nbsp; In reality, due to RL situations, he was offline a lot and didn't get time to explain.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Verdana></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Verdana>Many months later, I bumped into him running around with some mutual friends, and he had changed guilds.&nbsp; We chatted a bit and cleared up the miscommunication and I always had a warm and happy feeling while chatting with him.&nbsp; He had a habit of sneaking up behind me in random zones and&nbsp;"ninja hugging" and running off. &nbsp;At the same time, my relationship came apart at the seams and ended.&nbsp; </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Verdana></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Verdana>One night he bumped into me and said he "was about to go get eaten by a dragon" (hehe) and&nbsp;we kept chatting....and I made a naughty statement, and the conversation rapidly took a turn for the&nbsp;personal.&nbsp; A few nights later,&nbsp;as we were continuing to get to know each other, we moved the conversation to the phone.&nbsp; Over the next 2-3 weeks, there were very few nights where we&nbsp;couldn't be found on the phone talking the night away and coming to realize that we both were completely and endlessly in love with one another.&nbsp; He made me laugh and every moment spent talking to him were the happiest of my life.&nbsp; A few weeks later he mailed me&nbsp;his air force&nbsp;ring&nbsp;as a token of his&nbsp;love.&nbsp; Almost exactly 4 months after we professed our love to one&nbsp;another, he moved to where I was living at the time.&nbsp;&nbsp; We had never met in person before he moved but literally spent over 13,000 minutes each month talking to each other before he got here.&nbsp; The phone company was&nbsp;glad when he moved.&nbsp; We spent every spare moment together as I finished college and graduated, and 3&nbsp;months later we got married&nbsp;in Vegas.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Verdana></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Verdana>He&nbsp;is&nbsp;the light of my life and we are&nbsp;looking forward to celebrating our 2nd wedding anniversary in a couple months.&nbsp; We love each other more each day, and our characters still play together to this day.&nbsp;Truth is stranger than fiction, and when I found my soulmate,&nbsp;it was&nbsp;just <STRONG>right</STRONG>, and everything&nbsp;fell into place. </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Verdana></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Verdana>I never would have thought to look for love in EQ but it found me in the form of some excellent directions to Rathe Mountains.</FONT></DIV><BR><A href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1095662&amp;resize=true" target=_blank><B>Ladikennoch Mactiretreibh</FONT></B></A><BR>Barbarian Prophet and Mistress of Alchemy Quellious Server<BR><FONT color=#800080><B>"....be nice to me and I'll take off this chain armor and show you my frosty nips!"</FONT></B><BR><A href="http://thenoob.keenspace.com/d/20050207.html" target=_blank>"With all due respect, but you, sir, are a twatwaffle!"</A>
