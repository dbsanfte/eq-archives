&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;Sprite -&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; Welcome to the another great Stratics house of commons with the developers of EverQuest! Tonight's topic will center on the recently launched expansion: Depths of Darkhollow, so please focus your questions on this. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sprite -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Please send those questions to [QT]Brekkee - to do so type /msg [QT]NICK My question here. Please only send questions to our QT's as those sent to myself or the developers will not make it into the lineup. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sprite -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; The full logs will be posted on http://eq.stratics.com after the chat. We'll begin with a quick intro from our guests...now would be a good time to send in those questions! &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Rashere -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Good evening everyone. Thanks for coming. I'm Travis McGeathy, lead designer for EverQuest. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Maddoc -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Welcome to the chat. I'm Jason Mash, one of the Assistant Lead Designers for the EverQuest Team. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Rytan -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Greetings! I’m Ryan Barker an assistant lead designer for EverQuest. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Prathun -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Greetings folks! I'm Jonathan Caraker, Game Designer for EverQuest. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Zajeer-Dev -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Hi, I'm Camille Abdnor, itemization designer for EverQuest &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Kytherea -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Hello, I'm Christina Delzer the Community Relations Manager for EverQuest &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Zorillius -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Greetings everyone and thanks being apart of the chat. I'm Craig Knapp, Producer for EverQuest. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sprite -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *Tavaran-TM* Where did the creators of this expansion receive their inspiration for the lore/zones/encounters? This expansion has been very compelling. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Rashere -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Late nights and lots of caffeine. :) Seriously, though, Darkhollow is an area of the game that we've been wanting to explore and gave us a great opportunity to return to our roots. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sprite -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *Kataran* we have all saw that the spirt shrouds have no gear is there a chance gear drops can be added later maybe in oldercontent zones and older gear so that they can be made a little stronger while keeping them weaker than normal players? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Rytan -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Spirit shroud characters are generally not intended to have gear associated with them beyond the few pieces they currently start with. The bonuses that would normally be on equipment are already figured into the base statistics for the various templates. There’s several technical issue with giving shrouds equipment that can be moved between shrouds, so we’d be more likely to add shrouds later on that have higher base stats and/or abilities &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sprite -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *Cinexa* Greetings ~ can you give us an idea approximately what % of DoDH is undiscovered so far? Seems to be going along pretty quickly and I wonder if it's faster or slower than you predicted the high end people would discover / win? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Prathun -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; The raid content of Darkhollow has been consumed at a rapid rate, but this was to be expected considering that the top guilds are already saturated with end-game gear and have been waiting for new raid content for awhile. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Prathun -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Which isn't to say that I wasn't surprised by how fast players have gotten through the content. I'm always amazed at what raiding organizations can accomplish when they devote all their time and energy to a task. :) &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Prathun -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; As far as the percentage goes.. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Prathun -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; There are 6 raids and events required to gain access to the end zone, and there's much more than that within the end zone. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Prathun -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; So ... you're 33% done! &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Rytan -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; it's actually closer to 34.57% Prathun. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Prathun -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Repeating, of course. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sprite -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *Nolrog* When will we see the next round of tradeskill changes, that we've been expecting now for a long time? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Maddoc -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; We just pushed out one round of tradeskill changes (re-evaluating the stats on the cultural tradeskilled armor), which wasn't a small task, which means we're starting to look at some of the other stuff on your plate. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Maddoc -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; There's a few other things we're looking at, like balacing out some of the components on the cultural armor, which will be the next round we push out. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sprite -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *Loral* Good evening. There have been a fair number of complaints about the loot in DoD, particularly the loot rewarded on Missions. Are there plans to address the lower reward for the risk? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Zajeer-Dev -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; I’ve began to look at some of the missions and have made some adjustments to some of the item rewards for some of the missions. The issues players might be seeing are two-sided; some of the items were under-tuned for the missions they were targeted for and some of the missions themselves were over-tuned in difficulty. I plan on looking at both the reward system and the difficulty of the missions and make adjustments accordingly. However &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sprite -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *RogobFR* The run to Dreadspire Keep is not necessarily long, however, it can be relatively unsafe with all of the see invis, plus the Exiled drachnid. Was the zone in design intended to be this risky? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Prathun -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; There is another, safer, way to enter Dreadspire Keep but it requires having spent a little time hunting in Dreadspire itself. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Prathun -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; At the same time, I have noticed the zone-ins and zone-outs of Dreadspire are a bit harsh and I'll keep an eye on that. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sprite -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *SinisterDeath* Are there any plans to continue with the class re-invinsioning, now that DoD is released? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Rashere -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Class balance is an ongoing process and not something that really ever stops. There will be more changes coming in the near future. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sprite -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *Loral* Will we be seeing more monster missions before the next expansion? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Rytan -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; We will most likely be adding more monster missions in the near future. We don’t have a specific schedule for them right now though. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sprite -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; For those of you just joining us, tonight's topic is the recently launched expansion: Depths of Darkhollow. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sprite -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Please send your questions to [QT]Brekkee, questions sent to myself or the devs will not make it into the lineup. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sprite -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *jimmay* are there any plans to re-tune some of the "progression" encounters? possible that some of them were made a bit more difficult than intended, requiring far too many of a certain class in order to beat them? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Zajeer-Dev -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Keridon and I have been keeping a close eye on the Hive Queen encounter and also, with the help of Prathun, are looking at some of the other progression raids to make sure they are tuned appropriately. The access to the final zone of the expansion should be difficult, and we’re committed to getting them to that state. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sprite -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *slacklikeme-DB-DRo* Are the quests like Destroy the Bloodwings and Dredged Drachnids just little bonus things to increase the incentive to move around and not camp the same place all the time? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Rashere -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; There are a variety of little tasks and quests scattered throughout the zone including the ones you mentioned. They're there to provide a little extra something to do in the zone and give you a little extra reward for taking the time to complete them. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sprite -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *Nolrog* Since the new expansion takes us back to many of the old zones (a feature that I love by the way) is there any chance that we will see the graphics updated in them? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Rytan -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; We are definitely planning on redoing as much old zone art as time allows. We have several zones in the works that should be out in the near future. We’ve taken the feedback we’ve received from the Lavastorm and Nektulos updated and hope to improve on the aspects that players were displeased with in those zones. Overall we hope to make full use of the new graphics engine to augment EQ as much as possible. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sprite -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *Cinexa* Ok not to belabor high end raiding too much but here goes -- is that mytical 66% all finished and in tip top shape for us to tackle? *giggles &amp;amp; runs off* &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Prathun -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Despite our best efforts to replicate it, the raiding environment on Beta is not identical to that of Live servers. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Prathun -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; This means that tuning changes for end-game content should be expected, when it's more apparent how real guilds are faring on the raid encounters. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Prathun -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; But functionality-wise, everything should be good to go, and I appreciate the time that our beta testers devoted to getting these encounters as close to perfect as possible. Thank you! &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sprite -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *SinisterDeath* Are there any plans to update/add new illusions for enchanters to cast? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Zajeer-Dev -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; We’re definitely going to think about more enchanter illusions in the future and also possibly additional bard/rogue illusion masks. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sprite -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *Loral* Are there plans to add more spirit shrouds? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Rytan -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; We’ll likely be adding new spirit shrouds in the future. They’re relatively easy to add now that we have the full system in place. The only things that’s somewhat difficult is the model selection in global memory. We can’t add every NPC to the global file so we have to be careful about adding new models. Having variations on existing models is definitely doable though. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sprite -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *Loral* Recently the access quest to Dreadspire has been discovered and posted. Were you expecting it to take longer? What sort of player was this access quest intended for level / gear-wise? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Prathun -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Dreadspire Keep in Darkhollow is comparable to what Sebilis was in Kunark. It's end-game, but with the expectation that single groups will be able to complete the key quest, tour the zone, and camp for items that are an upgrade over what is available in Riftseeker's. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Prathun -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; As far as the expectations, I think it took about as long as it should have to figure out the access quest and distribute it. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Prathun -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; I'm hoping to see more players spending time in Dreadspire Keep soon. It's not just for raids. :) &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sprite -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *jimmay* is it safe to say that we can expect challenges in line with omm/vish in the end of DoD? or somewhere in the same creative vein? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Rashere -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; We try to do something a bit different with each raid so I wouldn't expect the same type of fights, but there's a lot of raid content that hasn't been touched yet and all of it should be extremely challenging. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800080&gt;* Prathun cackles evilly. *&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sprite -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *slacklikeme-DB-DRo* Are evolving items meant to be as slow as they currently are being reported as? I have heard of the symbiote ring taking upwards of 6aas of XP to get around 18 pct into the starting level. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Zajeer-Dev -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Evolving items and intelligent items both are supposed to take quite a while to level up - we were planning on these items taking weeks to fully level up. With intelligent items specifically, we wanted those to take even longer, so players got to see most of the texts associated with those items. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Zajeer-Dev -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Comparing AA experience to evolving item experience won’t do you much - both systems work differently in terms of advancement. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sprite -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *SinisterDeath* In DoD, the beta sign ups where rather messy at best, and were at very odd times. Are there any plans, in the case of a new expansion to improve the beta sign up proccess? I know a few of us would have loved to actually test beta, but weren't on at the right time to catch the message about beta sign ups, nor able to get there fast enough.. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Zorillius -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Beta signups in particular is something we've discussed internally since the release of DoD. We of course want to keep beta exclusive to players that are willing to work closely with development and give us open and honest feedback, as well as catch bugs. Nothing has been decided yet on how to improve signups, but we will improve on this process if another expansion ever comes. :) &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sprite -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; That will wrap it up for tonight. I’d like to thank the developers for coming! The log for tonight’s chat will be up shortly on http://eq.stratics.com &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sprite -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Thank you all for joining us! You can join #EverQuest to chat more about the game. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Rytan -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Thanks for coming everyone! &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Rashere -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Thanks for coming folks. Have a great evening. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Maddoc -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Thanks for coming everyone! :) &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Zorillius -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Thanks for coming everyone! &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Kytherea -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Thanks for joining us everyone! &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Prathun -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; G'night and thanks for attending. :) &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Zajeer-Dev -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Thanks everyone &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

Are there plans to address the lower reward for the risk? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Zajeer-Dev -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; I’ve began to look at some of the missions and have made some adjustments to some of the item rewards for some of the missions. The issues players might be seeing are two-sided; some of the items were under-tuned for the missions they were targeted for and some of the missions themselves were over-tuned in difficulty. I plan on looking at both the reward system and the difficulty of the missions and make adjustments accordingly. However &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sprite -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *RogobFR* The run to Dreadspire Keep is not necessarily long, however, it can be relatively unsafe with all of the see invis, plus the Exiled drachnid. Was the zone in design intended to be this risky? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Prathun -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; There is another, safer, way to enter Dreadspire Keep but it requires having spent a little time hunting in Dreadspire itself. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Prathun -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; At the same time, I have noticed the zone-ins and zone-outs of Dreadspire are a bit harsh and I'll keep an eye on that. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sprite -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *SinisterDeath* Are there any plans to continue with the class re-invinsioning, now that DoD is released? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Rashere -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Class balance is an ongoing process and not something that really ever stops. There will be more changes coming in the near future. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sprite -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *Loral* Will we be seeing more monster missions before the next expansion? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Rytan -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; We will most likely be adding more monster missions in the near future. We don’t have a specific schedule for them right now though. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sprite -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; For those of you just joining us, tonight's topic is the recently launched expansion: Depths of Darkhollow. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sprite -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Please send your questions to [QT]Brekkee, questions sent to myself or the devs will not make it into the lineup. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sprite -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *jimmay* are there any plans to re-tune some of the "progression" encounters? possible that some of them were made a bit more difficult than intended, requiring far too many of a certain class in order to beat them? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Zajeer-Dev -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Keridon and I have been keeping a close eye on the Hive Queen encounter and also, with the help of Prathun, are looking at some of the other progression raids to make sure they are tuned appropriately. The access to the final zone of the expansion should be difficult, and we’re committed to getting them to that state. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sprite -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *slacklikeme-DB-DRo* Are the quests like Destroy the Bloodwings and Dredged Drachnids just little bonus things to increase the incentive to move around and not camp the same place all the time? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Rashere -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; There are a variety of little tasks and quests scattered throughout the zone including the ones you mentioned. They're there to provide a little extra something to do in the zone and give you a little extra reward for taking the time to complete them. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sprite -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *Nolrog* Since the new expansion takes us back to many of the old zones (a feature that I love by the way) is there any chance that we will see the graphics updated in them? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Rytan -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; We are definitely planning on redoing as much old zone art as time allows. We have several zones in the works that should be out in the near future. We’ve taken the feedback we’ve received from the Lavastorm and Nektulos updated and hope to improve on the aspects that players were displeased with in those zones. Overall we hope to make full use of the new graphics engine to augment EQ as much as possible. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sprite -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *Cinexa* Ok not to belabor high end raiding too much but here goes -- is that mytical 66% all finished and in tip top shape for us to tackle? *giggles &amp;amp; runs off* &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Prathun -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Despite our best efforts to replicate it, the raiding environment on Beta is not identical to that of Live servers. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Prathun -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; This means that tuning changes for end-game content should be expected, when it's more apparent how real guilds are faring on the raid encounters. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Prathun -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; But functionality-wise, everything should be good to go, and I appreciate the time that our beta testers devoted to getting these encounters as close to perfect as possible. Thank you! &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sprite -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *SinisterDeath* Are there any plans to update/add new illusions for enchanters to cast? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Zajeer-Dev -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; We’re definitely going to think about more enchanter illusions in the future and also possibly additional bard/rogue illusion masks. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sprite -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *Loral* Are there plans to add more spirit shrouds? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Rytan -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; We’ll likely be adding new spirit shrouds in the future. They’re relatively easy to add now that we have the full system in place. The only things that’s somewhat difficult is the model selection in global memory. We can’t add every NPC to the global file so we have to be careful about adding new models. Having variations on existing models is definitely doable though. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sprite -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *Loral* Recently the access quest to Dreadspire has been discovered and posted. Were you expecting it to take longer? What sort of player was this access quest intended for level / gear-wise? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Prathun -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Dreadspire Keep in Darkhollow is comparable to what Sebilis was in Kunark. It's end-game, but with the expectation that single groups will be able to complete the key quest, tour the zone, and camp for items that are an upgrade over what is available in Riftseeker's. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Prathun -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; As far as the expectations, I think it took about as long as it should have to figure out the access quest and distribute it. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Prathun -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; I'm hoping to see more players spending time in Dreadspire Keep soon. It's not just for raids. :) &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sprite -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *jimmay* is it safe to say that we can expect challenges in line with omm/vish in the end of DoD? or somewhere in the same creative vein? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Rashere -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; We try to do something a bit different with each raid so I wouldn't expect the same type of fights, but there's a lot of raid content that hasn't been touched yet and all of it should be extremely challenging. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800080&gt;* Prathun cackles evilly. *&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sprite -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *slacklikeme-DB-DRo* Are evolving items meant to be as slow as they currently are being reported as? I have heard of the symbiote ring taking upwards of 6aas of XP to get around 18 pct into the starting level. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Zajeer-Dev -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Evolving items and intelligent items both are supposed to take quite a while to level up - we were planning on these items taking weeks to fully level up. With intelligent items specifically, we wanted those to take even longer, so players got to see most of the texts associated with those items. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Zajeer-Dev -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Comparing AA experience to evolving item experience won’t do you much - both systems work differently in terms of advancement. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sprite -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; *SinisterDeath* In DoD, the beta sign ups where rather messy at best, and were at very odd times. Are there any plans, in the case of a new expansion to improve the beta sign up proccess? I know a few of us would have loved to actually test beta, but weren't on at the right time to catch the message about beta sign ups, nor able to get there fast enough.. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Zorillius -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Beta signups in particular is something we've discussed internally since the release of DoD. We of course want to keep beta exclusive to players that are willing to work closely with development and give us open and honest feedback, as well as catch bugs. Nothing has been decided yet on how to improve signups, but we will improve on this process if another expansion ever comes. :) &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sprite -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; That will wrap it up for tonight. I’d like to thank the developers for coming! The log for tonight’s chat will be up shortly on http://eq.stratics.com &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sprite -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Thank you all for joining us! You can join #EverQuest to chat more about the game. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Rytan -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Thanks for coming everyone! &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Rashere -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Thanks for coming folks. Have a great evening. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Maddoc -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Thanks for coming everyone! :) &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Zorillius -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Thanks for coming everyone! &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Kytherea -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Thanks for joining us everyone! &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Prathun -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; G'night and thanks for attending. :) &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000a0&gt;&lt;B&gt;Zajeer-Dev -&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Thanks everyone &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
