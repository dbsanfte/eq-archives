      <description>ok kids, lets talk about the 1 class that has been screwed over and ingnored from the very begining. The paladin is by far the worst in terms of the GAME not just pvp, sure a good paladin can keep from dying in a battle only to get away not kill the other player.  Our stuns do not hit 95% of the time, out heals are not mana effective for pvp. Root never sticks we have no offencive spells. our dps is horrible.  sure we can go toe to toe with a int caster but good luck trying to get one of those little buggers to stand still and against a melee class we have no chance.  lets stop talking about fixing int casters they  WIZ, MAG, NECRO are all feared in pvp ok maybe the ENC needs alittle work but thats it. &lt;br&gt;what needs fixing in pvp are in order&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1.  Paladins first and foremost&lt;br&gt;2.  Enchanters&lt;br&gt;3.  shadowknights&lt;br&gt;4.  rogues&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;lol mages are not feared in pvp. but why are sk's complaining they are one of the best pvp classes and always have been. only classes that should be complaining is caster healing potions infusion melee hitting almost as hard as wizard nukes but without the bother of standing still or interuptions or resists.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;ok first the person who put paladin, ummm are you kidding?   mages and encs are pretty bad in pvp, but with some new aa's mages are starting to do a little dmg again.   Sk's i dont care what anyone says, its really hard to be effective in pvp.   And yes thats fine i did put issues list in the title, so come state your issues dont sit there and bash the one i brought up thanks.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;There's no doubt in my mind Pinhedd that enchanters need pvp help as well, infact they need a lot of help.  This is blindingly appearant by the lack of chanters on Zek.  Most chanters are just boxed twinks now on raids, barely any play anymore on Zek and that can be directly attributed to the fact that most enchanters are sick to death of being flattened like road kill in PvP.  Blackheart isn't posting here for YOUR problems however, he's here pleading the plight of HIS class's problems.  Maybe, instead of posting your complains HERE on a SHADOWKNIGHT thread you should try starting a thread for YOUR class voicing YOUR class's short-comings and YOUR class's wants to make YOUR class better in PvP.  Just a friendly suggestion .....</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subject says issues list. Its a bit misleading if this is supposed to be about sk's only, but if it is it probably wouldnt hurt to put it in the Sk's forum. Further to that point if its here because its a pvp issue, why then can pinnhead not put the enchanter pvp issues he has that should be addressed with the issues list?  If threads are started for every wounded pvp class nobody would read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Truth be told, the issue probably wont get looked at no matter where he puts it. Just my 2cp.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>The obivious response is to use your **SMURF** sword... it hits for 200-500+ a pop and doesnt get resisted, dispelled, ect... SKs are powerful enough as it is, not like we need to make their lifetaps unresistable when they basically got the equivalant of manaburn on an instant click.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; obviously you have no idea how the high end game is,   first our spells are resisted 2 outta 4 times easily.   and when our heal lands it hits for max say like 500 so thats a 500 point heal, for 395mana.   now im not the best geared but i have bout 9700mana.   so a wizard nukes me with the new fire spell and i have bout 490fr it usually lands for 2100-2300.   now i would have to cast 395x 8 just to get at max 2k hps back.   so thats fair?   that makes it ok?  our lifetaps are not lure and are not unresistable so learn some info before you post again pls.</description>

&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;obviously you dont play an int caster. First, my nukes (Enchanter) are resisted 3/4 times EASILY, have a 6 second cast time, so channeling them is difficult as is, and when it does land, it may do 300 damage, if I'm lucky, I may crit for 700-800. I have no way to heal myself at all, runes are easily broken, I have far far less HP than you do, and to boot, I take far harder hits. I have access to, and do play a Qvic/Tavci/Anguish geared Warrior so yes I do know what high end PvP is like.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Chanters ancients seem to land decently, and also rapture is unresistable.  Chanters teamed with people make them pretty deadly i'm not sure how you can complain.  Sk's do have a very valid complaint.  Our lifetaps are WORTHLESS in pvp.  The only real chance we have of healing ourselves is if you're lucky enough to have a 1.5  or 2.0 clicky. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Sk's really need their taps looked at.  I honestly think we should get our taps damage increased along with a better resist mod but I know that will never happen.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;HT is also a joke in pvp now.  Wow it does a whole 4-5k dmg ....how many players now a days dont' have over 10k hps..a ht at 40% isn't likely to drop many people except int casters and with so many runes and other spell rune buffs you'll be lucky to drop them. &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;an HT at 40% will drop almost anyone save a warrior. Even though Enchanters can be deadly due to Raptures/Dispells, they're easily dispatched. By the way, all the Enchanter OOW nukes have the same resist rates, the DOD Coloured Chaos is actually resisted more and the PoP/GoD nukes more so than the OOW nukes. I'm not saying not to take a look at SK lifetaps, but that other classes need help more so.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I took a crit DT for 5400 and lived thanks to delay death, SK was like **SMURF** and refused to fight me after until his HT was back up.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;SKs are just fine as is, I'd worry about fixing int casters first</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'll have to agree with Blackheart quite a bit on this when he says that some work needs to be done.  Now I do understand that SK's aren't hurting as much as some other classes in PvP right now when it comes to taking down an enemy or survivability.  There are quite a few classes that have to resort to just running in circles trying to survive a PvP encounter while a few chosen classes wreak havoc amongst the scattered masses.  HT will be the primary arguement that everyone will throw back in our face, but I'd gladly give my HT up if it meant I could get &lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;much improved&lt;/u&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;checks on my taps / dots / snare.  In a world where everyone has 10k HP and heal potions, a SK's melee damage just simply isn't enough especially considering defensive AA abilities that all classes have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heals can't be resisted in PvP yet Taps are and only heal for 1/4 the damage that a decent heal does and that's stretching it.  Its my opinion that taps should land much more than they do now, keep the damage the same but code the heal return equal to 100% of the original intended damage.  That is 66% damage to the nuke / 100% to the heal,  a tap that would do 600 would damage for 400 but heal for 600.  Is this really that hard to do ? &lt;/p&gt;</description>
