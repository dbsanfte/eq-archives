    <description>As far as "original purpose" most of the Charms I have seen still are non-constant.&amp;nbsp; Whether they are based on Gear worn, Weight Carried, Time in a Zone or the most constant Languages Known they all seem very clearly in the same family as "how much cloth armor you wore".&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; While these all have higher potentials than the original I dont think they "bastardize" the original concept at all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As far as augments for the slot, the reason people dont want to spend "months in Loast Dungeons" might be because they dont enjoy it and its old.&amp;nbsp; New content, new rewards, not a new concept.&amp;nbsp; Theoretically, if they could code it, theres no reason the Charm Slot Augs couldnt use the same mechanic, a variable based upon some condition.&amp;nbsp; The original Poster is only concerened with theoretical potentials.&amp;nbsp; I doubt he(she) would turn away from a charm with a potential equal to a non charm aug's stats but based on a charm's cariable mechanic of its own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The most amusing thing here is really your tone.&amp;nbsp; You obviously loathe raid content and the people who enjoy it, hence the name calling.&amp;nbsp; I'm not sure why you think raiding is a shortcut, but as far as I can see, its no shorter than LDoN would be assuming they didnt place the augs on the first raid level mobs within the content.&amp;nbsp; My guild raids 6 days a week 5ish hours a day, I could finish many LDoNs in this time if thats what I thought was fun.&amp;nbsp; However, I dont enjoy them, I enjoy raiding new content with scripts that make the events seem odd compared to me joining some people and mass slaughtering 100 mobs in a dungeon repeatedly.&amp;nbsp; That just doesnt amuse me after doing the few in each area that I have done.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the end the OP simply posted their opinion that the Devs add more powerful augment options via raiding like they have for pretty much every other item slot in the game.&amp;nbsp; I am happy with my DoDH charm aug, but I wouldnt refuse the ability to raid for better augs either.&amp;nbsp; I personally think the Charm slot should be given over to the Tradeskillers, with each different skill making a different style of Charm, and the "best" Charms be aquired via people making attunable items and selling them&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;You raiders don't do enough non-raid content in the game in my opinion.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Simply to give raiders the option of purchasing the items. Every single item in EQ has raid equivalent items that are superior to single group, solo items. Personally I see no reason to drift from this trend especially since there are items presently in the game for charm slots from raid encounters.&amp;nbsp; Subsequently flagging additional charms would not be overpowering. In reality this would help players plan their gear a lot more effectively as well as potentially ease some of the headaches for those responsible for itemization. I know I would appreciate less frustration as a player and assuredly would feel likewise if&amp;nbsp;I were responsible for itemization.&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;To reply to the second quote; In order to even raid the end zones of TSS requires TONS of grouping and solo tasks. This is yet another valid point to introduce raid level charm augs. Especially since the best charm aug to date, minus the Queen Sendaii and Emperor Draygun augs,&amp;nbsp; was from LDoN which is how many expansions ago? :smileytongue:&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by MythSR on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;12-12-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;09:36 PM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;How many of you people complaining have a maxed LDoN Charm aug? I was the first person on my server to finish the Wayfarers charm - and I did it in a mix of guild groups and pick up groups. I have no problem with having a new charm aug that is attainable to everyone, regardless of tier.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I was the top Ranger in the top guild on my server when I did the LDoN aug - and my closest competition was from non-raiders. We might need to redefine "Casual and Raider" into "Hardcore and non-Hardcore" players. I know tons of hardcore players who never raid. I know even more raiders that play extremely casually. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;EQ is a social game. Devs and content designers want to see players interact with each other. That is why this game was created, and still exists. Meet people, work together for a common goal, and gain the rewards of that teamwork. Don't be offended if an aug is added that is doable by non-raiders as well as raiders. One aug isn't going to suddenly close the gap in risk vs reward for your overall gear profiles.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;You can still use guild-only groups to achieve the reward - you don't have to socialize with new folks if you don't want to. But having the option to do so is nice, and that option is&amp;nbsp;the foundation upon which this great game was built. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>Zajeer your are forgetting how much time raiding takes each day, especially for players in "hardcore" raiding guilds. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Raiders do 1 group content quite a bit, but they do it outside of their official raiding times in doses they want. How much time out of raid people have veries quite a bit. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just don't make the mistake you did with TSS again and FORCE raiders to do excessive ammount of non raiding content when you design raid progression. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you make good grup content with uniq rewards raiders will come and do the content alot (dodh anyone?). Just make sure the content is fun also. =P&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Back to charm augs ....it's about time LDoN aug is retired as the best one available.&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Meph-AB on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;12-13-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;07:52 AM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

      <description>I tend to agree that charm augs should come from non-raid content.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Unfortunatly, the raiders doing non-raider comment you made - I'm not&#xD;
challenged in any way by non-raid content.&amp;nbsp; It's not really fun&#xD;
for me to do it, other than if required to get a reward.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
The best part of EQ grouping for raiders shouldn't be a carrot - it&#xD;
should also include fun, challenge, excitement, risk, etc.&amp;nbsp; I&#xD;
played on progression for quite awhile with friends.&amp;nbsp; We had hella&#xD;
fun times levels 15-55 taking on hard content where death was a very&#xD;
large risk.&amp;nbsp; Where we were constantly challenged.&amp;nbsp; Despite&#xD;
the fact that I did that content 7+ years ago, and I was on low&#xD;
level/new/gimp toons - it was still fun just to be challenged.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
That simply does not exist in today's group game for us as raiders, and&#xD;
I shouldn't have to switch to some character besides my main to&#xD;
experience it in a groups etting.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Theres a reason 90% of my guild logs on only for raids.&amp;nbsp; The other&#xD;
10% - its pretty much powersources only atm.&amp;nbsp; It's sort of sad -&#xD;
because we've all had tons of fun at one point being challenged in the&#xD;
group game - but not anytime recently really.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
So what am I trying to say in regards to your comment?&amp;nbsp; Just that&#xD;
I'm refuting your comment about raiders not being in enough group&#xD;
content.&amp;nbsp; It's entirely true, but your reasoning for it is that&#xD;
there isn't rewards for it (partially true).&amp;nbsp; Instead, its more of&#xD;
- theres no fun/challenge in it, in addition to being no reward.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

      <description>Because this would bring "Charm" Inventory slot items with Augmentation slots into the same line as the other 20 equiment slots which have items with aug slots that you can either fill via grouping for an aug with "group level" stats, or raid for an aug with "raid level" stats?&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;I think that charm augs are purposely confined to group/solo quests, in order to "promote" various things, such as questing, grouping, and exploring new expansions. I think this is a pretty decent model, and have no issue with a few specific slots being confined to specific types of play. As a matter of fact, I wouldn't mind seeing charms placed back in group content rather than raid, for this same reason.

&lt;P&gt;I can't really begin to express how much I agree with this person.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The charm slot has been so bastardized from its original purpose already (the PoP charm was a travesty) and it's sickening to see it slide downhill farther with the raid-dropped charms. The very original charm concept that was shown was a charm&amp;nbsp;whose stats were affected by how much cloth armor you wore. The LoY charms (where the slot was introduced) held decently to the principle of non-constant stats that were awarded based on some gimmick. The PoP charm gave constant stats based on how much raiding you did, and ruined the charm slot for probably 2 or 3 years. DoD did a fairly nice job of presenting some neat charms (like the random stats one from Undershore) but unfortunately also introduced powerful raider charms.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The augment slot in the charms was filled at first with the LDoN augment, then later with the Slipgear's Gem and the new Wanderlust augment. The Slipgear and Wanderlust augments provide an easy-out for people too lazy to spend months in Lost Dungeons, but also yield worse maximum stats, which is fine. Allowing a greater shortcut via raid-dropped augments (essentially hand-feeding the sheep herds even more heavily) should be avoided. Let them graze for some things like the rest of us.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Enok&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Edit: Uhh, this came out harsher than intended. I just don't believe charm augments should be a raider thing; they should be for everybody, and something we can relate on, to help us associate more strongly with one another, rather than broadening the gap between non-raiders and raiders.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Enokhaon-Innoruuk on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;12-11-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;08:44 PM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

      <description>As far as "original purpose" most of the Charms I have seen still are non-constant.&amp;nbsp; Whether they are based on Gear worn, Weight Carried, Time in a Zone or the most constant Languages Known they all seem very clearly in the same family as "how much cloth armor you wore".&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; While these all have higher potentials than the original I dont think they "bastardize" the original concept at all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As far as augments for the slot, the reason people dont want to spend "months in Loast Dungeons" might be because they dont enjoy it and its old.&amp;nbsp; New content, new rewards, not a new concept.&amp;nbsp; Theoretically, if they could code it, theres no reason the Charm Slot Augs couldnt use the same mechanic, a variable based upon some condition.&amp;nbsp; The original Poster is only concerened with theoretical potentials.&amp;nbsp; I doubt he(she) would turn away from a charm with a potential equal to a non charm aug's stats but based on a charm's cariable mechanic of its own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The most amusing thing here is really your tone.&amp;nbsp; You obviously loathe raid content and the people who enjoy it, hence the name calling.&amp;nbsp; I'm not sure why you think raiding is a shortcut, but as far as I can see, its no shorter than LDoN would be assuming they didnt place the augs on the first raid level mobs within the content.&amp;nbsp; My guild raids 6 days a week 5ish hours a day, I could finish many LDoNs in this time if thats what I thought was fun.&amp;nbsp; However, I dont enjoy them, I enjoy raiding new content with scripts that make the events seem odd compared to me joining some people and mass slaughtering 100 mobs in a dungeon repeatedly.&amp;nbsp; That just doesnt amuse me after doing the few in each area that I have done.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the end the OP simply posted their opinion that the Devs add more powerful augment options via raiding like they have for pretty much every other item slot in the game.&amp;nbsp; I am happy with my DoDH charm aug, but I wouldnt refuse the ability to raid for better augs either.&amp;nbsp; I personally think the Charm slot should be given over to the Tradeskillers, with each different skill making a different style of Charm, and the "best" Charms be aquired via people making attunable items and selling them&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Well, the skill based charms are what I consider to be in the constant family since they never get worse (since you can't lose skill); yes there were a couple from the start, but the others, faction based, gear based, time based, all fluctuate. People don't like the ones that fluctuate; I have guildmates who take lesser stat charms with consistent stats over ones that have higher potential, but aren't consistent.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I like raid content, and the more complicated encounters, but I do not like being insignificant in any given fight. When you're fighting alongside two dozen+ other people, you're insignificant unless you're the MT, MA or raid leader.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Which is why I want the gap closed more; so I can continue doing harder and harder old raid content with a single group, since interesting new single-group stuff is few and far between.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>Charms that fluctuate are the devil. I'll take a semi decent fixed stats one over them any day. As for the raid droppable charm slot augs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All quested charm augs have AC and resists on them in addition to hp/mana/end and are better for a well rounded char than majority of other augs in that slot. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don't really see a problem with few hp/mana/end only augs usable in charm slot.&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Meph-AB on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;12-12-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;07:38 AM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

      <description>Zajeer - at one point you stated that there would be augs coming out&#xD;

&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;Yeah, I did say that somewhere (I remember saying it, just not sure where =p). And yeah, it was more of a theoretical "everything gets upgraded eventually" than a definitive. Though, when we do phase out the LDoN augment, I'd rather it be from a quested/single group source than a raid source. You raiders don't do enough non-raid content in the game in my opinion. Plus, providing more chances for varied demographics of our game (raiders versus casuals in this case) to group up and accomplish a common goal, the better.&lt;BR&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Can I be very honest and say the bolded portion of that statement scares me? I can surely appreciate the intent behind it and hope that it can/does/will happen. The problem is the gear gap between raiders (in full raid gear) and non raiders (in full non raid gear) is so large at this point that it can only be measured in terms of levels over the current cap. I say that based on my guild group's attempt to take down the 68.3 boss at 70 (100% failure) and doing it again last week with 2x 75/74/72. Night and day in a way that can only be captured by reading full raid gear accounts of how easy the DoD arcs are from well over a year ago. If an upgrade to the charm is implemented in a way such as those arcs there will be a wave of melded demographics but once it has crested and moved on there will be significant numbers of people who wont be able to get it until the next level bump; is my fear anyway.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I do not overly envy the dev's jobs. The problem with content is, at this&amp;nbsp;point, you almost have to tweak it&amp;nbsp;not by what level the intended targets are but what they will likely be wearing. The up and down shifts in the TSS endzones are an evidence of this I believe.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>An idea zajeer may like -- Give the follow two options for raid level charm augs:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) Have charm flags added to normal raid level augs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) Create a quest similar to BiC to make the best charm aug.&amp;nbsp; Have it be considerably powerful after the last groupable/mini raid stage, but require parts from high end raids to take it to the point where it's better than the augs you normally get from raids. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Example:&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Quested up to mini raid level (comparable step 10 bic) - 125 hp mana&amp;nbsp; 2% spell&amp;nbsp; shield / dot shield&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Raid aug (non-quest) -&amp;nbsp; 175 hp mana 3% spell shield / dot shield&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Fully powered quested aug (multiple items from high end raids needed) - 225 hp mana 4% spell shield / dot shield&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This way any raider, regardless of out-of-raid playtime, can have access to raid level charm augs.&amp;nbsp; But raiders who are willing to put in effort outside of raids can get something that's a step above.&amp;nbsp; This also gives non-high end raiders a shot at a considerable upgrade, if they're willing to put the effort into it.&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

I raid 5 nites a week. I don't have much time for anything besides that if at least pretend that I still have a social life outside of EQ&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;B) Even if I find the odd hour or two where I can go out and do single group content on a weekend afternoon, I'll be more likely than not doing it with my guild mates instead of the random pickup group because the gap is so large already that I can accomplish 2x as much in a guild group than in a pickup group, or the content I'm interested in is simply too hard for the "casual" gamer. BTW, the horrible dmg/delay ratios on tss single group weapons doesn't help with mixing raiders and casuals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
