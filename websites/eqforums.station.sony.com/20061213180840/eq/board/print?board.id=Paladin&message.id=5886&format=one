				<DIV>Same thing happened to me last night, sigh...</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>We killed the regular "Mujaki the Devourer" easily, but then the "Shade of Mujaki" failed ot spawn.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>A related question:&nbsp; The first time I tried this event (a couple of weeks ago on Nov. 26)&nbsp;I got the "zone emote" as expected when I entered the zone ("Mujaki the Devourer's thoughts enter your mind, 'Fool, you have defeated my corruptor, but you will not defeat me!'").&nbsp; But we failed to kill Mujaki (we had a hard time single-pulling him, took too long, and he despawned).&nbsp; When I went back to try it again a couple of weeks later, I didn't get the emote again.&nbsp; (And this time we didn't get the Shade, bah.)</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Am I supposed to get that "zone emote" every time I enter PoN until I complete that part of the epic 1.5 quest?&nbsp; Or is that just a one-time message to give you a hint about the next quest step, which doesn't repeat after you've seen it once?</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I'm trying to figure out of if getting the message or not is a clue about whether PoN recognizes that I need the "Paladin version" of the Mujaki event.&nbsp; If so, I'm not going to waste time on another raid until I start seeing the message again.&nbsp; If not, I'll stop trying to figure out why I'm not getting it and may go ahead and retry the event again to see if I get lucky.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>(And yes, I'm the leader of my group when I zone in, and have Drema's Soulstone (container version) in my inventory, in my first inventory slot, and have the "A Soulstone Shard" from the Coterie Corruptor sitting in it.)</DIV>
