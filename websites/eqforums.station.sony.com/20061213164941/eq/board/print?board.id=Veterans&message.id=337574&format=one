<P>I'm not sure if you're referring to the raids or the single-group trials.</P>
<P>As someone mentioned earlier, "trials" wouldn't necessarily make sense in every expansion because the lore doesn't always&nbsp;center around an individual that poses challenges&nbsp;to those who wish to prove themselves.&nbsp; That said, we do&nbsp;have scripted raid encounters every expansion with mechanics that aren't dissimilar to the MPG raids.&nbsp; The difference between Hatchet the Torturer and the Trial of Adaptation is primarily lore. <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0></P>
<P>I liked <EM>almost</EM> everything about the single-group&nbsp;MPG trials.&nbsp; They were challenging, hand-crafted, unique events that required careful and sometimes unusual tactics.&nbsp; My problem with them was that the rewards were substantial... maybe a little too substantial.&nbsp; High level spells, a permanent increase to the resistances hardcap and some incredibly good gear.&nbsp; And I suspect this spike in itemization is one of the main reasons why they were so fondly remembered.&nbsp; Ask yourself, and be completely honest, if the events would have been so popular if the rewards were a shade or two less powerful.</P>

<P>I think the trials were popular for the fact they were each unique, they dropped really good gear for the era, and they were instances, which meant they were always up when you wanted them (assuming timers were down).</P>
<P>Personally, the "upgrade" to this that comes to my mind was the freeport arena challenge. Admittedly, it is longer, but it has the similar characteristics of always being ready to go, and yielding a really good result.</P>
<P>In contrast, the random spawn with a possible named, who then drops the item you want (or a mold), can be irritating to some, because of the chance of a bad RNG streak, leading to hours of nothing.</P>
<P>Admittedly, even the trials can drop an item you don't need, but at least you get runes. And you get to see an item, even if nobody needs it.</P>
<P>The dod missions were similar, in that they were instances, however, while the loot was kind of close to the quality of PG trial loot, it was several expansions later, and therefore weaker by comparison. Cursor loot was overkill quantity, and imo should rarely be used, if ever.</P>
<P>While I would not think every expansion would need a full set of "trials" a few really high quality items, from a few instances, popped in here and there (like freeport arena) would be nice.</P>
<P>In fact, I honestly would suggest adding one or two to TSS, that drop weapon upgrades for single groups. Despair is still one of the top groupable weapons, several years later. A 25 dmg, 21 dly 1h and about a 72dmg 38 dly 2h seem like they would be a good level for modern eq groupable top end items.</P>
<P>Of course, the events would have to be as hard now, as PG group trials were when OOW came out.</P><p>Message Edited by Treeslayer on <span class=date_text>12-12-2006</span> <span class=time_text>11:10 PM</span>
