yesterday to think of what spells or abilities that shaman has that if&#xD;
they gave to beastlords would completely make shamans unneeded. To my&#xD;
amazement everyone I could think of was to some extent already there.&#xD;
Looking at top end game not just newest content, beastlord was very&#xD;
very close to replacing shaman in all context. Since clerics are a&#xD;
mandatory class for everything now the one thing beastlords really lack&#xD;
they aren't really gonna be needed for, healing."&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr size="2" width="100%"&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yea shaman buffs are needed but when someone is trying to choose a new class to play for fun factor, seeing a class that has their main role as buffbot is more of a disadvantage than advantage.&lt;br&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;There was a time when all raid mobs were "slow capped", they couldn't be slowed more than 10-30% no matter what slow was used.&amp;nbsp; I take it this is no longer the case, even on old content?&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;The quoted person is mistaken in a lot of respects.&amp;nbsp; Beastlords are not "very very close to replacing shaman in all contect."&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;And to further his argument, he dismisses one of the major benefits that shaman have over beastlords; the ability to heal (clerics aren't mandatory bud.&amp;nbsp; You do just as well with a druid in most content, and in some of the really high stuff, a druid with a shaman off healing.)&amp;nbsp; He also forgets the buffs, Fo7 and Wunshi, sense and fortitude.&amp;nbsp; Beastlords don't get any of them (though shaman don't get SD/SA), but I guess they aren't pertinent to the argument, so we can forget about them.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Let us not forget ... Beastlord slows are VERY WEAK in the lower levels ... even compared to an Enchanter, much less a Shaman (who slows better than either).&amp;nbsp; Drowsy, the first&amp;nbsp;Beastlord slow spell, comes at level 20 ... and comes at level 5 for Shaman, only slowing for "Decrease Attack Speed by 11% (L5) to 25% (L60)" according to Lucy.&amp;nbsp; Their next slow?&amp;nbsp; Sha's Lethargy at level 50, "Decrease Attack Speed by 30%" according to Lucy.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Shaman, on the other hand, get Walking Sleep at level 13 - a spell that, according to Lucy, "Decrease Attack Speed by 23% (L13) to 35% (L60)".&amp;nbsp; They also get Tagar's Insects, which "Decrease Attack Speed by 33% (L27) to 50% (L60)" and apparently lasts them until 51, where they get Turgur's Insects, "Decrease Attack Speed by 66% (L51) to 75% (L60)".&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;So, from a slow perpective, Beastlords would NOT replace Shaman.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>beastlords can and do replace shamans in experience groups.. their slows are just fine for the job and they put out considerably more dps than a shaman.. but you're never going to see beastlords replacing shamans in raids, it just won't happen.. no one can slow multiple raid mobs better than us, especially with items such as PoTime's slow clicky and VT's malosini clicky&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shamans are also very good healers even in the later expansions (GoD+), we don't have the healing output of a cleric.. but where a cleric may go oom in 5 minutes, we keep going.. and going.. and going.. and going.. and again, we only get better with items such as the healing clickies to get free mana from canni AA/spells and spiritual channeling AA&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Beastlords just don't get sufficient tools to compete with shaman in xp groups till 65 and by the time we were already in game. Most of our spell line was like rangers and paladins till then. Useful but not huge enough to replace. Most of the focus line we got was an extention of the Altuna line....which changes in PoP mind you. Our slows don't catch up to the 10% difference will 65....again we already be in game.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most of our so called "competeing" utility we get is in PoP +. Most utilty we offer till then is acutally quite minor and are mainly a DPS class till then.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In summary, beastlord utility just doens't compete with shaman till PoP. Even then shaman still have a hge advantage till Omens. Beastlord utiltiy is very minor really till then.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

      <description>You'd probably see fewer shamans, but you still need them on raids.&amp;nbsp; Beastlords do not get the malo line of spells at all, so you'd need shamans to help debuff mobs to land slows.&amp;nbsp; Also, all bst hp buffs are inferior to a buff offered by another class that fits in the same stacking category,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I still don't think bsts should be allowed until Luclin, but I don't think they'd make shamans obsolete.&amp;nbsp; Just look back in history, and there was never a time when shamans stopped being needed on raids.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Even if BST was in at start, I would still play a shaman. I guess I'm just a masochist :P&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then again, I would prefer to play a Froglok shaman, so it's a moot point until LoY is unlocked, for me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;Can beastlords slow as well as shamans?&amp;nbsp; If the shaman can slow even a little better, he'd be in much higher demand.&amp;nbsp; Just asking, since I don't know.</description>

      <description>it doesnt really matter much in early game content.&amp;nbsp; Ultimately, yes.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
But who cares beastlords are vastly overpowered when everyone has crap gear.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
