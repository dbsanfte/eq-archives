    <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I'm not sure how they are doing the progression server but I get the feeling it will be mostly when such and such mob is killed the next expansion will be opened providing it meets certain time requirements the dev's have hinted at to make sure it doesn't progress too quickly.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;What do people think of a server where the progression is completely quest related.&amp;nbsp; Killing mobs doesn't unlock anything just completing quest.&amp;nbsp; I'm sure you'll have to kill those mobs in order to complete those quest but it would be a slower progressing server I'm thinking, and a lot more people would help eachother out completing quest.&amp;nbsp; This game is called "Everquest" it would be a good change I think.&amp;nbsp; Take opening up Velious it could only be done after each epic has been completed "X" number of times by different people.&amp;nbsp; Just a random thought ....&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I had an idea similar to this in my Content Raiding Server idea, and 1.0 epics are required to finish luclin and enter PoP (among other things).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The other quests are&amp;nbsp;VP key to enter Velious,&amp;nbsp;ST key&amp;nbsp;to enter Luclin,&amp;nbsp;VT key (and 1.0 epic)&amp;nbsp;to enter PoP, Time key to enter Gates, Qvic flag to enter OoW ect. Those are all required on each character who wants to advance.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;In addition, the final raid target of each expansion must be killed to unlock the next expansion serverwide. CT to open Kunark, Phara Dar to open Velious, wake Sleeper and kill Vulak to open Luclin, kill Seru and Aten to open PoP, kill Quarm to open Gates.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;You could add some quests to be completed once&amp;nbsp;also for serverwide unlocking. Such as BiC and other involved quests. The PoP one that requires the part from each EP god, the 10th Dain ring, and so on.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;It would slow down the top guild, prevent it from advancing too far beyond the general population, and more people would enjoy the game if they had to get keys for old expansion to enter the next one.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;The thing is, it honeslty wouldn't.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The best guild on this server will not have a capatalist-style DKP system where people bid on quest pieces: the raid leader will have enough forsight to realize that since they're abandoning content pretty much as soon as they defeat it with the exception of a very few farm stages, enough quest pieces will only drop to give a few people quests.&amp;nbsp; They will award those pieces all to the same person.&amp;nbsp; There are obvious exceptions: each cleric in the guild will have their epic.&amp;nbsp; But, overall, one necromancer, probably the one who spends the most time online, will be given all of his hard planes-drops, since the planes won't be done enough time for 2+ necros to get their epic.&amp;nbsp; At lest one epic quest / class (except maybe Beastlord) will be completed WELL before PoP... they will probably be completed before Luclin, perhaps even before velious.&amp;nbsp; The same goes for other quests.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;8th coldain shawl?&amp;nbsp; As soon as velious hits, that's going to be my primary goal.&amp;nbsp; I guarantee I'll have it done within a month, maybe less (tradeskills will be where they need to be before the fall of Phara Dar).&amp;nbsp; It's&amp;nbsp;my favorite content hands down, and I'm going to have a lot of fun doing it.&amp;nbsp; Someone I'm sure feels the same way about the 10 rings.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The elemental planes god quest?&amp;nbsp; As I said, that quest will all be awarded to the same person (like difficult to complete epics), and so is unlikely to hold back progression (at most you're talking 2-3 extra raids, TOPS, and that could be in only half a week).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>what would be SWEET is if they were like, "Unlock expansions via quests in game!" just like they were like, "Unlock the noble Frogloks via quest in game!" before EQ2 launched. That would wtfpwn all, a Progression server w/o even having the Progression mechansim at launch.</description>

      <description>should just not let any of the redtards play on the server...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;or perhaps just try to stay a little more on topic instead of spamming posts that mean nothing btu "add pvp plzzz!!!!!" regardless of the topic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
