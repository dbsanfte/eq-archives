    <title>Need help with bugged task</title>
    <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Prexus&amp;message.id=91</link>
    <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I have two tasks on two separate characters and am unable to complete the tasks.&amp;nbsp; I have petition and /bugged both of these.&amp;nbsp; But the issue still stands of I have a total of four and a half hours into the tasks (including two deaths on one).&amp;nbsp; One task I got from Shal Var called "Of Sands and Turtles".&amp;nbsp; I finished everything and the final part of the task was to talk to Captain Necin to complete the task and get my reward.&amp;nbsp; Well got to him, and he wont complete the task.&amp;nbsp; That in game petition ID is 3202937 and the Character name is Trexlore on the Prexus server.&amp;nbsp; I got a response basically saying sorry, but /bug it and go the forums to see if there is a work around.&amp;nbsp; The last task I did with this character granted almost 40-50% exp (lvl 14).&amp;nbsp; I am not going to just dump the task and start over.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;My other task that is bugged is "Sentry's Mission" out of the Dreadlands.&amp;nbsp; I have done various versions of this numerous times, and never had a problem, now I am stuck at the explore the tower in the front of the castle (and I have had this exact one before so I know im in the right place).&amp;nbsp; These generally yeild about 7-9% exp for mylvl 54.&amp;nbsp; My petition for this one was delete without response so I dont have the petition ID number.&amp;nbsp; Any thing I can do to complete both of these.&amp;nbsp; I am generally not a fan of doing all the work for something and then getting told sorry, but it sucks to be you by an GM (or just having my petition deleted) and getting no reward for the work I put in.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Thanks in advance for your help.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
