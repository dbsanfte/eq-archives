&lt;DIV&gt;Anyway I figured it was worth bringing over to these boards, because I too feel that it's somewhat lackluster. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;1. It's very limited, simply because of maximum HP and apparently it is also foci capped at 70. So Ding 71, it starts to degrade?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;2. Compared to the others (yes the lovely power comparison, and Zajeer if you're reading this I'm betting you've read something like this 100 million times:smileytongue:) the other BP's serve a very good function in continual usage for the life of the character since they scale very well.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Anyway in our terms, I was thinking of a type of super Panolpy of Vie. That is something on like a 1 minute duration and absorbs 15% damage or a 100% rez.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I would also like to see the effect changed. With the DoN expansion added to the game, there's now a focus effect 50% Improved healing in the game. The tier 2 BP from OoW shouldn't only last just for four heals. It wouldnt be a big deal to be able to cast unlimited heals during that 1 minute and don't see it fade. 4 heals greatly decrease the quality of the breastplate. I was highly dissapointed when I saw the focus fade after 24ish seconds. Seeing how rare the BPs are (Tier 2), it could be changed to last a whole minute. 1 minute out of 5 with a 50% improved healing focus would increase the value of the BP for clrs but atm it's prety **SMURF**ty imo. The stats are great but when I got it, I was a lot more excited about the effect than the rest. There's a lot of good BPs out there now but that one was THE one! until I realize it lasts for 4 heals and see other fellow clerics with a focus effect that works everytime and not only for 4 heals.. makes me sad!&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

IIRC that was part of the reason brilliance of ro never did actually anything, because the only people that ever had it were always max level.  So even if they wanted it to be good to 73 or 75, they have to wait til the cap is above that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the other hand, keep in mind there is no cap increase for DoD.  And if I remember correctly it's supposed to have content to keep anguish guilds busy.  So when the level cap is raised again, OoW will be at least 4 expansions old.  They may upgrade the anguish focus effects at that time, but if you are an active raider, you will probably have replaced a good deal of your gear by then.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As far as scaling, the druid bp also gives a focus buff, so it doesn't scale any better than yours.  Of course the druid one also seems lackluster to me, so maybe you have a point! :)</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;You dont have to worry&amp;nbsp;about dinging 71 for a while.&amp;nbsp; Besides they will probably increase its cap to 72 or 73, much like they did&amp;nbsp;with a lot of PoP and GoD gear,&amp;nbsp;if and when they increase the level cap again.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;By appearances they eliminated the "charges,"&amp;nbsp; so IMO all they really need to do is increase the buffs duration from 1 minute to 3 to 5 minutes.&amp;nbsp; The drawback is see though is that we have to have another piece of gear that has a healing focus to use while we can't use this buff.&amp;nbsp; Ideally, I would not mind seeing this becoming a simple focus effect (no clicky).&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;I believe I misunderstood "charges"&amp;nbsp; i took that to mean you could use the BUFF 4 times and then the click was no longer available.&amp;nbsp; Based on:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;BR&gt;I take it to mean that you buff yourself and when you cast 4 heals or 1 grp heal the BUFF is gone not the click itself.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;</description>
