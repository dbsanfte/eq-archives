      <description>&lt;div&gt;By hasting your swing you EFFECTIVELY lower your delay. Everquest seems to parse at 0.1 second intervals (i.e. 1 delay) and rounds UP regardless of the decimal (10.1 goes to 11, 10.9 goes to 11).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Therefore, haste does NOT affect all weapons equally, but it is irrelevant to whether or not its a high delay or low delay weapon, its entirely a function of the particular haste % and the particular weapon delay and where the EFFECTIVE delay ends up. However, IN GENERAL, a faster weapon is more LIKELY to end up with an effective delay within that tenth of a second interval within a larger range haste, so in general higher delay weapons get more out of haste.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But that is an average issue and is irrelevant to any particular weapon at any particular delay.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;For example, a 19 delay weapon has the exact same number of swings over time with 90%-109% haste.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;A 41 delay weapon has the exact same number of swings over time with 96-104% haste.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;That is a simple mathematical reality that has been in play in this game since the beginning, as anyone that extensively parsed this kind of thing back when we didn't know how this stuff worked should know.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;For any particular weapon, the generalization of how much you get out of max haste (or whatever haste % you are using) can easily end up with the lower delay weapon getting more out of haste. So you have to actually look at the numbers for the weapons you are interested in rather than the generalization of &amp;quot;higher delay weapons get more out of haste&amp;quot;, even though as a generalization it is true just because of the increased delay value.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Obviously, haste does not &amp;quot;modify&amp;quot; a weapon's delay. But it dang surely modifies the delay the game engine uses to determine when you swing. I'd love for someone to explain what magical method they think the game uses in order to use haste to calculate swings that does NOT involve a modification of the delay value in calculations.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;You misunderstand.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;1 delay = 0.1 seconds&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Log files may only post in 1 second intervals but the game engine is processing weapon swings in tenth of a second intervals.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I'm quite sure you could find a log where a 20 delay unhasted weapon is posting in 1 second intervals or 3 second intervals in places. That's irrelevant as it is an error&amp;nbsp;in the timing of the log system.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;If you take a character without double attack, riposte, etc, stick a 20 delay weapon in their hand and have them attack for 20 minutes, and you add up the number of swings from 0 seconds to the 1200 second mark, you will end up with 599, 600, or 601 swings depending on when the log truncated at the beginning and the end.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;This is how we parsed that stuff during 1999. You parsed over a period of time with a character without anything that could cause additional swings, and you averaged the number of swings per time interval.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;That is how we figured out how much haste items had.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;It is not a coincidence that we knew a fbss was 21% haste before we had anything capable of extracting that data from the game files. We determined those values accurately because the game engine uses very simple system for determining this stuff. Every point of delay is 0.1 seconds, the game only parses in 0.1 second intervals, and decimals are rounded up regardless of the decimal value.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>Those numbers seemed a touch high for me for Eulogy's final DPS in Ainmer's parse, then I realized that 100% haste works in favor of Eulogy since SC will cap out on delay by 100% but eulogy won't, reworked the numbers for 45% haste and eulogy does come out a tad lower. Note: I don't place a whole lot of faith in katta banker parses that they accurately reflect reality either. They should give a decent reflection of relative DPS by the same character in different setups, but given that's all I have atm I'd love it if a warrior would be willing to copy to test and do some SC/shield and SC/2.0 or 2.5 parses on a level 70 NPC.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you want to do a parse please include.. Number of swings and total accuracy with both setups, min/max/avg swings with both, total melee dps, total proc dps (and resist rate if you can), and of course total dps, that should leave us in a better position to approximate Eulogy's dps.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Swiftcleave=2.2*129*45.8=12998/60=216*.7=151.64+21.25=172.89&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eulogy=2.2*359*24.9=19666/60=327*.7=229.44+9.87=239.31&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;239.31/172.89=1.384&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*266.74=369.21&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Should be a good rough estimate of Eulogy's DPS in Ainmer's parse, 21 DPS lower then the dual wield parse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;369.21/390.83= 94.5%&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now I dunno what warriors think about a 5.5% dps tradeoff, I know BB feels it's too much. Personally I think it's rediculous, I give up 75% of my dps, warriors should ATLEAST give up 80%.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To compare again to the pally 219.87/369.21= 59.6% so pally is only doing a tad under 60% of the warrior's 1h/shield dps.&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Um, at the progression level where people have Dragonkiller2 or Eulogy I would venture to guess all have 45%+ worn haste and Salik available - hitting 100% haste is trivial. Beyond that there are quite a number of 5% and 10% overhaste items.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While the majority of Warriors, SK, and Pallies at that level may not have 110% haste, all of them have 100%.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let's not forget that a Warrior would likely use his highest available Hate aug on a Eulogy while a Knight could use a DPS aug. Also don't neglect the fact my best self-weapon buff is a stun (resisted) and DD (resisted) while Knights have weapon buffs that actually do something. Those things alone exceed the 5% more DPS than you think we ought to have when using the same weapon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Putting aside such details, you have to admit that results strongly suggest for Warriors 2Hand DPS &amp;gt; DW DPS &amp;gt; sword and board DPS even using a Eulogy and the difference in all 3 classes using a Eulogy's deviation from the traditioanal DPS gap is pretty small.&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Battleblade-Xegony on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;05-20-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;03:39 PM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Those things alone exceed the 5% more DPS than you think we ought to have when using the same weapon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Putting aside such details, you have to admit that results strongly suggest for Warriors 2Hand DPS &amp;gt; DW DPS &amp;gt; sword and board DPS even using a Eulogy and the difference in all 3 classes using a Eulogy's deviation from the traditioanal DPS gap is pretty small.&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Battleblade-Xegony on &lt;span class="date_text"&gt;05-20-2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;03:39 PM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;BB what on earth are you talking about? I said first 100% haste works in favor of eulogy compared to SC as a 1h/shield weapon so I refigured the formula at 45% haste to match what ainmer was using in his parse. The numbers show that he would have been at 95% of his dual wield DPS with Eulogy, it's based on a katta banker parse but it's a decent estimation, if anyone cares to do a parse on a test 70 we can refigure it all based on that. Grats you on totally missing the point of the post.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Wow, how many times does it need to be said?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dual Wield DPS is greater than Two hander DPS. Both parses on Katta Banker as well as real world dps comparisons on raid and xp group mobs prove this fact over and over. My DPS took a significant jump upon looting Swiftcleave. Prior to that I used ROSW all the time.</description>

      <description>Well, I can show you parse after parse of my fights with SC+2.0 against common raid mobs, and the same with RoSW. I've yet to see a single one where Rod of Shaded Wrath outdid SC+2.0. Granted, my RoSW is equipped with the Bauble of Aggression from RSS, but I'm doubting it's going to make that much of a difference.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think you would at least have to agree that for the vast majority of Everquest encounters and situations, SC+2.0 is going to outdamage RoSW. There might be lucky times where RoSW does more damage in a short fight, or certain situations in which RoSW is superior, but overall, SC+2.0 is superior.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a theoretical Yield, and I am extremely sceptical as to the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unless you parse a Warrior and a Knight with max AAs both using the same 1-Hander, then any such conclusions are really meaninless.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Its the same theory applied to all the configurations.  And it is pretty close to what I parse.  I imagine there's some stuff we don't know still, but most of the difference is in guestimating the accuracy, and in dropping decimals more than two places out(on the spreadsheet).&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't trust your numbers I mean your the guy who thought that min damage is the weapon damage plus the damage bonus which I can assure you is not the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spreadsheet dps is just bs number crunching anyway you may get an idea of what's going on but the only way to get real numbers is to get out and parse them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally your not including spell haste which to be frankly any warrior who has these weapons will pretty much have at least 50% at all times so will be sitting at at least 90-96% haste if not 100 which will play havok wiht your numbers. You are already showing here that your beloved sheildmate weapons would be closely approaching Dual wield dps just with theoretical numbers and would have about the same per swing agro showing once again that such a solotion would end up having warriors making no trade off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally I think you are ignoring the fact that your flurry rate will definitely favor the harder hitting main hander since only main hands have the potential to tripple and flurry which would further throw the numbers out of kilter in favor of the &amp;quot;sheildmate&amp;quot; from a DPS perspective.  &lt;/p&gt;</description>

You are further confusing matters since what we really should be looking at is what the DPS of one 1 hander is compared to the other. My Epic which is pretty much the same ratio of Swiftcleave is putting out as much DPS by itself as you are claiming the SC/2.0 combo is together ergo my sceptism considering that warriors actually have supperior melee DPS to rangers all other factors being equal just do to your skill set.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally I think you are ignoring the fact that your flurry rate will definitely favor the harder hitting main hander since only main hands have the potential to tripple and flurry which would further throw the numbers out of kilter in favor of the &amp;quot;sheildmate&amp;quot; from a DPS perspective.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0033ff"&gt;Which is why I used the Swings per round, rounds per minute calculation.  Did you actually READ the post, or just skim it enough to almost be on subject while you whine over a Kunark ranger's life some more?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;font color="#0033ff"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;Your calculations do not jive with the reality I observe and parse on a regular basis and when a theory fails to match objective reality the theory is scraped not the reality.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;As I said your calculator is showing the SC/2.0 combination putting out a level of DPS together that I regularly observe them generating on their own there for the calculations are flawed and not worthy of consideration and any conclusions drawn are worthless to the debate.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;Now on to the Eulogy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2.2 swings per round, x=4 is 359, delay 35(35*100% Haste is 1.8 seconds per round- or 33 1/3 rounds per minute)  making it 2.2*359*33.33=26324/60 438 DPS *.7 for accuracy, 306.6 DPS.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eulogy (3.385 *175/60)  ~9.87&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some interesting numbers there, let me see if I can interpret these somewhat. Trying it for Swiftcleave as a mainhand weapon with no secondary weapon I'm getting this:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2.2*129*60=17028/60= 283*.7= 198.66&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SC w CSIV (175+200)*6.77/2)/60= 21.25+198.66 = 219.91&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eulogy's total numbers were 306.6 DPS +9.87 = 316.47 which if I divide the SC number I get 316.47/219.91=1.439 so eulogy's DPS numbers by your formula should be 143.9% of what swiftcleave does as a 1h/shield weapon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now looking at Ainmer's DPS parse, I find a warrior with SC+CS4 does 266.74 dps on a katta banker from behind. I can speculate that the same warrior substituting a eulogy would be doing 266.74*1.439=383.84 dps. That same warrior using SC mainhand with 2.0 offhand parsed at 390.83 so eulogy in that parse would of been ~7dps lower then SC+2.0 or 98.2% of SC/2.0 dual wield.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To look at the knight comparison, the paladin using eulogy parsed at &lt;span&gt;219.87 which would be 57.3% of the warrior's dps.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Azazel420 on &lt;span class="date_text"&gt;05-19-2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;03:47 PM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
