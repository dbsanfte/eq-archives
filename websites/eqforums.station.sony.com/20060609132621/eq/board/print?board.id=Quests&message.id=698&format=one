				# Wooly Adventures - There is no blue compass line directing you to Droganoth Hrothgar in Everfrost Peaks. <br><br>    This was another task I ran through on a live server and the blue line appeared on my compass after I had completed the first two sections of the task.  Is anyone still having this problem?<br><br>I was just chatting to someone in the TNZ chat channel and they didn't have the blue line on their compass for this NPC still, so there is still a problem with some people's systems showing this one mob.<br><br>--------------<br><br>Task : Scouting the Aviaks.<br><br>The 4th stage of this is South Karana : Explore the Uppermost level of the Aviak tree village, once you complete this you get told to; South Karana : Explore the Aviak tree village. However, running all around the area will not trigger another 'stage completed' message.
