      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=zek&amp;message.id=1509#M1509</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Im not sure this is the place for this, but Im looking to start a froglok perma-group. A group that would commit to playing at a certain time every night and only with each other with their character. I play from about midnight to 4am pdt and hope others would like the idea. I&amp;nbsp; get sick of solo solo solo'ing all the time. The classes im thinking of could be warrior, SK or Pally, necro, wizard, cleric, and shaman. That seems to be the best balance for a frog group. Post here and maybe we can meet up in game at some point.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>Is Zek worth it for a new player?</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=zek&amp;message.id=1505#M1505</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I am looking at playing on Zek but have not played EQ in many many years. It seems the progression servers have a decent influx of real new people (not twinks or alts) and was wondering if Zek is like the old mans game? What I mean by this is:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;1) Is it stale with old vets to EQ and their super twink alts and very little new people? &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;2) Would a new player have&amp;nbsp;no chance surviving a pvp attack because all there opponents are twinks/hackers/or both?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;3) Would a new player be killed every 5 mins because he is fresh meat and is not a twink? So if he does not twink himself he is basically screwed?&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>The sad story of zek pvp</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=zek&amp;message.id=1504#M1504</link>
      <description>I started playing everquest a few months after the game first came out. I chose to play on rallos zek (as it was called then). I nearly quit the game 3 times before reaching lvl 8 because of my boredom and frustration with fighting NPC's. But because of the strong community within the server and the great fun it was for all of us "noobs" to battle it out on eachother relentlessly, it kept me going. It started to turn out to be a&amp;nbsp; fantastic server as I could battle more then just computer software (NPC's). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once I reached level twelve (I was a wizard so I recieved shock of lightning) I was more then pleased with the game. Me and my buds would battle eachother and others for hours everyday, not even caring to level. The stratagie and skill it took to kill eachother and others far surpassed the lame cast cast cast or hack hack hack that the rince wash and repeat NPC battling was. Each pvp fight was even filled with emotion as I feared losing items I had worked to gain and fought ferosiously if I was trying to kill others with items I desired. This made them game exceptional and I have never played another game that touched me the way everquest pvp did. This is what me and many of my buddies loved to do, it was our world away from the real world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sadly, everquest pvp began to fade. With the now predominant "uber" items being "no-drop" the emotion in battles was non-existent. There was still hope for the game as there were still many powerful "droppable" items. A player wearing full gear (including his droppable) had an advantage over a "naked player" (a player wearing very little - enough to "pack" before you die, or only no drop items) due to his increased stats. On the other hand If I or an enemy died in pvp naked we lost nothing - the emotion in the fight was gone. This is when pvpers were termed "grievers," because they gained nothing and the players who didnt wish to partake in pvp only lost the time it took them to rebuff, get full mana, and run back to where they were so they can go hack some more never ending program generated mobs. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PvP still had a chance, it would have to stop making nearly all the "uber" items no dop. What was the reason of making so many rare items "no drop"? Did they fear, "twinks?" All they had to do, and they actually did implement is a level restriction. An effective trade system and balanced plane system (where all the uber items at the time came from) would prevent these rare items from being unnecesarily farmed. So that leaves them with very little to warrant making so many items "no drop." To top the cake with newer expansions, they added what i believe were called sockets which items could be enhanced with gems that also had the added benefit of becoming no drop. I was beginning to quit at this time so sorry if my term "sockets" is wrong. What was sony thinking making droppable items no drop, they could already be traded before they were enhanced, the only thing they could be doing by doing this is making the items unlootable by pvp. Lets take a step back and look at why this was a bad move. At this time server transfers were available, if you didnt like pvp, transfer to a server where there isnt pvp (nearly all the servers) and you now have no worries of ever dying to another player or losing anything at all. But no the developers didnt realize this flaw. Furthermore, by now rallos zek now was predominantly populated by people who opposed player versus player!!! So their opinions were heard over pro-pvp players and of course they supported and advocated anything that turned zek into more of a blue server. The only reason an anti-pvp player playing on zek wouldn't want to leave is because he already has a strong friend base or guild that he didnt want to lose. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The reason for so many anti-pvp players on zek was for a few reason(s): &lt;br&gt;1)Players lacking the knowledge of what a pvp server is when they first start playing, then they don't want to lose all their hard work (not the player's fault as he was a new player and didnt know what he was getting into).&lt;br&gt;2)Players not knowing what they were getting into and after initially thinking pvp would be fun, changed their mind and would have rather played on a server without if they could have gone back in time.&lt;br&gt;3)Class imbalance (classes that arnt as powerful as others at certain levels leaves the player disappointed that no matter what they do or try they still lose). - This was untrue when I was playing. Every class was very balanced which I would be more then happy to go completly indepth about, but not in this post. Lets just say I know from experience as I have played every class throughout the levels 1-50 on rallos zek. Although there are 3 aspects of class imbalances:&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; A. some classes were more powerful then others depending on the level range (for example once class more dominant at lvls &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 20-23, and then the class that got dominated then becomes more dominant then the previous class at lvls 24-30.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  B. some classes were inherintly better at killing someone fast, or better at killing another player for their items.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  i.e.: classes that could blind could prevent players from 'bagging'. and classes that kill faster (high dps classes) could kill someone &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; before they have the chance to bag (on the contrary to high dps classes, is they had less hp/ac so they could die quickly as well &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; and lose items, and furthermore low dps classes usually have high ac, hp, or the ability to heal which in return gives them more &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; time to bag).&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; C.the short amount of time that a class when it first got its new abilities for the first time in the game, used them in pvp, and they &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; were overpowered, could demolish others easily (this was usually fixed within a week - a month and a half and very few people &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; because of the characteristics of the imbalance had these abilities). an example of this would be when wizards first got ice comet &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (it could do max damage) or when necros got their last pet which could solo a warrior.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Take my word for it, I can beat this topic home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4)Player skill at playing the game and/or their class not up to par with other players that were able to attack them, this leaving them unhappy they are always getting their ass handed to them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These players should have been encouraged to switch servers to a "blue" server, and in my opinion should still be encouraged to switch to a "blue server". Anti pvp players playing on a pvp server are ruining the game for many people.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I used to have 3 accounts that were mine and mine only. Lets say that eq costs $10 a month (which it used to cost more). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3 accounts x $10 a month X 3 years = $1080 they lost just from me quitting the game. Thats not to mention the hordes of my fellow pvp friends that also quit due to these problems with the pvp system. In fact a complete (and very powerful/large) guild that I was in quit over the course of 6 months due to these problems. Lets just say that 30 people total (many owning multiple accounts). Lets say the average loss for each member totalling $500. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;30x500=$15,000&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;I could have easily straightened out the pvp system within a week worth of work for all classes. Unfortantly, the developers either didnt notice these problems, didnt care, or were understaffed and had to use their time for objectionably more important affairs. This work could have been done by one developer and one programer if not the same person in a week. I'd gladly take half of the what I can gauruntee they lost from me and my friends exclusively, to come up with an easy to implement system (for the programmers and admins) that would straighten out pvp for everyone. Not to mention $7,500 would be a nice little contract for a week worth of work :).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the sad story of zek, and the reasons why it could have been exponentially more of a success then what it was allowed to become. Everquest was a great game and made incredible amounts of money for sony/verant, unfortantly it could have been optimized to the benefit of the players and sony as well due to happier (longer subscriptions) customers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Things that need to be fixed in PvP</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=zek&amp;message.id=1497#M1497</link>
      <description>It is hard to make an argument about EQ PvP when there are so many things that are unbalancing, and so many opinions on the matter that nearly any change is going to throw people into an uproar.&amp;nbsp; Even with that said, there are a few key things in PvP that need to be altered, tweaked or even removed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1)&amp;nbsp; Bard speed - This is the single most unbalancing ability in PvP.&amp;nbsp; A group, or single player, with bard speed is god in PvP.&amp;nbsp; With bard speed, you cannot be caught.&amp;nbsp; With bard speed, you can rarely be killed (because no one can catch you).&amp;nbsp; You cannot stun selos off of a player (in contrast to a horsed player).&amp;nbsp; In addition, a bard (high end at least) usually has access to "tank-type" gear, just as a benefit of being a plate-wearing class, which means stopping a bard even without selos is very difficult (because most have innate Run 8 also).&amp;nbsp; Toss in the fact that it lasts a reasonably long time, but more importantly can be refreshed anytime.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Possible Solutions:&lt;br&gt;-Bard speed dispells upon engaging someone in PvP (much like Song of Travel does when someone casts a spell, and would include Mounts)&lt;br&gt;-Increase Selos re-cast timer to something fairer for PvP (i.e. it lasts 2 and half minutes, make re-cast like 6-8mins)&lt;br&gt;-Remove bard speed from all aspects of the game for players (on pvp server)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2)&amp;nbsp; Zerker snare - With the resist changes that went live in the latest patch, I have yet to see how often zerker snare lands.&amp;nbsp; From my understanding, the rate at which it lands is based on AC or possibly avoidance of a player.&amp;nbsp; As a character with 3k+ AC, I find it lands way too often, and is essentially a 99% insta-kill ability, especially considering that Zerkers are arguably the highest Burst DPS classes in the game.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Possible Solutions:&lt;br&gt;-Rangers, druids, necros, SK's, and monks all have fairly high resist rates for their snares, and Zerker snares should to be put in line with them.&lt;br&gt;-Make all forms of snare as easily landable as Zerkers (worst option)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3)&amp;nbsp; Rogue SoS - I am not sure if it was implemented on purpose or not, but giving Rogues the ability to SoS and be entirely un-noticeable by players is extremely lethal.&amp;nbsp; Over just the past couple days (since the release of TSS), I have seen single Rogues wipe out an entire group of players, simply by SoSing near and RazorArc/Daggerfall BSing them (followed immediately by SoS.&amp;nbsp; There are methods to prevent it, but that also requires that you have a specific class in your group (of which there are only 5 that fall in it).&amp;nbsp; Because of this, it means a lonely soldier, or a less than ideal group, are all potential victims to a single opponent, regardless of their gear/level.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Possible Solutions:&lt;br&gt;-Decrease their DPS in PvP when in SoS form&lt;br&gt;-Return SoS form to be visible by players&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are more to come, as there have been in the past, but these 3 are the biggest unbalancing features in EQ pvp atm (at least in my opinion).&amp;nbsp; Hopefully a dev can respond to this.&amp;nbsp; Thanks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=zek&amp;message.id=1455#M1455</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;Im a old old school pvper from way back (beta+release till PoP ruined eq pvp for me for all time).  I would assume Zek, now that other things like instances are in and even more insane gear, is worse then even sullon zek got after Planes of Power.  If so, why cant we have a red progression server, to take us back to a time when pvp was way way more balanced then it is now.. and your enemies could not hide from you in instances and safe zones.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Here is to hopeing a red progression server is launched asap.  I really do miss EQ, but I dunno if its worth it to start back on the current Zek, where I am wearing late Vellious gear and everyone else is in omgwtf gear +500.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Oh, and everyone else has 700 AA.s and im sitting at like 20ish lol.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And is it true they allow blue server people to migrate to Zek? blah.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Some Questions -- Please Help</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=zek&amp;message.id=1452#M1452</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;Hello, I just re-opened my account today, unfortunately the only account I could remember the password for was a level 10 Mage(untwinked) .  But, I have some questions regarding Zek.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;-- I know Zek runs off the Rallos Zek rules, so does that mean if you kill someone white con to you, you get to loot on item, not in a primary slot(isn't that how the old Rallos Zek rules were)?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;-- Also, isn't it a 8 level difference between players that you can attack&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;-- And last but not least, this server is everyone for themselves, correct?  Not like Tallon or Zallon where there was race alliances, right?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;-- One last thing, how is the population?  That and twinking were the main problems I had back in the day.  Wasn't enough people to kill.  Granted, EQ was very old back then and they still had all 4-5 PvP servers up, so it should be a bit better now, so I'm wondering how much better? &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Thanks in advance for helping me out!&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Mob PBAOE switches target of clerics from warrior to mob on Zek, not on other servers...</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=zek&amp;message.id=1449#M1449</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;I was doing ragewind today and when my clerics got hit with the Mobs pbaoe they switched target automatically from the warrior they were healing to the mob. Naturally this destroys the CH chain.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If its true that this does not occur on the other non pvp servers, is there some way to make it so that if you have someone targeted mob or player pbaoe does not auto change target?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In a related problem its kinda hard to do two group pbaoe on zek because your pbaoe spells will hit everyone within level range in the other group on zek, but not on other servers. Is it also possible that player cast pbaoe spells be made not to hit fellow raid members or fellow guild members, even if they are not in group?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We should not have a pve disadvatage compared to the others servers.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Starting PvP</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=zek&amp;message.id=1421#M1421</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;Anyone finding it difficult? Or is it just me? Its like 1/50 to find a guild, and the tutorial is HARD. After you get past lvl 10, it feels like your lvl 30 on your home server trying to level up, which takes days. I want to know how to survive and be luxiourous on this server. Did everyone on this server do a character transfer? Because by golly its tough leveling up, and everyone has lvl 40+ character.&lt;/div&gt;</description>
