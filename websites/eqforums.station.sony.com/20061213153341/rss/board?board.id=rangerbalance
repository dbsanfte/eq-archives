&lt;DIV&gt;Tastian asked about this and here is the reply:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
Tastian wrote:&lt;BR&gt;Endurance on "hybrid" armor.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Originally when the END system came into being hybrids didn't really need more END because of how quickly it regened and the low number of disciplines available to them.&amp;nbsp; In recent expansions hybrids have seen the addition of several disc's that now make END on items useful.&amp;nbsp; Despite this change to game dynamic though, gear has remianed unchanged to this point, and "hybrid" class armor lacks +END.&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Could we please see +END tacked onto "hybrid" armor?&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;(Merloc) In future expansions hybrids will probably see endurance added to their armor.&amp;nbsp; However, it most likely wonâ€™t be retroactively applied to armor.&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;So sounds like its a not gonna happen issue, but I will leave it up to you if you wanna settle with that . . .&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <title>Burning Questions Debate from Sept 26 that hasnt be answered</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=rangerbalance&amp;message.id=21476#M21476</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Since we have a patch day and not much else today i resort the reading my class boards again.&amp;nbsp; A guy has been asking a question for a long time with no results and a Person by the name of Gegolensmith has the perfect answer.&amp;nbsp; As you can read in the ranger boards we are currently looking for a CC.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I thought i would share a laugh and show you have much the ranger has brought to the other classes.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Please note this is For the funny side of nature.&amp;nbsp; Please leave the flames somewhere else.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Just thought&amp;nbsp; i would share a bit of the ranger community with you guys.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;========================================================================================================================&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;There are two questions in the title. For the moment I will concentrate on the second one.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;As to the question of why we are not bieng upgraded, the answer is simple. Sony has "class balanced" themselves in to a corner in regards to the ranger class.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If they improve our tanking capability the knights complain.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If they improve our melee dps the rogues, monks, and berserkers complain.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If they improve our nukes the druids complain followed closely by the shamans, beastlords, clerics, paladins, enchanters, and monks.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If they improve our utility spells the druids complain.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If they improve our archery everyone complains but first in line is rogues.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If they improve our pulling capability the monks complain.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If they improve our crowd control capabilities......&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;..........By adding a better root - The druids complain if they don't get the same thing.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;..........By giving us some form of slow - The beastlords primarily, but also the bards, enchanters, and shamans complain.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;..........By giving us some form of mez - The Enchanters and bards primarily but also every other "pure" melee that has a mez no matter how effective thiers is. If thier mez is useless as a mez and ours was they would complain that we got something better. If thiers is useless as a mez and ours is to then they complain that we are cutting into thier uses.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;For example, when the world was young, we had an unresistable, aoe, outdoor, lull. "Spell: Harmony". The clerics, enchanters, paladins, and bards complained that ours was unresistable and thiers wasn't. So it gets nerfed. To add insult to injury they give our unresistable lull to monks, (Yes not all of thier lulls are unresistable but some are up to a level cap). Lull is one of the two primary tools for pulling legitimately. By legitimatly I mean not counting things like the now nerfed pet pull. Lull and Feign Death (of some description) are the two primary tools of a puller. Sony does not (and has not for a number of years) considered rangers to be in contention for a spot as puller. Bards could fade and could lull. Monks could only fd..... so of course they &lt;EM&gt;have &lt;/EM&gt;to have a lull as well. But as we aren't pullers you see our lull bieng added in only as an afterthought when it was added at all.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So many things that where once considered ranger domains have fallen by the wayside. In Velious we where main tanks... pretty obvious that those days are long past except for the top 1% of the ranger population, and then only if a decent tank isn't available. We are melee dps, 4th in line after Berserkers, Rogues, and Monks. We are tanks, 7th in line after Warriors, Paladins,&amp;nbsp;Shadow Knights, Monks,&amp;nbsp;Rogues (although admitedly most rogues don't want to tank but there are quite a few that do), and Berserkers. We are Nukers after (Well hell that list would probably be shorter if I just listed the ones that can't out nuke us). Same thing for dots. Now your average board trolling monkey or butt bandit or meat shield reading that will say that all is right with the world. Thats the way it is supposed to be. Hybrids give up tanking and melee damage for spells, but not spells as good as the parent.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;To them my answer is simple. Sony removed the entire concept of hybrids. Not only that, Sony removed the concepts of both hybrids and pure melee. Unfortunatly when they waved thier magic nerf bat and told rangers we weren't hybrids anymore they didn't bother to undo the hybrid nerfs to abilities we suffered. Then they went and gave the "pure" melee spells that cast from endurance instead of mana. This brings to mind the very obvious question most rangers have probably asked themselves..... I gave up plate armor, melee dps, and higher AC for my spells.... what did monks and rogues and berserkers give up for thier spells? The answer of course is F A. Monks believed they weren't as good at pulling as bards..... so they &lt;EM&gt;Must!&lt;/EM&gt; get lull. Monks can't snare like&amp;nbsp;bards, rangers, and sks&amp;nbsp;can.... they &lt;EM&gt;Must!&lt;/EM&gt; have some kind of snare. After they tag that mob and get it single, they can't run back to camp as fast as bards and can't be bothered to get SoE.... they &lt;EM&gt;Must!&lt;/EM&gt; get Run 8. Monk melee dps was well short of rogues and berserkers and they wanted an increase... so they get nukes to. Rogues weren't satisfied with bieng the undisputed sustained melee dps kings... they wanted more utility! So give them a mez and anything else you can think of, just so long as it isn't as good as bard and chanter mez. Monks want more utility... give them a slow, just don't make it as good as beastlord, shaman, or chanter slow.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;For most classes the answer to complaints is to give them some new ability they never had before. Trouble is alot of the abilities they have farmed out to those other classes where ranger abilities. I remember a time when snare alone could get you groups. Hell now everyone can snare. Those that can't cast it, endurance cast it, throw a potion that casts it, proc a weapon that casts it, pick up an item that right click casts it, embue thier warder's to cast it, or give thier pets a weapon that procs it, can always find at least 1 other someone that does one of the above.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So now there are rangers. Improve any single thing they can do more then a&amp;nbsp;pitance and Sony will get complaints from at least one other class. So thier answer has been, is, and will undoubtedly continue to be..... across the board marginal, questionable upgrades (that may or may not be an actual upgrade in any sense of the word) and maintain the status quo. They still get complaints about those but not in the quantity they would get if they gave us any real upgrades or balance. And so we remain. Capable of doing lots of things, but not doing them especially well. Even the rangers that are at the top of thier game in terms of both equipment and skill (two things rarely found in the same person irregardless of class) can only hope for situational usefullness (Hatchet in DPoB is a great ranger fight) and hope that they have made enough friends earlier in thier lives to be able to find groups.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;As to what the role of rangers should be......&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Since pulling has been largely taken away from us, since spell damage has never really been our forte, since crowd control is largely a excersice in futility, I believe they should either A) Give us back at least one of those things or B) Increase both our melee and archery dps exponentially.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Unfortunatly the ranger community is itself divided. Some feel that we should be melee dps and bollux to our bows. Others love thier bows and bollux to our melee dps. Some want better nukes, some want better dots, some want to pull, some want to tank, some want to enthrall females with a single gaze, or some combination therein. Our house is divided and cannot stand.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Personally..... I'd like to see our archery damage not only outstrip our own melee dps, but rival the melee dps of monks (since they get all that extra utility and those pulling jobs). Way back when I made a ranger instead of a pure melee because I wanted to shoot things. I'd like to see our buffs improved, I'd like to see dots returned to us. I'd like a root that lands in a maximum of 2 casts, that can be chain cast, and that lasts for several minutes. But then as my grandfather was fond of saying "You can wish in one hand, and s__t in the other and see which one fills up faster". Rangers can't decide what we as a whole want. The Devs would just as soon forget about us, and the other classes like us the way we were..... no competition to them.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;120)?120:this.scrollHeight)"&amp;gt;&#xD;
&lt;CENTER&gt;But thats just my opinion..... I could be wrong.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;A href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=649904" target=_blank&gt;&lt;FONT color=#fac400&gt;Gegolen Smith&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/CENTER&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;========================================================================================================================&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Smile&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; for in a few hours we will be playing again!&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I am wondering why poeple playing a ranger think this class is fun.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;ATM I am looking for an alt to play and I am not sure wich class I will try.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;It will probably be down to playing a monk dual weilding 2 SoD or a ranger using a BoD and a SoD.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;Its been fun to participate in making the ranger class better, and we have come a long way in the right direction the past couple of years, but EQ stopped being fun for me so I have desided that EQ != Ladwenae.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <title>possible ideas for a wolf form upgrade</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=rangerbalance&amp;message.id=21424#M21424</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;As a ranger who is almost always in wolf form if the content allows wolf form is one of the spells that I would like to see upgraded at some point in the near future.&amp;nbsp; Feral Form, our last major upgrade is several expansions old and was, until recently a pita to obtain.&amp;nbsp; I was wondering what other people would like to see in the way of an upgrade for this spell.&amp;nbsp; A few things that I have herd/thought of myself.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Gryphon Form- same as current just upgrade attack and add lev.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Angry puppy- same as current just upgrade attack add a shrink component.&amp;nbsp; Admittedly of limited usefulness as wolf form already makes you short, and being any shorter could cause targeting issues.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;(insert name of big cat here) form- add some attack and a proc buff, similar to the shammie line, probably about 250 damage and procing as often as our current proc buffs do, would also serve as an upgrade to that line.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Form of the ghost pack- spirit wolf form, again add some attack and maybe put a small amount of melee guard on it sort of like the cleric aura.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Porcupine form- as always more attack and then add a ds and maybe a chance to proc a 100 or 200 point DD as a defensive proc.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Most of these probably have no chance of being implement as they would either be considered too powerful or infinge on other classes to much but is fun to mess around, and who knows.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Regards.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;so far the tss raid level armor is horrible. what the hell were you guys thinking? faerune on helm? sharpshooting7 on arms? no focus on about any other pieces? come on you guys have been running this game for what, 5 years now. you should really focus on having expansions finished before you release them imo. the cockblocks in progression alone were almost enough to make me quit this game, now seeing a bunch of the new armor i am about ready to call it quits, and i think a majority of my guild is also about to leave the game as well.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>Estimate on when Harmony will be returned</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=rangerbalance&amp;message.id=21253#M21253</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Any estimate on when Harmony will be readded to our 71-75 spells?&amp;nbsp; Really missing this spell.&amp;nbsp; The kiting 3-5 mobs is getting pretty old.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Any clue whether it will finally work indoors like it should?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;On another note,&amp;nbsp; did I miss it, or do we not have a higher level animal fear?&amp;nbsp; While not as important as Harmony or some other class issues it can be a nice tool to solo and of course handle adds ( get them running away snared and root them).&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>What is the role of a ranger and why are abilities not being upgraded.</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=rangerbalance&amp;message.id=21220#M21220</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Seriously..Ive been reading all the post due to fustration about getting to level 75. I see only being 75 helping only in Raid situations for guilds a little undergeared/staffed to progress. Also I see us having one of our roles removed largly due to no Harmony upgrade. Yes we can root/Snare tricks, but not everyone has the skills to multitask multiple mobs incoming and dont panic from it.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;What do think our role is...Offtank, Puller, Kiter, Snarer..Buffer, Healer. We are a hybrid, so by design they gave us this multirole. So, SOE..when giving classes skills/abilities/Disc &amp;amp; Spells, you must give them all the abilities and upgrades. Seriously, go back to the drawing boards and write what each class should and shouldnt do and stick with it.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Why did Monks get a MEZ? They dont Enchant or buff....Or there DoN spell is a DD????. So monks are now bards. Pull mobs, Mez and park, get another and so on...?? Yes its being done, Ive seen it yet on there class boards they say No this isnt the purpose of it..Sony, Do you guys play the class you represent as dev's or do you play other games???&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Rogues get an EVAC, yet they cant cast spells...WHo is there Parent Class?? Hell, I can gate a group to Bind, but that is looked apon kindly...&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;A tank cannot last too long with out nice gear/aa's disc's without a slower/healer...there dead...&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;A healing class (Cleric/Druid and to some extent Shamans) cant take on mobs without dying due to there designs. A smart player&amp;nbsp;can make it to the zone line if prepared, but I dont see these classes really soloing.., cept some shamans...&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;For me, my job changes from group to group...Puller if no FD classes.. Offtank in case there is multipulls..Sometimes a slower, yeah still carry Earthcaller and sometimes I still use it. Sometimes backup healer, buffer, and mostly damage dealer..Sometimes I can tank, sometimes I am the tank, this part has strickly to do with content the group is doing or if in a raid. So, from now on, we dont pull cause a WHOLE expansion, mostly flagged for outdoor and we can use a skill we are suppost to have, I dont understand an no-one can give a valid reason why it was removed. I heard it would be overpowering yet Monks get a mez for a class that not suppost to cast spells?? Dont say its a disc because MEZ is a spell. And they can cast it FD also...Yet that isnt overpowered? HELLO SONY DEV's...you see what you guys did...So I would like a Email sent to my everquest account Irongron on the prexus server to explain this. Ive played and payed for 2 account for 7 years, me and my wife...whos a druid..So, as a customer I would like an explanation..I think im entitaled to that. I asked our Class rep, Ladwenae, he couldnt give me an awnser, so Im moving up the chain of represenatives. &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>I noticed we have a new "Remove Trap" skill.&amp;nbsp; Does this mean TSS came with a ranger trap?&amp;nbsp; Don't forget we did not get one from PoR nor did we get an aura.&amp;nbsp; We also did not get a level 70 spell from DoDH.&amp;nbsp; Can you guys think of any other spells that the dev's owe us?&amp;nbsp; I don't mean spells that we should have /cough 75 paci and longer range root w/ farther kick back.&amp;nbsp; I'm talking about spells that got pulled or spells that almost every other class got as a reward e.g. DoDH's 70 spell missions. I hope they at least added the trap to the PoR era.&amp;nbsp; It is simply not fair and as if you're ignoreing the ranger class If you're giving new traps and aura's to every class in TSS.&amp;nbsp; Please pay us back for past due spells, traps and auras.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Sustained MELEE DPS now and with Serpents spine compared to others</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=rangerbalance&amp;message.id=21180#M21180</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;May be too early for this, but from what i see our sustained MELEE dps before serpents spine was somewhere in the 200-250 range with a large amount of aa (~500+), and epic or better weapons.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Although stacking all of our nukes, etc, we could achieve a decent burst dps for a couple minutes, and augment sustained dps a bit with our spells, still in the end our sustained Melee only dps really seems to lag behind many of the other melee/melee-dps classes at the high end even though we have to invest a significant amount of aa into it also.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Question one &amp;nbsp;is, where do you see us being in "sustained Melee dps" compared to other melee classes after serpent spine?&amp;nbsp; I see some, but little help in this area.&amp;nbsp; BLs got a needed augment in the innate double attack, but I really don't see anything significant for us that will help us here.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Our spell damage will incease our sustained dps a tad and our burst dps some, but&amp;nbsp;am I missing something.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Guess question 2, is where we will be in overall sustained dps on the average (not burning the mana pool down)?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Guess while our burst dps is nice to have, I find it most useful when being forced to off tank a mob that I am overmatched&amp;nbsp;with and I burn the kitchen sink trying to make him drop before I do.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>Stuff I think we should have.</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=rangerbalance&amp;message.id=21166#M21166</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I know there has been countless top 10's and everything so I just throwing&amp;nbsp;a few&amp;nbsp;ideas.&amp;nbsp; The last one I participated in it seemed like they combined some from each and made the Zerker class. Well here are my&amp;nbsp; ideas though.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Outside deagro, like rogues have SOS, monks have FD, why don't we have something like that for outdoor only, I won't ask for indoors as that would not make sense but we should be able to blend into the woods and disappear if you wanna get back to some of the things a ranger can do.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;A search line in the track box to just type in a mob and if they in track distance it comes up. (As we seem to keep getting more lazy)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Make bow/melee dps equal to please both classes of people and make agro work too as a bow should have the same agro as melee'ing. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Those are just a few.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Hi everyone,&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I have been searching for an answer to a question and connot find it definitively.&amp;nbsp; I know rangers do not get an aura/trap at level 55, but do we get anything at level 70, and if so, where does the mission for it begin.&amp;nbsp; I am not level 70 yet, but I would like to be able to research if we do get anything so I can be ready for it.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Thanks&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
