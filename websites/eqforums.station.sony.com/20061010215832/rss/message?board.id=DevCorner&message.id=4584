&lt;P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**?MARGIN: 0in 0pt?&gt;AC Mitigation Changes – Bards and Clerics&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**?MARGIN: 0in 0pt?&gt;At the summit I spoke briefly with Boanerges about cleric AC mitigation and the AC cap. The AC cap for clerics is higher than other priest classes, and at the time I also claimed that the return for AC over the cap was better for clerics over other priest classes. Looking over the data, I found this to be not true – currently clerics receive the same returns from AC over the cap as other priests.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**?MARGIN: 0in 0pt?&gt;After evaluating this today, we’ve decided to go ahead and increase the AC over the cap for clerics to match that of bards – so that bards and clerics will have both the same AC cap and same returns from AC over the cap, making their gains from AC be equal.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**?MARGIN: 0in 0pt?&gt;As far as bards are concerned, I also looked over the AC cap values for their class. Currently, the AC value for bards is set to the same values as that of monks and rogues. This seems to also be too low and after evaluation, bards will have the same cap as clerics, which is a higher value.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**?MARGIN: 0in 0pt?&gt;These two changes should give both clerics and bards more gains from AC from gear than before.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Zajeer-Dev on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;10-05-2005&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;06:40 PM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Why are monks and rogues set to the same value? Monks=cloth wearers, Rogues=chain wearers. So how can cloth protect better than chain? Assuming rangers is higher than monks and rogues, should rogues be even to the other chain wearing classes such as rangers or shamans?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

Some aspect of their training is in avoiding damage, other aspects are in reducing the amount of damage they take if they cannot avoid it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Consider trying to catch a thrown ball. If you hold your hand rigid it is difficult to catch the ball because your hand is like a wall, and the ball wants to bounce off your hand.  But if you pull your hand back a bit with the ball, but still slowing the ball... catching it is easier.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, from a story-tellers perspective, the monks have received combat training that Rangers, Rogues and other chain classes have not had and so can mitigate at the chain level.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But I agree.. I'm just making up stories here :)</description>

&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;from a story tellers perspective rogues wouldn't be caught dead in chain as they like to be quiet and secretive, and chain is quite loud to walk/run around in.&amp;nbsp; rogues would run at equal speed to monks(2 fastest classes in the game).&amp;nbsp; monks wound mitigate more damage, rogues would avoid more damage. and rogues would be able to get out of dangerous situations better then anyone, fd &amp;gt; all.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;eq isn't from a story tellers perspective though now is it?&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;As someone who is playing a beastlord main im a bit puzzled by all this ac business. Back when monks got the big ac nerf beastlords got the nerf too, their ac softcap was lowered to be the same as the one druids have, in the meantime quite a few classes, not only monks, got substantial upgrades to ac but beastlords still sit at the druid softcap meaning that they tank pretty much the same as a priest class while being advertised as a melee class. I wouldnt mind if in return any avoidance skill is higher than comparable classes (only monk and druid work since both wear leather) but that is not the case. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Is there any thought given to change beastlord ac cap and overvap gains to be inline as a hybrid? Somwhere between a pure melee (monk) and a pure caster (druid)?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Thats a point I was trying to make earlier about what reasoning were certain caps and overcap set to begin with.&amp;nbsp; It seems though they are using one method of thinking for some classes/cases and an entirely different one for another.&amp;nbsp; Doing things like this could well lead to them reviewing&amp;nbsp;these settings again&amp;nbsp;some time in the future and noticing that monk mitigates more than leather or cloth and deciding that according to reasoning method one its too high and changing it again, instead of realizing they used reasoning method two for this case.&amp;nbsp; I really think its best to apply a more logical approach to the whole system and then tweak it from there and not this adjusting the wrong areas to get the desired approach system they seem to use now.&amp;nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;I think it is a good idea for the reflected mitigation of classes to follow line with the type of armor they generally wear or are restricted by and for this to be somewhat similar for all classes that wear such armor.&amp;nbsp; This follows a common sense way of thinking and most would agree that plate would provide better 'mitigation' over chain.&amp;nbsp; I allways wondered why eq used so many different variable to accomplish the same thing (I like this), yet sometimes it seems to me that the wrong variables are tweaked to affect changes instead of the more logical ones.&amp;nbsp; I wonder how you view ac soft caps and what they are supposed to reflect.&amp;nbsp; How you view over soft cap ac and what should it reflect.&amp;nbsp; When you consider over soft cap ac are you considering defense skill?&amp;nbsp; Buffs?&amp;nbsp; Total reflected ac?&amp;nbsp; Or just worn ac?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The reason I started questioning in this manner was because there are different soft caps, and over cap values for different classess and these don't even necessarily follow similar paths for the same armor types.&amp;nbsp; I don't feel this was necessarily an accident.&amp;nbsp; These values were deliberate and took effort to make them different.&amp;nbsp; It would have been far easier to have all such types behave the same, but they were made not to.&amp;nbsp; Why were these originally set different from eachother?&amp;nbsp; What was the thinking of the programmers/designers here?&amp;nbsp; Did they wish to reflect that there is more to fighting effectively in armor than just putting it on and getting hit?&amp;nbsp; Did they wish to reflect that certain classes tended to wear heavier armor?&amp;nbsp; Perhaps more complete armor?&amp;nbsp; Maybe they meant to show that a person that might be trying to sing while getting hit or trying to cast spells while getting swung at might not be able to properly realize the full benefits of thier armor in such a case.&amp;nbsp; Whatever the case I think they had their reasons and made them vary from eachother for a purpose that made sense to them (might be obsolete now, might not).&amp;nbsp; If you make a change in one place though, must you not also view other areas since you now have a way of thinking contrary to what was the original way?&amp;nbsp; Perhaps the returns over cap and the softcap values themselves were too good when combined with the other ac influencing skills, such as defense for instance.&amp;nbsp; Now this may not be the case, I don't know, but it would seem prudent that when altering values that others put effort into making one would be wise enough to check variables and such things that also have an affect on the overall effective results of whatever this change alters.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;To sum up, I think its good that you get an understanding of what you want things to be.&amp;nbsp; I think its good that armor types behave in a way that is logical to your understanding and the overall understanding of the community.&amp;nbsp; I think once you get your understanding you should apply that way of thinking to all similar cases and then realize the impact of what this is.&amp;nbsp; Applying to all classes and cases may reveal to you something you overlooked, or something you left out.&amp;nbsp; I think you should record your reasoning so that when someone later comes along they will understand what you were thinking before they alter to their perceptions since yours may seem completely incorrect to them.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>"After evaluating this today, we’ve decided to go ahead and increase the AC over the cap for clerics to match that of bards – so that bards and clerics will have both the same AC cap and same returns from AC over the cap, making their gains from AC be equal."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"As far as bards are concerned, I also looked over the AC cap values for their class. Currently, the AC value for bards is set to the same values as that of monks and rogues. This seems to also be too low and after evaluation, bards will have the same cap as clerics, which is a higher value."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Okay... let me get this straight.  First you say that the AC cap for clerics is lower than it is for bards, and you're increasing the AC cap for clerics to be the same as bards.  Then you say that the AC cap for bards is lower than it is for clerics, and you're increasing the AC cap for bards to be the same as clerics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Did I miss something?</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;It took me a moment to put it together myself 8)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Basically he is talking about 2 different AC calculations. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The first calculation he talks about is the effective return of AC once a cleric has reached the softcap for their class (point of diminishing returns) which he is increasing.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The second calculation he talks about is the point at which Bards reach their softcap which he is raising.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Curious if we will see a similar change for Rangers soon?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Ranger gain from AC above cap is currently super small and really needs a similar action as monks and now brd/clr is getting? please!! :)&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
