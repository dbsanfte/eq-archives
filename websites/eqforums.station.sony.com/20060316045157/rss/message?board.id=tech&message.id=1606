      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Log into the Test Server.&amp;nbsp; I logged all of my computers on to the Test Server and found that 2 of my computers running old ATI Rage series cards will no longer work. I can log into the game, But can't see anything that has any textures. All&amp;nbsp;I get is a greyish blue screen with nothing but NPC names showing up.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;/em heads out to the local computer store...&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;I'm in the same boat with Tilar. I tried the Test server yesterday and the only thing I can see are the NPC names and a blue screen. I usually log on to Test about once a week so I guess this must have been a patch around March 1. Haven't tried logging on today but will to see if anything has changed,&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;/em gets second job before heading out to local computer store.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>Don't know how many people this will effect, but I know I can't play on the test server.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I know you don't officially support Linux, but there are many of us who have given up on Microsoft and play EQ in the WineX emulator from transgaming in Linux.&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately, WineX does not support DX9 yet. The game runs on my system on the test server, but the background and and characters are a uniform grey. THis makes the game completely unplayable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I know it is my choice to run Linux instead of Windows, and I know there are things that I can't do with Linux. I was just hoping EQ would not be one of the.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Any thoughts on a native Linux client????....It can't be that much different from the Mac client for OSX. After all. OSX is basically Unix with a pretty GUI.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh well,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks for the time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-Sno</description>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;It's a bit early to be making purchase decisions based on what you see on Test; we're still fixing some compatibility issues and you may find your hardware does work when we are done.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>Well, I just tried logging on to Test with my laptop and so far everything was working fine. My vid-card is a Radeon IGP 340M. Pitifull, but it worked. Thank Tunare. I was a'scared I wouldn't be able to play when the new engine went live (and maybe won't-who knows what will change between now and then). I tried the Bazaar and had no probs. Not many peeps in there though so maybe not a good test. Didn't see any of the texture glitches I've read about in other posts. Gonna cross my fingers, toes, and any other appendages I can bend far enough and keep 'em crossed 'till the new engine goes live.</description>

      <description>I found out I had a terrible card when I got into the Gates beta.&amp;nbsp; Had to go out and buy a brand new one.&amp;nbsp; Another way to check is to the station store site and look up Gates, look for minimum specs on that page.&amp;nbsp; That's how I figured out my card didn't meet the specs.&#xD;
