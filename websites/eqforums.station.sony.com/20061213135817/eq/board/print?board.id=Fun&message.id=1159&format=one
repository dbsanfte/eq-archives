<DIV>I met a girl by the name of, well, names aren't important. Let's just call her Jane. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Jane and I met for the first time in Sept. of 01.&nbsp; She had been a long time member of a guild I had recently joined back in July. She had stopped playing back in March of that year, and came back in Sept. after she seriously hurt her back and had to stay in bed for a couple of weeks, so needed something to do. She'd posted on the boards what was going on, and I had responded that i hoped she got better. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I saw her ingame a couple of days later, and we started talking. Her druid was near my level, so we started grouping together. From then on, anytime we were on together, we grouped together. We grew to be great friends, both in game and out. We learned about one another, our likes, dislikes, our quirks and our foilbles. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Sometime around mid december I realized that I had fallen head over heels for her, but didn't want to mention it, since she was married. I didn't tell anyone about how I felt, except for person. Unknown to me at the time, but she had told this same person that she had fallen for me too. He kept pestering me to tell her how I felt, to take chances, etc. </DIV>
<DIV>I finally did tell her in mid January, and that's when she told me she felt the same way.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I felt guilty about this, since she was married and all, but then I found out her husband treated her like a slave. He never complimented her, always ordered her about, constantly insulted her, etc. She didn't tell me this, I found out from her brother-in-law, who really didn't like his brother doing all that. When I asked her about it, she confirmed it, and said she had been planning on leaving him long before she met me. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>We got married ingame that following April. Shortly after that I stopped playing my druid, and started up a necro. She had started a necro previous to that, to group with my shadow knight. Our necros quickly became our mains, and they hunted together from level thirty all the way up to 65. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>In July of 02 I flew from GA to Jersey to meet her. We spent 4 glorious days together, when she wasn't busy with her harp thing. (It was some kind of convention.) I really ddin't want to come back to Ga after that, but I had responsibilities here that I just couldn't abandoned on the spot.&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>In Sept of 02 I proposed to her ingame, but this time to be married in real life, not just in game. I had been planning on waiting until we got together in real life agian before proposing, but I couldn't wait any longer. I'd been planning on doing this shortly after getting off the plane in Ga. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Her first response was no. This left me very crushed. Soon as I saw the no I /q out of game, signed out of all the messenger programs, and took my phone off the hook. (Yeah, very immature of me.) A few days later I finally talked to her again, and after getting chewed out (which I did deserve) she explained to me what she would've said if I hadn't been such a child. She wouldn't marry me right off the bat. She wanted us to live together first, and to get to know one another's family, etc. So we were engaged, with no idea when we'd be getting married. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>In April of 03 her daughter needed help moving. Her boyfriend was being abusive, and she wanted out of it. Jane came down to Ga, and we spent the night together. The next day we left for St. Petersburg, Fla to help her daughter pack up and move. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Needless to say her daughter didn't like me, and certainly didn't like her mother dating a man younger than her youngist daughter was.&nbsp; That was the beginning of the end for us. They went back to CT, and I stayed in Ga. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>In June of 04 we started talking, and our relationship ended. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>There was far too many things in our way for us to have a good relationship. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>One was her being more than 35 years older than me. I wanted children, and she simply couldn't have anymore. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Another was our families. Neither of her daughters liked it. They considered me to be a gold digger, even after I explained I could care less about money the such many a time. They seemed to think I wanted to be put as the sole benifit thingie if she died. Which I didn't. I constantly said not to ever put my name on anything like that. Most of my family didn't care, as such relationships weren't unheard of in our family. My one sister was a real bitch about it though. She told each of us lies, called Jane a cradle robber, etc. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Something else was where we wanted to live. She wanted to be up north with her family, I wanted to be down south with mine.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>After all that, and a few other things, we just decided to end the relationship. We both still love one another, care for each other, talk on a daily basis, but our relationship is over. </DIV></DIV>
