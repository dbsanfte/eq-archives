    <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I know this is a shaman board, but it is a great topic.... (Note I am not in an uber guild and do not have any flags and only one key (Seb).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;1. 64 Halfling Rogue totally not soloable, but fun as heck&amp;nbsp;to play if I can find a group.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;2. 58 Froglok Cleric is one of the most enjoyable because I know my part in a group is important.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;3. 56 Dark Elf Necromancer was kind of my I cannot find a group, but don;t want to waste 2 hous with LFG on.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;4. 46 Vah Shir Beastlord was my attempt at my friends favorite class.&amp;nbsp; It is actually my weakest toon IMO.&amp;nbsp; Pets become light blue and useless.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;5. 42 Ogre Warrior was made because I could never find one, so I would help others get a group and have a tank.&amp;nbsp; Really fun to play.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;6. 24 Gnome Enchanter just cause I wanted to try it.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;7. 23 Halfling Druid becuase I heard they could solo, but more for constant SoW and portability.&amp;nbsp; Problem was they do not compare to a necro for dots, they just get targetable heals for their trouble.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;8. 29 Erudite Magician What can I say, I love INT research, and the pets are decent, though not as good as necro pet tanking IMO.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;9. 11 Froglok Shaman&amp;nbsp; I once got an Iksar shaman to 24, but the 20% exp burden did burn me out.&amp;nbsp; But there are WAY to many barb shaman in the game, so I made a Froglok becuase that is my favorite race.&amp;nbsp; I really enjoy the buffs on my high toons and hope I can enjoy this one more then the Iksar.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;In the end, I am an ALT-aholic.&amp;nbsp; I like to play the game from the different perspectives so I can take in the full game.&amp;nbsp; My toons are most on home server, but the mage and shaman are on another server due to not playing 3-boxquest.&amp;nbsp; I do not get to buff or rez myself ever, but I rather help others anyway.&amp;nbsp; I had a Human Bard once that got to 21, but I paid to leave a server and she got stripped and deleted.&amp;nbsp; The AOE nerf didnt make me remake one.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I firmly believe there ware way to many elves played in the game so I will not make one, and the human only makes sence for bard and monk because of no decent atributes, however for bard, they do not have high STR and low INT or CHA like other bard races.&amp;nbsp; Flatline for bard is good.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I love tradeskilling, I just cannot afford it.&amp;nbsp; 243 Poison crafting, 186 Pottery(Necro), 174 Research (necro), 154 Research (Enchanter), and everything else besides jewel crafting on the necro is from 100-135.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If I could wish for a couple small changes, I would wish for places, maybe instances that were made specificly for solo play by each class...&amp;nbsp; Rogues cannot root, cannot heal, cannot snare, but you can testtheir abilities and skills maybe teach people how to play their class...&amp;nbsp; Kind of like setting up and individualized gauntlet for each class that is based on level.&amp;nbsp; Every level you have thee ability to go up 5 points in ALL major skills.&amp;nbsp; An enchanter that cannot use divination (change forms) may not survive, or a Rogue that doesn't know how hide and sneak work better behind mobs then infromt, but would give every class something to do when no one else is around to play with or the LFG tool only has level 70 people that only want to play in places you have never heard of cause no one invites you to go out with them, or you are too low cause you do not have enough AA's to live.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I do think they need to stop nerfing everything and let casual players get into the game more.&amp;nbsp; I want to see Plane of Time, but no way will I ever be able to go there unless I leave my good group of friends, and that is sad.&amp;nbsp; That is like saying, you PAY us the same monthly amount, but because you can only play for 2 hours a few nights a week and School Boy Tom Joe can play from 3 PM to 10 PM you don;t have any right to see content.&amp;nbsp; I see this as a total bias.&amp;nbsp; I seriously enjoy the play I get, and love the people I get to talk to, but I really wish I could see / do / earn more then I am allowed to do because I made good friendships in the game and do not have the time for the much bigger stuff.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Last thing I got to say, I just need to get off my chest.&amp;nbsp; I woull buff, heal, help, share knowledge with ANYone, no matter what level, guild or too they are in / from.&amp;nbsp; I have lost ALL respect for a couple guilds because they do not know what MMORPG means.&amp;nbsp; They tell their players that they cannot group outside of guild groups and no usung LFG tool.&amp;nbsp; It not only hurts them if there is an odd man out or even 5 but no healer, it hurts everyone cause that means there are less players to find to group with.&amp;nbsp; I wish no one would they they are better then anyone, we were all newbs sometime, weather it was 6 years aog, 2 years ago, or 5 weeks ago.&amp;nbsp; Sorry for the big complaing, but I think if people read it, they might just decide to help a family guild ot 5 accomplish something rather then watch them all turn to dust beause no one is capable of helping anyone EARN much.&amp;nbsp; When you want to earn parts of the cleric epic 10 and not enough clerics or tanks on to do it, so you give up on being able to help people by offering free 96% rezzes even on drive by.&amp;nbsp; It is like the players say I do not want to help you even though that might make you a better player (spells and research components are outrageous in bazaar), or help other players benefit more in the long run.&amp;nbsp; Thank you for reading and I hope you agree with me.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Garamond color=#66ff00 size=3&gt;Hello and well met yet again.. For the past few months I have ranted and raved along with the best&amp;nbsp;of them on how displeased I was with Sony, with the Shaman, with my Sk so on and so fourth..The other day while still in mid rant, my good friends stopped me, looked me dead in the eye and said.."if you hate the game so much why do you play?&amp;nbsp; If you dont hate the game, what do you find that gives you enjoyment.."&amp;nbsp; I quickly closed my mouth and put on my most thoughtfull expression and said nothing for a bit..Then, after a few minutes of reflection I looked up and said... Exploring the new zones and hanging out with friends cracking jokes and rping...So there, thats why I havent quit..So tell me, no ranting, no boo hooing, tell me what still gives you pleasure in the game..&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>Pamela Sue and the rest of the forum. I owe you all an apology. My previous post should not have been dragged into the forum especcially into a thread which Viking intended to look for a sense of positiveness. I let my personal feelings overcome me and dictate my actions. For that I apologize. I should have PM'd Pamela if I had such a personal greivance towards her. I apologize to you Pamela for such a blatant display of malice towards you. I do not know you personally and as i stated earlier, tones in text get quite wishy washy at times. Again I'd like to apologize to everyone, especially Pamela.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Have a great day.    -Frost</description>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;There's still fun things to do at 65 with a shaman.&amp;nbsp; I like killing new things with the guild, seeing new zones, figuring out how to kill the new bosses.&amp;nbsp; A cheery and interesting guild makes or breaks it.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The best part of 65 is I&amp;nbsp;do not feel the need&amp;nbsp;to grind exp anymore, so I am free to go do other things.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;P&gt;I still enjoy wandering around old content, just enjoying a good dungeon crawl making mistakes like 'not letting the chanter die' or even really messing things up by 'not letting the chanter get hit'. I'm spending a lot of time in Seb at the moment (I want to get some good faction in Cabalis so I can start the Cudgel quests), when I'm not there I'm nosing around Chardok B, a great place to have to ask for help on a CR from - and working through Chardok naked is interesting on it's own.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I love finding out how life is for my guildees, and most of the time I'm not too worried about what I'm doing as long as I'm with my friends. I spent about 6 hours in Lake Rathe, camping Lord Beergoggles. My friend hates to camp, hates to quest and after 6 hours another friend came along to help - and messed up the hand in. I don't know why, but I enjoyed it all.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Give me a night where our Kamakaze Kitty shows up with his latest Idea on how to die, and let us see if he's right. We've been getting dissapointed in him recently since we keep surviving.&amp;nbsp; I can spend a whole night where my role isn't slower or buffer, healer or dps (low dps I admit). My role in the group is Shaman, and in that role I do what I need to.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I know I'll hit 65 soon enough, but I'm in no hurry to get there while there are still places to crawl and have fun. I can't stand any pull to camp sessions, so it's a very rare day that you will find me in the planes. Don't get me wrong, I can see that there are problems in the endgame, I'm just not in any rush to get there.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I enjoy my guild Faydark's First - super bunch of people. Not (and never have been) people aiming for uberdom, getting there accidentally.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I enjoy standing firm in a pick-up group where everyone else is legging it for zone, as long as I have one other Faydark's to stand back to back with.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I enjoy showing shaman still have power despite all the limitations and inequalities between us and other classes.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I enjoy not being able to shrink my pet so that our bard keeps trying to mezz him instead of the adds and gets really peeved :smileyvery-happy:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I enjoy writing novelette style features as raid writeups for the guild.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Most of all I enjoy finding a new way to die... and surviving.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>I enjoy the friends and family feeling of my guild, they are why I keep playing, and having fun.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; There have been a few times where I would log on, and be feeling down and my guild would joke and tease, and bring my spirits right up.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; As well as a few of my friends.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Plus there are moments when my hubby and I can get a group going and we head over to GE (Greig's End)&amp;nbsp; and just plow through there, and just have a blast. we may have a death or 2, HOWEVER, we are all having a blast, and that is what matters.&amp;nbsp; And that is what I enjoy about this game.&#xD;

      <description>Ok, if you want civility go read my other post. This will not include it. Pamela Sue, lets go over a few things here. First, you continually post threads indicating you're leaving the Shaman, EQ, you even butcher a song to get your little point across. Second, you keep saying you're through. Yet you keep returning. Quiting EQ means leaving, not stop playing the game and returning to the EQ forums to spout negativity and insults. For the most part the people with the issues here are doing a fairly good job of keeping things civil, sometimes feathers get ruffled and poeple misunderstand tone and bite back a little. But with you it is the same infernal complaining, whining, name calling, sniveling griping, to name but a few. So could you please do EQ, this forum and everyone within a 500 mile radius of you a big favor and go outside, disable your powerlines, go back in, board up your windows and doors and shut the **SMURF** UP! As of yet I have not seen one single post by you in this forum that lends any help or credence to the high end problems some are facing here. Please, change your diaper and quit yer whining. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;       -Frost</description>

      <description>I really enjoyed GoM.  Past tense unfortunately now.  Now I enjoy playing my bard!  I think they are trying to phase Shaman out unfortunately and if that is the case they are doing a fine job.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I know this is a shaman board, but it is a great topic.... (Note I am not in an uber guild and do not have any flags and only one key (Seb).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;1. 64 Halfling Rogue totally not soloable, but fun as heck&amp;nbsp;to play if I can find a group.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;2. 58 Froglok Cleric is one of the most enjoyable because I know my part in a group is important.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;3. 56 Dark Elf Necromancer was kind of my I cannot find a group, but don;t want to waste 2 hous with LFG on.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;4. 46 Vah Shir Beastlord was my attempt at my friends favorite class.&amp;nbsp; It is actually my weakest toon IMO.&amp;nbsp; Pets become light blue and useless.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;5. 42 Ogre Warrior was made because I could never find one, so I would help others get a group and have a tank.&amp;nbsp; Really fun to play.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;6. 24 Gnome Enchanter just cause I wanted to try it.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;7. 23 Halfling Druid becuase I heard they could solo, but more for constant SoW and portability.&amp;nbsp; Problem was they do not compare to a necro for dots, they just get targetable heals for their trouble.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;8. 29 Erudite Magician What can I say, I love INT research, and the pets are decent, though not as good as necro pet tanking IMO.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;9. 11 Froglok Shaman&amp;nbsp; I once got an Iksar shaman to 24, but the 20% exp burden did burn me out.&amp;nbsp; But there are WAY to many barb shaman in the game, so I made a Froglok becuase that is my favorite race.&amp;nbsp; I really enjoy the buffs on my high toons and hope I can enjoy this one more then the Iksar.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;In the end, I am an ALT-aholic.&amp;nbsp; I like to play the game from the different perspectives so I can take in the full game.&amp;nbsp; My toons are most on home server, but the mage and shaman are on another server due to not playing 3-boxquest.&amp;nbsp; I do not get to buff or rez myself ever, but I rather help others anyway.&amp;nbsp; I had a Human Bard once that got to 21, but I paid to leave a server and she got stripped and deleted.&amp;nbsp; The AOE nerf didnt make me remake one.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I firmly believe there ware way to many elves played in the game so I will not make one, and the human only makes sence for bard and monk because of no decent atributes, however for bard, they do not have high STR and low INT or CHA like other bard races.&amp;nbsp; Flatline for bard is good.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I love tradeskilling, I just cannot afford it.&amp;nbsp; 243 Poison crafting, 186 Pottery(Necro), 174 Research (necro), 154 Research (Enchanter), and everything else besides jewel crafting on the necro is from 100-135.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If I could wish for a couple small changes, I would wish for places, maybe instances that were made specificly for solo play by each class...&amp;nbsp; Rogues cannot root, cannot heal, cannot snare, but you can testtheir abilities and skills maybe teach people how to play their class...&amp;nbsp; Kind of like setting up and individualized gauntlet for each class that is based on level.&amp;nbsp; Every level you have thee ability to go up 5 points in ALL major skills.&amp;nbsp; An enchanter that cannot use divination (change forms) may not survive, or a Rogue that doesn't know how hide and sneak work better behind mobs then infromt, but would give every class something to do when no one else is around to play with or the LFG tool only has level 70 people that only want to play in places you have never heard of cause no one invites you to go out with them, or you are too low cause you do not have enough AA's to live.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I do think they need to stop nerfing everything and let casual players get into the game more.&amp;nbsp; I want to see Plane of Time, but no way will I ever be able to go there unless I leave my good group of friends, and that is sad.&amp;nbsp; That is like saying, you PAY us the same monthly amount, but because you can only play for 2 hours a few nights a week and School Boy Tom Joe can play from 3 PM to 10 PM you don;t have any right to see content.&amp;nbsp; I see this as a total bias.&amp;nbsp; I seriously enjoy the play I get, and love the people I get to talk to, but I really wish I could see / do / earn more then I am allowed to do because I made good friendships in the game and do not have the time for the much bigger stuff.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Last thing I got to say, I just need to get off my chest.&amp;nbsp; I woull buff, heal, help, share knowledge with ANYone, no matter what level, guild or too they are in / from.&amp;nbsp; I have lost ALL respect for a couple guilds because they do not know what MMORPG means.&amp;nbsp; They tell their players that they cannot group outside of guild groups and no usung LFG tool.&amp;nbsp; It not only hurts them if there is an odd man out or even 5 but no healer, it hurts everyone cause that means there are less players to find to group with.&amp;nbsp; I wish no one would they they are better then anyone, we were all newbs sometime, weather it was 6 years aog, 2 years ago, or 5 weeks ago.&amp;nbsp; Sorry for the big complaing, but I think if people read it, they might just decide to help a family guild ot 5 accomplish something rather then watch them all turn to dust beause no one is capable of helping anyone EARN much.&amp;nbsp; When you want to earn parts of the cleric epic 10 and not enough clerics or tanks on to do it, so you give up on being able to help people by offering free 96% rezzes even on drive by.&amp;nbsp; It is like the players say I do not want to help you even though that might make you a better player (spells and research components are outrageous in bazaar), or help other players benefit more in the long run.&amp;nbsp; Thank you for reading and I hope you agree with me.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I quit eq for 1.5 years, played wow to a level 60 priest...played EQ2 to a 45 defiler and all in all was left wanting and missing my SHaman, i missed my iksar, the abilities he had and most of all teh players in eq, he is a 65 shm with a few aa but he was and still is the only character that i compare all others too....i enjoy eq because is hard, frustrating and takes some amount of skill to play well.&amp;nbsp; I enjoy eq because over everything else.....it has a certain somthing i cant put my finger on but it always brings me back.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>Im a senior officer in a large guild, so I have a lot of interaction both in action and in chats with many players and this I like the most. My experience in the game and leading shaman guildies step by step thur both epic 1 and 1.5 is very rewarding for me. I love all the friends I made from my guild and other guilds, and even players who left our guild still keep in touch with me. I do miss the many players I knew for years that have left for this past fall for the other 2 games that came along. A few still keep email contact with me, but its not the same. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for what I like about the game ... well ... nothing anymore. The nerfing has ruined any game play ‘FUN’ it use to have. Oh well, maybe thats why I haven’t log on much in the past 6 months and am seriously thinking about cancelling an account I once revered as my golden outlet.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;As a shaman:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;OL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;I love my Hound Dog, as wimpy as he may be.&amp;nbsp; He's mine and has saved my life on a number of occasions.&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;I love my Drogmor.&amp;nbsp; He's the slowest critter in Norrath, but its all about mana regen, not running from one location to another.&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;I love killing Ice Giants - As a gimpy as that may sound, when I was a young'n, I actually had one kill me when I accidently went into the area to "see what was there..."&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;I love casting Stoicism on the main tank in a last ditch effort to save the day.&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;I love my High Elf Paladin honey, Erylon, who always gets lost FIRST, before we even start exploring.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;That's enough for now.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;1.&amp;nbsp; Corpse Recoveries.&amp;nbsp; Mine or other peoples'.&amp;nbsp; The thrill of going into a situation you know is dangerous, possibly inadequately equipped, and having to puzzle out how to get around the obstacles (they see invis? hmmm...) to reach your goal.&amp;nbsp; Going places you would never have gone, except that someone was kind enough to die there.&amp;nbsp; (You're in the lava?&amp;nbsp; OK, I'll cast fire resist and jump in and see how much it hurts, but no promises....hey this isn't so bad, I can handle it.)&amp;nbsp; (OK, in Ocean of tears, in the water...could you be a LITTLE more specific?&amp;nbsp; I only have one charge left on this chipped bone rod...)&amp;nbsp; The new guild hall summoning room means new players will never know the thrill of a good corpse run.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;2.&amp;nbsp;Saving the day.&amp;nbsp; Others have posted that here.&amp;nbsp; We shamans are perhaps the best class at rescuing a team from disaster because we can (sort of ) do it all...healing, crowd control, off tanking...if we keep our heads.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;3.&amp;nbsp; Helping new players, by teaching and explaining (not power leveling which I think hurts new players).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
