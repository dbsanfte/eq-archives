<DIV>Friday was a busy day for me... At the end of it I was wishing for an order of sleep and a pair of new legs...</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The day started off with the Best of the Best Tournament.&nbsp; Brenlo played the announcer all day.&nbsp; He did play by plays, heckled the contestants and the crowd.&nbsp; This started at about 10 AM and went on until just before 5 PM...&nbsp; And again he didn't lose his voice!</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>

<DIV><BR>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>After stopping by the Best of the Best, I ran over to the Dev Brunch...&nbsp; I didn't get to hang out and listen but I did take a few fly by pictures.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>

<DIV><EM><FONT size=1>That’s Zorillus in the blue shirt, seated next to him in red is Rapaz and that's Gordish on his other side.</FONT></EM></DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>After the Dev Brunch I ran over to help Kytherea with the EverQuest 2 Live Quest.&nbsp; I snapped a bunch of pictures of that but since it's EQ2 I won't bore you with them.&nbsp; I did give them to Blackguard to post so if you are interested you might be able to find them over there...</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Halfway through the Live Quest I was asked to help out with the Best of the Best so I jumped in and prepared computers for the folks that were setting up.&nbsp; Here are some folks setting up...</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Look it's Grunts, our Ranger correspondent.&nbsp; I think this was right after he participated in the tournament.<BR></DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>During the tournament quite a few of the participants played Shadowknights and rogues and hid until the end of the fight.&nbsp; These 2 gentlemen gave us, what I think was the best fight of the day...</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>There were panels through out the day and sadly I only had time to sit in on the "EQ and EQII Community Discussion."&nbsp; We discussed the boards and we briefly touched on the Top 10 Issues lists...&nbsp; We talked about class re-envisionement, and Ky and I are going to look into taking the list found <A href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=64032" target=_blank>here</A>, and marking what's been done and in some cases the status of what is being worked on.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>After the panels were over I headed over to the Phat Loot store.&nbsp; I worked behind the counter before it was time to head to the Banquet.&nbsp; Before I headed over there I ran across Firiona Vie…<BR></DIV>
<DIV><IMG src="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/forum_images/community/LVFanFaire2005/Firiona.jpg"></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>NOW it was time for the Banquet!!&nbsp; We all ate some delicious food and Brenlo gave out some great prizes.&nbsp; Brenlo had random contests through out the evening like "Who has a New York Driver's License," and other various US driver's licenses...&nbsp; Or who traveled the furthest...&nbsp; A group of people lined up on the stage and told us where they were from.&nbsp; We had someone from the Netherlands, someone from Australia, and the winner was from China!!&nbsp; Brenlo gave prizes away to the best impersonations of Antonia Bayle and Lucan D'Lere as well.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>After a ton of fun on stage it was time for the Costume contest...&nbsp; Here are some pictures of that...</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>A panel of SOE employees acted as judges.&nbsp; They couldn't decide on just one, so they picked 4.&nbsp; Here are the winners...</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Once the contest was over most people headed off in their own groups to hang out...&nbsp; There must have been a ton that went to Quark's because when our group arrived it was standing room only.&nbsp; We grabbed some tables and talked and laughed and had a good time.&nbsp; I waved good night to everyone and went to bed early...</DIV>
