      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;What's the first time you were playing EQ and came across a mob, a zone, an NPC, etc. that just made you /boggle?&amp;nbsp; When you realized that this whole EQ thing was a lot more complicated, dangerous, and scary than you had ever imagined?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;For me, it was my first run-in with an Evil Eye in the Gorge of King Xorbb.&amp;nbsp; That cheery little "you have lost control" message, and my watching helplessly as my character began healing bad guys and following this eye around like a puppy?&amp;nbsp; And meanwhile none of my group members were getting the messages I was frantically typing to them??&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Okay, I'm STILL boggling over that one.&amp;nbsp; The thing where I couldn't type to my group members was just the final detail that wows me.&amp;nbsp; In an RP sense, that was fantastic.&amp;nbsp; Glad it wore off in time...&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>The first time I fought an orc oracle in EC and it cast blindness on me.&amp;nbsp; It took me a while to realize my monitor hadn't gone out on me, and from then on, I was much more careful about attacking mobs I had never encountered before.&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I would have to say being blinded.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; My friend and I were hunting back when I first started out, when all of a sudden my screen went black and I was sure my monitor had bit the dust.&amp;nbsp; I tabbed out of the game and sent him a message on messenger explaining what was happening, to which he responded "You've been blinded, you goof!".&amp;nbsp; It was actually quite humorous after it was all over.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Ahh the good ol' days.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;Oh hmm..&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;One would be the ability for roaming mobs to hit you.. i was medding in the safety of the inn, and a Lion came through the wall and ate me. I thought that was pretty dumb.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;What else.. I didn't like how easy it was/is to interrupt spell casting.. slightest breeze..&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;How they increased fizzle rates just so they could add in anti-fizzle AA abilities. (I never EVER fizzled that much) and made me say, "They can do that?"&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;P&gt;Hehe, the first time I was ever blinded was in the Gorge of King Xorbb, little mudmen. I was SO freaked out, freaked out from being in a new zone to begin with, freaked out by the mudmen in general, and then barely surviving the battle and suddenly... what went wrong with&amp;nbsp; my monitor? Oh man, what timing, my god! I got my sight back just in time to make it to safety, and was just glancing at the screen while I was hollering at my husband to come figure out what was wrong&amp;nbsp; with the monitor, when I saw the blinded message and figured it out. I felt really silly. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Frankly I think your chat window should remain visible when you are blinded, so you can see that you have been blinded. Losing your chat screen amounts to being blind AND deaf.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Another thing that totally freaked me out was boats. They always did goofy things and I was terrified to ride them. Once, a boat I was riding pathed near some rocks and simply deposited me on them, and off it went. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;P&gt;If you really feel the need to communicate with your group that you have been charmed. Use emotes, type a colon first then type your message. But it's kind of pointless because your group should quickly realize you have been charmed anyway.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;If blinded you can still cast spells ( if you a caster) by using the alt/number 1-8 keys. 1 being the first spell on top in your spell line up .&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>For me, I think it was the first time I got blinded.  A muddite in the Gorge of King Xorbb threw mud in my eyes.  I thought my video card had failed!  Then the picture came back.  Then vanished again.  I was thinking maybe the card had come loose in the socket.  After the fight, I was scrolling back through the messages and noticed the line saying I was blinded.  Big relief!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the line of, I did something dangerous and was blissfully unaware of it:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wanted to get to Qeynos; as a level 19 Wood Elf Ranger growing up in Kelethin, the only way was to run.  So, I visited EQAtlas, carefully wrote down which zones I had to travel through and headed out.  I got to Kithicor Forest and it was night time.  I ran along the road, listening to the weird noises and thinking, this is a creepy place.  Later, someone told me never to run through Kithicor at night because of the undead.  First time, I did not encounter a single mob!  Tunare was with me that night, heh heh.</description>

      <description>First time I was feared - at the fort in LOIO.&amp;nbsp; I ended up running down the halls, gathering a huge train and there i was mashing every movement key over and over again.&amp;nbsp; I had no idea what had happened and thought the game had just gone completely whacky. &#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;For me, I've had three boggling experiences.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The first time happened while I was peacefully medding by the ocean in the Oasis.&amp;nbsp; It was the patch of ocean near the zone-in from North Ro.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Suddenly a sand giant popped directly on top of me and after one blow, I was mincemeat.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The second time happened when a guard near the inn in North Ro,&amp;nbsp;quickly&amp;nbsp;turned me into a mudpie while I was sitting next to him.&amp;nbsp; It was during the Halloween Special Event and with all the excitement, I had forgotten I was using the earth elemental illusion.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;And the third time happened in the Ocean of Tears.&amp;nbsp; The group I was with was trained by someone who was dragging around the corrupted cyclops.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I happened to be the last one to die, but it was the most memorable death.&amp;nbsp; The corrupted summoned me out into the middle of the ocean and then killed me.&amp;nbsp; There's nothing more disconcerting than seeing yourself sink to the bottom of the ocean.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;gotta be the first time I was blinded here too LOL&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;scared the heck out of me, thought I'd messed up my puter and was very upset...&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;rebooted, ran all the tests I could and all that stuff *looks sheepish*&amp;nbsp; THEN someone told me about the blind spells *rolls eyes*&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;For me it was the first time I tried to down a stack of booze in game.&amp;nbsp; It was awesome how the screen went fuzzy and I couldn't walk without swaying and going the wrong way.&amp;nbsp; Then about 15 minutes later I could see things clearly again and I haven't really drank much since.&amp;nbsp; But that first time --- wow! &#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
