    <title>Why Nerf Necros again?</title>
    <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Veterans&amp;message.id=215315</link>
    <description>&lt;div&gt;from fan-faire, i heard the developers are in agreement with all the non-necros that we need to be nerfed...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;1. how many developers have played a necro as their main? just curious... and after that, how many of them played necro back when we were nothing more than mana batteries from kunark till planes of power? top raiding guilds didnt want us, except to save a CR/wipe (and then when they nerfed droppable chain cast mod rods, we finally got wanted again, as mana batteries). i knew several necros that changed mains to cleric or enchanter, because after learning to play your necro for 50 levels, they redefined what our job was.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;2. rogues, rangers, bst, mage, wizzy, bzkr, sk, pal, all out dps us on raids. yeah, we get big dps with dots, but since we are also mindwracking, feigning off agro, feeding mana to newer, lower mana pool cle/dru on raids, we fall well behind everyone else on dps.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;3. we get a 2 minute snare that has a dot component, so it rules out crowd control if used, and results in summoning of us if its a summoning mob that we would rather lock down. short/dot snare is better than none, but by far, no reason to justify nerfing us, compared to classes that get a 10 to 14 minute snare.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;4. crappy utility spells (group taps = ac and atk) that both use a buff slot for an insignificant boost in those stats. mindwrack was 300 mana/minute when mana pools were 5k in luclin. our brand new shining upgrade is 340 mana/minute, with 10 to 12k mana pools... woohoo. our group heal is like, 1k hp over about 30 seconds, again, at the cost of a buff slot. the buff slot feature makes these spells near useless, especially in zones where mobs cast 2, 3, or 4 near unresistable ae debuffs/dots (anguish???).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;5. we still have the same mana feed spells we got back in our mid 50's when we were feeding 4k mana pools, costing us 450 mana to feed 150, with like a 12 second recast.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;6. mage and bst pets are still significantly stronger than ours, they have better pet buffs, and bst can slow, while mages get 2 1k+ heals on different timers... oh wait, i forgot, we get pet feign death that only fails like 2/3 of the time, and we can slow the vast array of undead mobs.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;7. we get undead mez/charm... refer to &amp;quot;vast array&amp;quot; in item 6 above. remember when you nerfed our charm because some ballsy necros didnt mind dying a couple times an hour, to solo 3 or 4 aa/hour in crypt of decay? one frigging zone, that was a crap shoot to find it not being camped by 2 or 3 necros in the undead portion to begin with.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;8. wizzy got huge upgrades/improvement to mana burn this release, a spell they can still land in pvp... lifeburn still gets me killed from hp agro or a badly timed mob ae or rampage after casting, from time to time, and it doesnt land in pvp either...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;9. speaking of pvp... lifetap dots were nerfed to not work in pvp years ago, as was fear. with todays resists, ALL purecasters are now shafted in pvp. casters are obsolete in pvp. the only strength of necros is our low resist check lifetaps. wizzies get lures, chanters get unresistable MR debuff, mages get malos... but for the most part, resists make all casters useless.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;10. lifetap is one of the best line of spells in game, but to balance its dps + healing effect, and its low resist rate, its 1300 hp unfocused... with aa/focus/bard song, can get like 4k crits from time to time (normal range is about 2k/cast). ive seen wizzies landing 10k+ nukes consistently, and mages in the 7k to 10k range. enchanters cant **SMURF** about dps at all, as anyone that ever made a chanter for dps shouldnt be playing eq anyways. they have their own strengths that separate them from the rest of us dps class casters (slow, haste, mezz, debuff, aa to FM themselves, etc... just not a dps class so no grounds to really complain about their dps vs other dps based classes).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;11. melee classes need to **SMURF** about us, as ive been in arena with monks, rogues, war, pal, sk's... that pretty much tear me up over time... i spend the whole fight shadowstepping, trying to get a lifetap off that is resisted or partially resisted, since all my other spells wont land on anyone time geared or higher, sucking thru mana... and once mana is gone, im useless/dead, just like any other caster. when a melee takes a rez, yeah they have rez effects, but quick heal, and theyre back in business... caster takes a rez, and we get to med up for the next 5 to 10 minutes unless we have an aa up, with limited use during the recovery time. in other words, a caster rezzed into a fight, with ae's, is dead again, with our lower hp/ac/mitigation. tank rezzed in, loots, and can start getting heals.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;12. heals... druids can nearly CH now, and in my guild, they have used druid CH rotations on big raid mobs in top end zones. so what if we get better dps, they are far more versatile. clerics cant solo for crap, but with huge hp buffs, huge heals, and rezzes, make them indespensable to any group (followed closely by druids). i had a shaman in guild tank the 3 red con pally mobs for my necro epic 2.0, and hold agro... but yeah, they dont get snare, so nerf necros...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;so boohoo that someone cant solo as good as us... the majority of the time, when looking for a group, a necro is the extra dps class they want to throw in, after theyve got their tank, healers, slower, crowd control, puller (yes, monks out pull necros since their FD isnt a spell and get a substantial boost to their ability to feign thru a spell... necros get a &amp;quot;15% chance&amp;quot; with max aa in it, according to developers, ive had it work once...)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;most people i talk to dont like soloing, but they sure use it as an excuse to nerf those of us who do. we can solo red con mobs, in like 2, maybe 3 zones, since they dont summon and snare lands. btw, we have to have 3 people to get the missions, so its not like we walk in and just start racking up aa... kiting has been a part of necro, druid, and wizzy abilities since eq started 6+ years ago... so what, lets nerf it now? its a 6 year bug that you guys are just getting around to? **SMURF**... why not fix the countless other bugs, broken quests, pathing issues first, then renovate a few more crappy zones, THEN think about and dismiss the idea of nerfing necros yet again, back to our level 50's lack of usefulness with crappy support spells, crappy dps, and mediocre pets.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;i love my class, its balanced, and ive played it since i started, this main being since kunark, with another before that even, shortly after beta. back when pets were kos, invis/ITU poofed pets, they couldnt be suspended or put on hold, warped thru dungeons then back to you with trains, when we did NOTHING but feed mana on raids, and had to be grateful that we were even wanted on the raids. werent allowed to use dots ever, on raids, in case you dotted a mob they needed to mez later, had a crappy feign death spell at 20, that was our only one till we got death peace in PoP like 7 expansions later, which, btw, has been stealth nerfed since the release of PoR, where i never fell to ground 2x in a row, now i'm falling to ground, like 1/3 of the time, sometimes 3 or 4 times in a row... other necros have noticed it, and its BS... at least have the balls to put the message in the patch notes.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;if you are concerned about class balance, make it so researchers can create usable versions of their classes spells, that other classes can use. low level versions with lower skills, high level versions with higher skills. people would love to buy a lifetap, FD, or snare spell... make it so you have one or two extra spell gems that can be used for a cross class spells, and after you mem it, takes an hour before it can be unmemmed... make it an aa, starting at like level 30, where you guys are talking about lowering the aa's to that level anyways, with higher ranks reducing the time it takes to rescribe a spell (make it exempt from unmemming if you die, or mem a spell set). further, add in item slots in game, where spells of certain ranks can be scribed into the item, for any class, adding a clickable effect of the spell scribed to it. this lets other classes share some of the benefits of each other, while shutting people up about nerfing someone that can do one or two things better than they can.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

Hell if you can kill a GOD wouldn't that justify you as one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was not on thing i found truthful let alone productive in that post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Except&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;if you are concerned about class balance, make it so researchers can create usable versions of their classes spells, that other classes can use. low level versions with lower skills, high level versions with higher skills. people would love to buy a lifetap, FD, or snare spell... make it so you have one or two extra spell gems that can be used for a cross class spells, and after you mem it, takes an hour before it can be unmemmed... make it an aa, starting at like level 30, where you guys are talking about lowering the aa's to that level anyways, with higher ranks reducing the time it takes to rescribe a spell (make it exempt from unmemming if you die, or mem a spell set). further, add in item slots in game, where spells of certain ranks can be scribed into the item, for any class, adding a clickable effect of the spell scribed to it. this lets other classes share some of the benefits of each other, while shutting people up about nerfing someone that can do one or two things better than they can.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;Now I don't agree with giving everyone the tools of everyone else's class's. But, to give each class a spell gem or two for cross class spells in lesser forms would help make all classes much more versatile. But considering them being lesser forms of those spells It would't make anyone way overpowered.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Is there anyway you all can step aside from the bickering for a few. To give some usful insight &lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;(FEEDBACK)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; as appossed to all the agressive attacks of a childish nature.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Thank you&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;So basically everyone would mem CH and Slow. That would just kill the game right there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding the whole Necro thing. Well, just make all damage done to any mob (including dots) parsable and after that is done we can go from there. Since the necro class isnt going to go about sharing information on how much damage or how good their abilities really are.

FR supposably if you listen to some wizzies/magis destorys their dps... apparently not as much as necros though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BUt regardless you have several parses to work with what more do you need to know abotu necro dps? Take a mob and it's immune to pr so take away the poison dps. Take a mob thats immune to mr and take away the mr spells. If the mob has low resists in mr/fr/pr well guess what just maybe we might do good damage. For a class that specializes in dots you would think they would do good damage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's been some really rediculous comments in this thread since last night such as the druid poster. How dod druids suck at healing I use them for main healer all the time and now a days they get moved into the ch chain. Druids have found more use recently then  they have in the past. Before they were jack of all trades class that couldn't really do to much but these days druids have turned out to be a pretty **SMURF** well rounded class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Nnodal on &lt;span class="date_text"&gt;04-14-2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;08:51 AM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I didn't have /log on.  I fail at life IRG omg. The point is, the conversations I had after yours, with mulititudes of people from multiple classes, in several different guilds...pretty much all said, you're full of **smurf**.  I was pretty well aware that your numbers were off, I just didn't think to such a degree.  Anyway, much LOLs, as I said in my last post.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;You're argument is based on necros having utility and dps.  The utility we have, is not pertinent to raiding situations, why should dps be lessened for stuff we can't use in that same setting.  Seriously, you have a point..it's not what you think, but there is one.  The point is all casters need a boost, necros included.  I did some asking around, and well..rogues are posting higher then you portray when conditions are right, upwards of 1600dps and atleast once at 1900.  IF you don't want a focus on your class, and what it is you all are capable of, I'd suggest you stop this rediculous sharade of an attempt to focus attention on necromancers.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;All you're going to accomplish is pissing a lot of people off.  Rogues in your guild have a serverwide reputation at under performing..perhaps you're just angry because, to quote several people I talked to after I talked to you, &amp;quot;Darkwind rog dps is absolute **SMURF**&amp;quot;.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ok.  As a TANK I'm going to weigh in here.  I do not want to see Necro's get Nerfed.  /GASP  A tank defending Necros?  Yes I am and believe me I took my share of deaths to them on the bad ol days of Tallon Zek (Sparwhawk there) Currently Ybiter on Emarr level 70.  As to the DPS Etc of the melee's one of the caster's put it right instead of bitching bout Necros how bout we **SMURF** about our END regen which is absolute crap?  I can sit for round 15min and have round 8K buffed END and not be full whereas a caster and med up from 0 to round 10K mana in half that time AND if they have a necro pump them it get's even more so increased. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We now have a situation where in some cases the casters are waiting on the tanks to regen instead of the tanks waiting on the caster's.  Oh how the tables have turned on that one. LOL  I have never seen one good post as to why nerfing necros is a good idea.   Yea they can solo non summoning mobs.  So what?  As many have pointed out they usually are wanted in groups for Mindwrack and mana pumpage and on rare occasions pulling.  Frankly I think they should be given a bit MORE to benefit a group than less.  Why make a class unplayable at all when they already have issues at times finding groups?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I made my point and flushed out the logic and reasoning already... it took 20 pages but its pretty clear that you three:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) have no idea about the end game content (so you have no info about equally geared classes)&lt;br&gt;2) have no intrest in providing parses (not you nnodal you tried to give parses... although we discussed these) AND&lt;br&gt;3) spend more time being defensive and attacking people who are posting here rather than actually acknowledging that&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;span&gt;a) necros have a superior utiltiy set compare to DPS classes AND &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;b) are able to post numbers that rival the top dps classes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;span&gt;As i said, the DPS classes (monks, mages, rogues, zerkers, wizards) should recieve a boost so they are consistently out-dpsing necros in 90% of end game events... not 20%-50% of end game events.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So don't expect me to be as religious on posting point-by-point rebuttals... if other necros want to provide parse info's to show us then i will for sure stop by... if someone else does not understand my case then you can /t in-game or post and i will respond, but as i said, the arguements are pretty well layed out, dev's have already read the pages, so continuing to chase 3 necro's down when the majority of their posts were either...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;a) bashes or criticism about how stupid me, sincro, or other people are for not understanding necro classes -or-&lt;br&gt;b) piggy-back on other people posts b/c there is no original thoughts or parse info that you can add to the discussion&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;...is a waste of time.  This thread has served its purpose.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Dommin-DW on &lt;span class="date_text"&gt;04-13-2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;11:31 PM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
