      <title>Healing / Curing Ward AAs reset OOC regen counter; other issues</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=clericbalance&amp;message.id=11726#M11726</link>
      <description>I brought this up in serverwide cleric last night, and thought a post here might receive some attention (as opposed to the one I made in the Veteran's Lounge).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Currently, healing and curing wards (the AA ones) are resetting the out-of-combat regeneration counter.&amp;nbsp; So, if one of those wards is active in the area, you'll never be able to enter OOC regen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I may be wrong, but it also appeared that Ward of Absolution (at rank 1) only seems to be firing off every 24 seconds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think these healing / curing wards were underpowered to begin with, and I can't see using the healing ward at all any more if it's going to block the far superior OOC regen from happening.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If this is working 'as intended' then we need a way to easily get rid of the ward once it's been cast; a /pet go away would be nice, if it actually worked on the wards. As it is, I use my goblin dedicant staff to summon the goblin familiar and then I dismiss him by clicking off the buff; that also kills all of my other wards and pets (including jesters).&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=clericbalance&amp;message.id=11687#M11687</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I have a question that perhaps someone can answer: &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Back before TSS when the player cap was 65&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;We use to raid buff wtih Symbols, Ward and Druid Oak. That gave you more hit points and ac then just plain virtue...&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Now When I buff with the new Direwood 2&amp;nbsp; / Symbol 2 and Ward&amp;nbsp; I get 100hp and 50ac less then just buffing with Tencity.&amp;nbsp; I am trying to understand if there is any advantage now to buffing with them 3 anymore. Was this an SOE oversight?&amp;nbsp; Or is there still some reason to use them 3 buffs together?&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>Extinct Spell Lines, Anything To Be Done With Them?</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=clericbalance&amp;message.id=11674#M11674</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;There's a few spells left in their hayday that haven't been reproduced or upgraded, however do us service still today well enough. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Firstly there's Atone, mem blur has proven itself to be useful time and again to do some tricky stunts especially with the Sprinkler. With the level degradation of atone, what's the plausibility of seeing an upgrade at some point in the higher levels. It's a unique form of utility that's been sort of lost to the ages. Or was this spell dropped because it was deemed overpowered?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mark of the Righteous, sure it's current incarnation was a fusion of our old previous lines. However it still stacks with Mark of the Martyr which combined make an 89 damage shield. Essentually it's an extinct stackible line which just decreases damage shield by 30. However is there any probability of making this a higher level spell line that does something unique on it's own? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One thought I had was correlating something of a sort of summons blades line from DnD, basically summons a bunch of morning stars to assail the opponent with a direct damage and a dot effect with the reverse DS aspect as well. But for starters while it would fit our summonsing weapons to assail our opponent, it would firstly not really fit the class in terms of DoTs and secondly it couldn't confer any sort of real dps which again wouldn't fit the class. Another mechanic to look at is a mitigation debuff, since we can already buff up mitigation. The one question I have though is on a raid mob, how much impact would a mitigation debuff really have? What else out there could be done to make a neo Mark of Righteous that could confer something unique and usefull to cross sections of play.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Divine Aura, will we ever receive an upgrade? I understand that there's relunctance for it, but it's been a cruct of our ability to drop aggro. Personally I think one of the detriments is that the short cast timer and long recast are something that is unecessary, 15 minutes as compared to a bard's 3 minutes. Could definately use a faster refresh, even if it's along the lines of a 5 minute reduction. Another aspect with Divine Barrier is the HP's healed, which is a joke but considering it's such a low level spell understandible. Perhaps another aspect to add in would be to offer self cures as well as a self hot in the aura mechanic, so could provide an extra round of cheap curing as well as avoid the dot problems associated with da but not totally stop certain ones. Basically taking the aspect from the ToTD discussions, it'd offer up some more uniqueness/utility to DA.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wake of Tranquility, definately one of our most useful spells for pulling as it was an ae lull. It's never been upgraded at all, and it's definately one of our most useful utility spells. Is this spell line considered overpowered for clerics to have as it's been thusly restricted to only bards in the later expansions?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greater Immobolization (short duration/fast cast) and Pretrifying Root (long duration, normal cast time) both have a resist adjust of -30 magic. However these don't seem to do what we need them to do, in terms of duality they firstly obviously don't serve as a well enough soloing (mob runs, dps goes down, and ect). Nor does it really have any effect on root park CC ability with high resists and short duration. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One of the most popular suggestions is the anti-run/Call of the Chosonisque spell, thusly would increase soloing potential and allow our dps to be increased for a trade off in more amount of damage. Using either a symbol of our differing faith to cause a holy frenzy of the mob we're fighting or to use rhetoric and doctorine to incite our enemies to face us is definately within the realm of lore as well. The other aspect of root is the "normal root" since it offers up pseudo CC abilities. Two of the other priest classes has received a new knockback root along with rangers. The knockback root mechanic is something appealing, since firstly it confers to get the mob away from us and our group. But it also has a large solo application, in that since "tank rooting" is not applicible with dropping ward. If we're warding down something with a wanderer or trying to reroot something while trying to ward down something else we can take advantage of the knockback without us having to constantly move back to ward. We have two archaic root lines, what about junking the concept of their original casting limitations and going with a more cleric friendly playstyle ones. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What are your thoughts?&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Vjik on &lt;span class="date_text"&gt;10-30-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="time_text"&gt;08:54 AM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Vjik on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;10-30-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;08:54 AM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

      <title>Representing the Gods</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=clericbalance&amp;message.id=11641#M11641</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;We are representations of our gods and the gods are something that are so ingrained into the game, yet we receive little in the terms of different religious based quests. Other than mostly newbie quests from home town guilds, as we grow away the faith is just represented through some spells and other such. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;From a quest stand point the classic deity symbols were and are still race/class defining item for well atleast Innoruuk worshipping Frogloks, Humans and Dark elves. Expanding on these obviously would be logical, albeit it time consuming to balance. However, new coding offers some interesting choices such as Aura's or Familiars. So I think for a symbol series 2.0 to manifest itself would be overdue to help flesh out priests of differing religions a little bit without overbalancing one over the other.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Another way is graphically. I see alot of potential with the models currently and with the future player models. In terms of current, the most obvious are avatar forms. We're the only priest class that doesn't receive some sort of altered form. An illusion of this sort has two functions, first fun and lore aspects respectively but also the potential for an additional buff to statistics that has no stacking issues with our current line up. It's an interesting avenue really and so many ways to go about it. Such as the Chaos and Order theme for clerics, or having "evil" clerics and "good" clerics having different avatar form. Or each deity or group of deities bestowing upon their worshippers a different model for their avatar form. Thus differentiating between the different religions. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The second way, dealing with the potential of new models is gaining the aspects of the gods. Such as evil clerics opening up blood red hair and horns with a demonic tail, or good clerics having golden or silvery hair and a halo. While this doesn't do anything directly statistical, it does however play onto further developing customizibility for long term clerics in the service of thier gods. From a lore stand point you become an embodiment of your god and overtime you grow to become a divine creature. This could be even done for other priests, such as human druids of Tunare gaining more elf-like features and what not.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <title>New Question Idea</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=clericbalance&amp;message.id=11639#M11639</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I have a new question if this could be considered. Essentially, people&#xD;
have been saying casting buffs / elixirs has been producing 0 aggro at&#xD;
all and they have been keeping out of battle state and have been power&#xD;
medding under the OoC status as a result. Yet when they do burst heals,&#xD;
they definately are procurring aggro alot more often. (this is what others have been stating).&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Buff aggro has been parsed at ~10 points of hate that is subject to SCS&#xD;
and aggro mods. Heal aggro has yet to be properly defined but is always&#xD;
greater than buff aggro when noticed.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
It is known, especially with Rashere confirming, that mobs have an&#xD;
intelligence factor that determines the chance whether a cast&#xD;
beneficial spell gets noticed or not, that is, whether hate is produced&#xD;
or not effectively putting someone on aggro. Therefore my question is:&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
"Is the chance an npc notices a cast beneficial spell identical for all&#xD;
spell types, or, are npc's less likely to notice a spell the less aggro&#xD;
it is? That is, will buff aggro be noticed less than direct heals or is&#xD;
it all the same chance?"&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Something to that effect Niph :) I thought it would be appropriate what&#xD;
with OoC changes and "in battle/out of battle" statuses to learn more&#xD;
on whether certain heals (elixirs/promised) are more likely to keep&#xD;
someone in "power med" mode than other healing methods.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Some answers to the weekly questions:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Healing someone will get you on the aggro list of a creature that hates your target, however it will not in all cases change your faction if said creature dies. For instance, healing in Kael Drakkal typically gives no faction for killing giants unless the healer performs something more offensive like nukes or melee attacks.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Is this intended and if so can you describe the mechanics of faction hits in the case of heals?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0033ff&gt;(Rashere) When you heal someone, the NPC only has a chance to put you on their hatelist.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0033ff&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0033ff&gt;That chance is based on the intelligence of the NPC.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0033ff&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0033ff&gt;The times you don’t get faction are due to not ending up on the hatelist.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Currently, Touch of the Divine doesn't strip detrimental effects like it was initially intented. Is it something you still want to implement and what can you tell us about ETA, difficulty etc?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0033ff&gt;(Oshran) &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0033ff&gt;There are currently no plans to have TotD remove negative effects for 3 reasons.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0033ff&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0033ff&gt;1) Clerics already have a number of tools for removing detrimental effects after TotD triggers. 2) A few raids rely on the fact that the only way to remove certain detrimental effects is to perform a certain raid-specific action or die…&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0033ff&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0033ff&gt;3) From a lore standpoint, TotD should either strip all positive AND negative effects (if you are being resurrected) or should strip no effects (if you are being saved from death).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0033ff&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0033ff&gt;The spell relies on the latter interpretation.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0033ff&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Additionally, even though there is no real evidence, people complain that it doesn't work well with Delay Death maxed. Can you confirm that the check is when you die, not when you go below 0 HP?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0033ff&gt;(Oshran continued) &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0033ff&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The check is made when you die, not when you reach 0 hit points.&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;This is intended because players can cross the 0 hp mark several times in a very short period of time (i.e. multiple checks), but they can only die once.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I'd like also to feedback that TotD5 triggers rate has been parsed at approximately 8% (I was expecting 10 or 15%).&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0033ff&gt;(Oshran continued) &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0033ff&gt;ToTD5 should have a chance to trigger 10% of the time.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0033ff&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0033ff&gt;This has been confirmed by our testing department.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0033ff&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0033ff&gt;If it's triggering less then 10%, please /bug report it with detailed steps to reproduce.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0033ff&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>I was with a group doing Bellfast 5 this evening, and at the end of it, one of the group members commented that I would probably have raised my faction enough to be able to get the Bellfast series of missionsmyself. I went and spoke to the NPC, and he ignored me as usual. A bit of investigation showed that although I had been a participant in every fight during the mission, because I had mostly only healed, I had recieved no faction modifier for most of the kills.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I know I have come accross this before when trying to raise Dranik Loyallist faction, and I had to try to tag every mob to make sure my faction was raised, but it seems unfair to me that clerics should be penalised on factions for doing exactly what our main purpose is in a group i.e., healing. I get plently of random faction messages allying me with meaningless groups while doing the same thing throughout EQ, so why should these two (and probably others that I am unaware of) be different and require me to directly interact with the mob?&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;(Oshran) Intended.&amp;nbsp; Buff and bebuff lines generally fill the same buff slot which prevents them from stacking.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;About the last answer, my understanding was that DoTs are allowed to stack on a mob if from different casters. This was a change put in place to help DoT classes (ex: necro) in raids. I must have been mistaken, can a raiding necro comment?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <title>Placate and Glowing Runes</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=clericbalance&amp;message.id=11573#M11573</link>
      <description>Thought I'd post this as a heads up. With TSS, they're opening up the OoW spells to be researchable. Depending on how it's done, the spell Placate might become much easier to obtain after this goes in since Placate is likely to be treated as a level 67 spell (since that's when enchanters get it). If you've just gotten your first glowing rune (or will get one soon), you might want to consider holding off till after TSS and see if you can get placate via easier means before doing your turn in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Raising the Complete Heal base, CH is obsolete.</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=clericbalance&amp;message.id=11556#M11556</link>
      <description>Complete Heal has not completely healed since the Planes of Power era&#xD;
when tanks started reaching 10k and more hit points.&amp;nbsp; Currently tanks&#xD;
hit 17k+ (at an Anguish level, we aren't going to discuss with PoR&#xD;
gear) so Complete heal is only 50% healing.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Fall damage was upped so that it was effective, as well as other things including Ranger heals but complete heal was left alone.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;font color="#cc66ff"&gt;&lt;b&gt;I feel we need a complete heal base raise, an aa that will allow us to do so, or an Improved Complete Heal spell.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Even with modifiers CH only heals for 9600 and takes 10 seconds to&#xD;
cast, it's original base heal is 7k.&amp;nbsp; Ancient Hallowed Light only takes 2.8 seconds to cast and heals&#xD;
for 6056 hp.&amp;nbsp; Meaning that CH is obsolete.&amp;nbsp; If the based was raised to&#xD;
actually do it's job and COMPLETE heal it would be used more in groups&#xD;
and in raid situations.&amp;nbsp; As it is now AHL is more efficient then CH&#xD;
(granting that you have the mana pool that typically comes with&#xD;
achieving ancient spells).&amp;nbsp; In raid situations when you don't have AHL&#xD;
Pious Light is used.&amp;nbsp; Now fast heal rotations will always be needed&#xD;
under certain circumstances but I fully believe that if Complete Heal&#xD;
was Improved it would be used more in both raid and group situations.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
Even people that do not have AHL use other heals rather then CH, not&#xD;
just because of the cast time but because it just simply isn't&#xD;
efficient in doing it's intended job.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
It wouldn't make it to powerful either since it would actually then do&#xD;
what it was intended to do... completely heal.&amp;nbsp; It will still cost 400&#xD;
mana, take 10 seconds to cast, and will be uneffected by most&#xD;
modifiers, including spell haste, as it is currently but it will then&#xD;
do it's actual job of COMPLETELY healing.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
What is everyone elses view on this?&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

      <title>Consolidating the question of the week</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=clericbalance&amp;message.id=11519#M11519</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Here is what I asked, verbatim, not counting repeated questions. If you would like to have a question answered please make a separate post so we can debate it, or send me a PM.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;......&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Ward of Purity is the cleric AA that cures 1, 2 or 3 (depending on rank) poison and disease counters. Is it intended that it cures every other tick (every 12s) instead of every tick?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;......&lt;/P&gt;As monsters become more and more powerful, they deal more and more damage during the 10 seconds of&amp;nbsp;a CH. Soon Complete Healing will not heal enough to keep a tank alive in standard group encounters.&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Do you plan to introduce upgrades&amp;nbsp;to CH or otherwise maintain a line of long casting time heal spells, or will you let CH as it is and focus only on upgrades to the Light and Remedy lines?&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;......&lt;/P&gt;"Where do the Developers see clerics heading in terms of raiding (new encounter mechanics, etc) and grouping styles (in terms of variety for that elusive "Secondary Role" that we do not currently have), and how would they go about achieving it?"&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;......&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Abundant Healing 3 was supposed to be reduced from a 10% to 9% trigger rate this patch. Did the change make it?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The problem was how&amp;nbsp;Abundant Healing&amp;nbsp;and Gift of Mana interact with each other. GoM is considered a better AA and with this change AH3 would not lower the trigger rate of GoM5.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Rashere said it was AH5 that was supposed to be changed and that yes it did get changed.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;......&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Here is what Rashere posted about Touch of the Divine the cleric AA:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
TotD now only checks when you actually die. It's not modified by anything. It's a flat percent check based on your rank in the ability. The actual percent will not be stated (sorry folks!), but the chance increases with each rank. It's basically a "get out of death" free card although it doesn't go off often enough that you can rely on it, which is by design.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;When TotD triggers, it puts a DA style buff on the player, so they drop to the bottom of hate lists just like DA. In addition, it heals the player over the next 6 ticks. Previously, because of the bug that was causing it to also work like Divine Aura and trigger at low health, it would strip the buffs of players. That no longer happens.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;In addition, with this patch, the amount of healing it does has been increased and made it remove all detrimental effects on the cleric when the ability triggers. This effect doesn't vary by rank. The only thing that changes as you increase ranks is that you have a greater chance to be saved when you die.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Currently, TotD doesn't strip detrimental effects. Is it something you still want to implement and what you tell us about ETA, difficulty etc?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Additionally, even though there is no real evidence, people complain that it doesn't work well with Delay Death maxed. Can you confirm that the check is when you die, not when you go below 0 HP?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;......&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Is there any plan to eventually have the cleric self buff line (ex: Armor of the Pious) stack with the shaman focus line (ex: Talisman of Wunshi) ?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>This has been troubling me for a while now, but whilst I know many are&#xD;
deterred from EQlive due to the endlessness of rants and raves from&#xD;
wailing whiners, spam posts and non-informative ones, apart from&#xD;
EQcleric.com I've been concerned lately with the activity of .org and&#xD;
here. I know there are people who do frequent all forums, or some of&#xD;
them, but in general they are really quiet compared to many of the&#xD;
other classes forums.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Is this a sign of our class going into decline, or are just people not&#xD;
bothered with the forums? :/ I'd assume its more the latter than the&#xD;
former... but well, you can only see so much and not expect otherwise.&#xD;
This isn't doomspeaking, but merely expressing a concern.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

      <title>Is Delay Death cancelling out/greatly lowering procs of Touch of the Divine?</title>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;font face="Arial" size="2"&gt;On &lt;a href="www.eqcleric.com" target=_blank&gt;www.eqcleric.com&lt;/a&gt; we've been discussing whether the Delay Death aa is causing Touch of the Divine to either fire less often, or not at all.&amp;nbsp; Anecdotal evidence seems to be showing that as you max out DD, your TotD fires less and less often.&amp;nbsp; Why would this be happening, if indeed it is?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff" face="Arial" size="2"&gt;Let's look at why they might be interfering with each other...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;TotD attempts to fire when your hp's reach zero. DD allows you to actually go below zero hp's. It very well could be that TotD attempts to fire, sees that DD has added hp's to you, or has somehow changed the death flagging on your toon, and therefor decides it doesn't need to fire as its conditions have not been met. It's kind of hard to explain, but I'm certain that you can see what I am getting at. When TotD does fire, it could be that it is doing so only on those occasions where you go below the additional death barrier that DD affords you. I think you really may be seeing something real happening.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is this a case of two aa's interfering with one another a-la the AH/GoM bug that was finally fixed recently?&amp;nbsp; It makes sense that it might be occuring.&amp;nbsp; What has anyone else seen out in the field?&amp;nbsp; If a Dev is reading this could you possibly check and see if something like this is indeed happening?&amp;nbsp; We all know now that it is possible for an aa to block another aa from working correctly.&amp;nbsp; We're just curious and concerned that we've found another problem with the same underlying issue...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Something odd I noticed</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=clericbalance&amp;message.id=11451#M11451</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I started playing a cleric on the Progression server to try it out and I noticed something odd.&lt;br&gt;The spell rebalancing did improve the efficiency of heals (for all classes) and it made them available to some classes including clerics at earlier levels then before. What also happened was the sliding scale of amount healed being dependant on level. This is where it gets interesting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Take the first two cleric heals, &lt;a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=200&amp;amp;source=Live" target="_blank"&gt;Minor Healing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=17&amp;amp;source=Live" target="_blank"&gt;Light Healing&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately Lucy doesn't give an easily understandable description of the range of hp heal depending on the level for Light Healing.&lt;br&gt;At level 6, minor gives a 2:1 ratio for amount healed to mana used. Light (healing about 53 hp) gives only about 1.9:1 at this level. It takes until about level 8 or 9 to match the efficiency of Minor Healing. It is at level 9 that Druids and shaman get this heal. All 3 priests have the same level of efficiency from level 1-9 and I would assume beyond until Superior Healing and level 37.&lt;br&gt;Yes clerics will have a higher output of hphealed/second but does that matter at those levels? So until level 37 all 3 priests are as efficient healers as each other. Was this always the way? Casting our newest heals was less efficient then using those the spell circle below?&lt;br&gt;It seems odd to me, not at all like I remember it.&lt;br&gt;Of course with all that said clerics have a 5% bonus to the amount healed by heals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What I'm getting at is that I think the healing spell changes reduced some of the healing advantage clerics once had at lower levels. Actually just looking at on old spell list I found clerics heals were more efficient as soon as a new spell circle (containing a heal) was reached.&lt;br&gt;At lower levels clerics have become more efficient healers but we have definitely lost some of our healing advantage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Cleric or Ranger?</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=clericbalance&amp;message.id=11449#M11449</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I first started playing a couple months after the Kunark expansion and left after the Planes of Power.&amp;nbsp; Recently I saw an old review of EQ and it gave me that nostalgia feeling.&amp;nbsp; Long story short, I&amp;nbsp;started checking the forums and read about the new progression servers on the forums and ran out to get the Titanium edition and am currently giving the servers some time to cool down before I get a fresh start.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Now to the heart of this post.&amp;nbsp; My main back then was a dwarf warrior, but always thought about starting either a&amp;nbsp;cleric or a ranger.&amp;nbsp; Now with the fresh start I am definitely going to make one or the other, but I'm a bit torn and was hoping that I could get a little pro/con session going to help me decide.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I'm also posting a similar thread on the&amp;nbsp;ranger pages to get their opinions.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>Clerics and the Dex stat question</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=clericbalance&amp;message.id=11438#M11438</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I was thinking of making a cleric on the progressive server tomarrow but wanted to make a melee cleric.&amp;nbsp; If i focus on raising DEX, will that allow me to actually land blows at a reasonable rate?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;With my 53 cleric I ignored DEX and melee'ing with him is painful to watch. Just too many dang misses.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Is it possible to make a cleric that has&amp;nbsp;decent melee skills or am I living in a dream world?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I want to pretend i'm a wimpy paladin when i'm not grouping, or be able to add to group DPS with melee instead of those mana hog DD spells.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;My friend said that DEX increases your chance to hit with your auto attack, but the game says it only increases the chance for melee procs to go off. Who is correct here?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
