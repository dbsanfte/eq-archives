I assume a fix is coming as Rashere said the change was unintended. I wonder if Rashere even knew that heals on pets didnt generate agro for the heal prior to the patch. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>As far as a "gimp" warrior tanking 3 mobs in direwind and holding agro off the cleric feverishly healing the warrior, well thats just a huge exageration of reality isnt it? No gimp tank is going to stand up long enough for heals to land.&nbsp; Trust me, I have seen a few "gimp" tanks die on one mob in direwind hehe. Even if they could stand up to that beating, an AOE taunt wouldnt hold agro over the kind of healing that would be necessary to keep the tank standing. Could an uber geared tank do that? sure.&nbsp; A gimp tank? No way. <b>Most of the mages that are talking and the examples that are given are either Raid guilded or have a ton of AA's or both.</b><br></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I find it amazing that a mage pet can take hits from 2 direwind mobs at once in stride and allow a healer to keep it standing long enough to finish both mobs off.&nbsp; &nbsp;It is clear that mage pets are far and away the best pets in the game<b> Mage pets are and always have been the best in the game since at least Kunark</b>. I know my beastlord pet couldnt handle one mob in direwind beating on it for any real length of time. Heck, most low to middle geared pc tanks couldnt handle that really <b>My low to middle geared mage can't handle tanking a named in Direwind with both the mage and the cleric chaining heals</b>. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I dont think a pet heal should be agro free. I just dont agree with that concept. Healing gives major agro in most situations from level one up until high end. Heck if the main tank goes down on a raid, clerics start dying if the ST hasnt built sufficient agro to avoid that situation. Agro free pet heals just remove that consequence from the equation. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Looking at it from a mage's perspective this is a huge change to the game. No other pet class can use its pet to tank mobs in current content really. I can see why mages would be upset over this kind of change.&nbsp; I just had no idea that pet heals were agro free prior to this patch and I dont really understand why they should be. I dont see a rational basis for breaking a basic concept in the game. Heals generate agro. It is a balancing concept<b> And herein lies the main point that we are trying to help people understand it requires BALANCE, pets and pet heals have been balanced around the idea that pet healing gives no aggro a concept readily seen by the fact no one seems to have known this, if you take it away you don't fix the balance, but instead destroy it.</b>, that requires finese to overcome. Without heal agro from a pet heal, a healer faces no consequences no matter how much mana they burn in spamming heals on the pet. If the pet dies, and the healer doesnt heal the mage owner of the pet, the healer simply walks away with no place on the mobs' hatelist? Despite all the hitpoints healed? It just seems wrong to me.</div><br><hr></blockquote>As an aside, why is it that everyone is freaking out like its some mass conspiracy when no one even tried in the least to cover this up, it was even on the patch notes that healers weren't getting aggro from healing pets. Just because something works differently for pets than it does for you doesn't make it a **SMURF** EXPLOIT, it just makes it different. Here's one for you, bards can run around while using clickys and potions and melee and outside of being stunned won't be interupted. **SMURF** thats so unfair they should have to hold still like everyone else. Please at least think a little before you fly off then handle and start coming up with end of the world theories if this is fixed back to what it has been for YEARS now.<br></div>
