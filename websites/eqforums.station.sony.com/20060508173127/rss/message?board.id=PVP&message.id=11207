    <description>&lt;DIV&gt;So many things are continually being brought about that discourage pvp. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Here's a list of the things I have noted that have ruined the pvp environment.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;1. Guild lobby... In mass pvp it's entirely too easy to be zerged by people summoning corpses, rebuffing, then porting back to the fight. It takes away the glory of the battle.&amp;nbsp; Would like pvp corpses to have to be retrieved as it was in the past. Before when you died in a pvp battle, people went through all kinds of creative means to retrieve their corpse. It was frustrating at times but much more fun for the pvp environment.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;2. Instanced zones.... everything is instanced.&amp;nbsp; I can appreciate that 1 person doesn't train a raid and ruin it etc, however some raid content that is desirable should still be uninstanced for all level guilds.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;3. PVP point system etc. It's a terrible system... when the zeks merged and people went ld they were lootable for 1 item and coin.&amp;nbsp; Then people complained because they were losing high value items that they had equipped in inventory.&amp;nbsp; It was then changed to be a pvp death with no loot only whatever pvp points that person offered if any at all. Then SOE implemented the 1hour full mana/hps meaning if im getting beat down in pvp i can /q with no detriments whatsoever. I can /q for an hour regain full health and mana and at the very worst&amp;nbsp; will take a pve death and have to summon my corpse for a small negotiable fee wherein i won't have&amp;nbsp;pvp rez effects, I won't take an experience lost, nor will I lose points.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Furthermore, I think by now people are getting a bit frustrated with killing 5 or 6 people and getting maybe 100 points then dying one time and losing 150 points.&amp;nbsp; What this does is further encourage people to /q to prevent themselves from losing points. Finally wheres the point reward? I&amp;nbsp;mean the items are crappy with the exception of a clickable item mostly you can get better from simply buying DoN crystals and purchasing items from the vendors there.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;4.The Heal pots need to go. They unbalance pvp more than it already is. If SOE wants to give non-healing classes the opportunity to heal themselves I want a stun pot thats unresistable, a nuke pot thats unresistable, and an unresistable mez.&amp;nbsp; Oh shucks did i mention a selos pot?&amp;nbsp; I think you get my point here.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;I'm sure that you all do not take into consideration the Zek population when you conjure all these nifty ideas but I'm telling you and I'm sure others will agree Potions for pvp is silly. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I'm sure people have many other suggestions for providing a healthy pvp environment to the zek server. &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;all i know is it sucks when as a mage i can hardly pk ne1 at 70 when at 65 i owned pvp what happened melees hit me for over 1k my nukes land for under 100 alot its just plain stupid my pet is basically useless in pvp his stun is resisted his dmg is major wea unless i fin a total gimp i have to run in almost every conflict wizzys get like 8 secx stuns which seem unnresistable then they nuke me dead whle my pet is charging them but not even hurting them itxss pretty sucky i mean im not a total gimp either ive got decent gear pretty hard to undeerstand you guys whining bout heal pots they dont do me any good i honestly couldnt care less either way keeping them in game or not i mean everyone has them i dont see how it unbalancees the game ... so ive got a beast now with a fabled Tstaff hes gonn own everyone and it honestly makes me mad i want to play my mage but if i go anywhere   alone im dead meat hardly seems fair maybe im just a gimp. but i kno3w it aint has to do with how im playing the game when i cant do anything at all anyway then i take my beast out and am basically unstoppable ... even when i play my pally i can endure a fight long enough to escape its so harsh what happened omg this sux badi guess i may have to retire my mage from all non instanced zones or delevel to 65 and own course then i would l,\ose some very nice gear ... i dunno what to say ifd that T staff \is unresistable why aint my pets stun or root unresistablke at least give mages a chance to be better than this sheeeeeesh&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;       I just wanted to bring up the monks again.I know your all tired of hearing it, but this is just nuts and needs to be fixed asap.I was in nek fully buffed with just over 11k hp,im a necro btw.I was hit by a monk  once and stunned I lost about 6k hp  and knowing i was prolly in for another stun I was gonna hit DA and just get the hell out of dodge before whats this I was stunned again and dead.How on gods grn earth can you say this is not unbalanced.I couldnt even get a near intstant spell off to save my life.Ive had better far chances trying to tank an untankable NPC.Theres also the fact that anyone with great resists I pretty much am worthless and about 20 percent of my life taps even get resisted.OHHHHH  but theres one great DPS spell I can always count on to land 75 percent and that lvl 58 Pyroooooooo............Come on fix the monk and resist issue plzzzzzz..........As for the heal pots I play both melee and caster I say get rid of the dam pots.As a caster I cannot out damage the heal pots when im getting resisted and  my taps arent landing for squat.Necros cant fight there way out of a wet paper bag anymore against someone with high resists.When I started my rogue I know i didnt pick a healing class when I chose to start one.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes nerf monks when I have top of the line PC and all my **SMURF** maximized for performance and I am dead to a monk before I even appear to myself in a zone, I would say that's pretty unbalanced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get rid of heal pots.  It's hard enough to nuke down a 15k hp warrior with spells that land for 300 on a crit. but to then have them just heal all the while hitting me for over 1k is really retarded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rangers have snare, bow, and wicked melee damage where they chop chop chop you to death with 500-1k hits before you can even do anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get rid of points.  I get killed I lose like 50 points - I can kill 50 NSA or Benediction and not even get 50 pts back.  Good luck killing someone worth anything - they instant, they warp, they horse away...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SOE seems to be removing some of the hackers.  Good job.  Keep it up.  But why treat PDM like they are princesses?  I never see them get banned they are all holier than thou and god, some of them are just trash hackers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Come to think of it the whole system is completely **SMURF**ed.  This is no lie, I think they should change the ruleset to the Sullon Zek ruleset.  That way if you cant kill the **SMURF**ers you can train them to hell.  No level limits so no lame shrouding and running to instanced zones.  Teams so you have to interact with who you are teamed with, whether you like them or not. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regards.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Zek is like &amp;quot;what&amp;quot; now?  Four servers merged into one and what's the population like now?  I'm not impressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are going to have rules like &amp;quot;no training&amp;quot; then why are some allowed to train with impunity while others are not?  You know this is true. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good gear might keep you alive long enough to get away, but class&amp;gt;all so basically everyone below the top three or four guilds serve as point dispensers.  At least on SZ there was a percentage of the server depending on your team you were not kos to.  Now when the average Joe wants to do something he gets spinned around by AD monks in LS, goes somewhere else and gets spinned around by PDM monks, and after 15 minutes in Shadowrest gets spinned around by Hate monks when he zones into Stoneroot falls.  No wonder people just mindlessly grind the MMs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All I am saying is on SZ there was at least some respect, maybe some little loyalty to your team mates whether you knew them or not.  On Zek its everyone for themselves and may the most putrid **SMURF** win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Your guild is your team on Zek.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;About the monk issue, I think alot of people are rolling or buying and servermoving monks right now, because they are the cool thing to play atm. They will eventually be nerfed and another class will peak out on top again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Caliel speaks the truth, Sullon was the armpit of the servers for a reason, and yes some people thoughoughly enjoyed it, however I do not think that the majority of the server would support such a change (I estimate that perhaps 10% would)&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Either way Caliel, what I was implying is that they already have gate potions, why make an instant gate potion a cast time gate potion, worthless idea.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Other gate potions are shaman made. That one is bought from a vender. And the reason to make it not instant is because it is mainly used by people in pvp right before they die so they dont die in pvp. I am saying that they should not have this option. That is why I want there to be a casting time on it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Heal potions arent as unbalancing as a few other issues.And Hodan,I can't kill alot of people.I cant kill clerics like Gollon ever.I can't kill most knights or monks either once they have my lvl of gear.Haze and I both tried to kill caliel in nek and he stayed in the zone 30+ mins toying with us until I was out of endurance.Monks have been discussed enough that I wont bother.If you want to talk unbalancing,let's look at the knight AA horse.1 vs 1 any decent knight can pvp for extended amounts of time with virtually no risk of pvp death in 1 vs 1 situations.If they get low HPs they just insta horse up and run off to heal/tap mobs.As a berserker I can stun but it doesnt always stick and its a 12 sec reuse so once off the horse,they insta horse up immediently and take off with little risk of dying.I also don't like gate potions.They ruin pvp.I have never used them nor will I ever use them on unberserker like principles alone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>A Vial of Swirling Mist implies to me that its almost a magical exit, therefore instant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I do not mind it, just need a way to limit the re-use.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Potions are retarded cos they are accesible to everyone (i.e. everyone can afford them)... would of been exactly the same effect to give them as innate abilities to people and reduce value of vendortrash on mobs, lol</description>

      <description>A magic exit does not mean instant. Spells = magic. Which gate is a spell.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>It makes no sense at all considering regular gate potions have a cast time, hence giving it an insta gate name. Umm, go look up instant at dictionary.com and come back sir.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>The insta gate name is only the name players give it. Its real name is A Vial of Swirling Mist if you forgot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Yeah Caliel, that makes sense to put a casting time on an &amp;quot;instant&amp;quot; gate potion~ what?&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
