      <title>Companion Seals why were they removed?</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Trade&amp;message.id=10480#M10480</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;I noticed that pet augments were removed from the game.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; The question I have is why?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; Pet classes are typically at disadvantage in the game to get pet augs. These items are hard to quest after but are rewarding for those looking to augment their pets. The fact remains by placing an item that's avaiable in  popular raids it allows the pet classes a shot at getting pet augs they desperately need to stay on par with other classes.Instead the augments were suspended and SOE has been very very vague about why, however, Sony sees nothing wrong with straight classes using the augments to increase their dps all out. For those new to the subject here is a list of  the seals that have been disabled:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Bazu Seal of companions&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Chronal Seal of companions&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Discordant Seal of companions&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;To my knowledge all other seals for the melee and other classes remain intact. Please correct me if this is wrong.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Currently the only way to get some the higher end pet augmentations in this game is by similar methods in COA or higher raids. Even the boot drop in COA which gives nearly the same effect is sought after by other classes for what it does for them. By opening up a few more avenues for pet classes you give them better chance to increase their pets dps and make them valued for it on raids and soloing.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;From your recent actions taken against pets it is my opinion that you unjustly favor classes that dont really rely on pets for DPS. This means any new players should seriously consider not playing mages or beasts. The pet focus and hold commands did much to restore pets to raids, but by limiting pet progression (with augs) pets are still not considered of any value to raids no matter how skilled their owners are with them. I am not asking for pets dps to match a tank they are after all supplement to dps not the where with all.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Please explain how disabling the above augs harmed classes that already brag about out dpsing mages, and beastlords. Both  these classes were once on par with other classes for dps and abilites but seem with each expansion to fall lower and lower on the dps ladder.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Please explain how these aug gave mages, beastlords, or even necro pets a unfair advantage over other players which requried their removal from the game.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Old bump, I know, but can this be looked into again?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just make the aug BST, MAG, NEC only.&amp;nbsp; The number of slots that a pet focus item can go into are very limiting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Apparently they were also told "no" on an Improved Block Last Blood.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
The offical reasoning I heard from up high was that - "not enough&#xD;
classes can use it, so no use itemizing for it" - straight from Fan&#xD;
Faire.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Pretty lame IMO, there is an Improved Bash aug (which only 2 classes&#xD;
really make use of), theres also several Focus augs which only 1-2&#xD;
classes make use of as well.&amp;nbsp; So to itemize for Block (2 classes)&#xD;
and pet focus (3 classes) must be unbalancing.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
/sarcasm off&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Thank you both for answering and I agree about the other lesser classes it cant hurt them to have pet augs to, their spells have lesser value pets I dont see much harm in augmenting them as well.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;As for the other comment I know that Dev does his best to keep equality in tradeskills best he can. BTW regardless whether I agree with some GMS and MODs I do respect them it takes courage every day to deal with thousands of whinning players threating to quit the game if they dont get what they want. I have worked customer service before and know the headaches, and challenges these people face.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Many times GM have the same feelings as players but they have to remain loyal to the company thats only right.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The only way change can happen is if enough players post asking for answers and then start to ask in game gms why this issue is being dropped so much. Then someone higher up will have to make decision and we can find out the reason. For those intrested in this particular issue please post even if you dont aggree. The more attention it draws from people the better. I for one vote that the augs should be restored. Its not like you can solo farm them they take a whole raid to gather, yes it puts pet classes in competion for same augs as tanks, but as it stands there is only one aug that drops.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The stone being tradeskilled in my opinon is being held back so the tanks can get their fill of augs first, all the rest to the back of the bus. Might seem harsh but thats the way the game is. For the tanks this not an attack on your class its a statement that the game perfers the mighty knight with a sword over the cunning dragonslayer type sorceror. Invite Sony to prove me wrong and to answer why this issue has been sitting around for months gathering dust.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;One other thing I know the pet classes have dps augs and such available, but lets be realistic even if you raid alot odds are you are only going to get one stone ever to aug unless you are a guild leader or just hoard them somehow. THE cost in time,  materials,  plat, and hours of working to farm just the right peice to work with it more than equals this equation. It not a super easy augment to be had you must attend raid after raid to have a shot at earning it I fail to see how having a level 7 auged shammy pet is threat to mages, beastlords, or necros pets. I personally dont mind if an enchanter has kick arse pet they deserve it for all the hard times they put in  with idots breaking mezz. Same for shammy they need a pet that can bleed off some that aggro from slows sometimes. Sk  I  dont see as an issue as well most Sk are not going to waste the aug they get to aug a pet when they got a killer dps aug for combat ablites they would tell you &amp;quot; YOU want me to make a pet aug are you NUTS its going to that new &lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;span class="headers"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bazu Seal Of Cleaving&amp;quot; &lt;font size="2"&gt;which btw is all/all guess us pet classes should start making them since we cant have pet augs. I can just see the tanks in my raid now WTH why are you making that aug its not for your class you wasted that stone!!!!!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you are unable to understand whats being addressed just look up any tradeskill website information on these seals you will be shocked and drooling to bad the pet classes got their best aug cut off in game for months.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Please if you know pet classes direct them to this post and to sound off. As always enough people equals  some kind of addressing to the issue.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason I posted this item undertrade skills is that the augments are trade skill managed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for the information. It helps alot but at same time it raises new questions. I post the following information from a mage point of view since my main is a mage, but it applies equally to all other main pet classes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason I find this upsetting is recently Sony tried to nerf mage pets. This resulted in widespread call to restore mage pets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All other pet classes get some from of slow. Mages were compensated with a broken elemental mezz, elemental charm, and  worthless fire pet whos snare is worse that any other snaring pet in any pet class. Still overall mages are a good solo, group or raid class to play till you reach the high end of the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plus side of the coin is if mages are able to use pet augs upgrades they retain a dps stalemate with all classes but Wizzy. Mages nukes are not supposed to equal wizzy and thats fine, but they are supposed to be the best pet class bar none and it seems sony often puts progression for  main pets to the side. The tradeskill augs gave mages hope for new way to increase their pets power and abilites. This also affected beastlords and necros as well , though many necros perfer not to use pets at the higher end of the games. I am not asking they make pet tradeskill augs easy a pie to get. I am asking that all classes including pet owners be given fair consideration in augments. I can guarntee if this had happened to say an item thats supposed to be only War, SK, Pally equippable somehow getting put all/all it would be patched within a week at the outside most.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new questions your answer provided prompted me to ask are as follows: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why remove this item and never fix it ?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I have seen in the  game,  over the years the minute a tank tradeskill is messed up it gets patched fast. I know the coders are overworked that issue isnt in doubt, however, someone should got the augments right the first time they came out. Not say ok the first few people to get this item grats, but  the rest of  the people can wait 3 years for the code patch  to upgrade and again be behind the power curve in the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So why aren't  the augments being fixed ? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please do not respond with a comment about how it unfairly gives SK, Shammy, and druid pets an unfair advantage the harm done to the main pet classes far outweigh any such argument. I know something about computers and if thats the case it wouldnt take much coding to alters the new augments to be mage, necro, and beastlord only equippable and keep the handful augs out there as all/all a rare and special find to the few who discovered it before patching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sony has had many many months to patch this item but clearly they dont seem to be in any way working towards a fair solution.I realize that you have limited manpower and that you have to deal with bigger priorties first, but dont put something off to the side forever that was caused by coding error and not the players fault.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quite honestly, if the seals worked for care bears (druid pet), dog-dog (shaman pet), SK's pets (lower level version of necromancer pets), enchanter summoned pets, and whatever other forms of summoned pet there are out there (ranger companion springs to mind - but that's off a proc I believe), what's the harm?  My main is a necromancer.  With comparable focii, I fully expect my pet will do more damage than most of the above.  And if the focus helps the swarm pet and that's how the character in question wants to spend their AAAA/stone/etcetera, I don't understand why this would be considered &amp;quot;broken&amp;quot; to let them.  The value in the slot 12 augment approach is it lets the players customize the equipment to match their play style and the developers don't have to worry (as much) about whether it makes sense for class A to have worn effect/focus b.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quite honestly, with the nerf bats that enchanters have taken in charming, I would regard it as only fair their summoned pet finally gets a focus.  As a necromancer, I know the SK pet well and it can tank nothing of interest ... it's a wandering dot which the focus would marginally strengthen (I use one of the top SK pets as an expendible pet for pulling).  Most druids I know regard their care bear as a potentially dangerous speed bump.  The only class which might seriously consider this focus which is not one of the main pet classes is the shaman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only thing which would concern me is a non-pet class accidentially using the wrong instruction.  But the again, there is nothing preventing the warriors out there from making the mana preservation lines of dodh augment.  I didn't hear any screaming from any of the pet classes about this augment being all/all ... so why did it get pulled again?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just my 2 cents.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I mostly wanted you to know that I have not ignored this thread.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;But I also do not have an answer for you.&amp;nbsp; I know that is not particularly satisfying, but is what it is :)&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>Similar to above, but explaining why:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Employees are too busy working on the new expansion to fix bugs from prior expansions (see GoM/AH for further reference).&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;The augs were not removed as an attack on pet classes.  They were removed because an error made them useable by all classes and races creating a problem for pet classes that should not have access to pet focuses (Shaman, Shadowknights, Druids ets).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;They may or may not make it back later once development team has time to re-evaluate them and fix the class restictions to Mag, Nec, Bst like they should have been from the start. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Don't hold your breath though, we've been waiting for developers to have some free time since the game went live.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;It has been several months since this was removed. Has there been any updates on what if any thing is being done to bring these back.&lt;/div&gt;</description>
