    <title>Freeport, Anyone?</title>

    <description>I found this recently - written back a few years ago when I and a friend set off to pursue the Tainted Cyclops as part of my epic.  It's unfinished, but I thought I might finish it up now that I've found it again.</description>

      <description>“Do you smell something?” Wolfwind asked, dangling his feet over the edge of the Freeport docks and kicking up a spray of water.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Gurgle”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“I said, Do you SMELL something” Wolfwind repeated, throwing up more water which, caught by the wind, sprayed the druid in a fine mist, dampening his face and leaving eyelashes sparkling with tiny gems of water.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Gurgle, Glug”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“I SAID, DO YOU…”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The ranger standing beside Wolfwind let out a loud belch, and tossed the rum bottle from which he’d been drinking into the bay.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Said – you’re smelling the sewer, Wolf. It empties into the water right under this dock”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Tunare!” swore the druid, jumping up off the docks and shaking his legs off, “You could have warned me, Falt.” Suddenly, his eyes glazed over slightly, and he cried out “Freeport SuXX0rs!!”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Huh?” asked Faltigoth “Wolf?”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wolf shook his head slightly, and the glaze faded from his face “Did I do it again?”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The ranger nodded solemnly, “Aye – you spoke in a strange tongue and your eyes went elsewhere.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wolfwind shivered, curling his lip in distaste and wiping at his face and eyes to clear the scummy water from them. “I really hate this town,” he complained.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Aye, Freeport is a disgusting hole. ‘Tis a shame to see our half-elven and human brothers sunk so low. Karana would do well to send a scourging storm against this den of filth and iniquity”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wolfwind raised an eye at Faltigoth. “Fancy talk, ranger. Rum wearing off?”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;”Aye,” nodded the Ranger, reaching into his tunic and producing another full bottle of spirits, pulling out the cork with his teeth, and taking a deep, long pull from it, “Never does to let it wear off too much, ‘specially not when I have to look at your ugly mug all the time”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wolfwind grunted and sank back down onto the docks, this time crossing his legs underneath him. He rested his head on his hands and stared out at the water. The setting sun sparkled painfully of the rolling water, and the cries of seagulls, made fat from scraps thrown from the windows of the taverns and inns lining the docks, rang harshly on the ears of druid and ranger, far more accustomed to the softly filtered light of the forests, and the melodious twittering of song birds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hearing something strange, Wolfwind leaned forward. A cry, far off and coming from above, soft at first but growing louder, getting nearer, was suddenly cut short by a loud splash somewhere a ways from the pier.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Huh,” he muttered. “That’s…strange”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“What’s strange,” asked Faltigoth, taking a heavy swig from his bottle and using his long-sword for a cane. The lightning dancing up the ensorcelled blade lanced onto the dock and made tiny burnt marks, leaping from puddle to puddle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“I could have sworn I saw…” The druid shook his head, trying to clear the obviously delusional image of a plummeting gnome from his head. “Never mind.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Faltigoth shrugged assent and returned to the study of his bottle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wolfwind sat brooding for a bit longer, squinting in to the setting sun.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“I hate boats,” he suddenly announced. “Boats are stupid. Don’t know why we need them”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Faltigoth groaned and rolled his eyes skyward.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wolfwind looked up at him from his seat on the wet dock. “I mean it,” he said, “I have no idea why we need the bloody things. They’re slow, they only go to – what – three or four places? I mean they are just completely impractical. Why, if I had my way –“&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Population control,” Faltigoth interjected, cutting off the druid’s rant before it really got going. “It’s all about population control.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“What?” demanded Wolfwind. “Are you drunk?”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Is the sky red in Lavastorm?” Faltigoth returned, hoisting his current bottle in Wolfwind’s direction. “That doesn’t change my point, however. Think about it. If it weren’t for the boats sinking regularly and killing whole hordes of people, there wouldn’t be enough room left in this place to toss a gnome – and THEN what fun would life be.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Bah,” scoffed Wolfwind. “Population control my arse. If we really need population control, we could just sell tours with you as the tour guide. You could wipe out a small town all on your own. Can’t you go anywhere without ticking off the local species? Last month you got so many people killed, you made the cleric cry.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Faltigoth shrugged. “Not my fault if they don’t appreciate my ranger-esque charm. Some folks just don’t have proper appreciation for a spear up the rear these days.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“I really don’t want to know what proper appreciation for a spear up the rear IS. Where IS that Tunare-damned BOAT?”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Faltigoth tossed another bottle into the bay, where it joined its fellows in a melancholy circle of bobbing empties, rusted daggers and tattered sandals. “It’ll be along soon, my friend. Have a wee nip to take the edge off.” Falt tossed Wolf a bottle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wolf caught the bottle and twisted off the cap. Taking a long draught, he glared out at the empty ocean. “I HATE boats.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“You did mention that once or twice.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;”I mean it. I hate ‘em. Boats – just big old hunks of wood that serve no purpose whatsoever…”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Actually, they serve a very useful…”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“…I mean if people REALLY wanted to, they could learn to travel Nature’s way. I mean if they really tried HARD, we wouldn’t need these cursed boats to get from place to place, and we wouldn’t have to be wasting our time in this damned, gods-forsaken TOWN”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wolfwind, now really worked up, leapt to his feet and began gesturing wildly. A small crowd had accumulated, mostly locals waiting to take the boat to the lovely vacation spot of scenic Kelethin. Most of them started to edge nervously away from the wild-eyed half elf.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“…and the sand ALWAYS gets down my back and gets stuck in my armor, and you KNOW how much I hate having sand stuck in my armor. The beer here is definitely substandard, and don’t even get me STARTED on that snooty, look-down-your-nose bank with it’s fancy blue carpet and ‘your money isn’t as good as our money’ attitude.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;”Wolf…”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“And if you aren’t being glared at by some crooked guard, you’re being preached at by some holier-than-thou Paladin…”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Wolf…”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lightning began to crackle as the druid continued his ranting, and stray blizzards manifested briefly over the calm waters, raging briefly and then fading away.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“AND those people at the school of magic can BARELY be bothered to sell you batwings…’We’re concentrating on our ART…” more like they’re concentrating on their ARSE!”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Wolf, look here, old saw…”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“And WHY is that Dark Elf swimming under the dock in the SEWER-POLLUTED WATER and giving me the finger! Why I ought to…”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“WOLFWIND,” shouted Faltigoth at the top of his lungs. The druid in question broke off his rant and dropped to the dock, looking about wildly for his doom.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“..what…” whispered Wolfwind, eyes wide.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The Boat’s here…” said Faltigoth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Oh.” Wolfwind climbed to his feet, gathering the shards of his dignity about him like a Wizard harvesting mana. “I knew that.” He looked around at the fair-sized crowd that was even now stampeding its way onto the boat and looking anxiously in his direction. He gestured towards the boat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Shall we?”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“We shall.”</description>
