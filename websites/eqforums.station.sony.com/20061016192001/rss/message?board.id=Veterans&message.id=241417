&lt;P&gt;Loral asks this question at almost every HoC chat.&amp;nbsp; The last one, Raghnell said they were looking into ways to make new models a reality.&amp;nbsp; They had some ideas, but nothing they could share.&amp;nbsp; You can read the chat log for the exact wording; it's posted in the Town Crier.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;there something i liked about old model ,&amp;nbsp; you could tell wich gear people had&amp;nbsp; just from looking at them . &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;the cleric armor&amp;nbsp; from poh was the most obivous .&amp;nbsp; with the purple color . &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;today it just not the same , walk around&amp;nbsp; pok , and everyone look the same , no matter wich gear they have . &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;1 - be nice to have something extra to tell the noob from the ubber one again . &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;2- be nice to be able to tell the difference&amp;nbsp; from diety also , good or evil one ....&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>You guys really, honest to god think that new models would perform better than the luclin models?&amp;nbsp; Be reasonable.&amp;nbsp; Yes, the luclin models are inefficient.&amp;nbsp; Newer models may be more efficient, but they'll also likely be a lot more detailed (if they aren't, what's the freakin point?).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh, and unless the game is really really badly designed, leaving the old models as an option does nothing to the "global file".&amp;nbsp; You only load one version of each model- you don't load all 2 (or 3 if they add new ones).&amp;nbsp; Thus the old versions wouldn't be taking up ram and cpu if the newer models were selected.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;I would be &lt;EM&gt;thoroughly &lt;/EM&gt;pleased if we got new models.&amp;nbsp; The luclin models have always been something that I never liked about the current game.&amp;nbsp; The old models were always superior in many ways, especially animations and armor textures.&amp;nbsp; I also hate how a level 1 dude&amp;nbsp;can look exactly the same (as far as armor goes) as a level 70.&amp;nbsp; If you're an uber toon, you should be able to look the part.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>There is enormous room for improvement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Look what happened to the horse model. The original Luclin horse was clunky and disproportionate. The new horse looks like a horse, wow! Beautiful.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Look at the new orcs and goblins and other mobs. They look great! Their movements and expressions convey personality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Characters in a game are like actors in a movie. If you find them to be "unbelievable", "disenchanting", "clumsy"... well, this takes away from the movie, no matter how great the scenery and story. In fact, well-drawn characters (pun intended) can go a long way toward elevating the experience.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am very glad to hear that the developers will redo the character models. I complained about them when they came out. As bad as the original character models were, they were a lot more clever and artistic with very limited polygons. The Luclin characters were given a lot of polygons, but most of the artwork was&amp;nbsp; uninspired and the anatomy was unskilled. (Yeah, I studied art!) I wonder why shouldn't EQ have character models as good as EQII?&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Characters need to have qualities of whimsy and mystery. The races need to be very distinct. I whole-heartedly agree that an "anime" feeling should be avoided. Fantasy doesn't mean cutesy. RPGs depend on their capacity to evoke a response in us, so that we feel that something special is happening.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And one thing... sheath weapons when they are not in use! Noone runs around with sword in hand unless he is fighting. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;---Opal&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;This isn't a text based game, graphics matter.&amp;nbsp; I'd like new models that run efficiently, but..I'd like a better overall product to play more.&amp;nbsp; More levels, more content, more spells..better itemization, couple 100 more aa to grind, some more tradeskills, research combines etc.&amp;nbsp; The graphics, I'll live with as-is.&amp;nbsp; The content and character upgrades/additions/expansions, I expect to be there in a timely manner..and at an acceptable level of playability(recent expansions have been nice from an execution standpoint, although I do wish they had done more with DoN).&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Jebasiz on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;06-16-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;05:36 PM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;i would like to see new character models and more customization features for the player. we spend hours/days immersed into these characters, variety becomes necessary after a while or you just get bored.&lt;br&gt;the models now are very old and inefficient, just please start working on something new and refreshing. at the very minimum allow mount speed in old graphics for the player who owns one but hasn't loaded luclin models--you can do this by just granting the speed improvement without having to render the actual graphic...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-Undo &amp;lt;Assent&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href=""&gt;http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=354302&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;Fix the 2-hand bash and the swinging-a-2-hander-with-1-hand animation and I'd be happy.&amp;nbsp; Its just pure laziness, and a deep seated lack of attention to detail.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The original models look old and dated.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The luclin models have many problems.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;OL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;The idle stances for many of them just look plain awkward.&amp;nbsp; I hate the iksar model specifically for this reason.&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;The combat animations are just awful.&amp;nbsp; Worse then bad.&amp;nbsp; Pathetic in fact.&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Animations other then combat are ok but far worse then what you see in any other game.&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Performance is terrible.&amp;nbsp; These models should fly on new systems with new video cards yet they still cause major frame rate issues.&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;The armor looks silly.&amp;nbsp; Why do half the character models wear WWC championship belts?&amp;nbsp; Come on thats just awful.&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Why do the females lool like they are on steroids and the males look like they never even caught sight of a gym?&amp;nbsp; Was this to counteract the critics who said the original models were sexist?&amp;nbsp; I liked the face that the girls looked like girls in the original models.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The best thing about EQ2 was the character models.&amp;nbsp; I loved the combat animations especially.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I would be willing to say that with new models with flawless animation EQ would look and feel as good as any of the best new games.&amp;nbsp; We already know EQ game mechanics blow those games away.&amp;nbsp; Its time to revamp the character models!!&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>Well the lack of armor selection falls back on the Model issue as well, for two reasons. The current system means that each new piece of armor needs to fit 2 sets of the appropriate models, which can make it awkward/time consuming to add. (Adding weapons is relatively easy since weapons only interact with your character at one point, the hand, and have a set box. Armor on the other hand has to interact all around your character)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The other reason is the good ole Global Memory file limitation. With both model sets taking up realestate in that file, combined with how many armor pieces you would need to create a full set of armor (for each class and each race combo, at least around 3 armor types per race and sex model), in a nut shell, armor takes up more room  than weapons do, so new looks are harder to get in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Still, improved armor looks are probably the second biggest visual change the Dev's want to do, after new PC models themselves; it's just that one depends on the other to get done. Basically, look at the Luclin models as the dam that is keeping armor sets, new PC races, and a pile of other things locked up. :(</description>

&lt;P&gt;I like all of the new npc models that they've been releasing. Rats in freeport, deathfist orcs, magician pets, skeletons, goblins in solusek, and lots more. I've never liked the Luclin models. I keep all of the old models up except for Vah Shir since they never had old models. Plus any models required for horses.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The old models were elegant. Plus, ogres and trolls are supposed to scratch their butts all the time.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>I don't despise the Luclin models but I only run two of them and thats so I can use a horse... everything else is on old models and my comp can definitely run them all!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Perhaps the Luclin models would have seen more love if the facial options and hair choices weren't so obvious... I mean for DE female there is only 1 hair choice that doesn't look ridiculous IMO. ;)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's funny that anime models got brought up... EQ2 made the SOGA models available to everyone because of the demand. You can run the original / SOGA models for your choices in EQ2, much like you can pick Old/Luclin models in EQ.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Of course, with the original models you only got, what, 5 choices. At all? You couldn't match the hair with the face of your choice. Couldn't change the eye color without changing everything else. I don't see how they were so much better when the options were so much more limited back then.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;But you always have the option of turning off the Luclin models if you want to, so no biggie from my point of view. I may turn on the original models, myself, until Luclin comes out. Just to give it an old feel.&lt;/P&gt;</description>
