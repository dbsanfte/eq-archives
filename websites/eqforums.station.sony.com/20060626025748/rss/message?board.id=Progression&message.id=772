    <description>a classic server. which means no luclin spires, no ldons, no pok books, no newbie armor and alot of patchwork armor. please give the people what they want. I for one would love come back and give you money just to GO BACK to the way it was. keeping the resubscribers happy = more money for you!&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

This is a serious question. Do people believe that if they call the progression server &amp;quot;classic&amp;quot; enough times over, it will magically change into one? Or do they just selectively read around the various comments &amp;quot;This is not a classic server&amp;quot;. I only ask because, regardless of how many times it's said &amp;quot;this is not a classic server&amp;quot; someone says &amp;quot;question about the classic server&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To the OP, anyone who reseubcribes looking for a classic server will be disappointed. They will not be disappointed at the fault of SOE in anyway, who has never claimed this to be classic in anyway. Their disappointment is caused by folks who, through untruthful statements, lead them to believe it a classic server when in fact, it is not.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I am almost certain newbie armor will still be in the game.  Luclin spires, ldon, pok books will eventually be in the game within the first 6 months probably.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I think this server is a good compromise between people wanting classic and the devs not rewriting all the code and removing all the small stuff like quests and items and such.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I don't think people will be resubscribing for something that wasn't announced.  Meaning they won't be expecting pure classic.</description>

      <description>Tutorial wasn't available until about 2 years ago (GoD release maybe?) so if the progression server were set to only release certain part based at the expansion, the tutorial won't be available right away.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the classic part of EQ was much harder than today's EQ so there will be some &amp;quot;knuckleheads&amp;quot; whining for tutorial so they can find all the spells and gears in one easy zone rather than having to farm and make it yourself.  And no spell for most non-caster classes until like level 9 or so.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Tutorial will be in it from the sounds of thigns but they might tune the equipment from it. Quite frankly I'm glad if it is in. The first 10 levels sucekd wit hthe overcrowdning this will spread people out nicely and all it really does is give you a free 9-10 hours of jumping ahead and not having to deal wit hthe frustration of finidng a snake or lion around to kill.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Nobody from SOE is calling it a classic server. The only reason people will be expecting it to be a classic server is because knuckleheads keep using the term in their subject lines.&lt;/div&gt;</description>
