				Class: Cleric<br>Progress point: High end Qvic/Txecvu<br><br>This is just my own personal rules of thumbs I generally follow when I look at gear for upgrades and such. I know it isn't ideal but it works for me mostly <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0><br><br>When I look at items being linked, the first three things I generally check out are:<br><br>HP: More HP I have, the better. If it's less HP than the item I'm replacing I don't really look much beyond that.<br>Mana: Same as HP basically.<br>AC: I'm willing to take an AC drop if other factors make it nice, but generally I only look for more AC.<br><br>As for the rest of the stats.<br><br>Basic stats (STA/WIS/INT/etc...), I don't usually give a second glance to, as long as the item appears to have a lot of  them I don't look into specifics. The high end stats, other than the minimum to keep at/near the caps, don't really play much of a factor in my equipment choices. <br><br>Resists: I look closer to than basic stats but I still only skim them. Generally I try to make sure the resists are still going up (I'm not capped yet) but I don't specifically look for them in a piece.<br><br>ManaRegen/HP Regen: It's nice if the item has it, but I don't specifically look for it. If the piece I'm replacing has a high +regen modifier I might look closr but generally I skip it. It would be nice if those totals were visible somewhere in game so we could tell how far over the cap we are, and that might make me pay more attention to those values. <br><br>For combat effects, I do try and get them when I can, but it's not a priority for me yet. They are more of a "That'd be nice to have" for me at this stage. Still, it would be nice to see current totals in game somehow for those +modifiers, so I can tell "Oh I'm near my cap" or "Man I should work on that if I can find the upgrades."<br><br>Same applies for SKill mods.<br><br>In case you missed one of the themes, one of the big things that may make SKill mods and Combat effects more noticeable is to make them more visible. It's outside your domain I know, but if you (generic you) can come up with a way that we can see what skill mods, combat effects and regen rates we have on us in total, it would help greatly. With that information they would probably become a bigger factor in my equipment choices and equipment desires. Without it, I may put in for something that has Extended Range, without realizing I've already got 2 Extended Range items already.<br><br>Oh almost forgot meelee weapon stats. With my Epic 1.5, I don't even look at shields nor 2HB's so that just leaves 1HB's. There, I tend to look and see if the damage/delay is better than my summoned hammer, and then I check procs on it. I'd love some more hammer choices to meelee with (soloing) that would rival my summoned hammer. In situations when I'm not fighting though, most of the time I keep Epic 1.0 equipped out of habit. (I've gotten into the habit of using the bandoler to switch to mod rod, click rod, switch back to rez stick)<p>Message Edited by Saroc_Luclin on <span class=date_text>07-06-2006</span> <span class=time_text>04:15 PM</span>
