<P>So now it's day 2 of our Las Vegas Adventure.&nbsp; Those staying in the Sahara meet at 9 AM so we can /movelog <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-wink.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0> over to the Hilton and have breakfast at their fabulous buffet...</P>
<P>While we wait for the rest of our group we do some gambling on the nickel machines, we are such big spenders <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0></P>
<P>Here is a photo of Kytherea gambling...</P>

<P>Now its time for breakfast, we have our share of bacon, eggs, crepes, fresh fruit, and other delicious breakfast items...</P>
<P>Here is a picture of our group eating, notice Brenlo is using a disposable coffee mug, I wonder where his regular mug is on this fine Wednesday morning... Mongoose anyone?</P>

<P><FONT size=1><EM>From Left to Right, Ky's Hubby Tom, Ky, Bonnie, and then Brenlo on the other side of the table...&nbsp; I am of course taking the picture.</EM></FONT></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>After Breakfast I attempt to connect to the internet again... Sadly I was not successful; sometimes I think the Technology Gods have a grudge against Halflings...&nbsp; It's time to do a little sight seeing so we use the /movelog I mean monorail and hop over to the MGM grand.&nbsp; We walk through and ooohhh and ahhh over the sights in there.&nbsp; There are 2 female lion cubs in the Lion Habitat with their trainers.&nbsp; They are so cute, but a Halfling can't get too close, so I watch from afar...</P>
<P>Our final destination for sight seeing today is the New York New York.&nbsp; The gang wants to ride the rollercoaster there.&nbsp; Me, I am too chicken so I am delegated to "Stuff Holder" and sit it out.&nbsp; After the ride we have a fabulous lunch of New York style pizza, and then /movelog back to the Hilton and some of us back to the Sahara where I sit now updating you on our day.</P>
<P>I am off to put together some stuff for the Summit folks and then it's time for some "Meet and Greet" in Quark's, I can't wait to have one of those Warp Core breeches...&nbsp; I am taking my camera.&nbsp; If it isn't too late tonight I will report back.</P>
<P>Fare thee well!!!<BR></P><p>Message Edited by Ashlanne on <span class=date_text>06-14-2005</span> <span class=time_text>07:08 PM</span>
