&lt;DIV&gt;Travel is the word of the day!&amp;nbsp; Been traveling quite a bit.&amp;nbsp; Austin, Vegas, Seattle, Anaheim.&amp;nbsp; All fun stuff but it makes for a very busy halfling.&amp;nbsp; Went to SWG Fan Fest and had a good time.&amp;nbsp; The folks there are just as friendly and fun as you are, not to mention passionate.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I spent Monday and Tuesday of this week in the Emerald city, visiting our Seattle office and meeting some of the team from the Matrix Online.&amp;nbsp; A fine bunch of smart folks up there.&amp;nbsp; I also got the chance to see my favorite ball team, the Mariners and that was a great time as well.&amp;nbsp; Although the M's lost, I was able to enjoy Safeco field and the yummy garlic fries.&amp;nbsp; Mmmm them's good eats.&amp;nbsp; For those you not in the know, they are fries tossed in olive oil and minced garlic.&amp;nbsp; Damn they are tasty.&amp;nbsp; I had forgotten how pretty the skyline was up there in the Pacific Northwest.&amp;nbsp; Seeing Mt. Rainier in the distance has always been one of my favorite sights (when you can see it through the rain).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I did have a blast at Fan Faire this year!&amp;nbsp; To those of you who came by, thank you very much for the great time.&amp;nbsp; It is always a pleasure to meet and interact with you.&amp;nbsp; To those of you who did not make this one, perhaps we can meet next time.&amp;nbsp; Fan Faire is a great event as it is all about you, the Community.&amp;nbsp; Yeah we have seminar's and panels and demo's. We show off our new stuff and have fun but at its heart, it is about gamers getting together and talking about games.&amp;nbsp; It's about you and your friends sharing your experiences.&amp;nbsp; It's even about us at SOE getting to know you and vice-versa.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;3 days of Fan Faire fun and I did not lose my voice.&amp;nbsp; Some naysayers (Ashlanne, Kytherea, Jenebel and others) had a pool going as to which day I would no longer be able to bore you all with my high pitched nasally mono-tone, well I beat the odds and made it the whole weekend.&amp;nbsp; Not sure if that is a good thing for those of you who attended.&amp;nbsp; I did misplace my coffee mug and I have seen some incriminating screen shots of various infamous board posters with said mug.&amp;nbsp; I think some halflings have some splaining to do.&amp;nbsp; This Fan Faire was bigger than ever with more to do and see.&amp;nbsp; We plan to continue that with the next one (no announcement yet, sorry folks) and add more panels and such to make sure that there is something to do (along with sitting with your in-game friends and chatting) the entire weekend.&amp;nbsp; Who knows, maybe next time we can have a dunking booth and you can all take turns dunking me and other SOE folks.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Until next time, make mine Mocha.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
