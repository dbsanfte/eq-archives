    <description>Hi, you may have read my other posts, if so you will know that I have been away for 15 months. Now I have returned i have discovered that my old guild is no more. I was wondering if any guilds are activly recuiting at mo. I am a 51 warrior wilthout epic/don or dark. I play for about 1-2 hours weekdays and 3-5 hours weekend days. I prefer a casual guild where there is no pressure on you to do this or do that. Send a whisper or post a reply. P.s my toons name is Raknruin.</description>
