    <title>EQ wont start - Need help</title>
    <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=tech&amp;message.id=127040</link>
    <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Ok, I click on my EQ shortcut to play EQ. EQ patcher does not come up, but when I click on the shortcut again, it says EQ patcher is already running. After a few minutes, it says I dont have a connection so EQ can't Sstart. Well, I do have a connection, I can get onto this website and make this post. I have 2 computers here that this is happening too. What can I do?&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;I tried rebooting the DSL and Router, but with no luck. This is starting to piss me off. Knowing I have internet but cant play EQ.</description>

&lt;P&gt;I feel your pain. About 2 weeks ago they ran this patch on the Test servers and ever since I can get to the Login Server but after I enter my Station name and Password it says the Login Server is down. Talked to several CSR and finally I sat down with one and we walked through some problem solvers. None of which worked. Then I was told sorry if none of those work we don't support the Test server after that. So, I thought "Fine! Screw Test servers! I can still login to my regular server." So, I ignored it since it didn't affect my regular server until I ran the patch this morning for the regular servers. Now I can't even establish a connection when I click the icon. You mentioned you have to wait several minutes before it says you don't have a connection. Mine says it the instant it tries to open. I've tried uninstalling EverQuest altogether and reinstalling to see if I had a corrupt file. I've tried rebooting everything. I'm not having an issue with the Direct X 9.0. And I do not have any Firewalls active. I'm at a loss of what to do. And about ready to just turn everything off and walk away. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Oh yea and when I receive the message that the patcher could not establish a connection it says I should try contacting someone at &lt;A href="mailto:EQtech@soe.sony.com" target=_blank&gt;EQtech@soe.sony.com&lt;/A&gt;. So, I figured what the hoot I'll go through the entire CSR thing again. So, I spent about an hour making sure I gave them all the needed information and exactly what the issue was only to find out the email bounced back saying the given address wasn't the correct one. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;If you happen to figure out what's happening with the connection please let me know. And if I find a fix I will post it as well.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;WooT. Well, I got the patcher to run finally. I was scanning the boards for some kind of solution and there is a post stating that you should try uninstalling all virus protection services. I only have Norton's so I uninstalled it and turned off the symantec and it opened no problem. If you also have symantec try &lt;A href="http://www.symantec.com/uninstall" target=_blank&gt;www.symantec.com/uninstall&lt;/A&gt; for solutions if you have a problem turning off this application. Now I am just waiting for the patcher to complete the download to see if it let's me past the login server. Will post what happens when I reach that point.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;Ok, I uninstalled Norton's as I posted above this. And I turned off Symantec and the patcher updated with no issues at all and Login didn't give me any issues either.</description>

&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;least you know where the issue is now, you can reinstall Norton and configure it correctly to allow eq to work</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;I did the whole Direct x 9 thing the other night. EQ was running just fine last night.&amp;nbsp; I leave my trader on when I'm not home or sleeping. It was running fine when I went to bed last night. I woke up, came down and saw my EQ was down. So I restarted it. And now it doesn't work.</description>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;You need to detail out your internet connection, router, firewall, broadband, etc.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;first a question, you did do the required directx 9.0c patch that is listed in the patch message and the stickied post here correct?&lt;/P&gt;</description>
