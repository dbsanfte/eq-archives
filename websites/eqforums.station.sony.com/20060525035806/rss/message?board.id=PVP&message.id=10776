      <description>If you are just addressing your concerns to Devs, just email them.  Dont post on a "message board" where everyone has the right to respond. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you do post on a "message board" then people assume you want a response from those who regularly post there (other customers).  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I wonder if you would have chastized posters if they would have agreed with you instead?</description>

&lt;P&gt;What exactly would YOU want from this meeting?  As best as I can tell, the ruleset for Zek was an exact copy of RZ rules with ONE exception, that being that if you choose not to pvp other people in zone or lock the corpse then you run the risk of being Ninjalooted.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
It's quickly going down the drain, turning into what Sullon Zek use to be, and defeating the whole purpose of the server merge.  Wasn't SZ the lowest populated server? &#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Sorry, but you're pretty clueless.  This server is NOTHING like SZ.  If they kept SZ rules, I'd take a vacation from work for a week just to show you whats up.  I know you might be thinking INSTANCED...   But, hey guess what?  It's kinda hard to raid when 1/2 your raidforce dies before they get there.  Doesn't matter if it's KoD, Yxtta, Qvic, Txevu, etc.  Most of your raid would die before they reached their instance.  I'd bring one group, and most likely that would be all I needed.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;But, alas I am getting sidetracked.  Most of SZ plays by the rules, one of these rules is:  You kill people that aren't with you or lock the corpse OTHERWISE you might get ninjalooted.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
 One of the sole purposes for the merge was to increase server population.  If things continue in the direction they are now, the server will quickly lose population.  Now, maybe that is what you all want as I can certainly see it being less of a headache for your staff of GM's.  However, there are quite a few people that would rather quit than take you up on the /movelog offer.  That is not a solution.   We want pvp, and there is still a huge population of players who want to continue playing EQ, but not at this expense.  I'm sure I'll get slammed and called a stupid retarded newbie for even posting this, but open your eyes, and give us some customer service.  Is it not eye opening when you have people come here threatening to get the FCC and Lawyers involved?  If that hasn't opened your eyes, then hopefully a straight forward post like mine will.&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;If things continue which way?  Ninjalooting?  If people can't adapt, then let em have fun somewhere else.  I won't miss the crying.  But, I do agree that a published Ruleset regarding ninjalooting might stop petitions and be less of a headache to GMs.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

Then to finish my day off, I'll rob a little old lady.  Are you really that immature that you need to bring RL situations into this?  Well, all your other cries for help didn't work, might as well try that right?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not everything in life comes for free, and thats a lesson I learned?  All I learned was that Defiant is too retarted to keep a corpse locked while other guilds are in the zone.  Maybe you don't know how to lock a corpse, so let me explain it for you....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When your raid mob dies (when its life reaches 0% and it falls over), the designated "looters" for the raid RIGHT CLICK (dont left click) the corpse.  Doing this will open up a new "window" which allows them to see the loots which this mob has dropped.  Don't get up just yet, because if you do, others can now loot that same corpse.  Now your raid leaders take tells and decide who wins what loots.  Now when they are ready to loot their item, they send that same player who is on the corpse a /tell, and say "I'm ready to loot my item, unlock the corpse please".  That player who has the corpse locks says "OK" and gets off the corpse, allowing that player to get his/her new item.  When that player loots his item, and if there is still more loots on corpse of said mob, then that first player right clicks the corpse again.  By doing this, you ensure noone can "ninja loot" that named mob's corpse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Really though, we did this on SZ for 4 years.  The person (usually Speedd) who was going to attempt to ninja loot even brought 20-30+ mob trains with him, so you can imagine how chaotic it was trying to derail a train, keep a corpse locked, decide on loots, etc.  We've even dealt with the warping ninja looters.  Just because they warp or are near the corpse doesn't mean they can loot it, having 1-2 people who just keep the corpse locked will ensure noone will get the loot on the corpse.  We didn't even use DA's to loot you, hell you were ninja looted once by a WARRIOR!  Sorry, don't blame SoE, don't blame CS, don't blame anyone else but yourselves.  It's not hard to keep a corpse locked, usually good officers will have all loot decided before that 5 minute time limit is up and someone risks being booted off the corpse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now please, stop whining, you are just making everyone laugh at you.  You got ninja looted because you were morons and don't know how to lock a corpse, you got ninja looted with hacks and without DA.  Suck it up and learn how to lock the mobs corpse if you want to keep the loots.  If you need help with how to lock a corpse, please scroll up as I have given a detailed description to how to do this.  Good day :)</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;haha, I was about to comment on that. The problem still stands with out of range players following raids around and ganking the loot. When this happens there's nothing to report, and hence, GMs wont do **SMURF**. Happened to us the other day.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Marrienna, I guess that why some people threaten to bring lawyers to solve the "problem", because they dont know the difference between real life and a game&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ;)&amp;nbsp; .&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I think it is funny how people consider pvp. What is interesting for me about pvp is that you never know what will happen. It is not just killing the named over and over again using a strategy and getting good items, but doing it knowing that someone might come at any moment and try to bother you.&amp;nbsp;If some &amp;nbsp;people see it as harassment, I am really wondering what they are doing on a pvp server. Those people seem to act as they are on a blue server and pvp when it is convenient for them. I see it as&amp;nbsp;the challenge of&amp;nbsp;a pvp server. If I wanted to just kill mobs without worrying about other people I would just play on a blue server. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I agree, it sucks if you get trained or ninja looted. However train is illegal, and ninja loot is something that can be easly counter. You got ninja looted, we got ninja looted. We all learned our lesson, we dont need to bother GM for such&amp;nbsp; little things. That a reason why they are so slow to answer us. There are a bunch of people petitioning for all kind of BS. &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Zek is a cess pool. Cut and dry. It's a server full of retards from Sullon. The trash of all video games. Good job Sony ruining 3 decent pvp servers by allowing the Sullon trash to contaminate pvp.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>Holy crap Vallon Zek must have been the nursery of the 4 Zek servers, every single person on this forum from the VZ server has done nothing but whine and moan and complain about every random thing.  You're not in bluebieville anymore, quit whining and bitching about every random thing that happens to you.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"WAHHHHH GM, MY GUILD WAS TOO STUPID TO ACTUALLY LOCK A CORPSE, AND THE BIG BAD HATE GUILD ZONED IN AND TOOK OUR LOOTS, WAHHHH CHANGE MY DIAPER AND GIVE ME BACK MY LOOTS BEFORE I TELL MY MOMMY AND DADDY!"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seriously tho, the more you whine, the more I start to check zones to ninja loot you even more.  In a few weeks, I'll have a full set of Qvic gear, and I won't even need to spend DKP :D</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Sorry but this server is&amp;nbsp; nowhere even remotely close to how sullon zek was.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; If you are that incompetent to prevent ninja looting go to a blue server already, and stop posting on here all the time CRYING and WHINING about it.&amp;nbsp; No one cares you got ninja looted because you were stupid enough to let it happen.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;LOL, Zek is nothing like SZ. You would have use /movelog a long time ago, if it was like SZ. Zek has rules, SZ did not have any. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;You need to leave your flying blubie island and come back to earth. Zek is a mixed of all pvp servers, thus you have a mixed of all rules. It seems to me like you were in one of the top guild of your server and did not have any real competition. Now that things have changed and you actually have to fight, you are trying to get more rules to feel "safer", like it was on your server. Zek is not&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;server you used to be playing in anymore. It is the server for all pvpers. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;In my opinion, Zek rules are not bad. SoE just need to get more GM, who actually know the rules and do something when someone break one of them.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Main problem on Zek at the moment are the hackers. And please Goldcyn, dont say that all of your guildmember dont cheat and are just angels.&amp;nbsp;On each server there was some cheaters and they need to be deal with.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;They are people training on Zek, but I can assure you that it is nothing like SZ. So people shouldn't cry about it, especially when those trainers comes from different servers. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Ninja looting is easly counter if someone lock the corpse. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;PS: You are talking like you know how SZ was, but have you even played on the server, or are you just talking about what you read on different posts. And Everquest is a game. People that come here threatening to get FCC and lawyers involved make me LOL. They are probably the same kind of people who sue McDonald because they didnt warn them that eating too many Big Mac will make them gain weight.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;See my Subject it is addressed to developers.&amp;nbsp;Thanks for your opinions and thinking you know exactly what I'm talking about, but you don't.&amp;nbsp; It's a simple request to host a meeting between Dev's, GM's, and Guild Leaderships to address things they see as problems.&amp;nbsp; One of the biggest being the lack of communication between the three.&amp;nbsp; Developers post one thing, GM's enforce another.&amp;nbsp; Look for example at Ashlannes post about the ruleset, and then go read the actual ruleset.&amp;nbsp; There is conflict in those two things alone.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Furthermore, I said "ALL" guild leadership teams, meaning Hate, and AsD as well.&amp;nbsp; I haven't discluded anyone in this, and if you don't foresee any problems with the server the way it is,&amp;nbsp; you'd be free to express that as well.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;You guys really need to quit acting like 2 year olds and slam people who have opinions that differ from your own.&amp;nbsp; We all are here for one common reason and that is the love of the game and pvp.&amp;nbsp; Why be a jerk about it?&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>How long are you going to sit here and whine like a 10 year old who wants cotton candy at the annual carnival?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Guess what, the Zek ruleset was based on Rallos Zek rules.  They took ***ONE*** rules from the SZ ruleset.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please don't try to convince SoE that ninja looting is the reason SZ had a low population, you are just making yourself looking like an ass.  I was playing on SZ on day one, the reason SZ died was because of TRAINS and TEAMS.  Ninja looting was at the very bottom of the list, with things like greenie griefing and faction burns.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trains are illegal on Zek, if your going to complain about that, then fine, I'll complain with you, trains are lame.  If on the other hand your going to cry more about ninja looting, just shut up and move on.  Its way too easy to prevent ninja looters.  Even with trains on SZ, we were able to stop ninja looters 95% of the time.  You're not in bluebieville anymore, we don't have teaparties and hug everyone we see in different zones.  Get used to it and stop whining.</description>
