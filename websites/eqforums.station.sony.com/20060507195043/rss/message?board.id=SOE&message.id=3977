    <description>No idea how well it is or isn't working, only SOE knows that. What I do know is that 2 Station Exchange servers were launched, and when PVP was brought in, one was switched over to be PVP Station Exchanged (They merged the 2 original station exchange servers into 1, then relaunched the second one as PVP Station Exchange)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Farmers and Plat Sellers still exist on the rest of the servers; you'd have to be extremely naive if you thought Station Exchange would make them all stop, but the servers themselves seem to have been going well. (There was talk at some point of launching some EQLive SE servers, but I don't know what happened to that)</description>

      <title>EQ II question</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=SOE&amp;message.id=3976#M3976</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Hi,&lt;br&gt;almost a year ago today Ashlanne posted about the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=SOE&amp;message.id=15"&gt;station exchange for EQ II&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It must be running at least 9 months now and I haven't heard much about it. Has it helped reduce that 40% of CS time devoted to helping recover lost items (which were believed to have been bought out of game)? Has it stopped the illegal trading (against the EULA at least)? How did the choice of servers for the station exchange work out? How is the community on those servers? Was Mr. Smedley's idea a good one? Was it all well implemented?&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Maebe on &lt;span class="date_text"&gt;04-18-2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;11:49 AM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
