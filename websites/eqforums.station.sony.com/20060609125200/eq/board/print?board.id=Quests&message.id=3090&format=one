I accidentally deleted this task instead of a Dragons of Norrath mission one day and thus lost that progress. I tried to petition to have the Shop Keeper’s Delight task restored with my previous progress, but was told that was not possible. Therefore, the next time my travels brought me nearby, I picked up the task again from Borso. However, now when I click on the crates on Tellen’s counter, they are not being picked up by my character like it had worked before. The crate remains visible on the counter and nothing appears on my cursor. Please investigate this task and advise so that I might be able to finish this task. Thank you.</span></p><p></span><span><font color="#000000"></font></span> </p></div>
