				<DIV>Many people in this thread forgot that the quest actually on test is only meant for <U>backflaging</U> and only for <U>backflaging</U>. THis by no way means a single group/ player access to the elemental planes or time, allowing to skip the entire flaging process</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>anyway, nowadays, guilds may still get flag for the EPs, and will surely skip Time, right now there are raid encounters in oow that are much much easier to reach and drop same if not better quality items</DIV>

				<DIV>Yay, and I'll explain why, but first character background so you can see where I am coming from:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Started right before GoD's release&nbsp;on my current toon, now a 66 SK with 98 AA's. I'm two flags away from Water/Air/Earth ((Rallos and Agnarr)). Then just Sol Ro for Fire. The Alliance I'm in has done all these, so it's just a matter of getting them.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>First off: Yes, I understand there needs to be raid content, and many guilds would be upset if the raid content would be made groupable, or have group equivalents... but honestly, how old is PoP? Raid guilds have plenty to do.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>And all we're talking is access. NOT flags. So, for example: I get the groupable EP access, should it happen that way. Can I get PoEB access? No. Can I get my Xeg, etc flags? Sure... doesn't mean I can access Time. I'd need to complete the WHOLE deal, and honestly, I think this should be the case. Time is a raid zone, no doubt about it... and even as someone who 9 times out of 10 champion's the casual, I understand the raiders need their content. If you want Time, you need to do the whole shabang. HOWEVER, having EP access up until that point gives two advantages: A) Gear and grinding B) Easier backflagging. And as has been said, if you can do the <U>groupable </U>content, access should be given. Doesn't mean you get the raid rewards.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>ALso, on the whole skill thing, it's nonexistant. I've met raiders with raid level gear who have not a CLUE what they are doing. I've met people with crap gear who can pull off amazing stunts in group and live. Skill is player dependant. I will say that raiding gives you the <U>chance</U> to practice/get some skills you just can't with groups.. however, the person behind the toon still needs to be intelligent enough to pick it up, and some of these skills could be explained to and picked up by casuals. I've met some players who, on their first raid, took some tips and picked them up immediately, making them look like an experienced raider.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The reason this needs to be? Well, for years there has been raid and group content, with the raider getting access to both. This is alright, in and of an expansion, because years later, as gear changed, that content could be grouped. However, with keys and flagging, some of this content remained locked. And the longer this has gone on, the more the locked content will begin to climb, and the gap widens.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>All EP access through groupable content would do is the following: A)Make for easier backflagging/gearing of new raid guild members/toons. ((Would likely make getting an alt Time flagged in a Time guild a LOT easier/faster)) B) Allow those who can handle the content access, thus expanding the groupable zones and allowing casuals access to a good few zones. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>For those who are worried the gap will shrink TOO much, and raiding will not be far enough above grouping: Uqua, Qvic, Tacvi, MPG ((Raid trials, and raid guilds got a jump on being effective here)), Riftseekers, and Tier 2 Quest Armor from OoW.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I will say SOME, not all, but SOME casual players need to look into other options. Though the drop rate for the OoW Tier 1 prolly needs a little tweaking ((And I mean MORE drops, not less Devs /eye)), it's good gear, and groupable. There aren't many quests that don't need raid access ((Someone once told me casuals should be glad they have groupable quests like the Veeshan's Peak ones.. though this works on FV, I think he missed the giant dragon Shade somewhere =) )), but the Tier 1 OoW armor is DAMN good.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>In closing, the world of Norrath is soon to be overshadowed by it's future post-apocolyptic version. If it doesn't open up, many will leave.... however.. this MAY be the intentions of the Powers That Be.</DIV>

				<DIV>Instead of looking in a 6-month old (dead) thread, look in the current one that explains what SOE is really doing.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>SOE is not opening the planes to single groups, with a quest or anything else.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I refer you to other threads for the details, but it looks like (in summary):</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>You can get gimped into a raid like always. A <EM>few </EM>NO DROP items will drop from the Raid MOB. These items can be used on a quest to get the real flag for the MOB. It does not mean you get all of the flags leading up to it, and you still need to be part of the raid that took it down.</DIV>
