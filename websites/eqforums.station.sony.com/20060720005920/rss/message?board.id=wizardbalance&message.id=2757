&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff00ff&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Wizard&lt;/STRONG&gt; - &lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;List Update scheduled for&amp;nbsp;04/01/05&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;1) &lt;STRONG&gt;Short to Medium term damage -&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;This will most likely be considered as part of the class Re-Envision process.&amp;nbsp; Some changes have been made to your damage dealing spells on Test Server.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Wizards are currently falling further and further behind in these areas, areas that they should actually excel given the major limitations on their damage potential. In reality, any class that isn't mana based should not even come close, and yet, many do, often exceeding the class by more than a minor amount. This is just exacerbated by the current trend of making fights last longer again, which actually only hurts classes that have built in limits on their damage, Wizards being the one that is probably the most affected by it. And this is without even taking into account mob abilities that affect casters to an even greater extent (high resists, mana drains, and even total immunities to spell damage).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2) Long term damage&lt;/STRONG&gt; -&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Currently being discussed, This will most likely be considered as part of the class Re-Envision process.&amp;nbsp; Some changes have been made to your damage dealing spells on Test Server.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;While Wizards tend to be be more focused on short term damage, they do suffer a lot when it comes to long term damage in groups because their damage is all mana based. This tends to mean that classes that come very close to or even exceed them in short term damage just destroy them when it comes to long term damage because they have no such limitations. Some ideas may be help with mana regen in places where this is a problem, or an extended line of spells that address this problem (lower dps, but higher efficiency).&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;3) Manaburn - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Changes to manaburn will come with part #1 of the Class Re-Envision process.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;A Wizard can currently spend their entire mana bar to do a little over 9k damage in 5 seconds - leaving the wizard completely helpless and out of mana afterwards. At the same time Ancient Strike of Chaos - our best fire-based nuke can crit for over 8k using less than 1 bubble of mana and taking 1 more second to cost. The damage cap on manaburn should be removed (with the exception of PvP), and it should be returned to its pre-nerf state.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;4) Aggro problems - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Changes to the way aggro is gained through spells is being considered with part #1 of the Class Re-Envision Process.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As spell damage goes up, aggro also increases. And so does mob damage output. So the penalty for gaining aggro for any reason can often be almost instant death. Currently Maelin's legs are the only real method used for aggro control at the high end, and they put Wizards roughly where they should be in terms of overall damage, while allowing some capability to maybe escape death when the MT goes down. But as spell damage goes up, they will become more of a limiter on how much dps rises because aggro is still going to be the main limitation, which would essentially leave Wizards in the same spot (concussion is a fixed amount, it doesn't scale in the manner that Evade can if you get too high on the list and there is no version of Wizard 'Escape'). Going back to spell based Concussion doesn't really solve the overall problem, it just increases the chance that Wizards will die when the MT does while likely lowering overall dps.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;5) Resists - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Wizards were supposed to be able to have an innately better chance of landing spells than any other class because all of our damage is based on mana, and resists affect both our short term and our long term damage (a resist, unlike a miss, is not something you can recover in the long term because it has a cost, the mana you used is already spent and did nothing but increase your aggro). When the resist change went in, this was basically handled under the new system by giving some of our spells a resist modifier, but not all. Magic spells, for example, do not share the resist modifier that fire and cold spells get. Also, as you level and go further into the high end of an expansion, the resists also tend to get worse. It would be nice to Look into whether or not the resist modifiers on the current spells are where they should be and seeing if the penalty for being resisted is perhaps too high as well. Magic based spells should get the resist adjustment the other spells have as well.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;6) Low/Mid Level Wizard Damage - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed, This will most likely be considered as part of the class Re-Envision process.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;While melee have every expansion gained numerous new weapons available at the lower levels that are markedly better in dealing out damage, casters have essentially remained static, casting the same spells they have always cast since the beginning. Slightly larger mana pools and minimally better mana regen hasn't really helped this too much. This has led to a situation where they are outdamaged in both the long and short term by melee, especially Wizards because there is no pet damage to fall back on (which can be helped with newer 'trash' weapons or pet only weapons in much the same way as melee). Suggestion would be to perhaps revisit the spell lines of lower and midrange casters to give some updated spells, perhaps available off harder encounters of those levels to alleviate the situation.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;7) AA Issues&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;- Frenzied Devastation -While the last change upped the efficiency of the ability, it still seems like it loses efficiency on average at the base level. If you add in the fact that focus items aren't even considered in the equation, this ability definitely loses comparative efficiency, the better your focus items, the worse off you are. It would actually be nice if this actually gained slightly in efficiency as you got more levels simply because it currently on par with similar melee abilities to gain DPS which don't seem to have the same problems. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- Ward of Destruction - The damage done by the spell even at the max level is extremely low and the static nature of it also makes the damage output even less reliable.&amp;nbsp; &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being evaluated.&amp;nbsp; Rashere is currently looking into ways to make this AA more useful. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;- Familiars - Should be more of a reason to use the GoD familiars, currently they are only used on short fights where you don't have a Bard because of the lack of mana regen and resists as well as the fact they are only dedicated to one resist type. It would also be nice if the other AA familiars were changed to the same 1 minute recast and instant cast as these. - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- Strong Root – Shorten recast timer and make it so Greater Fetter doesn’t overwrite it. - &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;8) Mana Pool Buffs - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;The Mana cap is being removed with the Class Re-Envision process&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;There is currently a cap on mana received via buffs at 750. At the moment, this cap mainly affects Wizards because of the additional mana provided by familiars. In OoW it will likely apply to other classes as well because of the new Clairvoyance spell adding 400 mana. Is there any real reason for this to be capped?&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;9) Rain spells - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed, The inherent resist rate from rain spells is being removed as part of the Class Re-Envision Process&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The primary problem here is resists and mezzes. You can't use a rain spell in a group because you will break mezzes. You can't root a mob and cast a rain spell because it will break the root. Rain spell also seem to have a built in 20% resist rate which seems rather excessive.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;10) Teleporting issues - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Add an AA that prevents leaving group mates behind for Teleport and Evacuate spells&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;The base time and mana cost on some port spells seems rather excessive (Knowledge Portal as a level 39 spell for 600 mana and 24 seconds being one of these, porting to Hate, a higher level spell, is only 300 mana and 10 seconds). &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Some method of removing the requirement for fragments being used for translocates. Removing the reagant requirements from Hate/Sky with the same method would also be appreciated. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;More useful locations that aren't 1 zone or less away from PoK. &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Community suggestions on new port locations - &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Riftseekers&lt;BR&gt;Western Wastes&lt;BR&gt;Plane of Traquility&lt;BR&gt;Chardok – Near Chardock B&lt;BR&gt;Dragon Necropolis&lt;BR&gt;Dranik’s Scar&lt;BR&gt;Timorous Deep&lt;BR&gt;Crypt of Nadox&lt;BR&gt;Lake Rathe - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;With the announcement of a portal to the Arean being added to the Plane of Knowledge we may want to remove this location.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Umbral Plains – Near the Maiden’s Eye zone line&lt;BR&gt;Ocean of Tears &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Decession - Make Decession a bit more 'raid' friendly by either allowing it to work on anyone in a raid or giving a short timer TL box when cast on someone outside of your group (it needs to retain the no box ability inside your group in either case). &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Create Gate, Portal, and Translocate spells for all of the evacuation locations.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P class=MsoNormal align=left **Zowie**?MARGIN: 0in mso-list: level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in? 0pt TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in; l0 0.5in;&gt;&lt;SPAN Verdana? Verdana; **Zowie**?FONT-FAMILY: mso-bidi-font-family: mso-fareast-font-family:&gt;&lt;SPAN **Zowie**?mso-list: Ignore?&gt;1)&lt;SPAN ?Times New Roman?? **Zowie**?FONT: 7pt&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN Verdana? **Zowie**?FONT-FAMILY:&gt;Manaburn - A wizard can currently spend their entire mana bar to do a little over 9k damage in 5 seconds - leaving the wizard completely helpless and out of mana afterwards. At the same time Ancient Strike of Chaos - our best fire-based nuke can crit for over 8k using less than 1 bubble of mana and taking 1 more second to cost. The damage cap on manaburn should be removed (with the exception of PvP), and it should be returned to its pre-nerf state.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;SPAN **Zowie**?COLOR: red?&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being evaluated.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal align=left **Zowie**?MARGIN: 0in mso-list: level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in? 0pt TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in; l0 0.5in;&gt;&lt;SPAN Verdana? **Zowie**?FONT-FAMILY:&gt;&lt;SPAN **Zowie**?COLOR: red?&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;2) Pillar Spells - Wizards grew up quad-kiting for a living. It is an insult to the class and the game that we are forced to fight level 70 monsters in Plane of Fire with a level 51 spell (Pillar of Frost). This line of spells - which is quite possibly the most used by wizards - has not had a meaningful update since KUNARK. New pillar spells should do in the 1500-1800 damage range (which is a lower ratio in terms of pillar versus nuke than the kunark pillars were compared to sunstrike). Mana cost should be higher to compensate for increased dmg output, however it is crucial that cast time remain low as this is a KITING spell and if it can't be cast in under 4 seconds, it is of no use.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal align=left **Zowie**?MARGIN: 0in mso-list: level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in? 0pt TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in; l0 0.5in;&gt;&lt;SPAN Verdana? **Zowie**?FONT-FAMILY:&gt;&lt;SPAN Verdana? **Zowie**?FONT-FAMILY:&gt;&lt;SPAN Verdana? **Zowie**?FONT-FAMILY:&gt;&lt;SPAN **Zowie**?COLOR: red?&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN **Zowie**?COLOR: red?&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

Currently wizards are the only class which gets hurt by the limit. Second: Raise the worn mana regen (FT) cap from 15 to 25 to represent the better equipment available in PoP and GoD. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal align=left **Zowie**?MARGIN: 0in mso-list: level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in? 0pt TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in; l0 0.5in;&gt;&lt;SPAN Verdana? **Zowie**?FONT-FAMILY:&gt;&lt;SPAN **Zowie**?COLOR: red?&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN **Zowie**?COLOR: red?&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

Mana is a wizard's life force. Warriors have had their hit points in numbers forever. The fact that wizards are forced to rely on a 3rd party (magelo) to get an accurate concept of their mana pool is - again - insulting to the class.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;SPAN **Zowie**?COLOR: red?&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;This is done; the UI is currently on test server.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;SPAN Verdana? **Zowie**?FONT-FAMILY:&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal **Zowie**?MARGIN: 0in 0pt 0.25in?&gt;5) Better agro management - It seems to be a common misconception at Sony that wizard's damage output is controlled by mana and the damage a spell does...this is wrong. Our main barrier to damage in a raid situation is agro. 90% of the wizard population meanwhile is forced to use concussion - a spell from the Kunark era. With Concussion on elemental legs, no spell form will ever be desired by high-end raiding wizards again. Even if an updated concussion were released that cleared 4 times the amount of agro, most wizards would opt for the clickable pants as being able to click instead of cast increases over all damage per second by 28% (see previous post). You should either (a) create some new spells which can help with agro.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;An AA which instantly drops the wizard to the bottom of the agro list with a refresh rate of 90 minutes would be a perfect fit for such a situation. Too long a refresh to not make trivial agro control, but useful enough so that if you cast 1 too many times in a raid encounter you won't be dead 2 seconds later. In addition, what happened to the Spell Casting Subtlety line? This was by far the most useful AA wizards have ever received. Consider putting an Advanced SCS in OoW.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;SPAN **Zowie**?COLOR: red?&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: Verdana? red; **Zowie**?COLOR:&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT face="Century Gothic" color=#ff0000&gt;This is currently being discussed for implementation in a future expansion.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;6) Concussion - Pretty much covers what was stated before. An improved concussion for wizards would be nice, but the best way to handle the poor state of agro control for wizards is through AA's not new spells in my opinion.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;SPAN **Zowie**?COLOR: red?&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;7) Lures - I often wonder if the "lures" we received in PoP were supposed to be a joke. In Kunark, Sunstrike did 1615 damage and Lure of Ice did 825 damage - about 2:1. Now wizards are using nukes that do 3000 damage, yet the best lure we have is Lure of Ro - 1070 damage. To keep lures in line with our major nuking spells they should do 1500 damage.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN **Zowie**?COLOR: red?&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;8) Rain spells - The primary problem here is resists and mezzes. You can't use a rain spell in a group because you will break mezzes. You can't root a mob and cast a rain spell because it will break the root. I'd refer you to the &lt;A href="http://www.graffe.com/forums/showthread.php?t=17412&amp;amp;highlight=rain" target=_blank&gt;&lt;SPAN class=Hyperlink1&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffff00&gt;Discussion Thread&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffff00&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;on Graffe's for more information.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN **Zowie**?COLOR: red?&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;9) GoD Familiars - I couldn't wait when I heard we were getting new familiars in GoD. This changed when I found out we would be spending 45 AAs for 3 familiars that were all WORSE than the one we previously bought in PoP. Issues: The damage focus does not stack with bard song - it should or else there is no point for the familiar any time there is a bard on a raid or in a group. There is no mana regen on familiars - This was the number one perk from using allegiant familiar. There are no resists on the GoD familiars. At the least it should have resists for its resist. Allegiant Familiar had +30 to all resists. Ro's Familiar should be +75 Fire resist and +0 the others. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;SPAN **Zowie**?COLOR: red?&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;10) Mana robe effects - Nobody is saying bring back the manastone. It is clear that doing so would bring serious class balance issues into question - namely the infinite stream of mana as long as you have a healer nearby. However, given that the mana regen caps have not be raised in aeons, the ability to convert hit points to mana is crucial for any wizard who wants to maintain a sustained level of damage output. Consider putting in an AA or long recast (like harvest) spell which converts 800 hitpoints into 400 mana. Additionally consider adding new items to the game that have similar effects of the mana robe.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;Wizard&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;1) &lt;STRONG&gt;Short to Medium term damage -&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Some changes with direct damage spells went live with the April 20th update.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Wizards are currently falling further and further behind in these areas, areas that they should actually excel given the major limitations on their damage potential. In reality, any class that isn't mana based should not even come close, and yet, many do, often exceeding the class by more than a minor amount. This is just exacerbated by the current trend of making fights last longer again, which actually only hurts classes that have built in limits on their damage, Wizards being the one that is probably the most affected by it. And this is without even taking into account mob abilities that affect casters to an even greater extent (high resists, mana drains, and even total immunities to spell damage).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2) Long term damage&lt;/STRONG&gt; -&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Currently being discussed, This will most likely be considered as part of the class Re-Envision process.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;While Wizards tend to be be more focused on short term damage, they do suffer a lot when it comes to long term damage in groups because their damage is all mana based. This tends to mean that classes that come very close to or even exceed them in short term damage just destroy them when it comes to long term damage because they have no such limitations. Some ideas may be help with mana regen in places where this is a problem, or an extended line of spells that address this problem (lower dps, but higher efficiency).&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;3) Manaburn - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Changes to manaburn are in the works, these changes are nearly finalized design wise however we will need to wait on coding for full implementation.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;A Wizard can currently spend their entire mana bar to do a little over 9k damage in 5 seconds - leaving the wizard completely helpless and out of mana afterwards. At the same time Ancient Strike of Chaos - our best fire-based nuke can crit for over 8k using less than 1 bubble of mana and taking 1 more second to cost. The damage cap on manaburn should be removed (with the exception of PvP), and it should be returned to its pre-nerf state.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;4) Aggro problems - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Changes to the way aggro is gained through spells is being considered with part #1 of the Class Re-Envision Process.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As spell damage goes up, aggro also increases. And so does mob damage output. So the penalty for gaining aggro for any reason can often be almost instant death. Currently Maelin's legs are the only real method used for aggro control at the high end, and they put Wizards roughly where they should be in terms of overall damage, while allowing some capability to maybe escape death when the MT goes down. But as spell damage goes up, they will become more of a limiter on how much dps rises because aggro is still going to be the main limitation, which would essentially leave Wizards in the same spot (concussion is a fixed amount, it doesn't scale in the manner that Evade can if you get too high on the list and there is no version of Wizard 'Escape'). Going back to spell based Concussion doesn't really solve the overall problem, it just increases the chance that Wizards will die when the MT does while likely lowering overall dps.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;5) Resists - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Wizards were supposed to be able to have an innately better chance of landing spells than any other class because all of our damage is based on mana, and resists affect both our short term and our long term damage (a resist, unlike a miss, is not something you can recover in the long term because it has a cost, the mana you used is already spent and did nothing but increase your aggro). When the resist change went in, this was basically handled under the new system by giving some of our spells a resist modifier, but not all. Magic spells, for example, do not share the resist modifier that fire and cold spells get. Also, as you level and go further into the high end of an expansion, the resists also tend to get worse. It would be nice to Look into whether or not the resist modifiers on the current spells are where they should be and seeing if the penalty for being resisted is perhaps too high as well. Magic based spells should get the resist adjustment the other spells have as well.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;6) Low/Mid Level Wizard Damage - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed, This will most likely be considered as part of the class Re-Envision process.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;While melee have every expansion gained numerous new weapons available at the lower levels that are markedly better in dealing out damage, casters have essentially remained static, casting the same spells they have always cast since the beginning. Slightly larger mana pools and minimally better mana regen hasn't really helped this too much. This has led to a situation where they are outdamaged in both the long and short term by melee, especially Wizards because there is no pet damage to fall back on (which can be helped with newer 'trash' weapons or pet only weapons in much the same way as melee). Suggestion would be to perhaps revisit the spell lines of lower and midrange casters to give some updated spells, perhaps available off harder encounters of those levels to alleviate the situation.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;7) AA Issues -&lt;FONT color=#0066ff&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;currently being evaluated&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;- Frenzied Devastation -While the last change upped the efficiency of the ability, it still seems like it loses efficiency on average at the base level. If you add in the fact that focus items aren't even considered in the equation, this ability definitely loses comparative efficiency, the better your focus items, the worse off you are. It would actually be nice if this actually gained slightly in efficiency as you got more levels simply because it currently on par with similar melee abilities to gain DPS which don't seem to have the same problems. Currently being discussed&lt;BR&gt;- Ward of Destruction - The damage done by the spell even at the max level is extremely low and the static nature of it also makes the damage output even less reliable.&amp;nbsp; Currently being evaluated.&amp;nbsp; Rashere is currently looking into ways to make this AA more useful.&lt;BR&gt;- Strong Root – Shorten recast timer and make it so Greater Fetter doesn’t overwrite it. Also consider making the root fixed duration given how short it can last now&lt;STRONG&gt;.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;8) Stuns -&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;No development feedback at this time&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Stuns currently seems to be less than they should be, at least compared to how they used to work. One of the current problems is that they cap to low to be as useful as they could be, and a side effect of the cap is that it leaves a gap in being able to use stuns while you are leveling up at some points. Would be nice to see the level cap raised so that you can at least attempt to stun yellow mobs when you are at the max level. Raising the current cap on the higher level stuns by 2-3 levels would make them more useful in groups as well as fix the gap problem.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;9) Concussion being affected by Spell Casting Subtely &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;There is a fix in the works, however the fix requires coding changes.&amp;nbsp; Unfortunately at this time there are other coding issues that have higher priority.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; &#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Currently Concussion is being affected by SCS, lowering its effectiveness by 20% if you have SCS 3. Given that aggro is one of the limiters on a&amp;nbsp;Wizardability to do damage (not to mention&amp;nbsp;the thing that determines whether&amp;nbsp;you are going to live or not in a lot of situations)&amp;nbsp;and that&amp;nbsp;Concussion is one of the extremely few tools Wizards get to manage it, this is something that needs to be fixed&lt;STRONG&gt;.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;10) Teleporting issues - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; &#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Add an AA that prevents leaving group mates behind for Teleport and Evacuate spells &lt;BR&gt;The base time and mana cost on some port spells seems rather excessive (Knowledge Portal as a level 39 spell for 600 mana and 24 seconds being one of these, porting to Hate, a higher level spell, is only 300 mana and 10 seconds).&lt;BR&gt;Remove the recast time on port spells. Needing to wait 10 seconds after memming a port spell in order to cast it seems to serve no actual purpose other than to annoy.&lt;BR&gt;Some method of removing the requirement for fragments being used for translocates. Removing the reagant requirements from Hate/Sky with the same method would also be appreciated. &lt;BR&gt;More useful locations that aren't 1 zone or less away from PoK. Community suggestions on new port locations - &lt;BR&gt;Riftseekers&lt;BR&gt;Western Wastes&lt;BR&gt;Plane of Traquility&lt;BR&gt;Chardok – Near Chardok B&lt;BR&gt;Dragon Necropolis&lt;BR&gt;Dranik’s Scar&lt;BR&gt;Timorous Deep&lt;BR&gt;Crypt of Nadox&lt;BR&gt;Umbral Plains – Near the Maiden’s Eye zone line&lt;BR&gt;Ocean of Tears&lt;BR&gt;The Hive&lt;BR&gt;Dreadspire Keep&lt;BR&gt;Decession - Make Decession a bit more 'raid' friendly by either allowing it to work on anyone in a raid or giving a short timer TL box when cast on someone outside of your group (it needs to retain the no box ability inside your group in either case). &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2) Long term damage&lt;/STRONG&gt; -&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Currently being discussed, This will most likely be considered as part of the class Re-Envision process.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;While Wizards tend to be be more focused on short term damage, they do suffer a lot when it comes to long term damage in groups because their damage is all mana based. This tends to mean that classes that come very close to or even exceed them in short term damage just destroy them when it comes to long term damage because they have no such limitations. Some ideas may be help with mana regen in places where this is a problem, or an extended line of spells that address this problem (lower dps, but higher efficiency).&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;3) Manaburn - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Changes to manaburn are in the works, these changes are nearly finalized design wise however we will need to wait on coding for full implementation.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;A Wizard can currently spend their entire mana bar to do a little over 9k damage in 5 seconds - leaving the wizard completely helpless and out of mana afterwards. At the same time Ancient Strike of Chaos - our best fire-based nuke can crit for over 8k using less than 1 bubble of mana and taking 1 more second to cost. The damage cap on manaburn should be removed (with the exception of PvP), and it should be returned to its pre-nerf state.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;4) Aggro problems - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Changes to the way aggro is gained through spells is being considered with part #1 of the Class Re-Envision Process.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As spell damage goes up, aggro also increases. And so does mob damage output. So the penalty for gaining aggro for any reason can often be almost instant death. Currently Maelin's legs are the only real method used for aggro control at the high end, and they put Wizards roughly where they should be in terms of overall damage, while allowing some capability to maybe escape death when the MT goes down. But as spell damage goes up, they will become more of a limiter on how much dps rises because aggro is still going to be the main limitation, which would essentially leave Wizards in the same spot (concussion is a fixed amount, it doesn't scale in the manner that Evade can if you get too high on the list and there is no version of Wizard 'Escape'). Going back to spell based Concussion doesn't really solve the overall problem, it just increases the chance that Wizards will die when the MT does while likely lowering overall dps.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;5) Resists - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Wizards were supposed to be able to have an innately better chance of landing spells than any other class because all of our damage is based on mana, and resists affect both our short term and our long term damage (a resist, unlike a miss, is not something you can recover in the long term because it has a cost, the mana you used is already spent and did nothing but increase your aggro). When the resist change went in, this was basically handled under the new system by giving some of our spells a resist modifier, but not all. Magic spells, for example, do not share the resist modifier that fire and cold spells get. Also, as you level and go further into the high end of an expansion, the resists also tend to get worse. It would be nice to Look into whether or not the resist modifiers on the current spells are where they should be and seeing if the penalty for being resisted is perhaps too high as well. Magic based spells should get the resist adjustment the other spells have as well.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;6) Low/Mid Level Wizard Damage - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed, This will most likely be considered as part of the class Re-Envision process.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;While melee have every expansion gained numerous new weapons available at the lower levels that are markedly better in dealing out damage, casters have essentially remained static, casting the same spells they have always cast since the beginning. Slightly larger mana pools and minimally better mana regen hasn't really helped this too much. This has led to a situation where they are outdamaged in both the long and short term by melee, especially Wizards because there is no pet damage to fall back on (which can be helped with newer 'trash' weapons or pet only weapons in much the same way as melee). Suggestion would be to perhaps revisit the spell lines of lower and midrange casters to give some updated spells, perhaps available off harder encounters of those levels to alleviate the situation.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;7) AA Issues&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;- Frenzied Devastation -While the last change upped the efficiency of the ability, it still seems like it loses efficiency on average at the base level. If you add in the fact that focus items aren't even considered in the equation, this ability definitely loses comparative efficiency, the better your focus items, the worse off you are. It would actually be nice if this actually gained slightly in efficiency as you got more levels simply because it currently on par with similar melee abilities to gain DPS which don't seem to have the same problems. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- Ward of Destruction - The damage done by the spell even at the max level is extremely low and the static nature of it also makes the damage output even less reliable.&amp;nbsp; &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being evaluated.&amp;nbsp; Rashere is currently looking into ways to make this AA more useful. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;- Familiars - Should be more of a reason to use the GoD familiars, currently they are only used on short fights where you don't have a Bard because of the lack of mana regen and resists as well as the fact they are only dedicated to one resist type. It would also be nice if the other AA familiars were changed to the same 1 minute recast and instant cast as these. - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- Strong Root – Shorten recast timer and make it so Greater Fetter doesn’t overwrite it. - &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;8) Stuns -&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;No development feedback at this time&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Stuns currently seems to be less than they should be, at least compared to how they used to work. One of the current problems is that they cap to low to be as useful as they could be, and a side effect of the cap is that it leaves a gap in being able to use stuns while you are leveling up at some points. Would be nice to see the level cap raised so that you can at least attempt to stun yellow mobs when you are at the max level. Raising the current cap on the higher level stuns by 2-3 levels would make them more useful in groups as well as fix the gap problem.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;9) Concussion being affected by Spell Casting Subtely &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;There is a fix in the works, however the fix requires coding changes.&amp;nbsp; Unfortunately at this time there are other coding issues that have higher priority.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; &#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Currently Concussion is being affected by SCS, lowering its effectiveness by 20% if you have SCS 3. Given that aggro is one of the limiters on a&amp;nbsp;Wizardability to do damage (not to mention&amp;nbsp;the thing that determines whether&amp;nbsp;you are going to live or not in a lot of situations)&amp;nbsp;and that&amp;nbsp;Concussion is one of the extremely few tools Wizards get to manage it, this is something that needs to be fixed&lt;STRONG&gt;.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;10) Teleporting issues - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Add an AA that prevents leaving group mates behind for Teleport and Evacuate spells&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;The base time and mana cost on some port spells seems rather excessive (Knowledge Portal as a level 39 spell for 600 mana and 24 seconds being one of these, porting to Hate, a higher level spell, is only 300 mana and 10 seconds). &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Some method of removing the requirement for fragments being used for translocates. Removing the reagant requirements from Hate/Sky with the same method would also be appreciated. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;More useful locations that aren't 1 zone or less away from PoK. &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Community suggestions on new port locations - &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Riftseekers&lt;BR&gt;Western Wastes&lt;BR&gt;Plane of Traquility&lt;BR&gt;Chardok – Near Chardock B&lt;BR&gt;Dragon Necropolis&lt;BR&gt;Dranik’s Scar&lt;BR&gt;Timorous Deep&lt;BR&gt;Crypt of Nadox&lt;BR&gt;Lake Rathe - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;With the announcement of a portal to the Arean being added to the Plane of Knowledge we may want to remove this location.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Umbral Plains – Near the Maiden’s Eye zone line&lt;BR&gt;Ocean of Tears &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Decession - Make Decession a bit more 'raid' friendly by either allowing it to work on anyone in a raid or giving a short timer TL box when cast on someone outside of your group (it needs to retain the no box ability inside your group in either case). &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff00ff&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Wizard&lt;/STRONG&gt; - &lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;List Update scheduled for&amp;nbsp;08/05/05&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;1) &lt;STRONG&gt;Short to Medium term damage -&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Some changes with direct damage spells went live with the April 20th update.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Wizards are currently falling further and further behind in these areas, areas that they should actually excel given the major limitations on their damage potential. In reality, any class that isn't mana based should not even come close, and yet, many do, often exceeding the class by more than a minor amount. This is just exacerbated by the current trend of making fights last longer again, which actually only hurts classes that have built in limits on their damage, Wizards being the one that is probably the most affected by it. And this is without even taking into account mob abilities that affect casters to an even greater extent (high resists, mana drains, and even total immunities to spell damage).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

Magic spells, for example, do not share the resist modifier that fire and cold spells get. Also, as you level and go further into the high end of an expansion, the resists also tend to get worse. It would be nice to Look into whether or not the resist modifiers on the current spells are where they should be and seeing if the penalty for being resisted is perhaps too high as well. Magic based spells should get the resist adjustment the other spells have as well.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;6) Low/Mid Level Wizard Damage - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed, This will most likely be considered as part of the class Re-Envision process.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;While melee have every expansion gained numerous new weapons available at the lower levels that are markedly better in dealing out damage, casters have essentially remained static, casting the same spells they have always cast since the beginning. Slightly larger mana pools and minimally better mana regen hasn't really helped this too much. This has led to a situation where they are outdamaged in both the long and short term by melee, especially Wizards because there is no pet damage to fall back on (which can be helped with newer 'trash' weapons or pet only weapons in much the same way as melee). Suggestion would be to perhaps revisit the spell lines of lower and midrange casters to give some updated spells, perhaps available off harder encounters of those levels to alleviate the situation.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;7) AA Issues&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;- Frenzied Devastation -While the last change upped the efficiency of the ability, it still seems like it loses efficiency on average at the base level. If you add in the fact that focus items aren't even considered in the equation, this ability definitely loses comparative efficiency, the better your focus items, the worse off you are. It would actually be nice if this actually gained slightly in efficiency as you got more levels simply because it currently on par with similar melee abilities to gain DPS which don't seem to have the same problems. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- Ward of Destruction - The damage done by the spell even at the max level is extremely low and the static nature of it also makes the damage output even less reliable.&amp;nbsp; &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being evaluated.&amp;nbsp; Rashere is currently looking into ways to make this AA more useful. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;- Familiars - Should be more of a reason to use the GoD familiars, currently they are only used on short fights where you don't have a Bard because of the lack of mana regen and resists as well as the fact they are only dedicated to one resist type. It would also be nice if the other AA familiars were changed to the same 1 minute recast and instant cast as these. - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- Strong Root – Shorten recast timer and make it so Greater Fetter doesn’t overwrite it. - &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;8) Stuns -&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;NEW&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Stuns currently seems to be less than they should be, at least compared to how they used to work. One of the current problems is that they cap to low to be as useful as they could be, and a side effect of the cap is that it leaves a gap in being able to use stuns while you are leveling up at some points. Would be nice to see the level cap raised so that you can at least attempt to stun yellow mobs when you are at the max level. Raising the current cap on the higher level stuns by 2-3 levels would make them more useful in groups as well as fix the gap problem.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;9) Rain spells - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed, The inherent resist rate from rain spells is being removed as part of the Class Re-Envision Process&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The primary problem here is resists and mezzes. You can't use a rain spell in a group because you will break mezzes. You can't root a mob and cast a rain spell because it will break the root. Rain spell also seem to have a built in 20% resist rate which seems rather excessive.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;10) Teleporting issues - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Add an AA that prevents leaving group mates behind for Teleport and Evacuate spells&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;The base time and mana cost on some port spells seems rather excessive (Knowledge Portal as a level 39 spell for 600 mana and 24 seconds being one of these, porting to Hate, a higher level spell, is only 300 mana and 10 seconds). &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Some method of removing the requirement for fragments being used for translocates. Removing the reagant requirements from Hate/Sky with the same method would also be appreciated. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;More useful locations that aren't 1 zone or less away from PoK. &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Community suggestions on new port locations - &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Riftseekers&lt;BR&gt;Western Wastes&lt;BR&gt;Plane of Traquility&lt;BR&gt;Chardok – Near Chardock B&lt;BR&gt;Dragon Necropolis&lt;BR&gt;Dranik’s Scar&lt;BR&gt;Timorous Deep&lt;BR&gt;Crypt of Nadox&lt;BR&gt;Lake Rathe - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;With the announcement of a portal to the Arean being added to the Plane of Knowledge we may want to remove this location.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Umbral Plains – Near the Maiden’s Eye zone line&lt;BR&gt;Ocean of Tears &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Decession - Make Decession a bit more 'raid' friendly by either allowing it to work on anyone in a raid or giving a short timer TL box when cast on someone outside of your group (it needs to retain the no box ability inside your group in either case). &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff00ff&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Wizard&lt;/STRONG&gt; - &lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;List Update scheduled for&amp;nbsp;06/03/05&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;1) &lt;STRONG&gt;Short to Medium term damage -&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Some changes with direct damage spells went live with the April 20th update&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Wizards are currently falling further and further behind in these areas, areas that they should actually excel given the major limitations on their damage potential. In reality, any class that isn't mana based should not even come close, and yet, many do, often exceeding the class by more than a minor amount. This is just exacerbated by the current trend of making fights last longer again, which actually only hurts classes that have built in limits on their damage, Wizards being the one that is probably the most affected by it. And this is without even taking into account mob abilities that affect casters to an even greater extent (high resists, mana drains, and even total immunities to spell damage).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2) Long term damage&lt;/STRONG&gt; -&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Currently being discussed, This will most likely be considered as part of the class Re-Envision process.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;While Wizards tend to be be more focused on short term damage, they do suffer a lot when it comes to long term damage in groups because their damage is all mana based. This tends to mean that classes that come very close to or even exceed them in short term damage just destroy them when it comes to long term damage because they have no such limitations. Some ideas may be help with mana regen in places where this is a problem, or an extended line of spells that address this problem (lower dps, but higher efficiency).&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;3) Manaburn - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Changes to manaburn will come with part #1 of the Class Re-Envision process.&amp;nbsp; Rashere and Gordish need your feedback please &lt;A href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=wizardbalance&amp;amp;message.id=3120" target=_blank&gt;&lt;FONT color=#cccccc&gt;post here.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;A Wizard can currently spend their entire mana bar to do a little over 9k damage in 5 seconds - leaving the wizard completely helpless and out of mana afterwards. At the same time Ancient Strike of Chaos - our best fire-based nuke can crit for over 8k using less than 1 bubble of mana and taking 1 more second to cost. The damage cap on manaburn should be removed (with the exception of PvP), and it should be returned to its pre-nerf state.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;4) Aggro problems - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Changes to the way aggro is gained through spells is being considered with part #1 of the Class Re-Envision Process.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As spell damage goes up, aggro also increases. And so does mob damage output. So the penalty for gaining aggro for any reason can often be almost instant death. Currently Maelin's legs are the only real method used for aggro control at the high end, and they put Wizards roughly where they should be in terms of overall damage, while allowing some capability to maybe escape death when the MT goes down. But as spell damage goes up, they will become more of a limiter on how much dps rises because aggro is still going to be the main limitation, which would essentially leave Wizards in the same spot (concussion is a fixed amount, it doesn't scale in the manner that Evade can if you get too high on the list and there is no version of Wizard 'Escape'). Going back to spell based Concussion doesn't really solve the overall problem, it just increases the chance that Wizards will die when the MT does while likely lowering overall dps.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;5) Resists - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

It would also be nice if the other AA familiars were changed to the same 1 minute recast and instant cast as these. - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- Strong Root – Shorten recast timer and make it so Greater Fetter doesn’t overwrite it. - &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;8) Stuns -&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;NEW&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Stuns currently seems to be less than they should be, at least compared to how they used to work. One of the current problems is that they cap to low to be as useful as they could be, and a side effect of the cap is that it leaves a gap in being able to use stuns while you are leveling up at some points. Would be nice to see the level cap raised so that you can at least attempt to stun yellow mobs when you are at the max level. Raising the current cap on the higher level stuns by 2-3 levels would make them more useful in groups as well as fix the gap problem.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;9) Rain spells - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed, The inherent resist rate from rain spells is being removed as part of the Class Re-Envision Process&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The primary problem here is resists and mezzes. You can't use a rain spell in a group because you will break mezzes. You can't root a mob and cast a rain spell because it will break the root. Rain spell also seem to have a built in 20% resist rate which seems rather excessive.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;10) Teleporting issues - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Add an AA that prevents leaving group mates behind for Teleport and Evacuate spells&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;The base time and mana cost on some port spells seems rather excessive (Knowledge Portal as a level 39 spell for 600 mana and 24 seconds being one of these, porting to Hate, a higher level spell, is only 300 mana and 10 seconds). &lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Some method of removing the requirement for fragments being used for translocates. Removing the reagant requirements from Hate/Sky with the same method would also be appreciated. &lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;More useful locations that aren't 1 zone or less away from PoK. &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Community suggestions on new port locations - &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Riftseekers&lt;BR&gt;Western Wastes&lt;BR&gt;Plane of Traquility&lt;BR&gt;Chardok – Near Chardock B&lt;BR&gt;Dragon Necropolis&lt;BR&gt;Dranik’s Scar&lt;BR&gt;Timorous Deep&lt;BR&gt;Crypt of Nadox&lt;BR&gt;Lake Rathe - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;With the announcement of a portal to the Arean being added to the Plane of Knowledge we may want to remove this location.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Umbral Plains – Near the Maiden’s Eye zone line&lt;BR&gt;Ocean of Tears&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Decession - Make Decession a bit more 'raid' friendly by either allowing it to work on anyone in a raid or giving a short timer TL box when cast on someone outside of your group (it needs to retain the no box ability inside your group in either case). &lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff00ff&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Wizard&lt;/STRONG&gt; - &lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;List Update scheduled for&amp;nbsp;04/01/05&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;1) &lt;STRONG&gt;Short to Medium term damage -&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;This will most likely be considered as part of the class Re-Envision process.&amp;nbsp; Some changes have been made to your damage dealing spells on Test Server.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Wizards are currently falling further and further behind in these areas, areas that they should actually excel given the major limitations on their damage potential. In reality, any class that isn't mana based should not even come close, and yet, many do, often exceeding the class by more than a minor amount. This is just exacerbated by the current trend of making fights last longer again, which actually only hurts classes that have built in limits on their damage, Wizards being the one that is probably the most affected by it. And this is without even taking into account mob abilities that affect casters to an even greater extent (high resists, mana drains, and even total immunities to spell damage).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2) Long term damage&lt;/STRONG&gt; -&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Currently being discussed, This will most likely be considered as part of the class Re-Envision process.&amp;nbsp; Some changes have been made to your damage dealing spells on Test Server.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;While Wizards tend to be be more focused on short term damage, they do suffer a lot when it comes to long term damage in groups because their damage is all mana based. This tends to mean that classes that come very close to or even exceed them in short term damage just destroy them when it comes to long term damage because they have no such limitations. Some ideas may be help with mana regen in places where this is a problem, or an extended line of spells that address this problem (lower dps, but higher efficiency).&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;3) Manaburn - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Changes to manaburn will come with part #1 of the Class Re-Envision process.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;A Wizard can currently spend their entire mana bar to do a little over 9k damage in 5 seconds - leaving the wizard completely helpless and out of mana afterwards. At the same time Ancient Strike of Chaos - our best fire-based nuke can crit for over 8k using less than 1 bubble of mana and taking 1 more second to cost. The damage cap on manaburn should be removed (with the exception of PvP), and it should be returned to its pre-nerf state.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;4) Aggro problems - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Changes to the way aggro is gained through spells is being considered with part #1 of the Class Re-Envision Process.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As spell damage goes up, aggro also increases. And so does mob damage output. So the penalty for gaining aggro for any reason can often be almost instant death. Currently Maelin's legs are the only real method used for aggro control at the high end, and they put Wizards roughly where they should be in terms of overall damage, while allowing some capability to maybe escape death when the MT goes down. But as spell damage goes up, they will become more of a limiter on how much dps rises because aggro is still going to be the main limitation, which would essentially leave Wizards in the same spot (concussion is a fixed amount, it doesn't scale in the manner that Evade can if you get too high on the list and there is no version of Wizard 'Escape'). Going back to spell based Concussion doesn't really solve the overall problem, it just increases the chance that Wizards will die when the MT does while likely lowering overall dps.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;5) Resists - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Wizards were supposed to be able to have an innately better chance of landing spells than any other class because all of our damage is based on mana, and resists affect both our short term and our long term damage (a resist, unlike a miss, is not something you can recover in the long term because it has a cost, the mana you used is already spent and did nothing but increase your aggro). When the resist change went in, this was basically handled under the new system by giving some of our spells a resist modifier, but not all. Magic spells, for example, do not share the resist modifier that fire and cold spells get. Also, as you level and go further into the high end of an expansion, the resists also tend to get worse. It would be nice to Look into whether or not the resist modifiers on the current spells are where they should be and seeing if the penalty for being resisted is perhaps too high as well. Magic based spells should get the resist adjustment the other spells have as well.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;6) Low/Mid Level Wizard Damage - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed, This will most likely be considered as part of the class Re-Envision process.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;While melee have every expansion gained numerous new weapons available at the lower levels that are markedly better in dealing out damage, casters have essentially remained static, casting the same spells they have always cast since the beginning. Slightly larger mana pools and minimally better mana regen hasn't really helped this too much. This has led to a situation where they are outdamaged in both the long and short term by melee, especially Wizards because there is no pet damage to fall back on (which can be helped with newer 'trash' weapons or pet only weapons in much the same way as melee). Suggestion would be to perhaps revisit the spell lines of lower and midrange casters to give some updated spells, perhaps available off harder encounters of those levels to alleviate the situation.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;7) AA Issues&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;- Frenzied Devastation -While the last change upped the efficiency of the ability, it still seems like it loses efficiency on average at the base level. If you add in the fact that focus items aren't even considered in the equation, this ability definitely loses comparative efficiency, the better your focus items, the worse off you are. It would actually be nice if this actually gained slightly in efficiency as you got more levels simply because it currently on par with similar melee abilities to gain DPS which don't seem to have the same problems. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- Ward of Destruction - The damage done by the spell even at the max level is extremely low and the static nature of it also makes the damage output even less reliable.&amp;nbsp; &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being evaluated.&amp;nbsp; Rashere is currently looking into ways to make this AA more useful. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;- Familiars - Should be more of a reason to use the GoD familiars, currently they are only used on short fights where you don't have a Bard because of the lack of mana regen and resists as well as the fact they are only dedicated to one resist type.

&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;8) Mana Pool Buffs - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;The Mana cap is being removed with the Class Re-Envision process&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;There is currently a cap on mana received via buffs at 750. At the moment, this cap mainly affects Wizards because of the additional mana provided by familiars. In OoW it will likely apply to other classes as well because of the new Clairvoyance spell adding 400 mana. Is there any real reason for this to be capped?&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;9) Rain spells - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed, The inherent resist rate from rain spells is being removed as part of the Class Re-Envision Process&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;The primary problem here is resists and mezzes. You can't use a rain spell in a group because you will break mezzes. You can't root a mob and cast a rain spell because it will break the root. Rain spell also seem to have a built in 20% resist rate which seems rather excessive.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;10) Teleporting issues - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Add an AA that prevents leaving group mates behind for Teleport and Evacuate spells&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;The base time and mana cost on some port spells seems rather excessive (Knowledge Portal as a level 39 spell for 600 mana and 24 seconds being one of these, porting to Hate, a higher level spell, is only 300 mana and 10 seconds). &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Some method of removing the requirement for fragments being used for translocates. Removing the reagant requirements from Hate/Sky with the same method would also be appreciated. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;More useful locations that aren't 1 zone or less away from PoK. &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Community suggestions on new port locations - &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Riftseekers&lt;BR&gt;Western Wastes&lt;BR&gt;Plane of Traquility&lt;BR&gt;Chardok – Near Chardock B&lt;BR&gt;Dragon Necropolis&lt;BR&gt;Dranik’s Scar&lt;BR&gt;Timorous Deep&lt;BR&gt;Crypt of Nadox&lt;BR&gt;Lake Rathe - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;With the announcement of a portal to the Arean being added to the Plane of Knowledge we may want to remove this location.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Umbral Plains – Near the Maiden’s Eye zone line&lt;BR&gt;Ocean of Tears &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Decession - Make Decession a bit more 'raid' friendly by either allowing it to work on anyone in a raid or giving a short timer TL box when cast on someone outside of your group (it needs to retain the no box ability inside your group in either case). &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Create Gate, Portal, and Translocate spells for all of the evacuation locations.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff00ff&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Wizard&lt;/STRONG&gt; - &lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;List Update scheduled for&amp;nbsp;02/07/05&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;1) &lt;STRONG&gt;Short to Medium term damage -&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;This will most likely be considered as part of the class Re-Envision process.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Wizards are currently falling further and further behind in these areas, areas that they should actually excel given the major limitations on their damage potential. In reality, any class that isn't mana based should not even come close, and yet, many do, often exceeding the class by more than a minor amount. This is just exacerbated by the current trend of making fights last longer again, which actually only hurts classes that have built in limits on their damage, Wizards being the one that is probably the most affected by it. And this is without even taking into account mob abilities that affect casters to an even greater extent (high resists, mana drains, and even total immunities to spell damage).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2) Long term damage&lt;/STRONG&gt; -&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Currently being discussed, This will most likely be considered as part of the class Re-Envision process.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;While Wizards tend to be be more focused on short term damage, they do suffer a lot when it comes to long term damage in groups because their damage is all mana based. This tends to mean that classes that come very close to or even exceed them in short term damage just destroy them when it comes to long term damage because they have no such limitations. Some ideas may be help with mana regen in places where this is a problem, or an extended line of spells that address this problem (lower dps, but higher efficiency).&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;3) Manaburn - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being evaluated.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;A Wizard can currently spend their entire mana bar to do a little over 9k damage in 5 seconds - leaving the wizard completely helpless and out of mana afterwards. At the same time Ancient Strike of Chaos - our best fire-based nuke can crit for over 8k using less than 1 bubble of mana and taking 1 more second to cost. The damage cap on manaburn should be removed (with the exception of PvP), and it should be returned to its pre-nerf state.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Dev notes – Ideas continue to floated around on how to fix the issues with Manaburn.&amp;nbsp; Please feel free to make suggestions &lt;A href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Wizards&amp;amp;message.id=559" target=_blank&gt;&lt;FONT color=#f0a911&gt;here&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;4) Aggro problems - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As spell damage goes up, aggro also increases. And so does mob damage output. So the penalty for gaining aggro for any reason can often be almost instant death. Currently Maelin's legs are the only real method used for aggro control at the high end, and they put Wizards roughly where they should be in terms of overall damage, while allowing some capability to maybe escape death when the MT goes down. But as spell damage goes up, they will become more of a limiter on how much dps rises because aggro is still going to be the main limitation, which would essentially leave Wizards in the same spot (concussion is a fixed amount, it doesn't scale in the manner that Evade can if you get too high on the list and there is no version of Wizard 'Escape'). Going back to spell based Concussion doesn't really solve the overall problem, it just increases the chance that Wizards will die when the MT does while likely lowering overall dps.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;5) Resists - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Wizards were supposed to be able to have an innately better chance of landing spells than any other class because all of our damage is based on mana, and resists affect both our short term and our long term damage (a resist, unlike a miss, is not something you can recover in the long term because it has a cost, the mana you used is already spent and did nothing but increase your aggro). When the resist change went in, this was basically handled under the new system by giving some of our spells a resist modifier, but not all. Magic spells, for example, do not share the resist modifier that fire and cold spells get. Also, as you level and go further into the high end of an expansion, the resists also tend to get worse. It would be nice to Look into whether or not the resist modifiers on the current spells are where they should be and seeing if the penalty for being resisted is perhaps too high as well. Magic based spells should get the resist adjustment the other spells have as well.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;6) Low/Mid Level Wizard Damage - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed, This will most likely be considered as part of the class Re-Envision process.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;While melee have every expansion gained numerous new weapons available at the lower levels that are markedly better in dealing out damage, casters have essentially remained static, casting the same spells they have always cast since the beginning. Slightly larger mana pools and minimally better mana regen hasn't really helped this too much. This has led to a situation where they are outdamaged in both the long and short term by melee, especially Wizards because there is no pet damage to fall back on (which can be helped with newer 'trash' weapons or pet only weapons in much the same way as melee). Suggestion would be to perhaps revisit the spell lines of lower and midrange casters to give some updated spells, perhaps available off harder encounters of those levels to alleviate the situation.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;7) AA Issues&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;- Frenzied Devastation -While the last change upped the efficiency of the ability, it still seems like it loses efficiency on average at the base level. If you add in the fact that focus items aren't even considered in the equation, this ability definitely loses comparative efficiency, the better your focus items, the worse off you are. It would actually be nice if this actually gained slightly in efficiency as you got more levels simply because it currently on par with similar melee abilities to gain DPS which don't seem to have the same problems. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Revised item, sending to Rashere&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- Ward of Destruction - The damage done by the spell even at the max level is extremely low and the static nature of it also makes the damage output even less reliable.&amp;nbsp; &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being evaluated.&amp;nbsp; Rashere is currently looking into ways to make this AA more useful. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;- Familiars - Should be more of a reason to use the GoD familiars, currently they are only used on short fights where you don't have a Bard because of the lack of mana regen and resists as well as the fact they are only dedicated to one resist type. It would also be nice if the other AA familiars were changed to the same 1 minute recast and instant cast as these. - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- Strong Root – Shorten recast timer and make it so Greater Fetter doesn’t overwrite it. - &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;8) Mana Pool Buffs - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;There is currently a cap on mana received via buffs at 750. At the moment, this cap mainly affects Wizards because of the additional mana provided by familiars. In OoW it will likely apply to other classes as well because of the new Clairvoyance spell adding 400 mana. Is there any real reason for this to be capped?&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;9) Rain spells - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed, This will most likely be considered as part of the class Re-Envision process.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;This is the last update for the year 2004.&amp;nbsp; The Community team has decided that the updates will now be posted once a month.&amp;nbsp; The updates will now be posted on the first Friday of each month.&amp;nbsp; The next update is scheduled for 01/07/05&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff00ff&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff00ff&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Wizard&lt;/STRONG&gt; - &lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;List Update scheduled for&amp;nbsp;12/17/04&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff00ff size=2&gt;Please note there aren't any new development updates.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff00ff&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: Verdana? **SMURF**?COLOR: #cccccc;&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff00ff&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;1) &lt;STRONG&gt;Manaburn&lt;/STRONG&gt; - A Wizard can currently spend their entire mana bar to do a little over 9k damage in 5 seconds - leaving the wizard completely helpless and out of mana afterwards. At the same time Ancient Strike of Chaos - our best fire-based nuke can crit for over 8k using less than 1 bubble of mana and taking 1 more second to cost. The damage cap on manaburn should be removed (with the exception of PvP), and it should be returned to its pre-nerf state.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being evaluated.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Dev notes – Ideas continue to&amp;nbsp;floated around on how to fix the issues with Manaburn.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;2) &lt;STRONG&gt;Pillar Spells&lt;/STRONG&gt; - Wizards grew up quad-kiting for a living. It is an insult to the class and the game that we are forced to fight level 70 monsters in Plane of Fire with a level 51 spell (Pillar of Frost). This line of spells - which is quite possibly the most used by wizards - has not had a meaningful update since KUNARK. New pillar spells should do in the 1500-1800 damage range (which is a lower ratio in terms of pillar versus nuke than the kunark pillars were compared to sunstrike). Mana cost should be higher to compensate for increased dmg output, however it is crucial that cast time remain low as this is a KITING spell and if it can't be cast in under 4 seconds, it is of no use.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;No changes planned at this time.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;3)&lt;STRONG&gt; Mana Pool Buffs&lt;/STRONG&gt; - There is currently a cap on mana received via buffs at 750. At the moment, this cap mainly affects Wizards because of the additional mana provided by familiars. In OoW it will likely apply to other classes as well because of the new Clairvoyance spell adding 400 mana. Is there any real reason for this to be capped?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;4) &lt;STRONG&gt;Low/Mid Level Wizard Damage&lt;/STRONG&gt; - While melee have every expansion gained numerous new weapons available at the lower levels that are markedly better in dealing out damage, casters have essentially remained static, casting the same spells they have always cast since the beginning. Slightly larger mana pools and minimally better mana regen hasn't really helped this too much. This has led to a situation where they are outdamaged in both the long and short term by melee, especially Wizards because there is no pet damage to fall back on (which can be helped with newer 'trash' weapons or pet only weapons in much the same way as melee). Suggestion would be to perhaps revisit the spell lines of lower and midrange casters to give some updated spells, perhaps available off harder encounters of those levels to alleviate the situation.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana? **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE:&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana? red; COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE:&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana? **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE:&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana? red; COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE:&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana? **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE:&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana? red; COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE:&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana? **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE:&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana? red; COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE:&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;5) &lt;STRONG&gt;Long term damage&lt;/STRONG&gt; - While Wizards can currently do pretty good short term damage for the most part, they suffer when it comes to long term damage in groups because their damage is all mana based. Some ideas may be help with mana regen in places where this is a problem, or an extended line of spells that address this problem (lower dps, but higher efficiency).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana? **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE:&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana? red; COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE:&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana? **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE:&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana? red; COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE:&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana? **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE:&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana? red; COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE:&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana? **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE:&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana? red; COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE:&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" &gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;6) &lt;STRONG&gt;Teleporting issues&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Add an AA that prevents leaving group mates behind for Teleport and Evacuate spells - &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;The base time and mana cost on some port spells seems rather excessive (Knowledge Portal as a level 39 spell for 600 mana and 24 seconds being one of these, porting to Hate, a higher level spell, is only 300 mana and 10 seconds). &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Some method of removing the requirement for fragments being used for translocates. Removing the reagant requirements from Hate/Sky with the same method would also be appreciated. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;More useful locations that aren't 1 zone or less away from PoK. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Here are top 11 choices, Umbral Plains and the Ocean of Tears had the same number of votes so I included both on the list.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Riftseekers&lt;BR&gt;Western Wastes&lt;BR&gt;Plane of Traquility&lt;BR&gt;Chardok – Near Chardock B&lt;BR&gt;Dragon Necropolis&lt;BR&gt;Dranik’s Scar&lt;BR&gt;Timorous Deep&lt;BR&gt;Crypt of Nadox&lt;BR&gt;Lake Rathe&lt;BR&gt;Umbral Plains – Near the Maiden’s Eye zone line&lt;BR&gt;Ocean of Tears&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Decession - Make Decession a bit more 'raid' friendly by either allowing it to work on anyone in a raid or giving a short timer TL box when cast on someone outside of your group (it needs to retain the no box ability inside your group in either case). &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Create Gate, Portal, and Translocate spells for all of the evacuation locations.&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana? **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE:&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana? red; COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE:&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana? **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE:&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana? red; COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE:&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana? **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE:&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana? red; COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE:&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana? **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE:&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana? red; COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE:&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;7) &lt;STRONG&gt;AA Issues&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Frenzied Devastation&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; -While the last change upped the efficiency of the ability, it still seems like it loses efficiency on average at the base level. If you add in the fact that focus items aren't even considered in the equation, this ability definitely loses comparative efficiency, the better your focus items, the worse off you are. It would actually be nice if this actually gained slightly in efficiency as you got more levels simply because it currently on par with similar melee abilities to gain DPS which don't seem to have the same problems. &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Revised item, sending to Rashere&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: ?Century mso-bidi-font-family: mso-fareast-font-family: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: New ?Times Gothic?; Roman?; mso-ansi-language: mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA?&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Ward of Destruction&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; - The damage done by the spell even at the max level is extremely low and the static nature of it also makes the damage output even less reliable.&amp;nbsp; &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Currently being evaluated&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&amp;nbsp; &lt;STRONG&gt;Rashere is currently looking into ways to make this AA more useful.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Familiars&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; - Should be more of a reason to use the GoD familiars, currently they are only used on short fights where you don't have a Bard because of the lack of mana regen and resists as well as the fact they are only dedicated to one resist type. It would also be nice if the other AA familiars were changed to the same 1 minute recast and instant cast as these. - &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;AA Costs&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; - The cost of some of the AA also seems excessive compared to previous ones of the same level. Also, some AA that cross classes (like Secondary Forte) seem to reflect a cost that is not tied to the usefulness for a given class, but seems to be tied to the cost for whatever class it is best suited for. - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;AA Costs for Gates of Discord were reduced and on live servers as of 12/15&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Strong Root&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; – Shorten recast timer and make it so Greater Fetter doesn’t overwrite it. - &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana? **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE:&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana? red; COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE:&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana? **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE:&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana? red; COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE:&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;8)&lt;STRONG&gt; Rain spells&lt;/STRONG&gt; - The primary problem here is resists and mezzes. You can't use a rain spell in a group because you will break mezzes. You can't root a mob and cast a rain spell because it will break the root. Rain spell also seem to have a built in 20% resist rate which seems rather excessive.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;9) &lt;STRONG&gt;Aggro problems&lt;/STRONG&gt; - As spell damage goes up, aggro also increases. And so does mob damage output. So the penalty for gaining aggro for any reason can often be almost instant death. Currently Maelin's legs are the only real method used for aggro control at the high end, and they put Wizards roughly where they should be in terms of overall damage, while allowing some capability to maybe escape death when the MT goes down. But as spell damage goes up, they will become more of a limiter on how much dps rises because aggro is still going to be the main limitation, which would essentially leave Wizards in the same spot (concussion is a fixed amount, it doesn't scale in the manner that Evade can if you get too high on the list and there is no version of Wizard 'Escape'). Going back to spell based Concussion doesn't really solve the overall problem, it just increases the chance that Wizards will die when the MT does while likely lowering overall dps.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana? **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE:&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana? red; COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE:&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana? **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE:&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana? red; COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE:&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;10) &lt;STRONG&gt;Resists&lt;/STRONG&gt; - Wizards were supposed to be able to have an innately better chance of landing spells than any other class because all of our damage is based on mana, and resists affect both our short term and our long term damage (a resist, unlike a miss, is not something you can recover in the long term because it has a cost, the mana you used is already spent and did nothing but increase your aggro). When the resist change went in, this was basically handled under the new system by giving some of our spells a resist modifier, but not all. Magic spells, for example, do not share the resist modifier that fire and cold spells get. Also, as you level and go further into the high end of an expansion, the resists also tend to get worse. It would be nice to Look into whether or not the resist modifiers on the current spells are where they should be and seeing if the penalty for being resisted is perhaps too high as well. Magic based spells should get the resist adjustment the other spells have as well.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;1) &lt;STRONG&gt;Manaburn&lt;/STRONG&gt; - A Wizard can currently spend their entire mana bar to do a little over 9k damage in 5 seconds - leaving the wizard completely helpless and out of mana afterwards. At the same time Ancient Strike of Chaos - our best fire-based nuke can crit for over 8k using less than 1 bubble of mana and taking 1 more second to cost. The damage cap on manaburn should be removed (with the exception of PvP), and it should be returned to its pre-nerf state.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;2) &lt;STRONG&gt;Pillar Spells&lt;/STRONG&gt; - Wizards grew up quad-kiting for a living. It is an insult to the class and the game that we are forced to fight level 70 monsters in Plane of Fire with a level 51 spell (Pillar of Frost). This line of spells - which is quite possibly the most used by wizards - has not had a meaningful update since KUNARK. New pillar spells should do in the 1500-1800 damage range (which is a lower ratio in terms of pillar versus nuke than the kunark pillars were compared to sunstrike). Mana cost should be higher to compensate for increased dmg output, however it is crucial that cast time remain low as this is a KITING spell and if it can't be cast in under 4 seconds, it is of no use.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;No changes planned at this time.&amp;nbsp; Would you like to replace this issue with a new item or would you like it left on the list for now?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;3)&lt;STRONG&gt; Mana Pool Buffs&lt;/STRONG&gt; - There is currently a cap on mana received via buffs at 750. At the moment, this cap mainly affects Wizards because of the additional mana provided by familiars. In OoW it will likely apply to other classes as well because of the new Clairvoyance spell adding 400 mana. Is there any real reason for this to be capped?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;4) &lt;STRONG&gt;Low/Mid Level Wizard Damage&lt;/STRONG&gt; - While melee have every expansion gained numerous new weapons available at the lower levels that are markedly better in dealing out damage, casters have essentially remained static, casting the same spells they have always cast since the beginning. Slightly larger mana pools and minimally better mana regen hasn't really helped this too much. This has led to a situation where they are outdamaged in both the long and short term by melee, especially Wizards because there is no pet damage to fall back on (which can be helped with newer 'trash' weapons or pet only weapons in much the same way as melee). Suggestion would be to perhaps revisit the spell lines of lower and midrange casters to give some updated spells, perhaps available off harder encounters of those levels to alleviate the situation.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;5) &lt;STRONG&gt;Long term damage&lt;/STRONG&gt; - While Wizards can currently do pretty good short term damage for the most part, they suffer when it comes to long term damage in groups because their damage is all mana based. Some ideas may be help with mana regen in places where this is a problem, or an extended line of spells that address this problem (lower dps, but higher efficiency).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;6) &lt;STRONG&gt;Teleporting issues&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Add an AA that prevents leaving group mates behind for Teleport and Evacuate spells - &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;The base time and mana cost on some port spells seems rather excessive (Knowledge Portal as a level 39 spell for 600 mana and 24 seconds being one of these, porting to Hate, a higher level spell, is only 300 mana and 10 seconds). &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Some method of removing the requirement for fragments being used for translocates. Removing the reagant requirements from Hate/Sky with the same method would also be appreciated. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;More useful locations that aren't 1 zone or less away from PoK. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Here are top 11 choices, Umbral Plains and the Ocean of Tears had the same number of votes so I included both on the list.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Riftseekers&lt;BR&gt;Western Wastes&lt;BR&gt;Plane of Traquility&lt;BR&gt;Chardok – Near Chardock B&lt;BR&gt;Dragon Necropolis&lt;BR&gt;Dranik’s Scar&lt;BR&gt;Timorous Deep&lt;BR&gt;Crypt of Nadox&lt;BR&gt;Lake Rathe&lt;BR&gt;Umbral Plains – Near the Maiden’s Eye zone line&lt;BR&gt;Ocean of Tears&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Decession - Make Decession a bit more 'raid' friendly by either allowing it to work on anyone in a raid or giving a short timer TL box when cast on someone outside of your group (it needs to retain the no box ability inside your group in either case). &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Create Gate, Portal, and Translocate spells for all of the evacuation locations.&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: Verdana? **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: 10pt;&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN COLOR: FONT-FAMILY: Verdana? **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: red; 10pt;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: Verdana? **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: 10pt;&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN COLOR: FONT-FAMILY: Verdana? **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: red; 10pt;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;7) &lt;STRONG&gt;AA Issues&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Frenzied Devastation&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; -While the last change upped the efficiency of the ability, it still seems like it loses efficiency on average at the base level. If you add in the fact that focus items aren't even considered in the equation, this ability definitely loses comparative efficiency, the better your focus items, the worse off you are. It would actually be nice if this actually gained slightly in efficiency as you got more levels simply because it currently on par with similar melee abilities to gain DPS which don't seem to have the same problems. &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Revised item, sending to Rashere&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: New ?Times mso-bidi-font-family: ?Century 10pt; mso-fareast-font-family: AR-SA? mso-bidi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: mso-ansi-language: Roman?; Gothic?;&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Ward of Destruction&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; - The damage done by the spell even at the max level is extremely low and the static nature of it also makes the damage output even less reliable.&amp;nbsp; &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Currently being evaluated&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&amp;nbsp; &lt;STRONG&gt;Rashere is currently looking into ways to make this AA more useful.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Familiars&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; - Should be more of a reason to use the GoD familiars, currently they are only used on short fights where you don't have a Bard because of the lack of mana regen and resists as well as the fact they are only dedicated to one resist type. It would also be nice if the other AA familiars were changed to the same 1 minute recast and instant cast as these. - &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;AA Costs&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; - The cost of some of the AA also seems excessive compared to previous ones of the same level. Also, some AA that cross classes (like Secondary Forte) seem to reflect a cost that is not tied to the usefulness for a given class, but seems to be tied to the cost for whatever class it is best suited for.&amp;nbsp; (All Gates AA costs will be evaluated after Omens launches - &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;The cost of Gates AAs are currently being evaluated.&amp;nbsp; The cost changes should be going to the live servers in the next update, or the one after that, neither have been scheduled yet.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Strong Root&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; – Shorten recast timer and make it so Greater Fetter doesn’t overwrite it. - &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: Verdana? **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: 10pt;&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN COLOR: FONT-FAMILY: Verdana? **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: red; 10pt;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: Verdana? **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: 10pt;&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN COLOR: FONT-FAMILY: Verdana? **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: red; 10pt;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;8)&lt;STRONG&gt; Rain spells&lt;/STRONG&gt; - The primary problem here is resists and mezzes. You can't use a rain spell in a group because you will break mezzes. You can't root a mob and cast a rain spell because it will break the root. Rain spell also seem to have a built in 20% resist rate which seems rather excessive.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;9) &lt;STRONG&gt;Aggro problems&lt;/STRONG&gt; - As spell damage goes up, aggro also increases. And so does mob damage output. So the penalty for gaining aggro for any reason can often be almost instant death. Currently Maelin's legs are the only real method used for aggro control at the high end, and they put Wizards roughly where they should be in terms of overall damage, while allowing some capability to maybe escape death when the MT goes down. But as spell damage goes up, they will become more of a limiter on how much dps rises because aggro is still going to be the main limitation, which would essentially leave Wizards in the same spot (concussion is a fixed amount, it doesn't scale in the manner that Evade can if you get too high on the list and there is no version of Wizard 'Escape'). Going back to spell based Concussion doesn't really solve the overall problem, it just increases the chance that Wizards will die when the MT does while likely lowering overall dps.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: Verdana? **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: 10pt;&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN COLOR: FONT-FAMILY: Verdana? **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: red; 10pt;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: Verdana? **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: 10pt;&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN COLOR: FONT-FAMILY: Verdana? **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: red; 10pt;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;10) &lt;STRONG&gt;Resists&lt;/STRONG&gt; - Wizards were supposed to be able to have an innately better chance of landing spells than any other class because all of our damage is based on mana, and resists affect both our short term and our long term damage (a resist, unlike a miss, is not something you can recover in the long term because it has a cost, the mana you used is already spent and did nothing but increase your aggro). When the resist change went in, this was basically handled under the new system by giving some of our spells a resist modifier, but not all. Magic spells, for example, do not share the resist modifier that fire and cold spells get. Also, as you level and go further into the high end of an expansion, the resists also tend to get worse. It would be nice to Look into whether or not the resist modifiers on the current spells are where they should be and seeing if the penalty for being resisted is perhaps too high as well. Magic based spells should get the resist adjustment the other spells have as well.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff00ff&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Wizard&lt;/STRONG&gt; - &lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;List Update scheduled for&amp;nbsp;11/19/04&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;1) &lt;STRONG&gt;Manaburn&lt;/STRONG&gt; - A Wizard can currently spend their entire mana bar to do a little over 9k damage in 5 seconds - leaving the wizard completely helpless and out of mana afterwards. At the same time Ancient Strike of Chaos - our best fire-based nuke can crit for over 8k using less than 1 bubble of mana and taking 1 more second to cost. The damage cap on manaburn should be removed (with the exception of PvP), and it should be returned to its pre-nerf state.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being evaluated.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Dev notes – Ideas continue to&amp;nbsp;floated around on how to fix the issues with Manaburn.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;2) &lt;STRONG&gt;Pillar Spells&lt;/STRONG&gt; - Wizards grew up quad-kiting for a living. It is an insult to the class and the game that we are forced to fight level 70 monsters in Plane of Fire with a level 51 spell (Pillar of Frost). This line of spells - which is quite possibly the most used by wizards - has not had a meaningful update since KUNARK. New pillar spells should do in the 1500-1800 damage range (which is a lower ratio in terms of pillar versus nuke than the kunark pillars were compared to sunstrike). Mana cost should be higher to compensate for increased dmg output, however it is crucial that cast time remain low as this is a KITING spell and if it can't be cast in under 4 seconds, it is of no use.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;No changes planned at this time.&amp;nbsp; Would you like to replace this issue with a new item or would you like it left on the list for now?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;3)&lt;STRONG&gt; Mana Pool Buffs&lt;/STRONG&gt; - There is currently a cap on mana received via buffs at 750. At the moment, this cap mainly affects Wizards because of the additional mana provided by familiars. In OoW it will likely apply to other classes as well because of the new Clairvoyance spell adding 400 mana. Is there any real reason for this to be capped?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;4) &lt;STRONG&gt;Low/Mid Level Wizard Damage&lt;/STRONG&gt; - While melee have every expansion gained numerous new weapons available at the lower levels that are markedly better in dealing out damage, casters have essentially remained static, casting the same spells they have always cast since the beginning. Slightly larger mana pools and minimally better mana regen hasn't really helped this too much. This has led to a situation where they are outdamaged in both the long and short term by melee, especially Wizards because there is no pet damage to fall back on (which can be helped with newer 'trash' weapons or pet only weapons in much the same way as melee). Suggestion would be to perhaps revisit the spell lines of lower and midrange casters to give some updated spells, perhaps available off harder encounters of those levels to alleviate the situation.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;5) &lt;STRONG&gt;Long term damage&lt;/STRONG&gt; - While Wizards can currently do pretty good short term damage for the most part, they suffer when it comes to long term damage in groups because their damage is all mana based. Some ideas may be help with mana regen in places where this is a problem, or an extended line of spells that address this problem (lower dps, but higher efficiency).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Add an AA that prevents leaving group mates behind for Teleport and Evacuate spells - &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;The base time and mana cost on some port spells seems rather excessive (Knowledge Portal as a level 39 spell for 600 mana and 24 seconds being one of these, porting to Hate, a higher level spell, is only 300 mana and 10 seconds). &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Some method of removing the requirement for fragments being used for translocates. Removing the reagant requirements from Hate/Sky with the same method would also be appreciated. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;More useful locations that aren't 1 zone or less away from PoK. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The list from &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;A href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=wizardbalance&amp;amp;message.id=1583" target=_blank&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;this post&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt; has been collected.&amp;nbsp; Please see reply below for further details.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Decession - Make Decession a bit more 'raid' friendly by either allowing it to work on anyone in a raid or giving a short timer TL box when cast on someone outside of your group (it needs to retain the no box ability inside your group in either case). &#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;7) &lt;STRONG&gt;AA Issues&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Frenzied Devastation&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; - Should be changed to make it more useful. Some suggestions would be making it last longer, removing the increased mana cost, increasing the chance to crit to close to 100%, or making the crits reflect focused damage instead of base damage. Currently, the doubled mana cost for the chance at an extra crit over an extremely short period seems excessive for most anything besides AEing given the unreliable nature of crits, especially given that at max crits you would crit at least 1 of the casts in the time period anyway. &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Notes from Rashere - FD isn’t changing.&amp;nbsp; It was meant as an ability that traded efficiency for quick damage.&amp;nbsp; After the last boost it got, at the highest rank it no longer loses any efficiency on average.&amp;nbsp; I’m not going to be improving it so that you actually gain efficiency while it’s in effect.&amp;nbsp; For a longer duration of the effect, pick up the Omens AA Prolonged Destruction which doubles the duration.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Ward of Destruction&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; - The damage done by the spell even at the max level is extremely low and the static nature of it also makes the damage output even less reliable.&amp;nbsp; &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Currently being evaluated&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&amp;nbsp; &lt;STRONG&gt;Rashere is currently looking into ways to make this AA more useful.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Familiars&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; - Should be more of a reason to use the GoD familiars, currently they are only used on short fights where you don't have a Bard because of the lack of mana regen and resists as well as the fact they are only dedicated to one resist type. It would also be nice if the other AA familiars were changed to the same 1 minute recast and instant cast as these. - &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;AA Costs&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; - The cost of some of the AA also seems excessive compared to previous ones of the same level. Also, some AA that cross classes (like Secondary Forte) seem to reflect a cost that is not tied to the usefulness for a given class, but seems to be tied to the cost for whatever class it is best suited for.&amp;nbsp; (All Gates AA costs will be evaluated after Omens launches - &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;The cost of Gates AAs are currently being evaluated.&amp;nbsp; The cost changes should be going to the live servers in the next update, or the one after that, neither have been scheduled yet.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Strong Root&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; – Shorten recast timer and make it so Greater Fetter doesn’t overwrite it. - &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN Verdana? FONT-FAMILY: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: 10pt;&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN Verdana? FONT-FAMILY: COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: red; 10pt;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN Verdana?

&lt;DIV&gt;8)&lt;STRONG&gt; Rain spells&lt;/STRONG&gt; - The primary problem here is resists and mezzes. You can't use a rain spell in a group because you will break mezzes. You can't root a mob and cast a rain spell because it will break the root. Rain spell also seem to have a built in 20% resist rate which seems rather excessive.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;9) &lt;STRONG&gt;Aggro problems&lt;/STRONG&gt; - As spell damage goes up, aggro also increases. And so does mob damage output. So the penalty for gaining aggro for any reason can often be almost instant death. Currently Maelin's legs are the only real method used for aggro control at the high end, and they put Wizards roughly where they should be in terms of overall damage, while allowing some capability to maybe escape death when the MT goes down. But as spell damage goes up, they will become more of a limiter on how much dps rises because aggro is still going to be the main limitation, which would essentially leave Wizards in the same spot (concussion is a fixed amount, it doesn't scale in the manner that Evade can if you get too high on the list and there is no version of Wizard 'Escape'). Going back to spell based Concussion doesn't really solve the overall problem, it just increases the chance that Wizards will die when the MT does while likely lowering overall dps.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN Verdana? FONT-FAMILY: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: 10pt;&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN Verdana? FONT-FAMILY: COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: red; 10pt;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN Verdana? FONT-FAMILY: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: 10pt;&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN Verdana? FONT-FAMILY: COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: red; 10pt;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;10) &lt;STRONG&gt;Resists&lt;/STRONG&gt; - Wizards were supposed to be able to have an innately better chance of landing spells than any other class because all of our damage is based on mana, and resists affect both our short term and our long term damage (a resist, unlike a miss, is not something you can recover in the long term because it has a cost, the mana you used is already spent and did nothing but increase your aggro). When the resist change went in, this was basically handled under the new system by giving some of our spells a resist modifier, but not all. Magic spells, for example, do not share the resist modifier that fire and cold spells get. Also, as you level and go further into the high end of an expansion, the resists also tend to get worse. It would be nice to Look into whether or not the resist modifiers on the current spells are where they should be and seeing if the penalty for being resisted is perhaps too high as well. Magic based spells should get the resist adjustment the other spells have as well.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff00ff&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Wizard&lt;/STRONG&gt; - &lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;List Update scheduled for&amp;nbsp;11/05/04&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff00ff&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: #cccccc; Verdana? **SMURF**?COLOR:&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff00ff&gt;&lt;SPAN COLOR: FONT-FAMILY: #cccccc; **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: New ?Times 12pt; Roman??&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff00ff&gt;Please note that there isn't any new development feedback in this update.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;1) &lt;STRONG&gt;Manaburn&lt;/STRONG&gt; - A Wizard can currently spend their entire mana bar to do a little over 9k damage in 5 seconds - leaving the wizard completely helpless and out of mana afterwards. At the same time Ancient Strike of Chaos - our best fire-based nuke can crit for over 8k using less than 1 bubble of mana and taking 1 more second to cost. The damage cap on manaburn should be removed (with the exception of PvP), and it should be returned to its pre-nerf state.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being evaluated.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Dev notes – Ideas continue to&amp;nbsp;floated around on how to fix the issues with Manaburn.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;2) &lt;STRONG&gt;Pillar Spells&lt;/STRONG&gt; - Wizards grew up quad-kiting for a living. It is an insult to the class and the game that we are forced to fight level 70 monsters in Plane of Fire with a level 51 spell (Pillar of Frost). This line of spells - which is quite possibly the most used by wizards - has not had a meaningful update since KUNARK. New pillar spells should do in the 1500-1800 damage range (which is a lower ratio in terms of pillar versus nuke than the kunark pillars were compared to sunstrike). Mana cost should be higher to compensate for increased dmg output, however it is crucial that cast time remain low as this is a KITING spell and if it can't be cast in under 4 seconds, it is of no use.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;No changes planned at this time.&amp;nbsp; Would you like to replace this issue with a new item or would you like it left on the list for now?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;3)&lt;STRONG&gt; Mana Pool Buffs&lt;/STRONG&gt; - There is currently a cap on mana received via buffs at 750. At the moment, this cap mainly affects Wizards because of the additional mana provided by familiars. In OoW it will likely apply to other classes as well because of the new Clairvoyance spell adding 400 mana. Is there any real reason for this to be capped?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;4) &lt;STRONG&gt;Low/Mid Level Wizard Damage&lt;/STRONG&gt; - While melee have every expansion gained numerous new weapons available at the lower levels that are markedly better in dealing out damage, casters have essentially remained static, casting the same spells they have always cast since the beginning. Slightly larger mana pools and minimally better mana regen hasn't really helped this too much. This has led to a situation where they are outdamaged in both the long and short term by melee, especially Wizards because there is no pet damage to fall back on (which can be helped with newer 'trash' weapons or pet only weapons in much the same way as melee). Suggestion would be to perhaps revisit the spell lines of lower and midrange casters to give some updated spells, perhaps available off harder encounters of those levels to alleviate the situation.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;5) &lt;STRONG&gt;Long term damage&lt;/STRONG&gt; - While Wizards can currently do pretty good short term damage for the most part, they suffer when it comes to long term damage in groups because their damage is all mana based. Some ideas may be help with mana regen in places where this is a problem, or an extended line of spells that address this problem (lower dps, but higher efficiency).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;6) &lt;STRONG&gt;Teleporting issues&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Add an AA that prevents leaving group mates behind for Teleport and Evacuate spells - &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;The base time and mana cost on some port spells seems rather excessive (Knowledge Portal as a level 39 spell for 600 mana and 24 seconds being one of these, porting to Hate, a higher level spell, is only 300 mana and 10 seconds). &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Some method of removing the requirement for fragments being used for translocates. Removing the reagant requirements from Hate/Sky with the same method would also be appreciated. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;More useful locations that aren't 1 zone or less away from PoK.&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;I would like to collect suggestions on where new posts are needed.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Decession - Make Decession a bit more 'raid' friendly by either allowing it to work on anyone in a raid or giving a short timer TL box when cast on someone outside of your group (it needs to retain the no box ability inside your group in either case).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;7) &lt;STRONG&gt;AA Issues&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Frenzied Devastation&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; - Should be changed to make it more useful. Some suggestions would be making it last longer, removing the increased mana cost, increasing the chance to crit to close to 100%, or making the crits reflect focused damage instead of base damage. Currently, the doubled mana cost for the chance at an extra crit over an extremely short period seems excessive for most anything besides AEing given the unreliable nature of crits, especially given that at max crits you would crit at least 1 of the casts in the time period anyway. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Ward of Destruction&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; - The damage done by the spell even at the max level is extremely low and the static nature of it also makes the damage output even less reliable.&amp;nbsp; &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Currently being evaluated&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&amp;nbsp; &lt;STRONG&gt;Rashere is currently looking into ways to make this AA more useful.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Familiars&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; - Should be more of a reason to use the GoD familiars, currently they are only used on short fights where you don't have a Bard because of the lack of mana regen and resists as well as the fact they are only dedicated to one resist type. It would also be nice if the other AA familiars were changed to the same 1 minute recast and instant cast as these. - &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;AA Costs&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; - The cost of some of the AA also seems excessive compared to previous ones of the same level. Also, some AA that cross classes (like Secondary Forte) seem to reflect a cost that is not tied to the usefulness for a given class, but seems to be tied to the cost for whatever class it is best suited for.&amp;nbsp; (All Gates AA costs will be evaluated after Omens launches - &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;The cost of Gates AAs are currently being evaluated.&amp;nbsp; The cost changes should be going to the live servers in the next update, or the one after that, neither have been scheduled yet.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Strong Root&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; – Shorten recast timer and make it so Greater Fetter doesn’t overwrite it. - &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: Verdana? **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: 10pt;&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN COLOR: FONT-FAMILY: Verdana? **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: red; 10pt;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: Verdana? **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: 10pt;&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN COLOR: FONT-FAMILY: Verdana? **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: red; 10pt;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;8)&lt;STRONG&gt; Rain spells&lt;/STRONG&gt; - The primary problem here is resists and mezzes. You can't use a rain spell in a group because you will break mezzes. You can't root a mob and cast a rain spell because it will break the root. Rain spell also seem to have a built in 20% resist rate which seems rather excessive.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;9) &lt;STRONG&gt;Aggro problems&lt;/STRONG&gt; - As spell damage goes up, aggro also increases. And so does mob damage output. So the penalty for gaining aggro for any reason can often be almost instant death. Currently Maelin's legs are the only real method used for aggro control at the high end, and they put Wizards roughly where they should be in terms of overall damage, while allowing some capability to maybe escape death when the MT goes down. But as spell damage goes up, they will become more of a limiter on how much dps rises because aggro is still going to be the main limitation, which would essentially leave Wizards in the same spot (concussion is a fixed amount, it doesn't scale in the manner that Evade can if you get too high on the list and there is no version of Wizard 'Escape'). Going back to spell based Concussion doesn't really solve the overall problem, it just increases the chance that Wizards will die when the MT does while likely lowering overall dps.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: Verdana? **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: 10pt;&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN COLOR: FONT-FAMILY: Verdana? **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: red; 10pt;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: Verdana? **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: 10pt;&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN COLOR: FONT-FAMILY: Verdana? **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: red; 10pt;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;10) &lt;STRONG&gt;Resists&lt;/STRONG&gt; - Wizards were supposed to be able to have an innately better chance of landing spells than any other class because all of our damage is based on mana, and resists affect both our short term and our long term damage (a resist, unlike a miss, is not something you can recover in the long term because it has a cost, the mana you used is already spent and did nothing but increase your aggro). When the resist change went in, this was basically handled under the new system by giving some of our spells a resist modifier, but not all. Magic spells, for example, do not share the resist modifier that fire and cold spells get. Also, as you level and go further into the high end of an expansion, the resists also tend to get worse. It would be nice to Look into whether or not the resist modifiers on the current spells are where they should be and seeing if the penalty for being resisted is perhaps too high as well. Magic based spells should get the resist adjustment the other spells have as well.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff00ff&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Wizard&lt;/STRONG&gt; - &lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;List Update scheduled for&amp;nbsp;10/22/04&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff00ff&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: Verdana? **SMURF**?COLOR: #cccccc;&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff00ff&gt;Please note that there isn't any new development feedback on this list.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" &gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;1) &lt;STRONG&gt;Manaburn&lt;/STRONG&gt; - A Wizard can currently spend their entire mana bar to do a little over 9k damage in 5 seconds - leaving the wizard completely helpless and out of mana afterwards. At the same time Ancient Strike of Chaos - our best fire-based nuke can crit for over 8k using less than 1 bubble of mana and taking 1 more second to cost. The damage cap on manaburn should be removed (with the exception of PvP), and it should be returned to its pre-nerf state.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being evaluated.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Dev notes – Ideas continue to&amp;nbsp;floated around on how to fix the issues with Manaburn.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;2) &lt;STRONG&gt;Pillar Spells&lt;/STRONG&gt; - Wizards grew up quad-kiting for a living. It is an insult to the class and the game that we are forced to fight level 70 monsters in Plane of Fire with a level 51 spell (Pillar of Frost). This line of spells - which is quite possibly the most used by wizards - has not had a meaningful update since KUNARK. New pillar spells should do in the 1500-1800 damage range (which is a lower ratio in terms of pillar versus nuke than the kunark pillars were compared to sunstrike). Mana cost should be higher to compensate for increased dmg output, however it is crucial that cast time remain low as this is a KITING spell and if it can't be cast in under 4 seconds, it is of no use.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;No changes planned at this time.&amp;nbsp; Would you like to replace this issue with a new item or would you like it left on the list for now?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;3)&lt;STRONG&gt; Mana Pool Buffs&lt;/STRONG&gt; - There is currently a cap on mana received via buffs at 750. At the moment, this cap mainly affects Wizards because of the additional mana provided by familiars. In OoW it will likely apply to other classes as well because of the new Clairvoyance spell adding 400 mana. Is there any real reason for this to be capped?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;4) &lt;STRONG&gt;Low/Mid Level Wizard Damage&lt;/STRONG&gt; - While melee have every expansion gained numerous new weapons available at the lower levels that are markedly better in dealing out damage, casters have essentially remained static, casting the same spells they have always cast since the beginning. Slightly larger mana pools and minimally better mana regen hasn't really helped this too much. This has led to a situation where they are outdamaged in both the long and short term by melee, especially Wizards because there is no pet damage to fall back on (which can be helped with newer 'trash' weapons or pet only weapons in much the same way as melee). Suggestion would be to perhaps revisit the spell lines of lower and midrange casters to give some updated spells, perhaps available off harder encounters of those levels to alleviate the situation.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;5) &lt;STRONG&gt;Long term damage&lt;/STRONG&gt; - While Wizards can currently do pretty good short term damage for the most part, they suffer when it comes to long term damage in groups because their damage is all mana based.

&lt;P&gt;6) &lt;STRONG&gt;Teleporting issues&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;

&lt;LI&gt;The base time and mana cost on some port spells seems rather excessive (Knowledge Portal as a level 39 spell for 600 mana and 24 seconds being one of these, porting to Hate, a higher level spell, is only 300 mana and 10 seconds). &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Some method of removing the requirement for fragments being used for translocates. Removing the reagant requirements from Hate/Sky with the same method would also be appreciated. &#xD;

&lt;LI&gt;Decession - Make Decession a bit more 'raid' friendly by either allowing it to work on anyone in a raid or giving a short timer TL box when cast on someone outside of your group (it needs to retain the no box ability inside your group in either case).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;7) &lt;STRONG&gt;AA Issues&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Frenzied Devastation&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; - Should be changed to make it more useful. Some suggestions would be making it last longer, removing the increased mana cost, increasing the chance to crit to close to 100%, or making the crits reflect focused damage instead of base damage. Currently, the doubled mana cost for the chance at an extra crit over an extremely short period seems excessive for most anything besides AEing given the unreliable nature of crits, especially given that at max crits you would crit at least 1 of the casts in the time period anyway. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Ward of Destruction&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; - The damage done by the spell even at the max level is extremely low and the static nature of it also makes the damage output even less reliable. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Familiars&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; - Should be more of a reason to use the GoD familiars, currently they are only used on short fights where you don't have a Bard because of the lack of mana regen and resists as well as the fact they are only dedicated to one resist type. It would also be nice if the other AA familiars were changed to the same 1 minute recast and instant cast as these. - &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;AA Costs&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; - The cost of some of the AA also seems excessive compared to previous ones of the same level. Also, some AA that cross classes (like Secondary Forte) seem to reflect a cost that is not tied to the usefulness for a given class, but seems to be tied to the cost for whatever class it is best suited for.&amp;nbsp; (All Gates AA costs will be evaluated after Omens launches - &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;The cost of Gates AAs are currently being evaluated.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Strong Root&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; – Shorten recast timer and make it so Greater Fetter doesn’t overwrite it. - &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana? **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE:&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana? red; COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE:&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana? **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE:&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana? red; COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE:&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;8)&lt;STRONG&gt; Rain spells&lt;/STRONG&gt; - The primary problem here is resists and mezzes. You can't use a rain spell in a group because you will break mezzes. You can't root a mob and cast a rain spell because it will break the root. Rain spell also seem to have a built in 20% resist rate which seems rather excessive.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;9) &lt;STRONG&gt;Aggro problems&lt;/STRONG&gt; - As spell damage goes up, aggro also increases. And so does mob damage output. So the penalty for gaining aggro for any reason can often be almost instant death. Currently Maelin's legs are the only real method used for aggro control at the high end, and they put Wizards roughly where they should be in terms of overall damage, while allowing some capability to maybe escape death when the MT goes down. But as spell damage goes up, they will become more of a limiter on how much dps rises because aggro is still going to be the main limitation, which would essentially leave Wizards in the same spot (concussion is a fixed amount, it doesn't scale in the manner that Evade can if you get too high on the list and there is no version of Wizard 'Escape'). Going back to spell based Concussion doesn't really solve the overall problem, it just increases the chance that Wizards will die when the MT does while likely lowering overall dps.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana? **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE:&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana? red; COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE:&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana? **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE:&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana? red; COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE:&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;10) &lt;STRONG&gt;Resists&lt;/STRONG&gt; - Wizards were supposed to be able to have an innately better chance of landing spells than any other class because all of our damage is based on mana, and resists affect both our short term and our long term damage (a resist, unlike a miss, is not something you can recover in the long term because it has a cost, the mana you used is already spent and did nothing but increase your aggro). When the resist change went in, this was basically handled under the new system by giving some of our spells a resist modifier, but not all. Magic spells, for example, do not share the resist modifier that fire and cold spells get. Also, as you level and go further into the high end of an expansion, the resists also tend to get worse. It would be nice to Look into whether or not the resist modifiers on the current spells are where they should be and seeing if the penalty for being resisted is perhaps too high as well. Magic based spells should get the resist adjustment the other spells have as well.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff00ff&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Wizard&lt;/STRONG&gt; - &lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;List Update scheduled for&amp;nbsp;10/8/04&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff00ff&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: Verdana? **SMURF**?COLOR: #cccccc;&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff00ff&gt;Please note that there isn't any new development feedback on this list.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" &gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;1) &lt;STRONG&gt;Manaburn&lt;/STRONG&gt; - A Wizard can currently spend their entire mana bar to do a little over 9k damage in 5 seconds - leaving the wizard completely helpless and out of mana afterwards. At the same time Ancient Strike of Chaos - our best fire-based nuke can crit for over 8k using less than 1 bubble of mana and taking 1 more second to cost. The damage cap on manaburn should be removed (with the exception of PvP), and it should be returned to its pre-nerf state.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being evaluated.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Dev notes – Ideas continue to&amp;nbsp;floated around on how to fix the issues with Manaburn.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;2) &lt;STRONG&gt;Pillar Spells&lt;/STRONG&gt; - Wizards grew up quad-kiting for a living. It is an insult to the class and the game that we are forced to fight level 70 monsters in Plane of Fire with a level 51 spell (Pillar of Frost). This line of spells - which is quite possibly the most used by wizards - has not had a meaningful update since KUNARK. New pillar spells should do in the 1500-1800 damage range (which is a lower ratio in terms of pillar versus nuke than the kunark pillars were compared to sunstrike). Mana cost should be higher to compensate for increased dmg output, however it is crucial that cast time remain low as this is a KITING spell and if it can't be cast in under 4 seconds, it is of no use.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;No changes planned at this time.&amp;nbsp; Would you like to replace this issue with a new item or would you like it left on the list for now?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;3)&lt;STRONG&gt; Mana Pool Buffs&lt;/STRONG&gt; - There is currently a cap on mana received via buffs at 750. At the moment, this cap mainly affects Wizards because of the additional mana provided by familiars. In OoW it will likely apply to other classes as well because of the new Clairvoyance spell adding 400 mana. Is there any real reason for this to be capped?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;4) &lt;STRONG&gt;Low/Mid Level Wizard Damage&lt;/STRONG&gt; - While melee have every expansion gained numerous new weapons available at the lower levels that are markedly better in dealing out damage, casters have essentially remained static, casting the same spells they have always cast since the beginning. Slightly larger mana pools and minimally better mana regen hasn't really helped this too much. This has led to a situation where they are outdamaged in both the long and short term by melee, especially Wizards because there is no pet damage to fall back on (which can be helped with newer 'trash' weapons or pet only weapons in much the same way as melee). Suggestion would be to perhaps revisit the spell lines of lower and midrange casters to give some updated spells, perhaps available off harder encounters of those levels to alleviate the situation.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;5) &lt;STRONG&gt;Long term damage&lt;/STRONG&gt; - While Wizards can currently do pretty good short term damage for the most part, they suffer when it comes to long term damage in groups because their damage is all mana based. Some ideas may be help with mana regen in places where this is a problem, or an extended line of spells that address this problem (lower dps, but higher efficiency).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;6) &lt;STRONG&gt;Teleporting issues&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;7) &lt;STRONG&gt;AA Issues&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Frenzied Devastation&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; - Should be changed to make it more useful. Some suggestions would be making it last longer, removing the increased mana cost, increasing the chance to crit to close to 100%, or making the crits reflect focused damage instead of base damage. Currently, the doubled mana cost for the chance at an extra crit over an extremely short period seems excessive for most anything besides AEing given the unreliable nature of crits, especially given that at max crits you would crit at least 1 of the casts in the time period anyway. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Ward of Destruction&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; - The damage done by the spell even at the max level is extremely low and the static nature of it also makes the damage output even less reliable. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Familiars&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; - Should be more of a reason to use the GoD familiars, currently they are only used on short fights where you don't have a Bard because of the lack of mana regen and resists as well as the fact they are only dedicated to one resist type. It would also be nice if the other AA familiars were changed to the same 1 minute recast and instant cast as these. - &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;AA Costs&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; - The cost of some of the AA also seems excessive compared to previous ones of the same level. Also, some AA that cross classes (like Secondary Forte) seem to reflect a cost that is not tied to the usefulness for a given class, but seems to be tied to the cost for whatever class it is best suited for.&amp;nbsp; (All Gates AA costs will be evaluated after Omens launches - &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;The cost of Gates AAs are currently being evaluated.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Strong Root&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; – Shorten recast timer and make it so Greater Fetter doesn’t overwrite it. - &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana? **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE:&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana? red; COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE:&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana? **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE:&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana? red; COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE:&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;8)&lt;STRONG&gt; Rain spells&lt;/STRONG&gt; - The primary problem here is resists and mezzes. You can't use a rain spell in a group because you will break mezzes. You can't root a mob and cast a rain spell because it will break the root. Rain spell also seem to have a built in 20% resist rate which seems rather excessive.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;9) &lt;STRONG&gt;Aggro problems&lt;/STRONG&gt; - As spell damage goes up, aggro also increases. And so does mob damage output. So the penalty for gaining aggro for any reason can often be almost instant death. Currently Maelin's legs are the only real method used for aggro control at the high end, and they put Wizards roughly where they should be in terms of overall damage, while allowing some capability to maybe escape death when the MT goes down. But as spell damage goes up, they will become more of a limiter on how much dps rises because aggro is still going to be the main limitation, which would essentially leave Wizards in the same spot (concussion is a fixed amount, it doesn't scale in the manner that Evade can if you get too high on the list and there is no version of Wizard 'Escape'). Going back to spell based Concussion doesn't really solve the overall problem, it just increases the chance that Wizards will die when the MT does while likely lowering overall dps.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana? **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE:&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana? red; COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE:&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana? **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE:&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana? red; COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE:&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;10) &lt;STRONG&gt;Resists&lt;/STRONG&gt; - Wizards were supposed to be able to have an innately better chance of landing spells than any other class because all of our damage is based on mana, and resists affect both our short term and our long term damage (a resist, unlike a miss, is not something you can recover in the long term because it has a cost, the mana you used is already spent and did nothing but increase your aggro). When the resist change went in, this was basically handled under the new system by giving some of our spells a resist modifier, but not all. Magic spells, for example, do not share the resist modifier that fire and cold spells get. Also, as you level and go further into the high end of an expansion, the resists also tend to get worse. It would be nice to Look into whether or not the resist modifiers on the current spells are where they should be and seeing if the penalty for being resisted is perhaps too high as well. Magic based spells should get the resist adjustment the other spells have as well.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=wizardbalance&amp;message.id=1449#M1449</link>

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff00ff&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Wizard&lt;/STRONG&gt; - &lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;List Update scheduled for&amp;nbsp;9/24/04&lt;xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" &gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;1) &lt;STRONG&gt;Manaburn&lt;/STRONG&gt; - A Wizard can currently spend their entire mana bar to do a little over 9k damage in 5 seconds - leaving the wizard completely helpless and out of mana afterwards. At the same time Ancient Strike of Chaos - our best fire-based nuke can crit for over 8k using less than 1 bubble of mana and taking 1 more second to cost. The damage cap on manaburn should be removed (with the exception of PvP), and it should be returned to its pre-nerf state.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being evaluated.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Dev notes – Ideas continue to&amp;nbsp;floated around on how to fix the issues with Manaburn.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;2) &lt;STRONG&gt;Pillar Spells&lt;/STRONG&gt; - Wizards grew up quad-kiting for a living. It is an insult to the class and the game that we are forced to fight level 70 monsters in Plane of Fire with a level 51 spell (Pillar of Frost). This line of spells - which is quite possibly the most used by wizards - has not had a meaningful update since KUNARK. New pillar spells should do in the 1500-1800 damage range (which is a lower ratio in terms of pillar versus nuke than the kunark pillars were compared to sunstrike). Mana cost should be higher to compensate for increased dmg output, however it is crucial that cast time remain low as this is a KITING spell and if it can't be cast in under 4 seconds, it is of no use.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;No changes planned at this time.&amp;nbsp; We should think about replacing this item.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;3)&lt;STRONG&gt; Mana Pool Buffs&lt;/STRONG&gt; - There is currently a cap on mana received via buffs at 750. At the moment, this cap mainly affects Wizards because of the additional mana provided by familiars. In OoW it will likely apply to other classes as well because of the new Clairvoyance spell adding 400 mana. Is there any real reason for this to be capped?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;4) &lt;STRONG&gt;Low/Mid Level Wizard Damage&lt;/STRONG&gt; - While melee have every expansion gained numerous new weapons available at the lower levels that are markedly better in dealing out damage, casters have essentially remained static, casting the same spells they have always cast since the beginning. Slightly larger mana pools and minimally better mana regen hasn't really helped this too much. This has led to a situation where they are outdamaged in both the long and short term by melee, especially Wizards because there is no pet damage to fall back on (which can be helped with newer 'trash' weapons or pet only weapons in much the same way as melee). Suggestion would be to perhaps revisit the spell lines of lower and midrange casters to give some updated spells, perhaps available off harder encounters of those levels to alleviate the situation.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;5) &lt;STRONG&gt;Long term damage&lt;/STRONG&gt; - While Wizards can currently do pretty good short term damage for the most part, they suffer when it comes to long term damage in groups because their damage is all mana based. Some ideas may be help with mana regen in places where this is a problem, or an extended line of spells that address this problem (lower dps, but higher efficiency).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;6) &lt;STRONG&gt;Teleporting issues&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Add an AA that prevents leaving group mates behind for Teleport and Evacuate spells - &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;The base time and mana cost on some port spells seems rather excessive (Knowledge Portal as a level 39 spell for 600 mana and 24 seconds being one of these, porting to Hate, a higher level spell, is only 300 mana and 10 seconds). &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Some method of removing the requirement for fragments being used for translocates. Removing the reagant requirements from Hate/Sky with the same method would also be appreciated. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;More useful locations that aren't 1 zone or less away from PoK.&amp;nbsp; &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Ports to Barindu are being added to the 9/14 update, further updates will be discussed in the future (after the Omens Launch)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Decession - Make Decession a bit more 'raid' friendly by either allowing it to work on anyone in a raid or giving a short timer TL box when cast on someone outside of your group (it needs to retain the no box ability inside your group in either case).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;8)&lt;STRONG&gt; Rain spells&lt;/STRONG&gt; - The primary problem here is resists and mezzes. You can't use a rain spell in a group because you will break mezzes. You can't root a mob and cast a rain spell because it will break the root. Rain spell also seem to have a built in 20% resist rate which seems rather excessive.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;9) &lt;STRONG&gt;Aggro problems&lt;/STRONG&gt; - As spell damage goes up, aggro also increases. And so does mob damage output. So the penalty for gaining aggro for any reason can often be almost instant death. Currently Maelin's legs are the only real method used for aggro control at the high end, and they put Wizards roughly where they should be in terms of overall damage, while allowing some capability to maybe escape death when the MT goes down. But as spell damage goes up, they will become more of a limiter on how much dps rises because aggro is still going to be the main limitation, which would essentially leave Wizards in the same spot (concussion is a fixed amount, it doesn't scale in the manner that Evade can if you get too high on the list and there is no version of Wizard 'Escape'). Going back to spell based Concussion doesn't really solve the overall problem, it just increases the chance that Wizards will die when the MT does while likely lowering overall dps.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;10) &lt;STRONG&gt;Resists&lt;/STRONG&gt; - Wizards were supposed to be able to have an innately better chance of landing spells than any other class because all of our damage is based on mana, and resists affect both our short term and our long term damage (a resist, unlike a miss, is not something you can recover in the long term because it has a cost, the mana you used is already spent and did nothing but increase your aggro). When the resist change went in, this was basically handled under the new system by giving some of our spells a resist modifier, but not all. Magic spells, for example, do not share the resist modifier that fire and cold spells get. Also, as you level and go further into the high end of an expansion, the resists also tend to get worse. It would be nice to Look into whether or not the resist modifiers on the current spells are where they should be and seeing if the penalty for being resisted is perhaps too high as well. Magic based spells should get the resist adjustment the other spells have as well.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
