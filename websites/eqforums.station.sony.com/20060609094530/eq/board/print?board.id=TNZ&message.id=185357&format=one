The rune series of spells is a "damage absorber" which blocks you from taking a certain amount of damage from melee attacks.  These are incredibly useful, but different from "damage shields" which cause damage to the opponent.<br><br>Runes are also not new.  As far as I know, enchanters have always had Rune spells.<br><br>Most classes have some form of damage shields:<br>Druids have two separate lines of thorns / spike spells.  One is self-only.  The other eventually has a group version.<br>Rangers have three separate lines.  The druid versions plus the Call of Earth series.<br>Wizards have O'Keils, including O'Keils Levity.  5pts<br>Enchanters have Feedback, a fairly rare research spell.<br>Necromancers have Banshee Aura, also researched.<br>Clerics get two separate lines of reverse DS, which don't count, because they're detrimental<br>Bards have a song or two that provides a group damage shield.<br>Mages get some of the best damage shields, including a group DS.<br>For everyone else, there's the Coldain Ring quest.
