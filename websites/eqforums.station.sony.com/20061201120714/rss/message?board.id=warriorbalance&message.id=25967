    <title>Mid-End gear, high level warriors</title>
    <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=warriorbalance&amp;message.id=25967</link>
    <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Greetings all&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I just wanted to air a few things out.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Seems to me, that most discussions on this board, are refering to the HIGH end gear warriors.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;What if we for a few minutes took a look at the mid end gear warriors tanking ?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I currently have a 66 warrior with 50somthing(forgot exact amount) of AA's, and working to improve this.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I currently sit with 6.7/8K hp and around then 1300ac mark(Unbuffed)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;My point of this post is that, at the progression I am at (Missing very few kills till EP'ed). I have been in situations where I have been "taken" out of the role I held in my group,&amp;nbsp; take for example a time in WoS,&amp;nbsp;there was a knight (SK) that could take over tanking THOUGH havnig less HP / AC then me (I was sitting at 9000hp/1500 ac, and he was sat at 8.2K/1400AC), and the cleric actually insisted to the point (was groupleader) That I stepped down as tank, and let the SK overtake, or left the group. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;This to me, seems rather unbalancing, when a cleric actually ask's a inferior(Hp/AC) tank, to take over tanking, when no issues were being had with other tank (Hell, we had slaughtered 3-5 nameds in WoS, before the SK came into the picture, without a problem) &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Am I the only one who has experienced this sort of happening ? Or have I just been unlucky?(Happened 6-7 times to me now)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If there is anything I can improve let me know. I have done my very best to be able to cope with handling my responsibilty as a tank, even though I am NO WAY near the high end equipment. Due to being at work (And the firewall is blocking me to get to my magelo, I will be posting it once I get home later today)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;But any feedback of what I might have been doing wrong or what I can improve, will be very much appreciated!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;Doesn't sound like either the warrior or the sk had too much trouble surviveing in wos at thier progression level. I suspect one of Frodlin's three answers was the correct one.</description>

&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Yeah, and the three posts before your's is true as well. Long as your still in the group your good to go. The problem lies when forming the group's more-so then when your actually IN The group. If your in the group then you can do DPS and whatever else is necessary without problems. As I said, the OP never come back to say anything else really, so I think this was more of a "rant" for them, then wanting help in finding out what the possible problem/solution might be.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;hmm, &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;Ok sounds like you were suckin up the mana ( casters always freak if they using mana) , I would say it's a " aa" issue . With only 50 ish AA's your not even close to getting defensive maxed out ,&amp;nbsp; and lets take a look how the&amp;nbsp;cleric was probibly&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; thinking&amp;nbsp; , " ok mob just killed this warrior who do it hate the most now? , yeah that cleric guy there.... loading please wait...&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;Really , you might try to get better agro weapons and or augs from don merchants , they will help you keep agro better and once folks see your not going down easly and getting casters wacked you'll never be without a group invite...also work on the aa's bro . i know too many level 70 + toons with no aa's ... not much good in higher zones..&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;Once you get at least to omans AA defensive aa's you'll start to see a differance in your damage midigation.....&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Not to pick on dawolfcyan, as there were other's like this. In the OP's post, he said&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;"My point of this post is that, at the progression I am at (Missing very few kills till EP'ed). I have been in situations where I have been "taken" out of the role I held in my group,&amp;nbsp; take for example a time in WoS,&amp;nbsp;there was a knight (SK) that could take over tanking THOUGH havnig less HP / AC then me (I was sitting at 9000hp/1500 ac, and he was sat at 8.2K/1400AC), and the cleric actually insisted to the point (was groupleader) That I stepped down as tank, and let the SK overtake, or left the group.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffff00&gt;This to me, seems rather unbalancing, when a cleric actually ask's a inferior(Hp/AC) tank, to take over tanking, when no issues were being had with other tank (Hell, we had slaughtered 3-5 nameds in WoS, before the SK came into the picture, without a problem)"&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Inferior tank to take over, not a tank with more AA's (we don't have that information, and based on the OP's post, we are led to believe that is NOT the case), just a tank that was inferior, but happened to be an SK.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I think Frodlin's post was more realistic. The cleric could be in the same guild, like SK's or Knight's period better for tanking, etc. Lot's of reason's, but nothing to lead us to believe that a knight with Less HP/AC had more AA's, and thus the warrior is not up to par.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;This day and age, your told to level, then get the AA's, so 50 or 60 AA's is not that bad at 66, unless you been playing year's with this toon.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The OP never even suggested anyone had died, in fact, they killed several name's before the SK come to the group. I doubt (HIM) sucking up mana was a big issue. Having played my cleric many times for groups in WOS, my biggest concern as far as mana, is aggro..... I don't want that monk/Beastlord or Rogue getting hit at all... So aggro is a big thing at those level's.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I would prefer a Knight at that level, because the Warrior's just aren't able to hold the aggro as fast, which is needed. I also like the fact that both knights are able to stop the mob from running away (at those levels) to fast. At 66, there is no Call of Challenge, and well..... What AA's from Oman's are you suggesting he should have?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If the Knight was around the same level, what AA's did he have that the Warrior most likely didn't have? These are question's that always come to my mind when seeing a post from someone that just assume's there was something wrong with the person playing the class, then the class itself. Warrior's are fixed for level 75, and alot better at level 70, but broken as heck from level 45 to 65, and pretty bad off in the levels of 66 to 69.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Bassically, all is well if you just level up. This is not easy for other class's to understand. You can play your Caster, healer, buffer, DPS class just fine if you emphasize your gear on what matter's most (DPS with weapons, and AA's to enhance, Healer with Healer AA's, and gear to enhance, Knight's with AA's to enhance their special skills, and gear to enhance, although moreso reliant on better all around gear then the other's). However, A Warrior get's skills after level 69 that they just do not possess at all before this level. This is a fact of the game, and warrior's although seemingly "fixed" (Dropped out of discussion's almost entirely on issue's concerning them, FOR A WHILE NOW), are broke as much as ever at lower level's, even moreso in today's game.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Just last week I was tanking in a group that had a superior Warrior in it. The reason though was because we all assumed the Warrior was a rogue (we were all glue victims ok) Worked for the best anyways cause the Warrior could focus on DPS&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Coming from you, I believe every word :-)&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;That's not the same, but the OP has not been back to verify, or post anything new.. so without farther information, no more can really be said outside of pure speculation.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;IMO if the cleric wants another tank to tank let them (the longer you argue about it, the less time you spend actually getting experience). Un-equip your aggro weapons and sit back, do some DPS, and soak up the XP. Let the other guy do the work. Just be ready to save the cleric when he can't .&lt;span&gt; :smileyvery-happy:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;My thoughts exactly.&amp;nbsp; I've now played my warrior for 6 years.&amp;nbsp; I've listened to all kinds of opinions about the class, sometimes from experienced, dedicated warriors that know their craft, but most of the time from&amp;nbsp;clowns that barely know enough about their own class to be considered competent.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;My advice to you is this.&amp;nbsp; Play your own style, play and learn your class.&amp;nbsp; If someone wants to take away your "tanking right" then let them.&amp;nbsp; It takes NOTHING away from you to be behind the mob crushing it with your best dps weapon.&amp;nbsp; You still soak up XP, don't have the pressure of worrying about keeping aggro off the healers and nukers, you can offtank when the puller (always) gets an add and the chanter eats it 'cause his mezz won't stick, and you can save the day with AET or /shield WHEN the SK dies 'cause the slower fell asleep.&amp;nbsp; Shoot I'm in a&amp;nbsp;group with another tank and he/she insists on tanking?&amp;nbsp; BONUS!!!&amp;nbsp; Time to skill up Sword and Board bashing or H2H /cackle.&amp;nbsp; Sign me up for semi-afk xp anyday :smileytongue:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;It's&amp;nbsp;ALL positive for you my furry friend!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Hey, it's not like your armor or skin gets thicker by getting beat on.&amp;nbsp; Plus it's good practice for you for raids, grabbing aggro when the Main Tank goes down (and they ALWAYS do, lol - Hi Valik).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Bottom line is HAVE FUN.&amp;nbsp; I don't regret rolling a&amp;nbsp;&lt;U&gt;real&lt;/U&gt; Tank all those years ago, and am still going strong .&amp;nbsp; Don't let the uninformed masses (they don't understant, they&amp;nbsp;don't have the secret warrior decoder ring) bring you down :)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Kawfup O'Loughee&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Tank&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;Agree'd , personaly ive said it before in an xp group as long as the cleric isnt going oom. The mobs are being killed safely, its just xp this is a time when you can work on secondary weapons skill and just relax and have fun.&amp;nbsp; Far to many folks place there entire gaming experiance on only 1 role, its nice to have some variety and to make freinds outside your own personal ego.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;Greetings all&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I just wanted to air a few things out.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Seems to me, that most discussions on this board, are refering to the HIGH end gear warriors.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;What if we for a few minutes took a look at the mid end gear warriors tanking ?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I currently have a 66 warrior with 50somthing(forgot exact amount) of AA's, and working to improve this.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I currently sit with 6.7/8K hp and around then 1300ac mark(Unbuffed)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;My point of this post is that, at the progression I am at (Missing very few kills till EP'ed). I have been in situations where I have been "taken" out of the role I held in my group,&amp;nbsp; take for example a time in WoS,&amp;nbsp;there was a knight (SK) that could take over tanking THOUGH havnig less HP / AC then me (I was sitting at 9000hp/1500 ac, and he was sat at 8.2K/1400AC), and the cleric actually insisted to the point (was groupleader) That I stepped down as tank, and let the SK overtake, or left the group.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;This to me, seems rather unbalancing, when a cleric actually ask's a inferior(Hp/AC) tank, to take over tanking, when no issues were being had with other tank (Hell, we had slaughtered 3-5 nameds in WoS, before the SK came into the picture, without a problem)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Am I the only one who has experienced this sort of happening ? Or have I just been unlucky?(Happened 6-7 times to me now)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If there is anything I can improve let me know. I have done my very best to be able to cope with handling my responsibilty as a tank, even though I am NO WAY near the high end equipment. Due to being at work (And the firewall is blocking me to get to my magelo, I will be posting it once I get home later today)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;But any feedback of what I might have been doing wrong or what I can improve, will be very much appreciated!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Well first few things Id ask is this, one how did the SK perform ? Secondly was the SK guilded with the same guild as the cleric ?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Third Was the SK higher level than you ? Because in some respects levels DO matter,&amp;nbsp; because higher level does mean there is a better chance of not taking huge damage. Anyone can tell the difference between a level 50 war and a level 70. Gets more difficult in 4 to 5 level differences. And also I know that your painting the picture of being the victum here and many folks do, but no one can be sure of the situation in a one sided discussion. I personally have been on the oppisite side of this situation. Group I knew realized I was online they had an SK of a much higher level than I was at the time.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The sk had real personality problems IE:Jerk and they decided to tell him they were all tired and going to break group. They did in fact the 2 minutes it took me to get to there location. The sk did know he was replaced by me and he probably thought that it was the groups loss, but in reality not all folks personalities match. This may have been the situation and the cleric placed whom they felt they could work with more easily in that role. This is one of hundreds of different situations it could be with the little information we have, stats matter for tanking, but not always for whom does a role.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The only real advice anyone can give is to level, but the advice i would give is to strive to be a person easy going and adaptive to situations. I group pretty regularly with SK's,PAL yes if im mt I do strive to be tanking most things, but if they tell me there bored and want to do those responsibilies. Its just xp, I ask the cleric if there ok with it sure they can do it, Pulling gets boring and were both tank classes. And it allows me time to keep myself current with pulling mobs, a skill many people should strive to learn.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;I am not trying to be negative, but I am trying to find the possible issue.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Having higher HP/AC is not the only thing needed for tanking.&amp;nbsp; Were you keeping aggro 100% of the time (meaning none of the other party member get hit at all)?&amp;nbsp; From the fact that you have 50 AA (which I think is pretty low for WoS), maybe the SK have more AAs, namely, all the defensive ones?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;From my personal experience, low end warriors are pretty broken.&amp;nbsp; It is almost impossible to keep aggro and maybe the Cleric had this in mind.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;Level up is all I can tell you. Warrior's still have most all the problem's they have always had pre 70th level.</description>

&lt;P&gt;Hi Fild,&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I think all of us are faced from time to time with discriminatory groupmates.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; In the scenario you described, there's a ton of reasons the cleric could've acted as he did, none of it having to do with you, or your abilities/playstyle/class.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Let me give some examples:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;1. He could've been friends with the SK&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;2. He could've grouped several times with the SK and become comfortable with him.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;3. He could just be a not very informed guy, or nervous or jittery about aggro, and felt better with a SK for that reason.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;There's plenty of reasons someone would choose one tank over another, and a small difference in durability isn't necessarily the only thing that folks look for.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; My advice is, keep doing your best, don't get annoyed and lash out over something like this, and go with the flow, pull out your best DPS weapons and go to town.&lt;/P&gt;</description>
