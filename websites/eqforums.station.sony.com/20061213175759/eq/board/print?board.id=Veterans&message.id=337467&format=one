Yeah, I did say that somewhere (I remember saying it, just not sure where =p). And yeah, it was more of a theoretical "everything gets upgraded eventually" than a definitive. Though, when we do phase out the LDoN augment, I'd rather it be from a quested/single group source than a raid source. You raiders don't do enough non-raid content in the game in my opinion. Plus, providing more chances for varied demographics of our game (raiders versus casuals in this case) to group up and accomplish a common goal, the better.<br><br><hr></blockquote>A) It's a time constraint for me. I raid 5 nites a week. I don't have much time for anything besides that if at least pretend that I still have a social life outside of EQ<br><br>B) Even if I find the odd hour or two where I can go out and do single group content on a weekend afternoon, I'll be more likely than not doing it with my guild mates instead of the random pickup group because the gap is so large already that I can accomplish 2x as much in a guild group than in a pickup group, or the content I'm interested in is simply too hard for the "casual" gamer. BTW, the horrible dmg/delay ratios on tss single group weapons doesn't help with mixing raiders and casuals.<br></div>
