<P>I choose not to pay for premium EQ Players, and I choose not to let that limit my gameplay.&nbsp; To be honest, although I know I'll be derided as the worst raid leader to ever enter Crushbone, I don't have time during raids to watch specific people to make sure they're doing their part well.&nbsp; Maybe other raid leaders are better at multi-tasking and I just need to work on that some more. /shrug.</P>
