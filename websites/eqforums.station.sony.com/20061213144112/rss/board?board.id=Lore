Is this true? Does this mean hes the oldest of the 3 Necro gods.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;CT -&amp;nbsp; no idea where he came from, hes not an elemental god( who were created by teh nameless right?). So who made him, is it known?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Inny -&amp;nbsp; No idea here eather.&amp;nbsp; He isnt a elemental god eather.&amp;nbsp; Has he and CT just always been around sence Nameless made the universe?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Basicly were did they come from, and whos the oldest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS any links to any pertaining lore would be appreciated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Where is this from?</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Lore&amp;message.id=12853#M12853</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Ok all you EQ and music junkies...I need your help. I love the EQ music. And while I don't like EQ2, I will admit, the music in EQ2 is much better than EQ Live. In fact that's one of the disappointing things about EQ Live, the music. A few expansions (namely GoD, DoN, PoR and TSS) have some decent music, such as Natimbi or Crescent Reach, but overall, the music is no good.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;However, we all remember being in Greater Faydark with the beautiful Kelethin music playing. I just love the nostalgia it brings. Now, with EQ2's new Echoes of Faydwer expansion out, there is a new Kelethin song, and it's BEAUTIFUL. Well, this brought me back to a previous mystery, that I have yet to solve...&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Ya know those special places in EQ Live that we visit that have great little songs? Such as the Cobalt Scar merchants, Kelethin and the shore of the river in the Karanas? Well, I came across a midi site with lots of EQ files....&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;A href="http://www.laurasmidiheaven.com/0vg/PC-Everquest.shtml" target=_blank&gt;http://www.laurasmidiheaven.com/0vg/PC-Everquest.shtml&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;About halfway down there is a song called *Mystery*. It's clearly a version of Kelethin. Is it in the game? or is this a remake by someone? If I'm not mistaken, I'm sure I've heard it in the game before, just not sure where. Any ideas?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <title>Saryrn Lore</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Lore&amp;message.id=12802#M12802</link>
      <description>Does anyone know a bit about how Saryrn came to be? As a relatively&#xD;
minor deity with few or no followers in Norrath, it's a bit difficult&#xD;
to drudge up any lore about her. From searching the forums a bit I've&#xD;
gathered from many posts that she was once a a human Priestess of&#xD;
Erolissi who ascended to Godhood. How and when did this happen, and why&#xD;
is her chosen sphere of influence so radically different than her&#xD;
passions as a former worshipper of E. Marr? Did she have the help of&#xD;
another deity to ascend, since that seems to happen frequently? I'd&#xD;
also like to know a bit more about her personal role in the Planes of&#xD;
Power progression story, as I've never spent much time in Torment, much&#xD;
less raided Saryrn herself. Any information would be greatly&#xD;
appreciated.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

      <title>Priests of Order?</title>

      <description>So I saw a Priest of Discord today, sure just like anyother day I just ran by. Accept I got this thought, "if he's of discord, then what is my puppet?" Obvious answer is a priest of order, now from off the top of my head there are spell names for clerics such as "Chaos Censure" and what not that do represent order. However, is there anything out there that shows that a cleric is to represent "order?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Dieties: How do their blood, skin(scales), and possessions(hammers, etc,) change Norrath?</title>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Ok in an effort to try and tie in the story lines, I thought it might be valuable for us to compile a list of all dieties and what associations have been made with the use of their blood(or scales, or anything belongings).&amp;nbsp; Please feel free to go back in the lore as far as possible.&amp;nbsp; I feel that if we can go back as far as we can and work our way forward we can start to answer some of our questions from the other threads we have started.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;1.&amp;nbsp; Sol Ro's blood: dries up forests, raises mountains(or did Sol Ro perform that act himself), and did I not also read that it corruptted some of the Tunarian Priests changing the color of their eyes??? &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Again, still a work in progress, but I think with these three entries (Blightfire, Stillmoon, and Stoneroot) people have a good idea of what I'm working on here :). I won't be adding any more for public consumption yet but I appreciate and encourage all the feedback so far. The actual site itself should be active and up some time before the end of the year, and while it will still be incomplete, I am hoping that it will provide one of EQ's more comprehensive and interesting lore sites. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>Veeshan, Prexus, Brell, rulers of "areas", not so much the elements of air/water/earth like the elemental gods, but the areas of the sky, sea, and underground and the creatures that live in them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Where are they? These gods seem pretty important, creating a lot of the life on Norrath, but I haven't seen them mentioned at all lately. Where have they been? Why haven't their planes been implemented?*&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*I don't consider PoSky Veeshan's plane, it seems more like they needed a zone, so they took the guide zone and slapped a good name on it, it doesn't seem to have too much relation to Veeshan except for a couple mobs (go ahead and show me the links if there are some, I have no idea.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Other Sporali Colonies?</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Lore&amp;message.id=12655#M12655</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;While reading "&lt;A href="http://www3.telus.net/canticlestower/Sporali.htm" target=_blank&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;A treastise on the Sporali by Canticle, Necromancer Emeritus of House al-Nasir&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/A&gt;" it struck me that I had seen examples of fungal creatures in other locations beyond Darkhollow, Innothule, Runnyeye Citadel, Guk, and Old Sebilis.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The example that I recall most clearly is that of the &lt;A href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=3442" target=_blank&gt;Mortuary Fungus&lt;/A&gt; of Unrest.&amp;nbsp; They are the only example of fungal people on Faydwer that I know of.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;A planar example would be the &lt;A href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=13466" target=_blank&gt;mushroom men&lt;/A&gt; found in the plane of mischief.&amp;nbsp; Perhaps the sporali are creations of Bristlebane...&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Also, do the various fungal creatures on Luclin have any relationship to the sporali on Norrath?&amp;nbsp; I thought others out there might know of other fungal creatures I may have missed, and also I thought this might be an interesting topic to discuss.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Dawgrin on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;11-07-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;09:14 AM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;This is currently in the working stages, but depending on response it may be going live some time soon, I was wanting the Lore Community to take a look at let me know if this would be something of interest. It's obviously in the working stages (and I've got nothing up at the moment but the sample page and it's my personal webspace, so please, try not to abuse it horribly), but I'd appreciate any feedback on the format, content and information. The intent is to provide a site as written by a scholar of Norrath (and as such, it will contain some opinion, conjecture and bias, the core lore that opinion, conjecture and bias is based entirely on in game sources)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;A few things on page design:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I'm using FrontPage 2003. Professionals mock all you want but I'm used to it, and it speeds up the process for me.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The font used on the site is 'Papyrus'. If you don't have it loaded, I'd like to know what the page looks like.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I'm going for a low bandwidth intensive approach, nothing fancy. I'm a minimalist that way.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV align=justify&gt;&#xD;
&lt;CENTER&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/CENTER&gt;&#xD;
&lt;CENTER&gt;&lt;B&gt;I have posted this before butdecided to post it again due to the recent discussion about the nameleess and its creations. Is this exactly how it happeneed.. no i dont think so ,but it does suggest that the we dont have the precise story of the creation of norrath.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/CENTER&gt;&#xD;
&lt;CENTER&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/CENTER&gt;&#xD;
&lt;CENTER&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/CENTER&gt;&#xD;
&lt;CENTER&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/CENTER&gt;&#xD;
&lt;CENTER&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/CENTER&gt;&#xD;
&lt;CENTER&gt;&lt;B&gt;Creation of Norrath&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/CENTER&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;In the beginning, all that existed was void. Empty of all, whether it be time or space. A vast and endless nothingness cloaked in a deep and all consuming silence. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Within this void existed "The Nameless", a power so incredible that in the entire universe, it knew only itself to exist. It had no idea why it was there, just that that it was. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In the quiet expanse of the void, it sent itself out and searched the void to find something different. And there it was, a pocket of space and therein lay the flow of time. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When The Nameless stepped into the space, something terrible but wonderful, something terrifying but exciting happened. It detected the elements of space and time. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The Nameless, knowing nothing of these things, freed what was in there so it could spread out in all directions, filling the space that had been empty for so long with a force that had no boundaries. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Forces touched each other and the emptiness filled with swirling energies, light and heat touched emptiness. Energies collided and crashed, were born and died and became new and different... none of those having been seen ever before started to form planets that differed in size and structure. Also created were stars to watch over this new creation. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;But the whole chaos needed order, shaping and fine touch. And so the Nameless created The Gods of Power. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;To do so, The Nameless reached into the chaos, drew forth four equal portions of the stuff of existence and shaped it into the Gods that would divide the universe into form. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The first was named Rathe and got the task of bringing order into the chaos. It saw that the task was indeed immense, so it reached into itself and divided into 12 equal parts. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Then The Rathe went into the chaos divided some more material and created Earth. This Earth got set under the eyes of the Nameless, under the stars, so it could watch over his cosmos. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The second was named Fennin Ro and received the task of shaping the chaos. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Fennin as well drew his portion and named it Fire. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;He then placed it upon the stars to shed light on the cosmos. Fennin Ro helped The Rathe to shape the solid matter and gave warmth to the cold of chaos. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The third was named Water and The Nameless determined it would need many forms. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;So it took the portion and split it into three. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Tarew Marr would be responsible for the main state of the element, the Water, E'Ci for the solid state; the Ice and Povar would lord over steam. These three took their portion and cloaked each world with its life giving touch. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;And finally the fourth was named Xegony and she received the task of drawing away the material in-between and setting each thing in its place. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;She used her portion of chaos to make it into Air, which she used to blow the chaos away and cushion each world from the harshness of the cold cosmos. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The Nameless then looked into its new creation and felt sorrow because it could not experience it, for the creation could not contain the Nameless and so it decided to find a way to explore this new existence. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;So the Nameless called out to the Gods of Power and commanded them to make minions that it could share in their experience of this new world. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Each of the Gods of Power reached into their elemental planes and drew forth a portion that they shaped with their will into what would be eyes and hands for The Nameless and themselves. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;They created beings of energy, much like themselves, but beings of will born of the matter of the cosmos. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The Gods of Power knew that balance must be maintained in the universe to keep its shape. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Therefore they started to create the Gods of Influence in the model of a scale, on one side a force of darkness or destruction, on the other side a force of light or creation and ...in the middle, a neutral or balancing force to maintain the balance without the involvement of the Gods of Power. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;And so they combined their elements to create each God in turn, good, neutral and evil, which the children of Norrath may choose to follow until the end of times.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;

      <title>Those Eq2ers....</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Lore&amp;message.id=12563#M12563</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;so was poking around on the Eq2 lore boards and was suprised to see misinfinformation about Eq1 being spread by some guy by the name Kyvthuhlu...(Hmm that name seems familiar)....I saw he posted this little ditty on thier lore boards:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
-Full (prefferably) coimprehensive story of Lanys T'Vyl &#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Cliffed notes version:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;OL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Born as daughter of Innoruuk and one of his priestesses. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Raised under the careful training of Laarthik K`Shin. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Envied by Naythox Thex who had always wanted a more secular Neriak and sees her as a center piece for Cristanos to "religiousize" the city. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Raised an army with the promise of conquering Highpass in order to dictate trade, commerce, and passage through Antonica. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Holds a great deal of jealousy for Firiona Vie. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Firiona Vie met her on the battlefield in Kithicor Forest under the guise of "protecting Highpass" - when in truth it was more or less the High Elves wanting a chance to bloody the Dark Elves. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Battle rages, Dark Elves losing, Laarthik K`Shin uses his Blue Orb to summon Innoruuk to the battle, who kidnaps Lanys. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Laarthik is killed. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Lanys T`Vyl resurfaces under mysterious circumstances and takes up the ancient Takish-Hiz fortress of Befallen as her headquarters.&amp;nbsp; Using her cult, the Primordial Malice, she plans to continue her campaign to kill Firiona, and take over Neriak. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Fails, her body is destroyed, Primordial Malice is hunted down and ousted from Neriak. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Nowhere knows where she is now.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Seems the enrite Dreadland war and Firiona Vie battles never took place in our game! nor the Dark Reign / Dragons of Norrath expansion, or the attempted conversion? of the King of the Dark Elves! Eq1 history ended in 2002 to them Eq2ers! &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Oh and Lanys never "took up residence" in Befallen, she was "dead" and being punished in Hate by her father at that time, the whole Primordial Malice cult was an attempt by her followers to resurect Lanys and return her to the Mortal World, she never had any direct influence on them.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <title>TSS Lore//Final Fights??</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Lore&amp;message.id=12561#M12561</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Alright, I'm curious from reading all the Lore in game if I have figured out a rough idea of who the final fights are for Ashengate and Frostcrypt. First, it is true that TSS has two end game zones, each of them supposedlly to be equal to eachother with final fights. At least, that is how I am understanding things to this point.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;With regards to Ashengate, I feel there is two possible&amp;nbsp;creatures that could be the final fight. Those are Lord Lethar and Dyn'Leth. When you read the lore, it sounds like, to me,&amp;nbsp;you may have to fight the four other Scale Guardians to "unlock" the ability to enter an instanced version of Ashengate wherein lies either Dyn'Leth or Lord Lethar or on the off chance, both. I mean, all dragons across Norrath could be "controlled" by Dyn'Leth who has the power of Veeshan's scale. This could place Dyn'Leth at the front of any assumption as to an end game mob. But, Lord Lethar placed Dyn'Leth as his second in command in essence. It just really feels like, to me, that one of these two or both of them will be the last two fights for Ashengate.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;With regards to Frostcrypt, there seems to be a lot of speculation over this zone though. Again, two mobs come into mind as the possible end game mobs for this zone. Rallos Zek and Beltar (Spelling?) the Shade King. I really can't say how this zone will pan out though. My guess is as good as anyone elses at this point. Could it be you fight the Shade King first and then Rallos Zek is angered that you destroyed his pawn in killing the frost giants that live in Frostcrypt? Or, it is only the Shade King that you fight to finish off this zone? Everyone is putting the focus on Rallos Zek as a end game boss. Consider this, Rallos Zek has already been seen in two different zones already, Tactics and Time. Why would Sony want to put him as a raid target AGAIN? That just makes no sense to me at all.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Well, if anyone else has any ideas on this topic... Please drop a post and MAYBE we can figure something out about the final end game fights for The Serpant's Spine.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>Who is/was Osh`vir according to TSS lore?</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Lore&amp;message.id=12548#M12548</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I only played beta so don't know the entire storyline behind the expansion but who was this guy Osh`vir?&amp;nbsp; So far a few items bear his name and they are pretty decent&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800080&gt;&lt;A href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=53414" target=_blank&gt;http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=53414&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;A href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=53412" target=_blank&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;A href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=53407" target=_blank&gt;http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=53407&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;First time in all of EQ I think 2 different class lines of armor have the same name on them so the guy must have been someone really important hehe.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
