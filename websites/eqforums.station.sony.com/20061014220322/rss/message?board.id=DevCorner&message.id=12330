    <description>Hi everyone&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;As you may know I've been at fan faire for most of a week but now that I'm back I'm&#xD;
deep in the pathing system which is where I was when I left. Well I did take a little while this morning&#xD;
to organize my notes from FF about various code things we need to look&#xD;
into but after that I started getting back to pathing.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;Here's the current plan with pathing:&lt;br&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Figure out what's wrong&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Figure out options that will solve the problems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Extract the current pathing system into a standalone project (a 'static library' for the technical types) and modify the zone server to use this reorganized form of the current code. This will allow me to do focused unit testing on the system, as well as easily swap between the current code and new code should any problems come up later.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have QA confirm that step 3 didn't change the behavior of the system, bugs and all.&amp;nbsp; This is done on my personal dev box to isolate Test server from major problems before we put it there.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Put the reorganized code on test. Note there aren't going to be any actual fixes at this time, just reorganized code to allow fixed to be done in an isolated, modular manner.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Implement changes that solve the problems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Put the fixes on my dev box and have QA check things out there. Work with them until known issues are solved.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Put the code on test.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br&gt;So where am I now with all this? I've been working on it with most of my time here at work for a while now, and here's the checklist:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) I believe I understand the problems at this point. I did find one major bug that was a big part of why warping occurs, but we're going to not only fix the bug but also make general improvements which we believe will substantially reduce the zone's CPU load due to pathing while also improving the end result. Not a bad deal, assuming we're right. I am optimistic at this point.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) If you've followed the threads you have seen the options discussed so I'll just get to what has been decided. Pathing will be implemented such that searches will be a series of smaller searches, each with a search budget smaller than what it is today. This will cause search failures to not stall the zone as NPCs burn huge amounts of time for no solution. They will follow their partial solution until they determine they are stuck. When this happens, the NPC will warp somewhere between the target and the NPC and the NPC will be guaranteed to reach the target from this warp location. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3) I finished the extraction before I left for fanfaire and had my server tested by QA while I was gone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4) Today I was able to get confirmation that everything works as it did before in this newly reorganized setup.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;5) We haven't put this code on test yet, I just got confirmation a few minutes ago. I need to update various people before we can do that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;6) I had implemented some of the fixes before the reorganization, but the invasive nature of the fixes is what prompted me to extract the pathing system into a module. I reverted my fixes before doing the code extraction, but I saved a copy of the changes to allow me to go through and put them in again which is a lot easier than doing it from scratch. When I was testing these changes before, I had to do some pretty extreme stuff to get any warps to occur at all. Like fly around outside the world. Not saying that it's perfect, but it was much much improved and I didn't see any problems with warping at all. There are a few things that need to be done in addition to what I already experimented with but I've already seen it work well enough that I'm confident it will make a huge improvement when it's done.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;7) I'm about to start putting the fixes on my dev box. I need to get the current code prepped for Test server and checked in before I can do that though.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;8) Going to be a while before we get to the point of putting the actual fixes on Test, probably a week or two is my guess. There are just too many things to regress to expect it any sooner.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyways, hope this helps answer any questions people may have or concerns that it's not being worked on. It's definitely being worked on actively both by myself and the QA department to make sure we get it right.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cheers,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I used tracking, "/pet attack &amp;lt;mob name&amp;gt;", charm mobs, and summon pet to bring all of the mobs from below ground to&amp;nbsp;the surface&amp;nbsp;and and killed them all.&amp;nbsp; It's a slow and tedious process and require a bot army.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The mobs respawned above ground okay at first.&amp;nbsp; But I came back two hours later after an afk break, some of the respawns have already pathed underground again.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;I know that KC is renowned for bad pathing, but the last couple days with an alt there - you can get a med break in the time between the mob entering the foyer and actually reaching the group by the ZI.&amp;nbsp; Back and forth and back and forth.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Lots of mobs in lots of zones cannot path reliably from pull to target.&amp;nbsp; I had a bad repop while kiting another mob in the undead side of the nest last night.&amp;nbsp; I was kiting one mob far up a hallway, which is where the new mob popped.&amp;nbsp; When I ran&amp;nbsp;back the length of the hallway and around a&amp;nbsp;corner (180 degree corner U turn up another hall), the popped mob met me head-on in the &lt;EM&gt;other&lt;/EM&gt; hallway.&amp;nbsp; Surprise!&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Bumping this thread, 2 atttmpts last night on Performer in DP of Blood. Both at about the 17 minute mark we got 6 zone adds in addition to the 4 normal adds. This is a commonly reported but, wondering when you will get&amp;nbsp; to work on fixing it?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;Yet again, we wipe to performer cause pathing is screwed up big time.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Half the zone came running in at 17 min mark.&amp;nbsp; Fix this please.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This is getting reduclous.</description>

&lt;P&gt;3 nights in a row.&amp;nbsp; Every mob dead each wave minus 4 orcs mez'd and at 19 minutes yet agian half the zone comes in and wipes us.&amp;nbsp; This is hardly fun at all.&amp;nbsp; Fix this.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; We got 2 WW's at the start, which we killed off and still had nearly everything dead, but near the end we got at least 30 mobs from the entire hallway and ballroom on us.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Despawn the mobs in the basement/hallway or something.&amp;nbsp; Or give them a long respawn and we'll just kill them off.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; But some of them respawn in less time than the event runs or close to it.&amp;nbsp; Gargoyles at door,&amp;nbsp; the roaming orcs, etc.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Jaradis-Twiggie-SR on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;07-25-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;11:43 PM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;We were doing that, the problem was one of a few things:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;1)&amp;nbsp; The mobs will sometimes path back out the door after charging in initially, if that roamer orc is out there, he'll path all the way around the hallway bringing the entire ballroom and hallway in on you.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;2)&amp;nbsp; Gating mobs....&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;[Tue Jul 25 23:26:32 2006] an angry Drachnid Gates.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Yes, an event mob gated out into the hallway, which would have agro'd everything out there.&amp;nbsp; Luckily we cleared the entire hallway.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;For now, we are just clearing the entire ballroom and hallway.&amp;nbsp; We leave the Gargoyles up till we are ready then charge in and kill them, then start up event.&amp;nbsp; That gives us 29 mins before Garg respawn, and 90 mins before hallway respawn.&amp;nbsp; So if you fail first attempt you can clear Gargs, then go again.&amp;nbsp; After that you will need to reclear the hallway again most likely.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;After 3 nights of wiping due to bugs we just cleared the entire ballroom/hallway area first and beat it easily with 52 standing at the end and only 8 or 9 mobs alive (5 orcs + spiders/Spinstress).&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;So I just suggest that anyone doing this event take the 10 extra minutes to clear the entire area around this event to be safe.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Not only are the mobs still going back and forth several times before coming into camp, but snared mobs that have been pulled beyond group aggro range are not coming to the puller until they return to spawn &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;In Halls of Honor, The Nest, Akheva Ruins, Rift Seeker’s Sanctum, and spell missions Tak 1 and 69.2 (areas I have seen this over and over), snared mobs with aggro still wander back to spawn points before re-approaching the puller. By then, they have picked up all the mobs that the puller has been trying to split them from. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;This isn’t a plea for risk-free pulling – to split the snared mob, I am often timing a feign death to a second or less to draw the snared mob far enough away to be split. That has to be timed in the face of multiple heavy-hitting mobs sometimes approaching at a fast speed. It’s very frustrating to work a mob out with 2 or 3 of these feign pulls just to watch it meander back to the spawn point and bring friends. This usually happens on what should be the last feign &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The rooms in the Accused Nest are nearly unsplittable solo.&amp;nbsp; As soon as the snared mob is drawn out of aggro range of its mates, it returns to “tag up” at home base before proceeding after the puller. It’s not that I’ve lost agro, because as soon as it gets close every mob in the area comes running (and sometimes warping) to me. After touching its spawn point, the snared mob comes, too. It returns to the spawn point even if I land a spell on it as it walks back. I don’t have a problem with splitting being hard, and I don’t mind that I don’t shed aggro as easily as a monk or bard puller. What I have a problem with is after several near-death experiences to work a mob out of aggro range, the effort is wasted because the mob heads back to base instead of coming on the pull &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;These pathing problems are not limited to new or even newer zones.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Figure out what's wrong&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Figure out options that will solve the problems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Extract&#xD;
the current pathing system into a standalone project (a 'static&#xD;
library' for the technical types) and modify the zone server to use&#xD;
this reorganized form of the current code. This will allow me to do&#xD;
focused unit testing on the system, as well as easily swap between the&#xD;
current code and new code should any problems come up later.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have&#xD;
QA confirm that step 3 didn't change the behavior of the system, bugs&#xD;
and all.&amp;nbsp; This is done on my personal dev box to isolate Test server&#xD;
from major problems before we put it there.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Put the reorganized&#xD;
code on test. Note there aren't going to be any actual fixes at this&#xD;
time, just reorganized code to allow fixed to be done in an isolated,&#xD;
modular manner.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Implement changes that solve the problems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Put the fixes on my dev box and have QA check things out there. Work with them until known issues are solved.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Put the code on test.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;Answer to 1 is simple pathing in almost every zone that has roaming mobs on a long path is completely borked.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Answer to 2 is just as simple. Remove the dx9c release and revert back to dx9. Then once you've followed through with the rest of the trouble shooting Actually adhere to 8 and put the code on test and make sure it works.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don't mean to be a smart ass here but it's that simple. We had the same issue for the dx9 release, only in addition to borking gameplay it rendered lots of people unable to play. Pathing had issues prior to dx9c but they were fairly isolated in that they occoured occasionally. Dx9c has now made it pretty much an across the board thing. And you cannot expect us to believe that it was placed on test for any reasonable length of time. The first day this was released there were complaints about it (because it's happening almost everywhere). I know a few people who play regularly on test and they aren't stupid, so Either you need a lot more people on test server or you need to actually listen when they complain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It really is that simple. And that's far better then ramroding the people on play servers to be forced to play beta releases.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Don't get me wrong. I support change. The graphics today look a thousand times better then they did in 2000 when I started. And I even liked the first release of dx9c because I could actually run to the pok main bank when an mgb orgy was going on and not have any lag but then with the first patch for the patch I got my lag back so at this point the release is useless to me. Change is good but only after you have stress tested it and made sure it works rather then just throwing it live and waiting for the complaints.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And if you want more people on test trying things out then you need to allow them to actually copy their toons there. I'm sure the players on test will have issues with this but the fact is I cannot accurately test something if I have no comparison. I'm not going to go through and lvl my toon up to where my main is now and allowing people to testbuff to 70 would be stupid. Allowing them to clone their toons with gear etc would allow them to do the things they do on live servers, on test and they can actually compare the results and give informed opinions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the endurance deal was released we were "invited" to come check it out on test. So myself and a warrior friend did that. 1 problem, We could only testbuff to 20 or 25. So we weren't able to check out squat past the fail messages for taunt.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you were to allow "cloning" then you must allow test players to complain about peoples actions and follow them up. If a cloned player is creating issues then they are banned from cloning anymore toons to test. Course many of the people I know on test have stated they did inform soe of the problems and it was ignored.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Tanise on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;07-17-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;10:30 AM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Hatchet has a very "WoW"ish pathing, ie, if you strafe at&#xD;
certain points he will turn around, run back to some checkpoint and&#xD;
then come rushing at you once again. We noticed it more by misstake and&#xD;
frustration during both the chase part and the trapping part trying to&#xD;
trap him, but it's quite probable that strafing back will cause him to&#xD;
once again run to the checkpoint, creating a "WoW"ish crowdcontrol&#xD;
measure, where pathing is so bad you can control a mob indefintly by&#xD;
strafing back and forth. That &lt;i&gt;could&lt;/i&gt; completely trivialise the&#xD;
chase part of the fight if someone would find out which area or&#xD;
movements causes this disruption in movement. However, the more&#xD;
annoying part that everyone faces is when he goes running back as you&#xD;
try to trap him, leading him to occationally become rooted far away.&lt;br&gt;He&#xD;
also sometimes refuses to follow someone running to fast (ie, has the&#xD;
blockers) and instead takes a (rather admitedly) more clever path,&#xD;
making kiting him a semi prayer that you don't run over one of the&#xD;
points that will make him switch heading. The fight should be easier&#xD;
with blockers, not harder, aye?&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Pathing in Dreadspire is completly destroyed. Also in Demiplane. Illsalin is sucking pretty hardcore now also.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Example one - Mobs from the Dining Room (Performers room) are some how warping to devlins room and wandering around there. This is in Dreadspire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Example two - In demiplane in the Performers room. Mobs randomly run out and path all the way around training TONS of mobs mid event. Its so annoying and unneccessary,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Example three - In Illsalin some mobs randomly run out the room and up the stairs at the Clergyman camp. It runs all the way back to the room with all its friends and trains us. Also unneccessary and annoying.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pathing was SO MUCH BETTER BEFORE YOU TRIED TO FIX IT. Nothing like this happened to me pre - pathing fixes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I seriously think this needs to be looked into.</description>
