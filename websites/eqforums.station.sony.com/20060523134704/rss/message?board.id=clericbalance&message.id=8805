&lt;P&gt;really? you think adding 72ac that is affected by soft caps for 550mana is useful or anything other than a waste of time?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I mean, if it were like shield ac and always had its full value, I could see a point to it, even if its a small total amount of ac, but since the caps affect it, i dont see any value at all.&amp;nbsp; for a cleric, its a non-parsable diffrence, as well as any other main tank except the most poor, who dont even have decent bazaar gear.&amp;nbsp; it has some minor value to casters I suppose if they havent managed to cap as well.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I would honestly be suprised to see any parse that shows its anything more than maybe a .5% diffrence.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I've read through the posts on the board, and have seen a few posts about our ac buff. None of them seem to get much attention. We asked for our ac line to be added to our symbol line, but that was turned down. I've had a few ideas about the buff myself that I would like to share, and, I would also like to get some feedback from other clerics about it. Including or not including the rest of the post, I would like to see a&amp;nbsp;group version of these spells as well.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;(I want to say here that I still do not fully understand "ac softcaps". I have heard so many differing opinions, seen 2 viable tests that have shown completely opposite results, and various other things. It makes sense to some but not to me. From what I do understand, is that there is a point for all classes, where there is a diminishing return on ac over a certain point. I do not know the exact numbers, but they don't matter in my example. Let's say an int caster caps at 1100, priests cap at 1300, most melee cap at 1500, and tank classes cap at 1700. I know the numbers are off, so bear with me. These numbers are not accurate, nor are they real. Also, I have come to believe that some classes get less on the diminishing returns. Say a warrior over his cap get the benefit of 1 ac for every 2 points of ac shown. But a caster may only get the benefit of 1 ac for every 5 points shown. Again, these are not real statistics, but given as an example to prove my point. This is just what I have come to believe from reading various parses, posts, and such on many boards from many people. If all of these are not true, then, there is no reason to look at these buffs.)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The issue I have about the buff is that most of the times when I cast it, it doesn't have&amp;nbsp;anywhere near&amp;nbsp;the full effect. What I mean by this, is that in almost every case that I cast this buff on someone, they are at the effective ac "softcap". So the returns of ac of the spell are lowered. Ward of Valiance gives 72 ac. On a warrior that is at his effective cap, this&amp;nbsp;may only net him 36 ac benefit. But for a caster at their effective cap, this would only net them a 14 ac benefit. If there are cases where a buff has less of an effect on certain players than it should, I believe that buff should be looked at. If a hit point buff were to give less hit points to someone over a certain amount, that would be unacceptable. Case in point, shaman statistic buffs, and a druids strength buff. Shaman were upset that they got a range of buffs that had small to no effect, because most people were capped in that stat. Those buffs were changed to give modifiers that would have been upgraded had the stat been raised, or they raised the cap of the stat. This is what I would like to see happen to our ac buff. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;My first idea was to make this buff like the shaman stamina line, and effectively raise the cap for whoever it was cast on, as well as give the ac. Talisman of Fortitude raises stamina by 75, and raises the stamina cap by 40. Ward of Valiance raising ac by 72 and raising the cap by 50 or the full amount would make this spell beneficial for any it was cast on. If they were under the ac cap, they would get the full 72 effect. If they were over the cap, they would still get the benefit of most or all of the spell. In the case of it raising the cap by 50, a warrior would get the benefit of 66 ac, while a caster would get the benefit of 54 ac. Raising the full amount of the ac would seem fairest to me, but, I doubt that would be allowed. :)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Another idea I had was to add a modification to the spell, like the shamans&amp;nbsp;chance to avoid melee, or increasing a skill modifier. Because this spell mitigation and not avoidance, I wouldn't ask for anything avoidance related be added to it. However perhaps a small melee shielding aspect, perhaps 2% or&amp;nbsp;5%. Since we already have the vie line of spells, this wouldn't be adding anything new to our repertoire, and would add the same benefit to everyone.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;These are just a few of the ideas I would like to see happen to our ac buff. I would also like to see input from other clerics about this, as well as a possible developer input. Please keep this thread to discussion about the spell and it's effect only. I don't want to see any arguments about how we need better mitigation, or how they need to raise our softcaps, as those are all discussed in depth in other threads. Thank you.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;AC softcaps don't reduce the amount of visual AC you get from a buff. What they reduce is the effect the AC has. If I cast a 72ac buff on myself, it shows a 72 ac increase on my inventory screen. However, since I am over my softcap, the effect off that buff is more like 18 ac in terms of damage reduced.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Why your Ac buff is giving less than 72 ac is beyond me. Perhaps it is a stacking issue with Tribute, or something along those lines.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Hrm, did I suggest the visual ac was lowered? I didn't mean that if I did. I was talking about the benefit of the ac over the cap, not the actual numbers.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
