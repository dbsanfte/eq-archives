of Norrath are four spirits, each attuned to one of the four elements. He is to&#xD;
find these spirits and subdue them at any cost to tap out their power into one&#xD;
of four special jewels he carries. The problem presented is that these spirits&#xD;
haven't survived the ages challenging any force that passes them. The spirits&#xD;
will only fight those willing to face them in fair combat. Thus A Dark Stranger&#xD;
will only take with him five whom he deems worthy upon his quest to face the&#xD;
spirits.” – Hrrm... Want to know more? March 24&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;. You know the&#xD;

when she gets older. A gang of nefarious goblins have kidnapped you and sold&#xD;
you to the Orcs to slave in their mines. Fortunately you managed to escape and&#xD;
find your way back home. Retell the story of your escape to your friend.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;b&gt;RESPONDANT SAID:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;As I ate my stew in earnest, I could see her study me out of the corner of my&#xD;
eye. I knew what she was thinking. But, I would feel better if she announced it&#xD;
on her own. "Ok. I can't take this. You are filthy, Dolly, and you're&#xD;
starving! Even for a Dwarf!" She continued to stare at me with her sky&#xD;
blue eyes. Eyes only a half elf can have. I carefully set my spoon down and&#xD;
began to fiddle with a loose string of her table cloth. When she frowned at me,&#xD;
waiting for an answer, I sighed and let my hands drop to my lap. Taking another&#xD;
deep breath I began, "Ok, I will tell you all that happened. I was&#xD;
practicing my stances with a stick when I heard noises-" Liz cleared her&#xD;
throat, "I hope you weren't where you weren't supposed to be. I know you.&#xD;
No matter how many times you tell me that you know what you are doing, you get&#xD;
in trouble. A week later you are here! Tattered and dirty. With leaves that I&#xD;
know are not common in the forest I live in. You were at the forbidden pond in&#xD;
the dark wood, weren't you?" She was right. Liz is always right. Human&#xD;
intelligence and Elven wisdom combined to make her. I realized her eyes were&#xD;
glowing and I knew with a start she was looking at me through infrared. She&#xD;
could see my heart beating faster. I swallowed and worked my tongue. "Yes,&#xD;
Liz. I was practicing stances when I heard a noise, when I looked behind me, I&#xD;
was ambushed. One of them hit me on the head and I blacked out." I touched&#xD;
the tender spot on my head where the club found a fancy to strike me.&#xD;
"What else?", Liz's eyes were beginning to soften, but she was still&#xD;
going to present me to the Elder for my being-where-I'm-not-supposed-to. Liz was&#xD;
fifty years older than me. She raised me when my parents died. A definite life&#xD;
friend. A friend to keep away the trouble and invite it at the same time.&#xD;
"They sold me to some Orcs and-" Liz's eyes were hard again. Under&#xD;
that gaze my mouth went dry. I had to work my tongue to get some moisture&#xD;
before I could continue. We both hated Orcs. Orcs were responsible for her tribe’s&#xD;
death and my parents murder. Being an experienced woodswoman, she, with my&#xD;
help, ensured the safety of the nearby villages. I respected and feared her, with&#xD;
good reason. Once I had enough spit, I continued, "The goblins sold me to&#xD;
the Orcs for a slave. The Orcs were traveling with a new caravan of slaves for&#xD;
their mines. When I got there, they put a pick in my hands and worked me till&#xD;
my hand were raw, then made me work some more." My hands are bandaged.&#xD;
"If they saw you sleep or sneak something to eat before it was time to eat&#xD;
there, the slave drivers whipped you." They fed you slop made of other&#xD;
slaves that died from exertion and sickness, seasoned with leftovers of the&#xD;
Orcs dinners and rancid mushrooms. If you were lucky enough to catch cave bugs,&#xD;
they gave you enough energy to last another hour or two. "When it was time&#xD;
to sleep, the Orcs were impressed with my strength and let me sleep with only&#xD;
ropes holding me bound. I managed to use a nearby sharp piece of rock to cut&#xD;
loose when everyone else was asleep. "The watchers that were standing&#xD;
guard overlooked me as just wiggling from uncomfortable." I grunted a&#xD;
humorless chuckle and continued. "The Orcs were careless and left one pick&#xD;
untouched nearby. I waited 'till the guard finished his round and started to go&#xD;
switch out for some sleep. While they were making the change, I darted for the&#xD;
pick with as little sound as possible, the way you taught me. "A new guard&#xD;
was just now taking his place, but he still had sleep in his eyes. He didn't&#xD;
see me until the last minute that I put the pick through his skull." It&#xD;
was Liz's turn to grunt. She picked up her mug and studied the black coffee in&#xD;
it, waiting for me to continue. "I managed to gather a little food for the&#xD;
trip back here. It took me longer than I thought. I misjudged the lay of the&#xD;
land, and ran out of food the third day..." I ended my story frowning at&#xD;
my stew. Remembering the cut off shriek of the Orc I killed. Feeling his warm&#xD;
blood, I lost my appetite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr size="2" width="100%"&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;

brings with him a mandate from the wizard whom he serves. Dormant in the lands&#xD;
of Norrath are four spirits, each attuned to one of the four elements. He is to&#xD;
find these spirits and subdue them at any cost to tap out their power into one&#xD;
of four special jewels he carries. The problem presented is that these spirits&#xD;
haven't survived the ages challenging any force that passes them. The spirits&#xD;
will only fight those willing to face them in fair combat. Thus A Dark Stranger&#xD;

when she gets older. A gang of nefarious goblins have kidnapped you and sold&#xD;
you to the Orcs to slave in their mines. Fortunately you managed to escape and&#xD;
find your way back home. Retell the story of your escape to your friend.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;b&gt;RESPONDANT SAID:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;As I ate my stew in earnest, I could see her study me out of the corner of my&#xD;
eye. I knew what she was thinking. But, I would feel better if she announced it&#xD;
on her own. "Ok. I can't take this. You are filthy, Dolly, and you're&#xD;
starving! Even for a Dwarf!" She continued to stare at me with her sky&#xD;
blue eyes. Eyes only a half elf can have. I carefully set my spoon down and&#xD;
began to fiddle with a loose string of her table cloth. When she frowned at me,&#xD;
waiting for an answer, I sighed and let my hands drop to my lap. Taking another&#xD;
deep breath I began, "Ok, I will tell you all that happened. I was&#xD;
practicing my stances with a stick when I heard noises-" Liz cleared her&#xD;
throat, "I hope you weren't where you weren't supposed to be. I know you.&#xD;
No matter how many times you tell me that you know what you are doing, you get&#xD;
in trouble. A week later you are here! Tattered and dirty. With leaves that I&#xD;
know are not common in the forest I live in. You were at the forbidden pond in&#xD;
the dark wood, weren't you?" She was right. Liz is always right. Human&#xD;
intelligence and Elven wisdom combined to make her. I realized her eyes were&#xD;
glowing and I knew with a start she was looking at me through infrared. She&#xD;
could see my heart beating faster. I swallowed and worked my tongue. "Yes,&#xD;
Liz. I was practicing stances when I heard a noise, when I looked behind me, I&#xD;
was ambushed. One of them hit me on the head and I blacked out." I touched&#xD;
the tender spot on my head where the club found a fancy to strike me.&#xD;
"What else?", Liz's eyes were beginning to soften, but she was still&#xD;
going to present me to the Elder for my being-where-I'm-not-supposed-to. Liz was&#xD;
fifty years older than me. She raised me when my parents died. A definite life&#xD;
friend. A friend to keep away the trouble and invite it at the same time.&#xD;
"They sold me to some Orcs and-" Liz's eyes were hard again. Under&#xD;
that gaze my mouth went dry. I had to work my tongue to get some moisture&#xD;
before I could continue. We both hated Orcs. Orcs were responsible for her tribe’s&#xD;
death and my parents murder. Being an experienced woodswoman, she, with my&#xD;
help, ensured the safety of the nearby villages. I respected and feared her, with&#xD;
good reason. Once I had enough spit, I continued, "The goblins sold me to&#xD;
the Orcs for a slave. The Orcs were traveling with a new caravan of slaves for&#xD;
their mines. When I got there, they put a pick in my hands and worked me till&#xD;
my hand were raw, then made me work some more." My hands are bandaged.&#xD;
"If they saw you sleep or sneak something to eat before it was time to eat&#xD;
there, the slave drivers whipped you." They fed you slop made of other&#xD;
slaves that died from exertion and sickness, seasoned with leftovers of the&#xD;
Orcs dinners and rancid mushrooms. If you were lucky enough to catch cave bugs,&#xD;
they gave you enough energy to last another hour or two. "When it was time&#xD;
to sleep, the Orcs were impressed with my strength and let me sleep with only&#xD;
ropes holding me bound. I managed to use a nearby sharp piece of rock to cut&#xD;
loose when everyone else was asleep. "The watchers that were standing&#xD;
guard overlooked me as just wiggling from uncomfortable." I grunted a&#xD;
humorless chuckle and continued. "The Orcs were careless and left one pick&#xD;
untouched nearby. I waited 'till the guard finished his round and started to go&#xD;
switch out for some sleep. While they were making the change, I darted for the&#xD;
pick with as little sound as possible, the way you taught me. "A new guard&#xD;
was just now taking his place, but he still had sleep in his eyes. He didn't&#xD;
see me until the last minute that I put the pick through his skull." It&#xD;
was Liz's turn to grunt. She picked up her mug and studied the black coffee in&#xD;
it, waiting for me to continue. "I managed to gather a little food for the&#xD;
trip back here. It took me longer than I thought. I misjudged the lay of the&#xD;
land, and ran out of food the third day..." I ended my story frowning at&#xD;
my stew. Remembering the cut off shriek of the Orc I killed. Feeling his warm&#xD;
blood, I lost my appetite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr size="2" width="100%"&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
