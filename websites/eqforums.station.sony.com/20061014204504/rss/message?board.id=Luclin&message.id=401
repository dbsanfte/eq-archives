    <title>South Ro down?</title>
    <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Luclin&amp;message.id=401</link>
    <description>I'm in a bit of a sticky situation here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have only one character of any value to me, my necromancer. He's currently camped in South Ro.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Every time I try to log in, I get the message &amp;quot;You have been disconnected&amp;quot; and it kicks me back to the server select screen. But here's the worst part: it took away the &amp;quot;return home&amp;quot; button for me, so I can't even get out of there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Any ideas? It's been doing this for 4+ hours right now, and shows no signs of letting up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know this is an old thread now and probably the issue has long since been corrected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I got this problem when trying to zone and got kicked out I had to get into the Chat channels  you get to from the server screen and /join stuckcharacter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In there is usually a GM and the only way you can talk to them is /tell messages to that name.  The channel is moderated and unable to be communicated in by anybody other than the moderator.  This was very hit and miss as I managed to /tell the GM to put me in a different zone and he followed directions and tossed me in PoK so I was able to get back in.  Problem was my wife had the same issue and they changed GM's and the new 1 did not listen or follow directions near as well so she ended up stuck for about 3 hours because they were not fixing the problem and after a while it kicks you from the channels if it considers you inactive long enough.  So if the GM is taking a while to get some things done you might have to /tell to yourself to hopefully keep the connection active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the process I understand is go into that stuckcharacter channel and most times they will get it fixed for you in just a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
