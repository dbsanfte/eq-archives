				<DIV>Greetings Folks!</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>As I am sure you have noticed we had to do a quick update again this afternoon to fix the bug with NPC spell casting.&nbsp; Let me step back and try to give a more thorough explanation of why we ended up with the amount of downtime we had this week.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>EQPlayers is a huge separate but connected system to the EverQuest game.&nbsp; Because of this there is a lot of messaging going on and the amount of traffic is dependent on the amount of information that is being dealt with.&nbsp; The consequence of this is that some bugs did not become apparent until we hooked up the system to all of the live servers.&nbsp; Although EQPlayers has not been available for you this week it has been running with all of the live data.&nbsp; Even more unfortunately, some of the leaks and crashes were not seen until the other ones were discovered – much like the layers of an onion.&nbsp; This is what has caused the repeated updates.&nbsp; Although not immediately obvious, this morning’s update dealing with the NPC spell casting bug is also EQPlayers related.&nbsp; As you all know EverQuest is a large and complicated system.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>This being said I am not making excuses but I wanted to communicate the reasons.&nbsp; I do believe that EQPlayers is a great addition to the game and will be a great service to all of you.&nbsp; We do strive to maintain a stable and reliable service to our customers and I hope you agree that this week has been the exception and not the rule.&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Once again, please accept my apologies for this week’s downtime.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
