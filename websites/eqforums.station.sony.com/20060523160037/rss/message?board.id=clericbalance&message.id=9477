&lt;DIV&gt;Not quite sure I understand this one.&amp;nbsp; Do you mean an automatic exceptional heal?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;I'm afraid I have to agree.&amp;nbsp; This has actually already happened.&amp;nbsp; Someone creates a group and does not have many leadership AAs.&amp;nbsp; Someone in the group that does have them says, "Make me leader.&amp;nbsp; I have more Leadership stuff than you."&amp;nbsp; This is especially true when HOTT is not available (at least in my experience).&amp;nbsp; Creating class specific leadership AAs would only widen that gap.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I have to agree here.&amp;nbsp; Class specific Leadership AA doesn't sound like a good idea to me.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Would you really want to be LFG and every&amp;nbsp; offer start with, &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;"do you have leadership ability cleric_001?".&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;"No"&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;"Sorry, we really need the cleric_001 ability"&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;The only mechanic that would work is stackible class specific AA that gives an effect to everyone in the group. Like clerics giving a small group heal proc, and then for each cleric in the group that proc heal grows by a percentage.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;what would work thogh would be an regular AA that invoke a class specific group effect with resonable reuse time (15 min around)&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
