    <title>Suspended my EQ subscription.</title>

    <description>I have come to the point I have decided to suspend my EQ subscription.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the best game I have ever played.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After, getting 600+ AAs on my cleric I feel there was not much left significante for what I like to do. (One Grouping exp and soloing) &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Which is not a problem cause I started another character. A WAR.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But after replaying all the old zones again I got burn out, feeling It was just to big a gap to fill and the time needed to invest to get AAs where my WAR would be any good to get groups easier and play in the newer zones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have posted alot on these forums so I wont go over my opinions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The straw that broke the camels back was when I seen I had less then 8K HP fully raid buffed at level 65 with my WAR and 4 other WARs LFG. As my CLR has over 10K buffed I know I need to be 11K+ to get groups for the newer content plus some 100AAs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, I did not want to hit 70 with my WAR and compete with all the 14K+ WARs for groups, cause peeps would be so used to  them when I would join they would get to hate me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So I played my CLR again and died in RCoD because of see invise mobs. That put me over the edge and now I leave EQ.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am not going to play another Multiplayer online game either. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have seen alot of games including EQ2 and guild Wars and WoW and I still stayed with EQ as it is the best in my opinion in the areas that are important to me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All the expasions offered alot that added fun to the game. Ldon and DoN missions being my favorite. Guild hall / corpse alter / dru res Rocks !!! =))&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I would have liked harder one group instanced zones. and more boss mobs in those. Would have been real cool to dump 8K of my 9.7K mana pool healing on 5 boss mobs in each one group mission. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maybe EQ 3 will come out some day. =)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Good Luck.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;At the end of the day it is one of the few forms of protest they listen to.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So check back when they give away free subscriptions (once or twice a year as it helps artificially inflate their&amp;nbsp;subscriber numbers).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Have fun wherever you decide to go.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;i have a stack of free subscriptions... they were giving them out at gencon a few years ago... they are I think 14 day subs, that include all content through luclin.&amp;nbsp; not bad for "free"&amp;nbsp; I think i have 50 of them or so... not even sure where they are now.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

(Not everyone has the same budget I am sure. Plus I never did the multipule account thing.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also,I have been given free game that I either never even installed or only played for 10 mins and then deleted them off my hard drive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the cost of one combo meal at Mc Donalds I could play EQ for half a month about. Id say that is pretty good value =).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then if your not hungy for Mc Donalds it really does not matter how cheap it is.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;it took someone almost 13 years to come up with a game near the quality of UFO: Xcom.&amp;nbsp; Maybe someone can come up with something that complements what made EQ that good in less time.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
