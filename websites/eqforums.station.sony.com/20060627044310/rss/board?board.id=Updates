      <description>&lt;br&gt;- Fixed a crash while trying to search the bazaar when not using the default UI.&lt;br&gt;- Fixed the problem with AA experience being reset when you enter monster missions or use a shroud.&lt;br&gt;- Fixed a bug with some tasks not being available to be given out to players.&lt;br&gt;- The ‘;’ chat commands should now work again.&lt;br&gt;- Setting a chat window's default channel to a chat channel (instead of say, group, raid, ...) will now broadcast the chat to that channel.&lt;br&gt;- Fixed a problem that was causing the Concentration AA to not function properly.&lt;br&gt;- We've reverted the fix to channeling made with the last patch. After much discussion, our general feeling is that channeling has been broken for long enough that players have come to rely on that broken behavior as expected gameplay. For the time being, we've reverted back to that broken behavior and will address spell interrupts in general at a later date.&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;*** Headlines ***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*** We've now upgraded to DirectX 9.0c! ***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Continuing our efforts to keep pace with current technology, EverQuest will be upgrading to DirectX9.0c to allow us to take &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;advantage of many of the new features and fixes since our last upgrade in the middle of 2003.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; You will need to be sure that &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;you are currently running DirectX9.0C .&amp;nbsp; If not you will need to download it.&amp;nbsp; This can be done by simply going to &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=56513&amp;amp;clcid=0x409 and following the instructions there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Make sure you:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align="left"&gt;1. Get the April 2006 DirectX 9.0C redistributable version (Caution: Download is about 52 MB) at: &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=fb73d860-5af1-45e5-bac0-9bc7a5254203&amp;amp;DisplayLang=en&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. Run directx_apr2006_redist.exe. Extract the files to an easily identifiable directory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3. Go to the directory the files were extracted to in step 2. Run "DXSETUP.EXE" from that directory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4. Accept the license agreement. Allow the installer to update the DirectX components.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Nektulos Forest got a face lift!&amp;nbsp; Check out the amazing new look.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- The Guild Lobby is now available to everyone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- The 8th-year veteran reward Throne of Heroes, a gate ability that transports veterans to the throne room in the guild lobby, is now available to those who are eligible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*- The map window now has an option to display your group mates.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- To help smooth the transition to incurring death penalties for new players (losing experience and leaving a corpse), the level when you start to incur death penalties has been lowered from level 11 to level 6 and the amount of experience you lose when you die now starts at a very small amount at level 6 and slowly ramps up from there.&amp;nbsp; We've added a corpse summoner to the tutorial who will summon corpses for free for anyone who is level 10 or under. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- New Hot Zones! With this patch the old hot zones have been reverted to their previous values and a new set of hot zones has been selected! The following zones are now the "Hot Zones"! &lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Level 20: Swamp of No Hope&lt;br&gt;Level 25: Overthere&lt;br&gt;Level 30: Timorous Deep&lt;br&gt;Level 35: Emerald Jungle&lt;br&gt;Level 40: Dreadlands&lt;br&gt;Level 45: City of Mist&lt;br&gt;Level 50: Skyfire&lt;br&gt;Level 55: Karnor's Castle&lt;br&gt;Level 60: Veksar &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;*** Requested during Fan Faire ***&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/b&gt;(Items in body are denoted with a *)&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;*- The map window now has an option to display your group mates.&lt;br&gt;*- Pet spells and weapon procs now report to the owner and can be filtered appropriately.&lt;br&gt;*- The refresh time on Spirit of Bih`Li has been reduced.&lt;br&gt;*- The damage on Bloodpyre and Heartblaze have been increased.&lt;br&gt;*- Illusion: Werewolf now uses the new werewolf model.&amp;nbsp; This applies to enchanter spells and item effects.&lt;br&gt;*- You can now turn off messages generated by bard songs affecting your pet.&lt;br&gt;*- Throwing axes should now pull from ammo/inventory appropriately.&lt;br&gt;*- Increased the amount of mobs that can drop exceptional shissar blood.&lt;br&gt;*- The tradeskill recipes for Dreary Deeds and Infusion of Spirit have finally been discovered. &lt;br&gt;*- The Antonican forge has moved to outside of Armor by Ikthar.&lt;br&gt;*- The LDoN raids have been switched over to use the expedition system. This means you can add new players to the raid at any time, and the lockout occurs at the end after a success instead of at the beginning when the raid is launched. Also, the maximum player limit has been increased from 36 to 54, and all death count failure mechanics have been removed.&lt;br&gt;*- Dain`s Historian Duggans will now review with you which of his missions you have completed and turned in a seal for that mission. Simply ask him to "Review" the Coldain History you have studied.&lt;br&gt;*- Updated the character models for many NPCs throughout the world.&amp;nbsp; This includes changing Illusion: Werewolf to use the new werewolf model.&lt;br&gt;*- Creatures without legs have lost the ability to kick. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*- Lowered the hit points and increased the respawn time of the door that leads from Devastation into Stronghold of Rage to make access to Stronghold of Rage easier.&lt;br&gt;*- The default size for the barter and bazaar windows has been increased.&lt;br&gt;*- You can now filter the barter window by seller name.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*** Spells ***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Fire pets should now regenerate mana appropriately.&lt;br&gt;*- Pet spells and weapon procs now report to the owner and can be filtered appropriately.&lt;br&gt;*- The refresh time on Spirit of Bih`Li has been reduced.&lt;br&gt;*- The damage on Bloodpyre and Heartblaze have been increased.&lt;br&gt;- The effect from your aura will no longer be removed if you use an illusion.&lt;br&gt;- Having an aura up should no longer cause targeting issues while you are under illusions.&lt;br&gt;*- Illusion: Werewolf now uses the new werewolf model.&amp;nbsp; This applies to enchanter spells and item effects.&lt;br&gt;- Bard songs will now stop pulsing when an NPC forces the bard to feign death.&lt;br&gt;*- You can now turn off messages generated by bard songs affecting your pet.&lt;br&gt;- Buffs that increase run speed will no longer overwrite AA run speed increases that are better than the buff.&lt;br&gt;- You can now specify beneficial spells to block by name using the Blocked Buff window.&amp;nbsp; This will allow you to block spells that don't have a buff icon without editing a file.&lt;br&gt;- Attempting to gate or teleport to a zone that isn't currently running will no longer result in your spell bar being locked up.&lt;br&gt;- Several spell texts which were gender-specific have been changed to something more gender-neutral.&lt;br&gt;- Added a wear-off message to Elddar's Grasp, Puratus, Harmony of Nature, and Mind Shatter.&lt;br&gt;- Short duration buff icons should now be a consistent size.&lt;br&gt;- Eyes of Zomm have been sedated and should no longer decide to attack their owners from time to time.&lt;br&gt;- Sitting while levitation wears off will no longer leave your character looking like he's falling until you stand up again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*** AAS ***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Added the 8-year veteran reward Throne of Heroes, a gate ability that transports veterans to throne room in the guild lobby.&lt;br&gt;- Pious Supplication has been renamed to Improved Hand of Piety.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*** Items ***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Increased the amount of experience that evolving items gain when you kill an NPC. In addition, you will now gain more experience toward your evolving item when you are in a group, similar to how normal experience works. &lt;br&gt;- Reduced the amount of experience required to level up intelligent items. If your items now have more experience than is required to level, they will evolve the next time they gain experience.&lt;br&gt;- Due to the changes to how fast you gain item XP, the amount of XP required to evolve the Cloak of the Spirit Tracker has been increased.&lt;br&gt;- Evolving an item should no longer cause occasional crashes.&lt;br&gt;- The aura effects from Prophecy of Ro "clicky" items are no longer restricted to only hitting your group. In addition, they will no longer recast their effect every 6 seconds, but instead will remain on a character for as long as they are within range of the aura.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*- Throwing axes should now pull from ammo/inventory appropriately.&lt;br&gt;- Lowered the duration on the spin stun on Peace of the Disciple Strike and One Hundred Blows while in PvP.&lt;br&gt;- Bane of Muram and Curse of Muram now last 18 and 36 seconds respectively.&lt;br&gt;-Modified the Battleworn Symbol of Rage. The charm was calculating values higher than intended and now should be on par with other Demiplane of Blood level charms.&lt;br&gt;- Changed all four of the Furious Bash Augments from DoD that use Ambleshift's Amazing Automated Amalgamator to Improved Block. Additionally the names of the Chronal, Discordant and Bazu seals have been changed appropriately.&lt;br&gt;- Altered the Favorable Breezes line of augments from DoD that use Ambleshift's Amazing Automated Amalgamator. They now give a different progression of effect.&lt;br&gt;- Increased the level required to equip the following augments to 45 to match the level that their effect is able to be used: Carnivorous Coral, Deepwood Hunter's Stone.&lt;br&gt;- Increased the level required to equip the following augments to 60 to match the level that their effect is able to be used: Green Fire Phosphorous, Frozen Malachite, Jagged Dragon Scale, Turquoise Lifetap Sieve.&lt;br&gt;- Increased the level required to use the following augments to 65 to match the level that their effect is able to be used: Volcanic Sink Geode, Deep Crust Frozen Malachite, Vein Sap Mineral, Ethereal Sky Stone, Faerie Luck Stone.&lt;br&gt;- The Mystical Aptitude effect will now last its full 20 minutes.&lt;br&gt;- Vibrating Gauntlets of Infuse and Vibrating Hammer of Infuse are now lore to each other.&amp;nbsp; This is to prevent players from getting into an odd state that could cause a crash.&lt;br&gt;- Barbarians can now use Naturalist's Leather Arm Wraps.&lt;br&gt;- Roleplayer's Jester now looks like a doll rather than a bag.&lt;br&gt;- The Burning Affliction focus effect on The Skull of Torture should now work properly.&lt;br&gt;- Increased the stats on the Wrought Blade of Hiz.&lt;br&gt;- Bravefoot Short Sword is now considered a one-handed slashing weapon instead of one-handed blunt.&lt;br&gt;- The Cracked Stone of Savagery now has the proc effect of Lifesap I. &lt;br&gt;- The Shard of Crystallized Rage now has the proc effect of Fiery Strike II. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*** Skills ***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Made changes to the taunt formula at high levels. A level 60 character taunting an even con or higher level NPC will now use the character's taunt skill to determine success rate, similar to what occurs below level 60. The chance to taunt is roughly the same. In addition, the reduction in your chance to taunt creatures higher level than yourself now occurs at a slower rate and the minimum chance to taunt an NPC is higher. Also, you will now gain a bonus to your chance to taunt NPCs that are lower level than yourself. To go along with the change to use a character's taunt skill after level 60, paladins and shadowknights have had their taunt caps increased to match warriors and ranger's skill cap has been increased to 200. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;- Taunts that fail because of distance will no longer cause you to have to wait the cool down period before attempting to taunt again.&lt;br&gt;- Ranged combat should behave much more consistently now.&lt;br&gt;- Increased the sense and disarm range on many traps throughout the world.&lt;br&gt;- /con will now properly report whether an NPC can see you sneaky rogues.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*** Tradeskills ***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*- Increased the amount of mobs that can drop exceptional shissar blood.&lt;br&gt;*- The tradeskill recipes for Dreary Deeds and Infusion of Spirit have finally been discovered. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;- Merchants across the world realized that they were selling small pieces of ore at a loss. They have mutually agreed on a price increase. &lt;br&gt;- The poisons from the Omens of War era will no longer magically create a vial; they now require two of the appropriate poison vial. &lt;br&gt;- You will no longer be able to combine ingredients that you have up for sale in the bazaar.&lt;br&gt;*- The Antonican forge has moved to outside of Armor by Ikthar.&lt;br&gt;- Failing to create Frost Bunny Stew will now return your pot to you.&lt;br&gt;- Fixed the bug to the evolution of the tradeskill trophies for players using lower than master certificates while having a 300 skill.&lt;br&gt;- Bristlebane's Challenge and Bristlebane's Challenge Meats have changed to No Drop. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;- Fixed a bug in the wording of the Grandmaster's Book of Barbarian Culture.&lt;br&gt;- Expanded the shark skins that can be used to make advanced poison vials. There are two shark skin items, both with the same name.&lt;br&gt;- Seeping Haze poisons will now properly bestow the Seeping Haze proc effect. &lt;br&gt;- Bitter feedback poisons will not properly bestow the Bitter Feedback proc effect.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*** Quests ***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Removed the "Loot 4" requirement from all of the "Bring Me Their Heads" quests in Devastation and Stronghold of Rage. This should make these quests more accessible by allowing characters to collect the items needed, then get the quest and hand them in to complete it. &lt;br&gt;- Added an experience reward for the "Bring Me Their Heads" and "Engines of Destruction" tasks in the Devastation and Stronghold of Rage.&lt;br&gt;- Fixed a problem with the Shaman epic 2.0 Elder Spirit of Enlightenment in West Freeport.&amp;nbsp; Seemed he wanted to enlighten himself by wandering where he shouldn't. He should now happily lead shamans from the Jade Tiger Inn into the courtyard for the ritual.&lt;br&gt;- The drop rate of the Twilight Sea armor quest gems has been increased significantly. In an effort to keep the amount of money entering the world from those gems roughly the same, the value of the gems has been reduced as a result.&lt;br&gt;- Shalowen the Pure will now return The Chalice of Life if you have completed the single group missions in his arc in order and turning in the chalice of life drop from the Corruption of Ro raid.&lt;br&gt;- Exploring the Valley of Xanzerok for the Arcstone quests should now work correctly when levitating.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*** Events ***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*- The LDoN raids have been switched over to use the expedition system. This means you can add new players to the raid at any time, and the lockout occurs at the end after a success instead of at the beginning when the raid is launched. Also, the maximum player limit has been increased from 36 to 54, and all death count failure mechanics have been removed.&lt;br&gt;- The events in Deathknell, Tower of Dissonance now have individual lockout timers instead of applying a lockout to the entire zone. &lt;br&gt;- Made some tuning changes to the first raid event in Deathknell.&lt;br&gt;- The Deathknell Enforcers will no longer use Immobilizing Stone. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;- Added a tether to Maestro Tan`Lor in Theater of Blood.&lt;br&gt;- The lava spout traps have been removed from the Tirranun encounter. &lt;br&gt;- The traps in the Inktu`ta raid should fire off much less often, as well as be easier to locate and disarm. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;- Mayong will now teleport back to his spawn point if he wanders too far from his room. &lt;br&gt;- Fixed a crash bug that could occur in the Demi-Plane of Blood during the Performer event. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;- Drekish the Enforcer of Ro will now properly reset in the event of a failure in the Corruption of Ro raid. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;- You now only need one flagged player to initiate the 18-man Kunark Monster Mission raid: Fall of an Empire. &lt;br&gt;- The invaders that breach the walls into the Stronghold of Rage will be a bit less easy to split. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*** Missions&amp;nbsp; ***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Increased the distance that the Dwarf armies must be from basecamp in The Defense of Thurgadin monster mission before they return to full combat potential. Units moving to forward locations are guaranteed to be back in combat states when they reach their destinations but may still be thinking of resting while they are in transit. &lt;br&gt;*- Dain`s Historian Duggans will now review with you which of his missions you have completed and turned in a seal for that mission. Simply ask him to "Review" the Coldain History you have studied.&lt;br&gt;- Corrected an issue that could cause you to not get credit for finishing the mission "Train" if you were charmed when it completed.&lt;br&gt;- Corrected an issue that could cause the mission "Creepy Concerto" to not update properly if there were pets or auras in the mission. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*** Zones ***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- The Guild Lobby is now available to everyone, whether they own Dragons of Norrath or not.&lt;br&gt;- Added a guild hall port stone to Arcstone.&lt;br&gt;- Added an Augment Sealer Pool to Arcstone.&lt;br&gt;- Fixed a number of crashes that could occur with older graphics cards in Anguish and Muramite Proving Grounds.&lt;br&gt;- The portal out of Veeshan's Peak will now take you to the proper version of Freeport.&lt;br&gt;- Fixed a problem that was causing NPCs to fall under the world in Dawnshroud Peaks.&lt;br&gt;- Creatures in Devastation now travel in smaller packs and are slightly weaker than before.&lt;br&gt;- The portal to Dranik's Scar from East Freeport has a visual effect again.&lt;br&gt;- The entrances to Paineel and The Hole can be lock picked once again.&lt;br&gt;- The Hunter/Forager cycle in Trakanon's Teeth should no longer spawn multiple copies of the same creatures.&lt;br&gt;- Corrected an issue that could cause several non-targetable creatures to attack you in Halls of Honor.&lt;br&gt;- Casting Succor in Grimling Forest will no longer put you under the world.&lt;br&gt;- Fixed a problem with the Guild Hall Portal that could cause the teleport confirmation window to display the incorrect target zone.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;- Fixed an issue in Illsalin that was causing groups of arena combatants not to despawn after the event.&lt;br&gt;- You should no longer get stuck behind the grate leading into Dranik Sewers.&lt;br&gt;- Kerra Ridge should now be much friendlier to lower level adventurers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*** NPCs ***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*- Updated the character models for many NPCs throughout the world.&amp;nbsp; This includes changing Illusion: Werewolf to use the new werewolf model.&lt;br&gt;- The corpse summoners in the guild lobby are no longer fooled by shrouding down to lower levels before handing in a soul stone. &lt;br&gt;*- Creatures without legs have lost the ability to kick. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;- The treants in Theater of Blood that have been shedding hooves and horse meat will no longer do so.&lt;br&gt;*- Lowered the hit points and increased the respawn time of the door that leads from Devastation into Stronghold of Rage to make access to Stronghold of Rage easier.&lt;br&gt;- The angry and hurt Faydedar that Dolgin helps people bait no longer has any viable meat on him.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;-Terrorantula's children should no longer warp across the desert.&lt;br&gt;- Summoning a horse should no longer upset nearby NPCs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*** Maps ***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Cartographers have been very busy. Numerous map fixes made.&lt;br&gt;*- The map window now has an option to display your group mates.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*** UI ***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*- The default size for the barter and bazaar windows has been increased.&lt;br&gt;*- You can now filter the barter window by seller name.&lt;br&gt;- The guild window should now display information properly for guilds with over 999 members.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*** Miscellaneous ***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Corrected a problem with channeling that was causing you to channel through damage (not bash, kick, stun, or movement) 100% of the time if you didn't have any channeling AAs.&amp;nbsp; Interrupts from damage are now back to working how they did previously and your chance to channel through damage is based on your channeling skill.&lt;br&gt;- We've now upgraded to DirectX 9.0c!&lt;br&gt;- Many pathing issues have been resolved. Monsters rejoice!&lt;br&gt;- The Universal Chat system will replace the old Channel Server for all channel operations. All player-owned channels will be moved over automatically and using channels in the new system is the same as before, so you should not notice any difference.&amp;nbsp; One of the primary benefits of this change is that channels now support cross-server and cross-game functionality. EQIM will no longer work with this change however we do intend to remedy this situation if possible in the future.&lt;br&gt;- Luclin character models are now available to everyone, whether they own Shadows of Luclin or not.&lt;br&gt;- Increased the amount of experience you gain toward your shroud progression when you kill an NPC as a shroud. In addition, you will now gain more experience toward your evolving item when you are in a group, similar to how normal experience works.&amp;nbsp; This does not affect the evolving tradeskill trophies, which don't gain experience from killing creatures.&lt;br&gt;- Fixed a number of rendering anomalies that could occur throughout the game.&lt;br&gt;- Targeting corpses should now be much easier and much less confusing.&lt;br&gt;- Item links can now be sent across Universal Chat channels!&lt;br&gt;- Ogre females using voice emotes for Agree and Disagree will now play the proper voices.&lt;br&gt;- Player and NPC names should now be rendering correctly at all times when they are overlapping.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- The EverQuest Team&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Kytherea on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;06-14-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;05:17 PM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Many of your favorite NPCs from the original EverQuest zones and Kunark have been upgraded to Fabled versions that are tougher and tote better loot.&amp;nbsp; And for the first time, they are joined by over a hundred NPCs from Velious!&lt;BR&gt;- New scavenger hunt! NPCs in Thurgadin, Kael, and Skyshrine are looking for help finishing up some of their collections.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;*** Missions, Quests &amp;amp; Events ***&lt;BR&gt;--------------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;- Fixed a bug in the Gilded Scroll mission that was not updating the scrolls when they are looted.&lt;BR&gt;- Five new unusual creatures have been spotted in the Demi-Plane of Blood. &lt;BR&gt;- The mini bosses in Anguish will now drop augments again.&lt;BR&gt;- Made some aesthetic changes to the Snowtail and Ghost encounters in Razorthorne.&lt;BR&gt;- Tailfang in Shar Vahl will now drop his tail on the Firiona Vie server.&lt;BR&gt;- The mission The Key to the Past should now hand out an appropriate reward.&lt;BR&gt;- Reduced the difficulty of the Oroshar encounter in Arcstone.&amp;nbsp; Oroshar should now be in line with the other four spirits. &lt;BR&gt;- Modified the Sundersky encounter in Arcstone.&amp;nbsp; Sundersky is now more powerful, but becomes less so after his four summoned winds are destroyed. &lt;BR&gt;- Collapsed all of the missions on Spirit Hunter Elijo into one mission: Mark of the Spirits.&amp;nbsp; Any previously collected spirit marks can still be turned into Spirit Hunter Elijo for task credit.&amp;nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;- Ao the Fourth Born now gives out a spell scroll reward for completing his mission arc.&amp;nbsp; If you've previously completed all 3 Skylance Missions, then simply hail Ao for your reward.&lt;BR&gt;- For the quest, Through the Portal, a fix has been made so that crazed scyrkins will drop the needed shards.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;*** AAs , Spells, and Disciplines ***&lt;BR&gt;--------------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;- Temporarily removed the AA Abundant Healing.&amp;nbsp; This ability was causing a conflict with the ability Gift of Mana.&amp;nbsp; As Gift of Mana is generally considered the more useful of the two, Abundant Healing has been removed until we can resolve the conflict.&amp;nbsp; Any points spent in Abundant Healing will be refunded &lt;BR&gt;- Dispel spells can no longer be blocked using buff blocking.&lt;BR&gt;- Harmonic Dissonance now has a 15 minute reuse time associated with it.&lt;BR&gt;- Pets will no longer instantly die when told to attack a trap they are not allowed to attack.&amp;nbsp; The owner will receive notification about why the pet did not attack.&lt;BR&gt;- You can now remove pet buffs even if they are stacked beyond 4.&lt;BR&gt;- The buffs in the pet information window will no longer show 0 time left in their tooltip.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;*** Items ***&lt;BR&gt;--------------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;- Fixed the evolving item reward for the Spirit Hunter Missions in Arcstone.&amp;nbsp; If you have a cloak that is stuck in the second stage of the evolving item (Cloak of the Spirit Stalker) speak to Spirit Hunter Elijo to receive the final version. &lt;BR&gt;- Modified the Black Orb of the Scrykin quest.&amp;nbsp; The orbs of the seven dead Scrykin are now called "Gray" orbs and are tradeable.&amp;nbsp; The orbs of the six living scrykin will also drop off the appropriate scrykin (in addition to being the task rewards for completing Or`Sarro's tasks) &lt;BR&gt;- The Enraged Flesh Armor pieces are now no trade.&lt;BR&gt;- The Prophecy of Ro tier1/2 cleric breastplate now has the activated effect of Pious Elixir&lt;BR&gt;- The Prophecy of Ro tier1/2 shaman breastplate now has the activated effect of Ghost of Renewal&lt;BR&gt;- The Prophecy of Ro tier1/2 enchanter breastplate now has the activated effect of Ethereal Rune&lt;BR&gt;- The Saga of Skin Translations are now no-trade&lt;BR&gt;- The Coldain Historical Seal augmentations are now lore to each other&lt;BR&gt;- Hammer of Shadows now has 300 endurance&lt;BR&gt;- A number of items from the events in Theater of Blood now have their proper stats&lt;BR&gt;- Burning Tree Leaf now only returns at max 337 hp and mana and has reduced stats.&lt;BR&gt;- Pendant of Insurgency, Aelly’s Earring, Prickly Earring, and Mary-Anne’s Ring of Insanity now have monk, beastlord, and berserker as usable classes.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;*** NPCs ***&lt;BR&gt;--------------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;- Farwein Windrun has returned to his camp in South Ro.&amp;nbsp; Feel free to stop by and welcome him back.&amp;nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;- Queen Tak`Yaliz in the Desert of North Ro will no longer be missing while you’re looking for her. &lt;BR&gt;- Ping Fuzzlecutter is now carrying some tasty water!&amp;nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;- Tak`Valnakor will now properly offer all of his tasks.&lt;BR&gt;- Boomba the Big has returned to his old stomping grounds near the west gate of Freeport.&lt;BR&gt;- Vulak`Aerr, High Priest of Veeshan, has returned to the Temple of Veeshan.&lt;BR&gt;- Gnarlibramble has loot again.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** Special Notes ***&lt;BR&gt;--------------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;- We have made really good progress on the reported issues of increased zoning times.&amp;nbsp; We would like to thank all those that have helped with this by providing detailed information.&amp;nbsp; We know what the issues are and we are in the process of implementing our solution.&amp;nbsp; We hope to have a fix that can be tested on our Test Server within the next week or so.&lt;BR&gt;- Just in the last couple of days we were able to find the line of sight issue that some of you have been reporting.&amp;nbsp; Given how close we were to our next live update, we felt that there was not a sufficient amount of time to properly test this change.&amp;nbsp; For this reason the line of sight fix will not be in this update, but will go to our Test Server this week so that we can have the proper amount of testing time to ensure that our fix actually fixes the problem and does not create any others.&amp;nbsp; Thank you for your understanding.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;February 21st, 2006&lt;BR&gt;_____________________&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** Headlines ***&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- Prophecy of Ro Launches!&lt;BR&gt;- The Desert of Ro and the city of Freeport have been revamped&lt;BR&gt;- Alchemy system has received an overhaul&lt;BR&gt;- New Hot Zones&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** Prophecy of Ro Launches! ***&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As a demi-god, Mayong Mistmoore -- the greatest vampire ever known -- is threatening Norrath and its gods. Druzzil Ro, the goddess of Magic, has seen the future and the darkness that lies ahead. Now, the time has come to heed Druzzil Ro’s calls as she opens the planes of Rage and Magic and a passage through time to the long lost Elddar elven city of Takish-Hiz. Draw your swords and prepare your magic to face the greatest fight of your lives. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The full story is available in-game in your Storyline window.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** Prophecy of Ro Features ***&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;- Spheres of Influence - Spheres of Influence will appear in expansion zones as visual effects, like soft blue lights, whirling winds, or spinning axes. Any player or non-player character that enters the area of the sphere is subject to its effects. In order to see Spheres of Influence, you must have Player particles enabled in your display options.&lt;BR&gt;- Auras - Players can create Spheres of Influence called Auras. There is an Auras window available in the Character section of your EQ menu which shows your currently active auras and gives you the ability to remove them with a right-click. Player auras are available through mission rewards and events much like spells. In order to see Auras, you must have Player particles enabled in your display options.&lt;BR&gt;- Destructible Objects - Destructible objects, like walls, doors, and siege engines, are used in many of the new expansion zones. These are terrain objects that have a health points which can be depleted and, when the object has reached low enough health, it will crumble and break. As you damage the objects you will see it break down until it is completely destroyed. You can identify an object that is destructible because it will pulse when you put your mouse over it. &lt;BR&gt;- Zone Traps - Traps in EverQuest are now represented by objects that can be seen or hidden. As you would expect, traps trigger if you move into their range and you or your party, and sometimes the entire zone, can be affected by them. Rogues and bards have the ability to sense traps, reveal them to those around them, and disarm them. All traps in the game have been converted to use this new trap system.&lt;BR&gt;- Player Traps - Traps are available to players in the same way as spells and abilities, through specific quests, mission rewards, and off spell or discipline vendors. Once a trap has been memorized, it can be created by using the spell or discipline. The trap will remain in the area it is summoned until it is triggered, disarmed, removed by the player who set it using the new Remove Trap skill, or expires.&lt;BR&gt;- Buff Filters - Players can now filter beneficial spells cast upon them and their pets. By right-clicking on any active buff showing in your Effects window, you can select to remove it and/or select that it will never be allowed to take effect on your character again. Pet owners can also click off buff icons in the Pet window and apply filters to them. The list of spells being blocked can be found in the Blocked Buffs or Blocked Pet Buffs windows in the Character section of your EQ menu. &lt;BR&gt;- New Bank Space - Available bank space has been increased by 8 slots.&lt;BR&gt;- /Claim Item - If you have received the Prophecy of Ro /claim item from the retail box, Stable Ward Kyle in the Bazaar may be able to help you use it to upgrade your old horse to a warhorse. Paladins or Shadowknights who have the Holy or Unholy Steed AAs and the /claim item can upgrade their special mounts to a warhorse by visiting Stable Ward Rames as well.&lt;BR&gt;- New Tradeskills - Event Coordinator Baublie Diggs has a test for you to prove your abilities!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;See the Prophecy of Ro manual (Prophecy_of_Ro.pdf) downloaded to your EverQuest directory for more information! &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;******************&lt;BR&gt;***Live Updates***&lt;BR&gt;******************&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** Zone Revamps ***&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- Freeport has been redone. East, West, and North Freeport have been replaced with a brand new East and West Freeport. All your old friends should still be there and more.&lt;BR&gt;- Desert of Ro recreated. North Ro, Oasis, and South Ro have been replaced with a new North Ro and South Ro. Watch out for Sand Giants while checking out the new scenery.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;*** New Guild Functionality ***&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- There is now an "Alt" button to flag a member of the guild as an alt character (this can be done by an officer on anyone, and by anyone on themselves).&lt;BR&gt;- The "Hide Alts" button will hide anyone in the guild list who is flagged as an alt. This defaults to off.&lt;BR&gt;- A "B" is no longer appended to the status of bankers. Instead there are two new columns, Banker and Alt, which have the status in them. You can sort by either Banker or Alt by clicking on the header.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** New Raid Functionality ***&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- There is a new raid loot option: Entire Raid. This will allow any raid member to loot NPCs killed by the raid.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** New Hot Zones ***&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- The time has come to once again update the "Hot Zones" throughout Norrath. The previous zones have been reverted to their former states and the following zones are now a great place to go for experience and fun:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Level 20: Najena &lt;BR&gt;Level 25: Iceclad Ocean &lt;BR&gt;Level 30: Rathe Mountains &lt;BR&gt;Level 35: Frontier Mountains &lt;BR&gt;Level 40: Gulf of Gunthak &lt;BR&gt;Level 45: Velketor's Labrynth &lt;BR&gt;Level 50: Fungus Grove &lt;BR&gt;Level 55: Old Sebilis &lt;BR&gt;Level 60: Cazic Thule &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** Spells ***&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- Increased the duration and lowered the mana cost of Talisman of the Tribunal.&lt;BR&gt;- The Test of Efficiency spell should no longer conflict with Peace of the Disciple or Grace of the Order.&lt;BR&gt;- Increased the damage and lowered the mana on Touch of Inruku to better match the rest of the spell line's progression.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** AAs ***&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- The way that the wizard AA Mana Burn works has been modified. The new version will use a maximum of 3000 mana instead of draining your whole pool and will do 4 damage for every point of mana spent. This is a raw channeling of magical energy that cannot be focused and will not critically hit. The ability is unresistable by normal creatures, but certain special creatures may be immune to the effects. Like the previous version, once a Mana Burn ability has affected a target, no other Mana Burn abilities will be able to affect that target for the next minute. Upgraded versions of the ability, Mana Blast and Mana Blaze, are available at level 65 and level 70 and use a maximum of 6000 and 9000 mana respectively. The original Mana Burn ability has been refunded and can be repurchased by Wizards interested in the new version.&lt;BR&gt;- Gift of Mana will no longer be used up when you cast a 0 mana spell and now has a chance to trigger on heals other than just instant heals, including heal-over-time and percent healing spells.&lt;BR&gt;- Rogues and Bards have a new AA ability called Thief's Intuition. This ability goes hand-in-hand with the new trap system and allows those classes a chance to automatically sense nearby traps. The new AAs can be found in the Class tab. &lt;BR&gt;- There are new special mounts available for Paladins and Shadowknights under the Class AA tab.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** Events ***&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- The planar projection for defeating Mithaniel Marr was not rewarding the correct character flags. This has been fixed.&lt;BR&gt;- Raids in Dynamic zones in Gates of Discord now require a minimum of 12 people to be started.&lt;BR&gt;- Sendaii the Hive Queen raid will now lock out the expedition after the glowing egg is broken.&lt;BR&gt;- NPC’s should no longer re-spawn after being killed in the Controlling the Beast mission set in Stoneroot Falls.&lt;BR&gt;- The mission "Taking Control" from Stoneroot Falls now only requires 3 people to start it.&lt;BR&gt;- Adjusted the rewards on monster missions so they scale better based on how long it’s actually taking to complete the mission.&lt;BR&gt;- It should be much more difficult for Stefan Marsinger to die within one of the Greater Faydark spires.&lt;BR&gt;- Various magician epic mobs should no longer double, triple, or quadruple spawn for every mage that enters the zone.&lt;BR&gt;- A number of changes were made to the Demi-Plane of Blood, including pathing fixes, tuning tweaks, and bonuses for defeating Mayong. For more information, see the EQLive forums.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** Missions ***&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- Monster Mission XP rewards have tuned to better account for the amount of time required to complete the mission. Longer missions now give more XP while shorter missions give less. In addition, the way XP is rewarded has been refactored so it scales better as you gain levels.&lt;BR&gt;- In Stoneroot Falls, mission givers Kelliad and Widdlethorpe will now offer you missions that you have completed previously in each of their story arcs when requesting the mission that you are currently on.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** Tasks ***&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- Added a timer to normal tasks. You can now only complete a task once every 15 minutes. As with shared tasks, the time counts from when you initially get the task, so if it took you longer than 15 minutes to complete the task, you can immediately get another one. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** Tradeskills ***&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- Alchemy has undergone some changes resulting in modifications to old recipes as well as introducing new recipes and potions, smoother progression in the skill, and significant cost reductions.&lt;BR&gt;- Potions - All old-style (10 charge, non stackable) alchemical potions have been removed and replaced by an equivalent potion in the revamped system. These new potions are stackable up to 20 per stack. Note: Due to an error that did not show up on our testing, this was not completed, but only partially done. Some players will have their items exchanged, some will not. The old potions will still function, despite the fact that there will be no way to make them. You can still make the new potions using the new recipes once the community discovers them. We will correct this error and do this exchange the next patch after it has been re-tested.&lt;BR&gt;- Recipes - All recipes that point to the old-style alchemical potions no longer exist. New recipes have been created for all of the new potions and will use new herbs. &lt;BR&gt;- Herbs - Many old herbs have had their prices altered and new herbs have been introduced, both as purchased components as well as dropped components. &lt;BR&gt;- Planar Fletching Kits are now tradeable.&lt;BR&gt;- Changed Othmir Short Beer to use a bottle instead of a Cask.&lt;BR&gt;- Deep Orc Essence now requires less meat.&lt;BR&gt;- Disabled the spell research creation of the spell Draught of Lightning. This was done because it is a quest derived spell.&lt;BR&gt;- Some very old erudite only combines have had their trivials adjusted up from being no-fail to on par with other combines of that era.&lt;BR&gt;-The Research Recipe to make Unholy Bellow has been disabled.&lt;BR&gt;- The Rusty Mining Pick used by Druids has changed names, but works exactly the same.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** Items ***&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- Changed the Slot12 Tradeskill augments that have Cleave, Ferocity, Furious Bash, Improved Dodge, Improved Parry and Sharpshooting to be worn effects instead of focus effects.&lt;BR&gt;- Made a few minor modifications to damage ratios on some of the Demi-Plane of Blood weapons.&lt;BR&gt;- Set a cap on the maximum amount of skill bonuses you can get from certain worn effects. The caps are for bash (100), backstab (125), dragon punch (100), eagle strike (100), flying kick (100), kick (100), round kick (100), tiger claw (100), and frenzy (125).&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** General Bug Fixes ***&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- Players will no longer see their breath in first person while on a boar mount.&lt;BR&gt;- Froglok jump animation will now play at normal speed.&lt;BR&gt;- Skeleton illusions will now function correctly on boar mounts.&lt;BR&gt;- PCs will no longer warp to the location they were charmed or feared when those spells wear off.&lt;BR&gt;- The autofire ability will now turn off when a player sits down or loots a corpse.&lt;BR&gt;- Charmed PCs will no longer disappear after being stationary for a few seconds.&lt;BR&gt;- When alt-tabbing out of full screen mode and then re-entering the game, you should now properly be put back into full screen mode instead of windowed mode.&lt;BR&gt;- Players marked as group leaders in a raid would sometimes not have functioning leader abilities. This was happening when reforming groups in the raid and has been fixed.&lt;BR&gt;- Players will no longer remain encumbered by coin after donating that coin to a guild tribute master.&lt;BR&gt;- If a player is wearing an item with a focus effect and casts a delayed spell that utilizes that focus effect, it will no longer be negating if they use a clicky effect before it lands.&lt;BR&gt;- Fixed sync issues with removing shared tasks and tasks from a player.&lt;BR&gt;- Throwing axes will no longer throw an entire stack, instead only a single axe will be consumed from the range slot.&lt;BR&gt;- The map window should now be available to all players.&lt;BR&gt;- Fixed a problem that was causing several of the Dragons of Norrath items to have the wrong colors.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- The EverQuest Team&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Kytherea on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;02-21-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;01:46 PM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;- M.C. Tinkerton bids all in the Plane of Knowledge farewell as he packs up his Clockwork Party Machine and heads for home.&lt;BR&gt;- The issue where player pets were attacking other players when hit by an AE spell has been fixed.&amp;nbsp; Thanks to all those that helped provide information about this issue.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;December 7th, 2005&lt;BR&gt;_____________________&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** Headlines ***&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;~ Holiday Festival ~&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;M.C. Tinkerton needs help repairing his Clockwork Party Machine in time to celebrate 3199!&amp;nbsp; The party machine's dance gyroscopes, firework cannons and party favor dispensers are fully functional, but the most important piece, the machine's primary party motivator, was stolen at the zero hour.&amp;nbsp; M.C. Tinkerton seeks adventurers to steal back the primary party motivator from the Dark Mistletoe giants, a grouchy clan of frost giant nomads in the Great Divide.&amp;nbsp; Seek out M.C. Tinkerton in the Plane of Knowledge for further details. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;~ New Arena ~&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;A new arena zone is now available off of Lake Rathe!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** Tradeskill ***&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;- Shield of Maelin now uses the proper quill.&lt;BR&gt;- The following LDoN spell research recipes have been disabled:&amp;nbsp; Death's Despair, Instinctual Panic, Eidolon Bellow, Soulless Panic, Angstlich's Echo of Terror, Jitterskin, Unholy Bellow, Shadow Bellow, Call of the Muse, Guidance.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;- Jar of Clockwork Grease is now made with a Small Grease Jar in a toolbox. A Small Grease Jar is made the same way a clay jar is, except that you use a Small Grease Jar Sketch. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** Events, Missions &amp;amp; Tasks ***&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;- Additional text has been added to "Investigate a Disappearance" that should help clear up a confusing spot late in the task.&lt;BR&gt;- Soulseeker, Death's Sigh can no longer drop more than once per kill.&lt;BR&gt;- The Mask of the Hidden quest in the Ascent now resets properly after 1 hour of inactivity. &lt;BR&gt;-&amp;nbsp; Monster Mission experience now properly takes into account hell level modifiers.&amp;nbsp; These modifiers smooth out the experience curve to lessen the impact of the old hell levels (30, 35, 40, and 45).&amp;nbsp; Inclusion of these modifiers in the monster experience will cause you to gain more experience than before during hell levels, essentially returning it to a normal level, but you will gain slightly less experience than before when you are not on a hell level. &lt;BR&gt;- Within Monster Missions, you will now find Shards of Wisdom that will impart upon you the experiences of the creature you inhabit at the time.&amp;nbsp; Looting one of these shards will grant the experience to your main character upon successful completion of the mission.&lt;BR&gt;- Aid Fimli in the Plane of Knowledge will now offer to trade you a Cloak of Lesser Pernicity for a Cloak of Greater Pernicity. This is for players who wish to have the original cloak instead of the new, attunable cloak.&amp;nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;- Clockwork Commander Cogswain has outfitted his clockwork models with upgraded weaponry for the War Machines monster mission that begins in Lavastorm. He only has a limited supply of Clockwork Models in commission, so be careful with them.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;- Farsoth Mal has regained some of his power deep within the Lair of Splitpaw. Defeating him may prove a bigger challenge than before!&lt;BR&gt;- Dinner invitations to Dreadspire Keep are now flame-resistant and reusable.&lt;BR&gt;- The Performer event will now respawn properly after a failure.&lt;BR&gt;- The respawn time on many NPCs in the Demiplane of Blood has been significantly increased.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** Items ***&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;- Archaeologist Flottwit has uncovered a cache of older Darkhollow items and is currently searching the bazaar for some of the newer items for comparison. If you have a Depths of Darkhollow item that changed from tradeable to no trade with the last patch and you'd prefer to have the old tradeable item instead, give the no trade version to Flottwit and he'll give you the old tradeable item in return. Flottwit will only be around until the next patch. &lt;BR&gt;- Heartlight is now no-drop, poof-on-death, and no-rent.&lt;BR&gt;- The mixing bowl and oven now identify Rockhopper eggs more clearly. &lt;BR&gt;- The Cultural Charms should now be tradeable on Firiona Vie. &lt;BR&gt;- Sporali Battle Hammer of Spirits and Daybreak, Bringer of Light have had their proc chances modified.&lt;BR&gt;- Vule's Frozen Heart and Frozen Heart Shards now have +30 atk, +3 accuracy, and reduced weight.&lt;BR&gt;- The hitpoint and mana values on the following items have been increased: Ring of Dark Mists, Dark Void Shoulders, Jagged Coral Choker, and Pristine Illsalin Stonecraft Mask. &lt;BR&gt;- Some of the Depths of Darkhollow hp/mana augmentations were increased too much in the last patch and have been reverted to their old values.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** NPC ***&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;- Hatchet the Torturer will now always leave a corpse when slain. &lt;BR&gt;- Nitram Anizok has become interested in some of the clockwork that are near the Plane of Innovation entrance. He will now wander from his workshop and explore the entry to the plane for a few minutes before returning to his workshop.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** Titles ***&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;- Corrected an issue that prevented server-based suffixes for the Cazic Thule server from being displayed properly.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** Spells ***&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;- Renamed "Zombie Malaise" to "Wurine Guard" and "Wurine Guard" to "Zombie Malaise". This is to correct an inconsistency in the naming. &lt;BR&gt;- Corrected the spelling of "Thief" in the description for the spell Enduring Vision.&lt;BR&gt;- Capitalized "Eyes" in the spell Thief's Eyes.&lt;BR&gt;- Fixed issues with the Aura of Arcanum spells to allow better stacking with other resist buffs.&lt;BR&gt;- Summon Companion will now summon a pet even when you have Steadfast Servant up.&lt;BR&gt;- Field of Vision spells will now stay persistent through zoning.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** AAs ***&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;- Gift of Mana will no longer trigger on any spell that costs no mana to cast.&lt;BR&gt;- The monk AA Eye Gouge is now more effective and will stack better with other attack debuffs.&lt;BR&gt;- The magician AA Elemental Agility should now properly cause your pet to be hit less often.&lt;BR&gt;- Guardian of Ro ranks 2 and 3 will now properly increase the damage that your Guardian of Ro does.&lt;BR&gt;- Attempting to use Living Shield before the cool down is finished should no longer result in an error message.&lt;BR&gt;- When Bards use the Origin ability it can now be interrupted by ducking.&lt;BR&gt;- AA's should no longer vanish from your AA list until you zone.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** UI ***&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;- A bug where the UI could not be reloaded more than a few times has been fixed.&lt;BR&gt;- The 'Skills' option on the EQ menu has been moved down into the player information sub-menu.&lt;BR&gt;- Added new EQType label "Target of Target Name", type 135, at the request of the UI community.&lt;BR&gt;- Added optional "CloseButton" button to the Story Window at the request of the UI community. The default UI doesn't have this button, but if UI creators want it they can add one now.&lt;BR&gt;- The UI XML parser has been slightly optimized, slower computers may notice a slight decrease in load times.&lt;BR&gt;- Through a change to defaults.ini, the way the Evolving Item XP Transfer window opens should no longer obscure parts of the window. &lt;BR&gt;- A Bazaar Search UI bug where the All Effects filter would no longer bring up weapons with combat effects has been fixed.&lt;BR&gt;- The bandolier window is now persistent across a zone change.&lt;BR&gt;- Hotkeys in the hotbar as well as in the actions window will remain useable when you exit a monster mission.&lt;BR&gt;- It is no longer possible to get 2 group leaders in the same group in the raid window.&lt;BR&gt;- In the Bard Songs Window, all icons should now appear the same size and not overlap each other.&lt;BR&gt;- Fixed a bug with groups and raids where if group member with a shared task /raidinvites a separate player with a different shared task, the group players become bugged.&lt;BR&gt;- Fixed a crash related to minimizing the chat window to as small as it can go.&lt;BR&gt;- Swapping to a weapon configuration that includes a light source in the bandolier should now activate that light source.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** Miscellaneous ***&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;- Corpses that were under the world when a zone starts up are now moved to the safe spot of the zone. &lt;BR&gt;- Sharvahl and Hollowshade now use Luclin night settings for the sky. Previously there was no sky in these zones. &lt;BR&gt;- The /safelock command now prevents the Esc key from altering in game windows while safelock is activated. &lt;BR&gt;- You can now no longer summon a horse while controlling a boat. &lt;BR&gt;- If a tracking class enters a monster mission that has a template with track, their sort track will now work correctly afterwards.&lt;BR&gt;- /Dzadding a character that is zoning should no longer cause various bugs.&lt;BR&gt;- Various atlas typos have been corrected. Grobb was spelled Gukta; even the trolls could spell enough to tell that was wrong.&lt;BR&gt;- New Half Elves can now claim Kelethin as their starting city.&lt;BR&gt;- Fixed a problem most often seen in the Tutorial where Arias would attack the player if they use the hide ability. This was a general bug; any NPCs that were told to follow the player because of a script would agro when the player tried to hide.&lt;BR&gt;- The '/who all' command will now filter searches for Frogloks.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;November 16th, 2005&lt;BR&gt;_____________________&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** Depths of Darkhollow***&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Many of the single group attainable rewards from the Depths of Darkhollow expansion have received significant upgrades.&amp;nbsp; This includes more than 1,000 items from all over the expansion.&amp;nbsp; Also, to allow players who have deleted items a chance to get them again, the rewards you get for completing a mission the first time are now given to you whenever you complete the mission and do not already have the reward.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;We've also made many tuning changes to the DoD missions to provide a smoother ramp up in difficulty over the course of the expansion.&amp;nbsp; In general, earlier missions are now a bit easier and missions further into the expansion are now a bit more challenging, particularly the hard level missions.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** New Monster Missions ***&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;- A gnollish zealot has been spotted near the bridge in South Karana. He speaks of the rift within Paw and the final whereabouts of the son of Ishva Mal. Perhaps there is still hope for the prisoners within.&lt;BR&gt;- The Solusek Mining Company has begun recruiting clockwork pilots for a special mission.&amp;nbsp; Report to Clockwork Commander Widgetsworth in Lavastorm for further details. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** Spells ***&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;- Several of the abilities used by NPCs in the Demi-Plane of Blood have been modified.&lt;BR&gt;- The Enchanter spell Apathy of the Nihil has been replaced with Dreary Deeds, an upgrade to Forlorn Deeds.&lt;BR&gt;- E`ci's Frosty Breath and Glacier Breath are now much harder to resist.&lt;BR&gt;- Blood of the Spire is now a more potent mana preservation focus.&lt;BR&gt;- Ravenous Hunger has been changed. It is now named "Ravenous Sloth" and is a 40% duration extender on the spell "Lingering Sloth".&lt;BR&gt;- The Aura of Arcanum line of spells should now have the correct spell description.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** Items ***&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;- Pumpkin lovers rejoice! Pumpkin items now stack.&lt;BR&gt;- The spell Servant of Marr now properly requires Ink of the Companion.&lt;BR&gt;- Some of the ores that did not stack before now stack. This is from a list provided by the community.&lt;BR&gt;- The drop rate on Shards of Dark Matter has been increased. The high-end Gates of Discord bosses will now drop at least one of them every time they are killed.&lt;BR&gt;- The weight on all versions of the Mask of Horror for the Halloween event has been decreased.&lt;BR&gt;- Ensorcelled Great Sword of the Night should now proc correctly for players at level 55 and greater who can wield the sword. The Greatsword is also more visually imposing.&lt;BR&gt;- All none/none flagged containers in the game are now flagged as all/all. This should fix some issues with containers not showing up in varied item searches in the bazaar and item point vendors.&amp;nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;- Some of the "Last Blood" augmentations now have stronger focus effects.&amp;nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;- Darkhollow Constitutional will now return a normal cork, not the dissolving kind.&amp;nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;- Statuette of the Tranquil is now called "Amice of the Tranquil" and is a shoulder slot item. The AC has been increased and the avoidance has been replaced with accuracy. &lt;BR&gt;- Woven Shadow Shroud is now called "Woven Shadow Stone" and is a range slot item. The item now has points in backstab damage.&amp;nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;- Razorsharp Shortsword is now not usable by berserkers.&amp;nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;- Dragon Scale Tiara is now named "Dragon Scale Eyepatch"&lt;BR&gt;- Azure Sleeves of the Diplomat and Azure Cowl of the Diplomat have lost their +attack bonus.&amp;nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;- Azure Slippers of the Diplomat have lost their attack bonus and have received a +2 to mana regen.&amp;nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;- Eulogy, the Bloodthirsty Blade now has higher hit points. &lt;BR&gt;- Bard instruments will drop less frequently in the Demi-Plane of Blood and a maximum of once per kill.&lt;BR&gt;- The Insidious Hooded Cloak now has its specialization modifier set to alteration instead of conjuration.&lt;BR&gt;- The Ancient Werewolf Skull evolving item now has augmentation slots at each stage in evolution.&lt;BR&gt;- The Sharpshooting VI spell effect on Soulseeker, Death's Sigh is now worn instead of combat. &lt;BR&gt;- The Polished Chitin War Horn now has an augment slot.&lt;BR&gt;- Ancient Cudgel of Slaughter now has resistance modifiers. &lt;BR&gt;- Though it is still magnetic, a magnetic metal brick will no longer stick to your hands.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** Missions, Tasks &amp;amp; Quests ***&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;- Adjusted the experience reward for monster missions to better reflect the amount of effort the mission requires.&amp;nbsp; Missions that could be finished very quickly are now worth less experience and missions that are taking longer to complete are now worth more experience.&lt;BR&gt;- High Seas Rogues have regained the ability to evade!&amp;nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;- All Drachnid Hive level 65 missions should now give out the appropriate one time rewards.&amp;nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;- Artisan Dosan Vis’Moor, Vivian Selgan, and Gart Okken should now be accepting items for the tasks that they give.&amp;nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;- Additional text has been added to the "Investigate a Disappearance" task that begins in Freeport that should help clear up a confusing spot late in the task.&amp;nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;- Aid Fimli in the Plane of Knowledge will now reward you with a cloak of lesser pernicity that matches the stats of the original cloak of greater pernicity. In addition the cloak of greater pernicity has been changed to be attunable.&amp;nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;- The Misty for You quest now works properly.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** UI ***&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;- The GuildManagement window has a new tab "Information", which contains the MOTD fields, as well as two new fields for Guild web URL and Guild channel specification. These new fields are changeable by the Guild leader only.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** Tradeskills ***&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;- The spell Light of Order will now use the proper ink.&lt;BR&gt;- Poison Vials made with Crows Special Brew now show properly in the Tradeskill UI.&lt;BR&gt;- Players baking with pumpkin will now get their tools back when they mess up.&lt;BR&gt;- Players making Spiced Pumpkin Cider no longer have to hold it in their hands. The recipe now requires a bottle.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** NPCS ***&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;- The Knight of the Dread Sun will now make his appearance more often.&lt;BR&gt;- Fixed an issue in Dreadspire that could cause some of the residents of the crypt to aggro through the roof.&lt;BR&gt;- Ogres will now be able to get the thread for their cultural armor without having to fight off guards.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;- The EverQuest Team&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;October 27th, 2005&lt;BR&gt;_____________________&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** Headliners ***&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** New Default UI Skin ***&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- We have updated the default UI skin with new art and icons! This is the same artwork that has been on display on our Escape to Norrath server (www.escapetonorrath.com) and our test server. For those of you that prefer to use the old default UI Skin, you can type /loadskin default_old in your chat window and it will allow you to use the old default UI.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** Events and Seasonal Festivities ***&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- Zigan Ribshard in the Plane of Knowledge has a few friends he’d like you to meet. Speak with him for more information regarding seasonal festivities.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Community Summit Related Items:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- There is a new filter option on the guild bank to narrow your search.&lt;BR&gt;- Added a "guildbank" argument to /outputfile, allowing a player to dump the guild bank to disk. NOTE: This can only be used in the Guild Hall.&lt;BR&gt;- Players should now be able to withdraw items from the Guild Bank deposit area (if they're a Guild Banker).&lt;BR&gt;- Added Stun and Strikethrough filters/color selectors.&lt;BR&gt;- Players now have an option in the options window to determine whether or not they want other players to see them with their helm. "Show My Helm" &lt;BR&gt;- EverQuest now uses the system mouse. While in windowed mode you can freely move the mouse around as you can with any other application running in a window.&lt;BR&gt;Mouse pointer customization can be done on a UISkin level. Just make your own .cur files with the appropriate names. (Please see the default directory for the .cur names.)&lt;BR&gt;- There's a new command to launch a web browser from the chat window. Just type /www and check it out. Also for additional flexibility, /url is available.&lt;BR&gt;- There's a new command to launch an application. Check out /system for usage.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;New arena zone headed to Stormhammer! &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- Please be aware that if you login to Stormhammer and download the new arena.eqg, that file will need to be deleted if you want to login to a server other than Stormhammer. This file is located in your EverQuest root directory.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- Raid invites can now be done across zones via "/raidinvite name"&lt;BR&gt;- Bandaging other players will appear to give a healing effect again.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** Audio Triggers ***&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Audio triggers are sound effects that are played when certain patterns appear in the chat window. You can make audio triggers to play any sound you want when something you want to be sure not to miss appears in the chat window. This might be /tells from specific friends, certain buffs fading, or any other event you can think of that has a text message associated with it. The window used to configure your Audio Triggers can be accessed via the EQ button -&amp;gt; Actions -&amp;gt; Audio Triggers.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;There are a couple key ideas that make up Audio Triggers. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Audio Triggers are a collection of text patterns associated with a sound effect. The window shows a list of all active audio triggers. They are sorted by priority so that the first pattern that matches text in the chat window will be the one and only sound that is played. This allows patterns to be made, for example, "tells you" and "yourbuddy tells you" that may have different sound effects. The "Move Up" and "Move Down" commands allow you to control which patterns will be tested first. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Creating a new trigger is a simple matter of typing text in the "Pattern" field, selecting a sound in the "Sound" control, and pressing "Create". &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The other controls include:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* Apply - changes the sound selected for the current pattern. Note that changing a pattern requires a new pattern to be made.&lt;BR&gt;* Play - plays the currently selected sound again.&lt;BR&gt;* Delete - delete the currently selected trigger.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Trigger Sets&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Trigger Sets are similar to choosing a UI skin. Each trigger set represents a set of patterns associated with sounds that is stored on a per-character basis. You can switch trigger sets by selecting the drop-down control and selecting among the listed options. Unless you have installed custom Audio Trigger sets, you will only see the "default" entry. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Each trigger set is stored as a folder in the AudioTrigger folder in your EverQuest directory which can contain .wav files unique to that trigger set. The goal here is to provide a way for the player community to create and share their own Audio Trigger sets that people find useful for different classes or play styles, much like they have done for custom UI skins. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;An example of a useful trigger set may be a set of patterns &lt;BR&gt;There are many possibilities. Due to the differences in play styles, there is no way to predict what settings people might prefer so the default settings are empty. We encourage players to discover and share ways to make this a fun part of their gameplay. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Notes on customizing Audio Triggers:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* Any .wav files found in the folder .\AudioTriggers\shared will be made available to all Audio Trigger sets in the Sound selection control. You will probably want to put most of your custom sounds in this folder, unless you are making custom Audio Trigger sets.&lt;BR&gt;* Creating a new Audio Trigger set is similar to making a new UI skin. It's not complicated but it's not built into the UI. Create a folder in .\AudioTriggers\NewTriggerSetName and put any .wav files specific to this trigger set in there, and you will be able to start using the new trigger set the next time the program is started.&lt;BR&gt;* User settings for each Audio Trigger set can be found in .\userdata\AT_TriggerSetName_CharacterName_ServerName.ini. You can copy these files to other characters as needed. You will probably want to include a sample of this if you make an Audio Trigger set that you plan to share because this is what contains all the details on each specific trigger pattern and sound.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The above instructions are available in-game via the help button on the audio triggers window. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** Shrouds/Monster Missions ***&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- Tribute will now be properly disabled when in shrouded form.&lt;BR&gt;- GuildTribute is now properly disabled when in shrouded form.&lt;BR&gt;- You cannot guild invite someone who is shrouded.&lt;BR&gt;- Adjusted the power scaling of Spirit Shrouds level 55 and above. As you unlock higher tier shrouds you will see a larger difference in their power level.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** Items ***&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- Light Amphibian Hide Slippers now have the effect "Form of Protection"&lt;BR&gt;- Cultural Charms will now be able to receive augments.&lt;BR&gt;- Whisps of Potameid Hair will now drop occasionally from some of the Potameids in Jagged Pine.&lt;BR&gt;- The experience required on many of the intelligent items has been reduced significantly to bring them more in line with evolving items. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** Tradeskills ***&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- Charm Patterns now stack better!&lt;BR&gt;- Players will now be able to make journeyman’s charm patterns instead of cloth caps! &lt;BR&gt;- The spells Night Stalker and Night's Beckon now use the proper thickener. &lt;BR&gt;- Saltpeter and Crystallized Sulfur should drop about 10 times as often as they did in the past. &lt;BR&gt;- Pan Seared Orange Tuna will no longer magically transform your non stick frying pan into a stew pot if you make a mistake while making it.&lt;BR&gt;- Radiant Titanite of Quickening and Pure Quickening can now be made by rogues.&lt;BR&gt;- Scribe Rikik in Rathe Mountains found the inventory that he had lost during the move from Gukta.&lt;BR&gt;- The spell Light of Order will now use the proper ink.&lt;BR&gt;- The Darkhollow Geode task changed. Only Artisans will accept the Geode.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** NPCs ***&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- Cartographer Slipgear is reviewing his notes and discovered that some of his maps are not properly accredited. Speak with him if you have provided him with a map but not received credit for it. &lt;BR&gt;- The Knight of the Dread Sun will now make his appearance more often.&lt;BR&gt;- Atheling Plague has decided that heights aren't to his tastes, so he has left his tower.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** Quests ***&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- Added a new quest to reward players for completing the mission story arcs in Darkhollow. Speak with the old shiliskin fortune teller in Undershore for details. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** UI ***&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- There is now a button on the Options/Display page to "turn off" your helm’s graphic.&lt;BR&gt;- You will now see all text color options.&lt;BR&gt;- If you cancel a coin selection and then attempt to select crystals instead, the crystals will now appear on your cursor and not the coin.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** Miscellaneous ***&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- You will now be able to remove gold from your shared bank or regular bank if you die with an item on your cursor.&lt;BR&gt;- When using Find to find the Fishing Supply merchant you will no longer lock up.&lt;BR&gt;- Seru's animations are now fixed.&lt;BR&gt;- If a character dies while LD, Charmed or Feared the corpse can will be able to be dragged by the appropriate people.&lt;BR&gt;- We have fixed any remaining issues with setting a portion of your experience to go to AAs and then losing regular experience.&lt;BR&gt;- Client stability fix. This specifically happened while raiding with many many different types of particle clouds being used.&lt;BR&gt;- The issue involving the loss of a portion of a player's mana, hitpoints, and endurance after zoning is now fixed.&lt;BR&gt;- We have fixed the issue involved with the loss of half a player's mana, hitpoints, and endurance after zoning from a death.&lt;BR&gt;- Added some additional logging and error-checking to the Plane of Time. These changes should address the issue where an instance would not progress past Phase 1 in some circumstances.&lt;BR&gt;- Numerous raid management systems fixes have been made.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** Chat ***&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- Players in shrouded form will not auto-join class chat channels.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** Pets ***&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- Pets will once again receive HP from their items.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** Regen ***&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- Regen will work properly after becoming your main character after being a shroud. Iksars rejoice.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** PvP ***&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- You can no longer loot an item from someone else's corpse if you kill them in an arena.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** Evolving Items ***&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- You can now see the final result after adding an augment to an item.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** Spells ***&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- Detrimental spells will not be marked as used if used in a non-combat zone like PoK.&lt;BR&gt;- Several Ranger spells have been modified once again:&lt;BR&gt;* Ward of the Hunter - Replaced the ATK bonus, lowered the double attack bonus to 3%.&lt;BR&gt;* Howl of the Predator - Replaced the ATK bonus, lowered the double attack bonus to 3%.&lt;BR&gt;* Strength of the Hunter - Replaced the ATK bonus, removed the double attack bonus.&lt;BR&gt;- Greater Familiar is no longer an instant cast spell. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** Skills ***&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- Berserker axe throwing skills have had their timers modified. The stun and snare type abilities will now be on one timer, and the jolt and volley sets will be on another.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- The EverQuest Team&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;EverQuest - Live Update - 08/11/05&lt;BR&gt;----------------------------------&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;*** Headlines ***&lt;BR&gt;----------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;Gukta is no more.&amp;nbsp; The Trolls have retaken their ancestral home and torn down the remembrances of the Frogloks.&amp;nbsp; The Guktans, suffering more than just defeat, have retreated into the Rathe Mountains.&amp;nbsp; They have built a tent city to accommodate their needs, but there is something obviously wrong.&amp;nbsp; Many of their friends and family were touched by the curse laid upon the battlefield by the Warlord Ykesha. These poor souls have been corrupted.&amp;nbsp; They have been torn from the breast of Mithaniel Marr and grasped by the clutching claws of Innoruuk and turned to evil.&amp;nbsp; Yet they are cousins and brothers to the remaining Guktans and so they live together, trying to make the best of their fate.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** Items ***&lt;BR&gt;----------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;- Ancient Mist Root Stone, Refracted Dusk Amethyst, Ancient Life Root Stone, and Refracted Dawn Amethyst are now usable in the hands and wrist slots.&lt;BR&gt;- All potions that were recently introduced now have a required level instead of a recommended level.&lt;BR&gt;- Lightning Singed Mantle now has 38 AC.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** Missions ***&lt;BR&gt;----------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;- Changed the required count for the kill and loot elements on the Dragons of Norrath mission "Diseased Pumas". This change was to fix a discrepancy between the number of items required for task completion compared to the number of kills and items looted that the task said you needed.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
