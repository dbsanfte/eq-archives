      <description>The problem of them isn't weither or not they stack.  The problem is if you actually get into a situation to use the ward.  Any situation.  Well The ward is effected by the same aoe you are.  If this aoe has a DD associated with it well your sol, because the DD on the aoe will kill your pet!  So what good is a pet that is supposed to heal you, your group, or your raid, that just dies if it gets hit by the aoe!</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Can someone look at the HoT or the cure on ToTD. Many of the DoTs in game atm can out damage it. Maybe the purify is set too low? Meaning if you are lucky enough to be saved by your god that you might not actually be.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The heal component of DB also has to be looked at again to take people out of low hp aggro. Yes I do click off buffs to help me get over 20% but is that really supposed to be part of the mechanic? For those with real hp, clicking off buffs might not help.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Anyone else find the healing wards to be useless?&amp;nbsp; I mean if you use them on a fight they die if there's an aoe or anything.&amp;nbsp; They are very situational and well don't heal for that much anyways.&amp;nbsp; It would be cool if on raids clerics could cast there healing wards or cure poison/desiese wards and have them be effective.&amp;nbsp; However for most instances they ward will just die and do abosolutly no helpfull healing or helpful curing.&amp;nbsp; If we could get the developers to make it so we could have a use for these wards would be great.&amp;nbsp; Or if any clerics have found these wards to be usefull for anything plz list it below.&amp;nbsp; ATM I just feel like these wards need to be added to the list of things that need rethought.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <title>Some news</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=clericbalance&amp;message.id=11277#M11277</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;You may have noticed that the top 10 issues list hasn't been updated for quite some time, and also that some of these issues have not been addressed for an even longer time. Since this list started, many changes were made to the game, and slowly it has accumulated dead issues. They are tagged as &amp;quot;currently being discussed&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;currently being evaluated&amp;quot;, but the reality is that devs seem to have relied less and less on class lists, to the point that maintaining them is no longer efficient.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It seems to me that devs are getting feedback from other sources, and have stopped using these lists altogether. In their current incarnation, they have outlived their purpose.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I believe, however, that keeping a record of issues we have, and how we would like the game to change for us in the future, still makes sense. I also believe that restricting it to only 10 items is good and helps getting to the point.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So I have decided to cleanup and reorganize the list a little bit, which means eliminating some items and adding a couple others from &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.eqcleric.com/forums/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=10733"&gt;this thread&lt;/a&gt;. It also means that from now on we shouldn't expect to see any dev input about this list, although I hope the see the fixes coming, and to see the game move in the general direction it describes. Expect to see Kytherea post the new list soon.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Now for the news. I have been given (as well as other correspondents) the opportunity to ask questions to the devs with a real chance of obtaining answers. Of course it's a limited &amp;quot;offer&amp;quot;, and I intend to be very careful not to abuse it. It's pretty successful so far, unfortunately the proximity of E3 and the fact that Oshran (the dev in charge of AA) is too busy learning the system to answer have delayed the responses to cleric questions.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Nevertheless, expect to see me post new Q&amp;amp;A from time to time.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;You are free to post your own questions anywhere on this board of course, but for once I reserve the right to select those I find pertinent, or just mine if I see fit. The reason for this is that most questions are already answered if you do a search, but also because I expect them to take the form &amp;quot;can we have this and that?&amp;quot; which is in my opinion just a devious way to post a wishlist.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Suggestions for discussion</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=clericbalance&amp;message.id=11235#M11235</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's nice to see that there are other clerics out there who are not fully satisfied with how our class is being managed.  It seems anytime I post a suggestion for cleric change someone (usually not a cleric) feels the urge to tell me how wrong I am and insult me in the bargain.  We get complete heal .. how dare we ask for anything else?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some would relegate us to healer/rezzer/buffer alone.  I don't mind being &amp;quot;just&amp;quot; the healer most of the time but I do find it annoying that we don't get better cure abilities.  I'd also like to see broad spectrum resist spells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we can return a person from the dead isn't it logical to think that we could cure any disease/ poison/ curse without a ridiculously long recast/ AA reuse timer? Wouldn't it make sense to let us cast a group cure more than every 2.5 minutest? Many mobs recast their detrimental spells almost immediately after they are cured. Why should I have to wait to be able to counteract those detrimental affects? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We do get word of divination and I love it but why give us a group heal with cures built in but not give us a group cure without the heal built in for a more reasonable mana cost? Why should I have to use so much of my mana to cure my group when they don't need the heal portion?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would add that a buff that raises resists across the board by at least 100. Currently only bards get that ability and it's far better than anything any other class can manage.  (not including vet rewards)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I would add a focus affect that improves our cures ( much like bards get improvements to their instruments that in turn improves their cures). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Respectfully&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Divine Retribution?</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=clericbalance&amp;message.id=11199#M11199</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I've been fighting some blues lately and I've found that when I have Divine Retribution up and it stuns a mob the mob still hits me or tries to hit me. I realise that the AA adds a defensive proc and the mob has to swing at us to proc it but when it does proc the mob is still tripple atacking me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So I'm getting something like&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Mob is struck by divine retribution.&lt;br&gt;Mob hits you.&lt;br&gt;Mob tries to hit you.&lt;br&gt;Mob hits you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;So it is stunned but it still gets to hit me?&lt;br&gt;Is this just me and lag on my part or has anyone else come across this?&lt;br&gt;I think it is stopping mobs from running/moving for a little after it stuns them but it only stuns for 4 seconds. They still get to hit me when they get stunned and then again in four seconds. As they are blues to 70 would they be attacking all that quickly anyway? Am I just upping my aggro? Is this just a train to zone tool?&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Yes, I said it!  As a cleric I feel that this spell is hurting us more than helping.  It reduces all single group encounters to, &amp;quot;if the tank can live for 12 seconds, I'm just going to chain cast CH a bunch&amp;quot;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In raids we are reduced to CHO.   I want more excitement!  Get rid of CH and we would get a lot of fun cool amazing toys!  Game becomes a lot more interesting.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Sure they would have to retune a bunch of encounters, but wouldn't it be worth it?&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>GoM Clarification Please</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=clericbalance&amp;message.id=11167#M11167</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;I loved the double exp period.  I went from 67 w/ 5 AAs to 70 w/ 45 AAs.  I have been reading the forums at work since I've returned to EQ (about 2 months) and read all about the GoM/AH conflicts, etc.  I heard many people saying GoM was much better and decided that since it was fixed, I wanted to invest in it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Anyway, here is my question.  Do the different levels of GoM determine the probability of it firing on particular spells?  For example, after I trained the first level, I must have casted 300-500 heals and up to 100 nukes with no procs.  But with 15-20 casts of conviction, it fired 3 times.  But after training level 2, it has fired a few times w/ DD and HoT and every so often with heals.  I know that it has to be a spell over a certain level (67?) but it still seems that it fires more often on conviction or pious elixir.  Basically, is GoM going to proc more often on heals and DDs at level 3 or is the type of spell casted completely unaffected and level 3 will just cause an increased chance to fire?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks for the info&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>puratas (or however its spelt) sucks but...</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=clericbalance&amp;message.id=11147#M11147</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;...we all knew it would lets be honest! Apart from the (solo only) nice retribuition spell, every cleric spell sucks a lot except the level increase expansions, where all our old spells get made a bit nicer, except of course the much hated cheal. I mean really.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Puratas! It's antidote, only it (apparantly) blocks the next poison spell too! BUT crappy refresh timer makes it worse than antidote, and I got no idea where the very short block buff would help anyway.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Undead nuke with snare. It's like OOW undead nuke, only it comes with snare! The ability to snare mobs who never run away for 20 seconds was clearly overpowered though, so they made it 5% or so chance for snare to proc.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;A big heal! Well kind of big, slightly bigger than our usual heal. With some cure portion that doesnt cure anything except tash thrown in. Oh yes and a huge mana cost. This clearly needed a 30 second refresh timer, its so overpowered :/&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Aura! Well some seem to like this, but I am personally fuming that it doesn't stack with our normal vie. Every other classes auras stack with their relevant spells. And it's been downgraded to 3%! 3% FFS. LDON vie gave 10% 3 years ago. I dont give a stuff if it remains on tanks now (well those fortunate enough to be in range) 3 PERCENT SUCKS.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Chromostrike. Well I've finally got the focus ring from demi plane, so it does about the same damage as an un focused normal nuke now. Which means I use it soloing, cause I have no nuke focus for normal nukes anymore. But I still think having to win new loot just to get back to where I was before is a tad lame. I want bigger nukes.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The group hot, not got this yet  but guess could be ok, apart from the huge mana cost. We will see, will it be a good spell? I hope so. BEt its got 5 minute refresh or something lame.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Cleric Aura's (Level 70 is a waste of time)</title>

      <description>After a bit of work I managed to get my lvl 55 and lvl 70 auras for my Cleric. I wanted to verify the working of the lvl 70 aura verus the lvl 55 aura.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now granted a lvl 55 may not be as quick as me to get the lvl 55, but I still do not see the value of the lvl 70 aura. I do like the aura but I would only recommend that a cleric bother with the lvl 55 version as it stands.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lvl 55 aura&lt;br&gt;Mana: 416&lt;br&gt;Cast time: 6 seconds.&lt;br&gt;Effect: 5% melee damage reduction max 300 points&lt;br&gt;Time to aquire: 30mins.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lvl 70 aura&lt;br&gt;Mana: 500&lt;br&gt;Cast time: 3 seconds.&lt;br&gt;Effect: 5% melee damage reduction max 300 points&lt;br&gt;Time to aquire: 8 hours (3 group missions with no worth wild loot) Ohh and one boss mob has a nice 8k DD time delay nuke.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(The effects does not stack with the Vie line.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An example of a good aura. Monk lvl is 55 5% to dodge, ripost, and parry. Monk lvl 70 is 10% to dodge, ripost, and parry.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;My question is in regards to mana pres and improved healing...after the spell is cast, the item that gives you the most benefit will glow ---- right?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Have some older items had their %'es increased?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;For example:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The DON aug - preserved citrine spell stone which lists as 10% mana pres to spells up to lv70. My cleric is wearing a Mask of Simplicity ---- has effect of Preservation of Mithaniel ---- online lists this effect as 20% mana pres up to lv67...10% decrease each level you go above lv67. In theory - my mask would glow over the don aug for all spells except lv69 and lv70 right? To answer your question, this is not the case - no matter the level of the spell I cast - the mask glows each and every time...has Preservation of Mithaniel been changed?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If I remove the mask ---- the aug stone glows.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Next example:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The DON aug - ground healer stone which lists as 20% healing boost to spells up to lv70. My cleric is wearing a Mantle of Pure Spirit ---- has effect of Marr's Blessing --- online lists this effect as 30% healing boost up to lv67...10% decrease each level you go above lv68. In theory - my mantle would glow over the don aug for all healing spells except lv69 and lv70 right? To answer your question, this is not the case - no matter the level of the healing spell that I cast - the mantle glows each and every time...has Marr's blessing been changed?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If i remove the mantle ---- the aug stone glows.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Would it be prudent to sell both of these crystals back to the don merchant and buy something else or am I missing something?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Thanks for any help in this matter.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Question.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;In appropriate (non-trivial) content when you have a Knight in your group and he heals himself do you duck your heals and go for a new one or decide to hold off a few seconds before casting?&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>Curing &amp; healing ward</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=clericbalance&amp;message.id=10993#M10993</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;Hey all...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I'm contemplating getting the curing ward DoDH AA ability, and I'm just curious to know if anyone has it and would recommend it. I've heard it only cures on every other tic, and doesn't cure for much, but i'm wondering if you think it's still a fair investment for the cost. I'm imagining using it on, say, a Time raid (against Saryrn or Terris Thule) and wonder if it'd be useful in such a circumstance, or if the meagre curing is even worth the investment.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Any opinions would be more than welcome.  Or if anyone has any actual stats for the curing ward.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;For the record, I have the *healing* ward up to the sixth of eight levels, and just haven't bothered getting the last two levels of it yet.  I'm at the point now where I'm debating somewhat minor purchases.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Here is an incentive to get off your rears and fix the GoM/AH issue:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I can only guess that the reason these abilities were introduced was the encourage clerics to stop using Cheal all the time.  With both these abilities maxxed a cleric might be able to use his Pious/Ancient Hallowed Light heal and not use up all his mana in 15 to 20 casts.  However, because they are broken we will never know will we?!?!?&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>unique and religious</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=clericbalance&amp;message.id=10949#M10949</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We want something unique we want something religion based.  I think I have an idea.  It is one that is &amp;quot;stolen&amp;quot; from D&amp;amp;D 3rd edition: &amp;quot;domains&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In D&amp;amp;D 3rd edition &amp;quot;domains&amp;quot; are additional powers and spells granted by the cleric's god.  Each god has three to five domains which it &amp;quot;controls&amp;quot; and a cleric of that god chooses two of these domains.   Each domain comes with a special granted power.  Some granted powers are simply a boost in power with certain spell types (cleric casts these spells at one level higher than he is), some are abilities that a cleric would not normally have (the ability to use a weapon not normally usable by a cleric), and some are abilities that can only be used once per day (the ability to provide a party member with additional protection [improves saves]).  In addition to granted powers, each domain provides an additional spell at each level, the cleric has to choose which of his two spells per level to memorize though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think this system could be adapted to EQ.  I would think that additional spells would be out of the question since in EQ no memorization is required, but the &amp;quot;granted powers&amp;quot; piece would be  unique to the cleric class and be religious in nature since it is the god granting the cleric that power.  Now by no means would these powers be overwhelming and unbalancing.  Some of the D&amp;amp;D ones are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Air, fire, earth and water domains grant the cleric the ability to turn the respective type creature as they would an undead creature.  In EQ terms an Air domain cleric could use his Turn undead AA against Air elemental mobs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Healing domain grants a +1 cast level boost to all healing spells.  In EQ terms a small percentage healing boost that stacks with other foci.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strength domain grants the ability to perform a feat of strength once per day.  in eq terms a short duration extreme strength bonus.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;War domain grants the cleric the ability to use a weapon type specific to the god he worships even if that weapon is not normally available in his repitiore and gets a bonus to hit and atk when using a weapon of that type.  In EQ terms, like the druid having access to scimitar weapons, a cleric of a specific god could have access to a specific 1hs weapon (i.e a dwarf can weild a battle axe).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trickery domain grants the cleric Bluff disguise and hide as class skills.  In EQ terms, the cleric in question would be granted the hide and sneak skill though limited to a reasonable cap.  (this one may be too powerful as invis is the one thing all clerics want :smileywink: ).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I would do, is establish a quest/mission NPC in each home temple that would detail each granted power of the god in question (remember each god has limited access to what powers it can grant), so that each player can make an informed decision as to what he/she wants.  Once the decision is made, the cleric then goes on a series of quests.  At first, the rewards are items with click or focus effects that provide the granted power.  Initial quests are simple so that any level 20 (fassume these quests start after the tutorial) and up can do them, but the rewards are equally &amp;quot;simple&amp;quot;.  As the cleric completes quests/missions the items steadily improve.  Eventually however, items normally acquired in the game will out perform those granted through this quest series.  So, at some point (probablly around level 51) the quests change from rewarding items to rewarding AAs providing passive improvements or clickable abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Cleric Issue List</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=clericbalance&amp;message.id=10902#M10902</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;3. Please evaluate the defensive skills and abilities of clerics. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;knight will have varying results on actual damage taken (not hit rate, which is controlled by secondary skills, but actual damage per hit) It is our belief that clerics have enough real penalties due to lack of secondary skills (riposte, parry, AA), that also having soft caps and tables that lead to different results with the same skills is excessive and detrimental.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#66cc00"&gt;Was this not handled already?  A short time ago, the developers announced that they were &amp;quot;correcting&amp;quot; this problem by changed the Cleric AC table to mimic bards instead of casters.  Is #3 different or the same?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="timetext1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;7. Add more lore and quests related to religion &lt;font color="#339999"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(NEW)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;At lower level clerics can see how their chosen race and religion impact their EQ life.  They can complte specific quests (symbol), and must take faction into account.  As they level up, religion no longer make any difference.  We would like to see religion matter again in the game, with new deity-specific quests and items for instance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="timetext1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#66cc00"&gt;Thank goodness something new.  The Invis issue is off the list.  Some are not going to be very happy about it, but I personally feel (as I have said many times) Sony has done enough and has made regular invisibility very accessible to clerics (and other non-invis spell classes).  The solution may not be popular, but it is usable and balanced.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>
