</BLOCKQUOTE>Yeah, I did say that somewhere (I remember saying it, just not sure where =p). And yeah, it was more of a theoretical "everything gets upgraded eventually" than a definitive. Though, when we do phase out the LDoN augment, <STRONG>I'd rather it be from a quested/single group source than a raid source. You raiders don't do enough non-raid content in the game in my opinion.</STRONG> <STRONG>Plus, providing more chances for varied demographics of our game (raiders versus casuals in this case) to group up and accomplish a common goal, the better.</STRONG><BR><BR>

<P>Can I be very honest and say the bolded portion of that statement scares me? I can surely appreciate the intent behind it and hope that it can/does/will happen. The problem is the gear gap between raiders (in full raid gear) and non raiders (in full non raid gear) is so large at this point that it can only be measured in terms of levels over the current cap. I say that based on my guild group's attempt to take down the 68.3 boss at 70 (100% failure) and doing it again last week with 2x 75/74/72. Night and day in a way that can only be captured by reading full raid gear accounts of how easy the DoD arcs are from well over a year ago. If an upgrade to the charm is implemented in a way such as those arcs there will be a wave of melded demographics but once it has crested and moved on there will be significant numbers of people who wont be able to get it until the next level bump; is my fear anyway.</P>
<P>I do not overly envy the dev's jobs. The problem with content is, at this&nbsp;point, you almost have to tweak it&nbsp;not by what level the intended targets are but what they will likely be wearing. The up and down shifts in the TSS endzones are an evidence of this I believe.<BR></P>
