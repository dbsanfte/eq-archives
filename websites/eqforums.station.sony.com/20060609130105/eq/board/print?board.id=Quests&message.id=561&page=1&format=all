<DIV></DIV>Yeah, about this big nasty dragon, is he gonna be there permanently?&nbsp; Those of us who raid Nagafen on a regular basis found him to be somewhat of an inconvenience heh.&nbsp; We worked around him and went in through Sol A zone to Naggy's Lair, but still, it was a thorn in our side, hehe.&nbsp; Any clues?
