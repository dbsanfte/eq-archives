      <description>Wouldn't that like me just saying I am JASC "Just another slow class"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is just so much more to my class then that is true as well to rangers. We are not that single dimensional and rather short sited to think otherwise.</description>

What competition do you have?  You have chanters and beastlords.  Beastlord is not competition and the hast/slow combo makes your only real copetition an enchanter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If we are not an archery class (SoE confirmed), not a crowed control class, not a heal class, etc. our main contribution is our melee and we compete at melee damage with zerkers, rogues, monks, pallies, SKs, warriors and even bards and beastlords to an extent.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We should be like Bards and Beastlords where groups recognize we may not excel in one category but we add value through diversity.  In reality though groups for most of the game do not consider rangers to add the same utility that a BL or Bard does.  They see us as a melee class cause thats all we do proficiently (root breaks too easy compared to other crowed control, snare is overwritten by other snares, buffs suck, paper tanks, blah bla blah you've heard it all before).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I get very tired of rangers saying its all how you play.  I want to know what other rangers do to make THEIR root stick but mine breaks.  I want to know what other rangers do at level 50 to make their dps comparable to a rogues.  I don't see how the blatently obvious details of our class to other classes continue to evade rangers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Good for you if your level 70 with 300 AAs and you have developed a reputation.   Some of us don't play enough to have a reputation.  We are judged by our class and level and we are not judged favorably.</description>

      <description>*sigh* anyone want tell the guy I am a beastlord?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;'we add value through diversity."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you are talking about the only diversity I really have from you is that fact you do superior DPS then I do and having the same utility outside of slow. Yeah I say things break even between our classes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Listen. No one gets a bard just to pull, they do expect them to do the other things they bring with them. Just as they might get you to pull, grant it oudoors only, snare, and DPS....but they do expect you to throw out hunter and maybe some other buffs, help cover with some healing, and maybe hold off an add if you have no other way to CC.. and how you do it is up to you of course.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you are sitting there just meleeing and doing nothing else when you can be doing anyone of those things mentioned above then yeah your JAMC...but it isn't something that your class is restricted to. You restricted yourself to it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If other rangers are telling you "it is how you play" then maybe they are right. *shrug*&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"I want to know what other rangers do at level 50 to make their dps comparable to a rogues. I don't see how the blatently obvious details of our class to other classes continue to evade rangers."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2 things wrong with this as well&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. your DPS should not compare to rogues, it is what they do and they are suppose to be the best at it melee wise....get use to it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. Your not the only class who feels like their problems are just being avoided. Browse the other boards for awhile.</description>

      <description>*sigh  yourself if our utility doesn't work then all we are is melee and in comparison to other melees we aren;t very good.  My point was not to argue for better DPS which is the path most of these end up going but to make our crap work.  If root stuck for more than a tick and we could mitigate enough damage to offtank then classes might see rangers differently but as it stands they don't recognize our utility cause it brakes too often for the group to depend on.  SO to a forming group we are JAMC and not a very good one by comparison.</description>

      <description>THis is the ranger defintion area and the definition of a ranger for SoE - JAMC - just another melee class - not a tank, not healer bla bla bla its been said again and again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are just another melee class - nothing special, nothing unique, no value added - JAMC</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;You know, I am not denying we have some issues, but I am a far smurfing cry from just another melee class.&amp;nbsp; I suppose I could be played like "JAMC" but at the moment I use all my tools to the best of my abilities, and given the spell changes and triple attack am even feeling a little love from the Devs.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I am just another melee class that can pull, snare, nuke, do nice dps, heal for 1700/3400, apply admittedly minor buffs, solo, do some tanking.................&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I want to do some of these things better, and I try to post constructive posts suggesting changes.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Are you serious?&amp;nbsp; You don't give any indication of your level or progression, and give a litany of inaccuracies and half statements bashing the class as a whole?&amp;nbsp; Why?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Since you didn't specify I am going to address your response as best I can assuming you're somewhere in the 65-70 range.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;A)pull - in outdoor zones I have it easy, that B) best snare in the game thing is all it takes to pull 99% of EQ.&amp;nbsp; -50 chromo lands very well, even when root is iffy, I pull in most of my groups indoor and out.&amp;nbsp; Unless there is a bard around, in which case I whine for Yelwins and clicks while I dps.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;B) -50 chromatic is game changing, it is the best snare and lots can be done with it.&amp;nbsp; Even the -20 level 61 version is great.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;C) Nuke.................5 second cast, and don't forget the dot that seems to always run 11 ticks for me and is a nice dps bump.&amp;nbsp; A resist mod wouldn't suck, but most real resistant mobs I fight are in groups with a debuffer present.&amp;nbsp; And can we get any more casual options for FT?&amp;nbsp; I have a high AA count but am not even fully elemental flagged, 16FT, 4 from AA, and the EASY to get MP5 aug from DoN.&amp;nbsp; FT drops in GoD 1 group content, FT in LDoN and DON, radiant tourmaline in the bazaar.&amp;nbsp; Lack of FT is like lack of hp's and melee focuses, and speak more for your gear choices then the class as a whole.&amp;nbsp; Nuking increases my dps, dotting increases my dps, so mana regeneration is a factor just like it is for every spell caster in the game.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;D) DPS - Well, I agree, lots of people bring dps to the group, but I don't decide I'm going to dps today and leave all my healing, CC'ing, offtanking abilities up in the tree.&amp;nbsp; I bring nice DPS in addition to those.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;E)Healing................Nope, you don't have to have tons of AA to be a respectable healer, and now you don't even need to get one of those new fangled runes, Chloroblast heals for 1044, at a better rate of efficiency then the OoW heal.&amp;nbsp; With ZERO AA you are slinging a 1k heal.&amp;nbsp; I had maxed healing AA before the changes AND the OoW heal and was happy as hell healing for 1k.&amp;nbsp; That was like 4 months ago..........&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;F) Buffs - I think these need work, but I cast GoE and Pred, and SotH if no Pallies or BL's are in group.&amp;nbsp; Pets in groups without a cleric get skin.&amp;nbsp; I think we should have cabbage, but as you said I don't feel buffs are my primary concern.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;G) Solo.................Well gear is going to be a big part here, but I solo tons of stuff.&amp;nbsp; I can "take an eternity" in Yxxta root shoot/rotting for about an AA an hour.&amp;nbsp; I can melee and self regen and heal (that's a big one).&amp;nbsp; I don't do as well as a necro kiting, or some pet classes, but mages and BL's don't get root, so I solo some things they cannot albeit a bit more slowly.&amp;nbsp; We do ok in the solo hierarchy.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;H) tanking - Well, I think we need some improvement here, but I tank level 70 DoN's anywhere but the nest semi often, and spent a few days duoing with a shaman friend in RCoD for a drop he wanted not too long ago (means sham heal and slow, me tanking).&amp;nbsp; I am an adequate emergency tank as well.........while I believe our avoidance and mitigation needs improvement, and defensive AA make a huge difference, I have the best balance of quick agro and decent durability of non platies.&amp;nbsp; We managed to win a fear trial a while back losing a tank on the first wave, I tanked while cleric Divine rezzed and stuck buffs then the Sk took over again&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;You know, I am not denying we have some issues, but I am a far smurfing cry from just another melee class. I suppose I could be played like "JAMC" but at the moment I use all my tools to the best of my abilities, and given the spell changes and triple attack am even feeling a little love from the Devs.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I am just another melee class that can pull, snare, nuke, do nice dps, heal for 1700/3400, apply admittedly minor buffs, solo, do some tanking.................&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I want to do some of these things better, and I try to post constructive posts suggesting changes.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I stand by "JASP"&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Lets break that down:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I am just another melee class that can:&lt;BR&gt;A) pull - in outdoor zones if you have enough AAs for the upgrade to harmony, &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;B) snare - this is true we still hve one of the best snares&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;C) nuke - If you have the uber gear with FT at a significant level cause we don't get mana regen component on our regen line like beastlords or a FT song like bards so compared tot he other jack of all trades... not a compelling argument&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;D) do nice dps - Yes we can but so can everyone else if that is waht we4 BRING TO THE GROUP then the group can easily bring others and probably find better.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;E)heal for 1700/3400 - again have to have a ton of AAs/levels to be respectable healer, Rangering should be fun before getting to the end not just at the end.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;F) Apply admittedly minor buffs - Not terribly concerning - to me buffs are a caster thing and I view Rangers primarily as a melee/archery/utility class. Let the folks on horsback cast their buffs.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;G) Solo - With the FT gearthis is possible but to heal after the fight and get tot he next one have to have pretty hefty mana regen cause were fighting not medding, alternatively we can take an eternity to kill the mob by root and shoot either way any pet class solos much more efficiently.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;H) Do some tanking - Perhaps thats where my LFG strategy is wrong, I should /ooc "tank looking for group" and I am sure I will get more takers.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;At best rangers are 5th puller (if in an outdoor zone and you have the appropriate number of AAs),4th tank, 4th slower (if you have the gear), 5th healer (if you have the AAs), 4th crowed controller (if you have the AAs), 3rd jack of all trades, and 4th DPS. Their is no unique service we provide to the group or RAID that they can't better from THREE other classes. We are competative in melee dps so lets just be honest and admit it:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sony defines rangers as = JAMC&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Are you serious?&amp;nbsp; You don't give any indication of your level or progression, and give a litany of inaccuracies and half statements bashing the class as a whole?&amp;nbsp; Why?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Since you didn't specify I am going to address your response as best I can assuming you're somewhere in the 65-70 range.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;A)pull - in outdoor zones I have it easy, that B) best snare in the game thing is all it takes to pull 99% of EQ.&amp;nbsp; -50 chromo lands very well, even when root is iffy, I pull in most of my groups indoor and out.&amp;nbsp; Unless there is a bard around, in which case I whine for Yelwins and clicks while I dps.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;B) -50 chromatic is game changing, it is the best snare and lots can be done with it.&amp;nbsp; Even the -20 level 61 version is great.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;C) Nuke.................5 second cast, and don't forget the dot that seems to always run 11 ticks for me and is a nice dps bump.&amp;nbsp; A resist mod wouldn't suck, but most real resistant mobs I fight are in groups with a debuffer present.&amp;nbsp; And can we get any more casual options for FT?&amp;nbsp; I have a high AA count but am not even fully elemental flagged, 16FT, 4 from AA, and the EASY to get MP5 aug from DoN.&amp;nbsp; FT drops in GoD 1 group content, FT in LDoN and DON, radiant tourmaline in the bazaar.&amp;nbsp; Lack of FT is like lack of hp's and melee focuses, and speak more for your gear choices then the class as a whole.&amp;nbsp; Nuking increases my dps, dotting increases my dps, so mana regeneration is a factor just like it is for every spell caster in the game.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;D) DPS - Well, I agree, lots of people bring dps to the group, but I don't decide I'm going to dps today and leave all my healing, CC'ing, offtanking abilities up in the tree.&amp;nbsp; I bring nice DPS in addition to those.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;E)Healing................Nope, you don't have to have tons of AA to be a respectable healer, and now you don't even need to get one of those new fangled runes, Chloroblast heals for 1044, at a better rate of efficiency then the OoW heal.&amp;nbsp; With ZERO AA you are slinging a 1k heal.&amp;nbsp; I had maxed healing AA before the changes AND the OoW heal and was happy as hell healing for 1k.&amp;nbsp; That was like 4 months ago..........&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;F) Buffs - I think these need work, but I cast GoE and Pred, and SotH if no Pallies or BL's are in group.&amp;nbsp; Pets in groups without a cleric get skin.&amp;nbsp; I think we should have cabbage, but as you said I don't feel buffs are my primary concern.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;G) Solo.................Well gear is going to be a big part here, but I solo tons of stuff.&amp;nbsp; I can "take an eternity" in Yxxta root shoot/rotting for about an AA an hour.&amp;nbsp; I can melee and self regen and heal (that's a big one).&amp;nbsp; I don't do as well as a necro kiting, or some pet classes, but mages and BL's don't get root, so I solo some things they cannot albeit a bit more slowly.&amp;nbsp; We do ok in the solo hierarchy.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;H) tanking - Well, I think we need some improvement here, but I tank level 70 DoN's anywhere but the nest semi often, and spent a few days duoing with a shaman friend in RCoD for a drop he wanted not too long ago (means sham heal and slow, me tanking).&amp;nbsp; I am an adequate emergency tank as well.........while I believe our avoidance and mitigation needs improvement, and defensive AA make a huge difference, I have the best balance of quick agro and decent durability of non platies.&amp;nbsp; We managed to win a fear trial a while back losing a tank on the first wave, I tanked while cleric Divine rezzed and stuck buffs then the Sk took over again&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Ted, I say again, just another spam post.&amp;nbsp; I've been playing this class for a long time, and have seen lots of changes and am far, far from uber (magelo below).&amp;nbsp; Casuals have seen a lot of love lately, and the Devs last couple moves have left me shocked when they occurred because they were nice improvements.&amp;nbsp; Sony did well with healing, did better with the nuke cast times, and triple attack was beautiful.&amp;nbsp; I am not trying to be antagonistic, but is it possible that playing your ranger as just another melee class is connected to your difficulty to get groups?&amp;nbsp; I feel like a pretty useful toon.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>Interesting that your stuff works at 60 because at 62 mine does not (though it does work better than it did at 60).  Camo still breaks regularly at the most inopportune time, root still breaks after a single tick often enough that groups get pissed if you try to root mobs for crowed control.  I already said in another thread how a pickup RAID was forming and I and another handful of rangers hailed raid leader etc and had others from guilds ask for us to be invited and RAID leader filled RAID with other classes but left us waiting in Plane of Tranquility as "their is nothing a ranger can do that we can't get better from antoher class, they don't add any value to this RAID".  54 people in the raid and he would't invite a ranger cause 46-65 we are percieved to be JAMC and not a very good one by comparison unless we have uber gear and sunk 6 hours a day into AAs for the last 2 years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are supposed to be the best scouts in the game and we don't even get Improved Superior Camo!?!?!?</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Well, I am able to peel with snare and CC with root ... unless they summon&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;My DPS is good, i use ranged for low aggro good DPS and melee for high aggro DPS&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I tank in PoV just fine&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Heals .... well no comment&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;My buffs are liked&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;My nukes work decent &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I harmony pull just fine&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I can forage some stuff for tradeskills or to sell&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I can track named for the group in instances or wherever I choose to&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Not grossly overpowered at anything, but extremely versatile while remaning effective.&amp;nbsp; I actually enjoy playing my level 60 ranger with 33 AAs more than my level 70 Paladin with 850 AAs for those qualities.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

I enjoy the versatility of the class too (at least where it works) because we can't do any of those things as well as at least 3 other classes per job.  Most pickup groups judge you not by your gear or individual ability but of the overall impression of what Rangers can add to a group.  The perception we are fighting is that we are JAMC.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yes I think we are versatile when stuff works but I also think groups are reluctant to consider that versatility an assett while it is so inconsistent.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Example we are "the scout class", and yet we have inferior camouflage spell to our Druid parent class (unless we have the AAs yes I know but camo AA is an improvment on improved superior cam).  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first time you root park an add in ooW only to have root last 2 ticks then try to re-root while he is beating on you and th group pretty quickly realizes not only does ranger crowed control not work (root anyway) but now the rangers is sucking up  healer resources to keep them alive, not contributing DPS cause he/she has to go over to the add every tick or 2.  It is less effective than not haveing them do it in the first place.  Better off have the ranger just DPS and let someone whose stuff works take care of the add.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I see rangers pulling all the time, I see rangers DPSing all the time, I see some rangers tanking and asked to join to tank, I see rangers resort to archery when their melee is more aggro when the tank can handle while maintaining great DPS.&amp;nbsp; What are you asking for?&amp;nbsp; Do you want to be THE puller, THE CCer, THE DPSer, THE tank?&amp;nbsp; If you feel that we are JAMC, well then welcome to the club because ALL melees fit that category.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;With my Paladin and his experiences regards to Rangers.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Doing Sewers of Nihilia for the KT flag I &lt;STRONG&gt;always&lt;/STRONG&gt; wanted a Ranger there to scout ahead before we invis past parts and track for named.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Doing Tipt/Vxed I &lt;STRONG&gt;always&lt;/STRONG&gt; wanted a Ranger to pull and even WS named sometimes.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Hunting in WoS I &lt;STRONG&gt;always&lt;/STRONG&gt; wanted a Ranger to track named so we get a good shot at them, and that Ranger is expected to be our puller as well.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;In all groups I always considered the Rangers DPS as a big factor for taking him and their buffs in a melee heavy group are valuable.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;With no CCer I turn to Rangers as the root CCers for their survivability to snare-peel and root-park adds or offtank.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;In MPG trials I put Rangers on top of the list because of their sustained and versatile DPS that remains remarkably high&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;And if you are dying to an add in 2 hits, then you are not truly fit for that zone, rather you are being carried thru it.&amp;nbsp; Even then you have a nice a disc that works every 72 minutes, and if the 24 seconds of Weaponshield isn't long enough for you to properly park a mob then&amp;nbsp; you are doing something wrong or in over your head.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Well&amp;nbsp; Cellan , you make some very very good points there.&amp;nbsp; There is only a quick comment to be made really. Its about the spell root ( i use earthen root highest end we get).&amp;nbsp; I do use root and use it often , as CC in a grp (when needed) or on raids (alot more often then one would think)&amp;nbsp; and once in a while on down time when i dont feel like grp'in and go solo.&amp;nbsp; I dont think the previous guys was say he wanted the be THE CC guy , but using root as often as i seem to , seeing its random duration can become frustrating at times.&amp;nbsp; In grp's it becomes a reliability / liability factor.&amp;nbsp; In raids its can become disaturous. Solo its just annoying.&amp;nbsp; This has been discussed in other areas ( top 10)&amp;nbsp; as one of the "being looked into" or "underreview". This spells needs upgrading. As far as the rest of you r post goes though ....Right on Man. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;P.S Forgot one thing , you said ....."if your dying to a mob in 2 hits you are not ruly fit for that zone"......well i know your point here, but Go to Tacvi , not even a named but the "inbetween" guys will one round alot of folk let alone&amp;nbsp;a ranger, Just pokin fun, but there are badies out there that will do this to the best of the best &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;As a Paladin main and playing a Ranger I gotta agree with you.&amp;nbsp; The only class that seems to have a truly reliable root is Druid.&amp;nbsp; I do notice that Ranger roots are slighly more reliable than the Paladin root, yet paladin root is VERY fast to cast (something I would contend Rangers should have as well as a sort of Tangling&amp;nbsp; Weeds of root line).&amp;nbsp; But with a mob snared and rooted, there should still be ampler time to recover in a root-break situation still allowing you to react and reposition and reroot mobs and still survive a couple a hits while doing so if needed.&amp;nbsp; It isn't quite along the lines of mezzing, but I consider Ranger ghetto-mezzing the best thing next to real mezzing since druids tend to get pwned trying unless overgeared for the content.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;and ya, people get pwned quick in places like that, but then again ... if you are relying on rangers offtanking to root stuff in a high-end raid then you are just asking for trouble LOL.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Personally, I am happy with my Ranger.&amp;nbsp; I do agree there are things that really need to be looked at just as with all classes.&amp;nbsp; But people know the verstality of a Ranger and when a Ranger doesn't step into these little roles as needed or expected, they will usually catch heat from the group.&amp;nbsp; Not the best at what we do, but effective at the many things we do is how I see it.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;i have to disagree with the pallies&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;anyone can track a named if you are at a static camp in wos, bard/druid are close enough to work&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;bard is a better puller with fade and can debuff and slow on inc&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;until you get don snares, our snares are heavily resisted in god and oow&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;our root sucks you cant reliably root park&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;the loss of atk is outweighed by bbb's hps, the atk cap means the buff does nothing on a group or raid&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;saying that aas can make up for a lot but thats not balancing thats a penalty.&amp;nbsp; i prefered tanking in wos rather than&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;sk/war/pally tanking found it easier on healer mana and my dps wasnt hit that much&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;anyone can track a named but the ability to filter your track and prioritize it makes a big difference.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;sure a bard is a better puller, so is a monk.&amp;nbsp; but does that mean rangers cannot pull effective and are not taken as pullers in groups?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;my level 60 Ranger was in WoS at the tents today.&amp;nbsp; I was landing snares and never got more than 1 resist per mob with no resist debuffs being done.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;root does need work, but root still works.&amp;nbsp; if you have an add in your camp with no CCer do you leave it alone to run loose just because root doesn't work?&amp;nbsp; do you think your group would put up with that for long?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;my paladin doesn't take BBB if there is a Ranger around.&amp;nbsp; I live with SoH even when tanking.&amp;nbsp; If you aren't expecing to take dmg then your HPs aren't that important ... but even with attack caps you still make gains and DPS stacks infinitely.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Tanks are almost required to come with a full set of tanking AAs and warriors with WA5 to be seriously considered.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Noone is truly required to have AAs to play the game, but alot of classes are expected to have them before going to some places without being laughed at.&amp;nbsp; May I point your attention to this thread as an example discussing impressions or whatever --&amp;gt; &lt;A href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Paladin&amp;amp;message.id=4655" target=_blank&gt;http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Paladin&amp;amp;message.id=4655&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp; It's just the nature of the beast that people want developed and experienced players to do a good grind with.&amp;nbsp; Noone wants to group with a level 70 in MPG with 2 AAs and Kunark loot.&amp;nbsp; But that doesn't make the class penalized or weak.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
