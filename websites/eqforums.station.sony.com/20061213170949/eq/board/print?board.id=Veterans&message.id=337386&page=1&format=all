<P>No worries, I still hate players just as much as before (the pain runs deep I tell ya). </P>
<P>In an ideal world (or in this case, game world), there would be a ton of different pieces of geomotry, and a ton of different textures to go with that geo, for each armor class type. So you'd see 3-4 versions of plate looking armor geo-wise, for example, and 6-8 versions of textures to go along with it, giving you a good 18-24 different combinations of armor. Not to mention having particle point attachments to armor, which would give even more possibilities (a particle like a black cloud that swirls from your arms/shoulder slot all the way down to your hands, for example). Now, this armor would be armor-class specific, not race specific as it is now in EQ (think Ogre plate chestpiece versus High Elf plate chest piece and how different they look). What this means is, each race would look extremely similar in the same armor set.</P>
<P>Now, with that many combinations, a few exclusive textures can be made that would be "epic armor". A paladin's epic armor, for example, would be all white, glowing, and regal in look (personally, I'd say it should be purple and pink with hearts and ponies on it, but I'm betting the artists and players&nbsp;would attack me). And then we can do really unique looking armor for each class that would stand out and give you that same type of feeling that the old Planar armor gave. Remember that feeling where you could spot out that cleric in their Ethereal Mist armor from a mile away and know they put a lot of time in their armor? That was cool and would be nice to have again.</P>
<P>Now will this happen in EQ? Probably. Will it happen very soon? Probably not. We need new character models that load their armor as attachments instead of skins on the model the way the current ones work. The Drakkin model was our first real 'test' into finding out how much programming and art resources were required to make the model, and now we have a better understanding of what it takes, so expect a revamped race(s) in the next couple of expansions. I personally am excited just for the simple fact that we will have the ability to make cool and unique armor once the models are done.</P>
<P>Anyway, epic armor would be cool, but that's more of a personal dream of mine than something that will happen anytime soon.</P>

<P>Oh, and to note, before someone says "omg you guys are so unoriginal, FFXI already did this." I'd agree, it's not an original idea. I played FFXI a bit when it came out and their "Artifact Armor" which is similar to epics was really impressive.&nbsp;Below is a good page to view what they have for epic armor for each job (class) in their game for each race. Note for example that the Red Mage armor (Red armor with a feather in the cap) for a Taru Taru (the short dudes) looks very similar to the Red Mage armor of the Elvan Male (the tall elvish dudes...duh).</P>
<P><A href="http://www.randomdialogue.net/gallery/ffxiarmor" target=_blank>ttp://www.randomdialogue.net/gallery/ffxiarmor</A></P>
<P>While the art is a little too Asian for EverQuest, it does give a good example of how epic armor would work and feel.</P>

<P>On a more serious not: I would definitely love some epic armor and I don't see any problem in the fact that other games have used that before. In fact, EQ's real strength in the last years has been the ability to adept, to see what makes other games good in some aspects and bring them over into thw world of Norrath.</P>

				<DIV>Let's try this -&nbsp; when a player hits a certain level they get their epic one automatically, next plateau they get epic 1.5, and so on. Blending this in with the thread where a person is asking why not take the level restrictions off spells, I think the level a person gets the epic 1.0 should be level 5, with 1.5 taking much longer, possibly up to level 20. This would mean making some skills available earlier too, a warrior with epic at level 5 should naturally need dual wield. </DIV>

Why?<br>Because epics are good content.&nbsp; Add a lot of raiding to the game, and people like them, and like quests.<br><div></div>

<P>My only hope is that the "Epic" style of availability will continue as it has, at least from 1.0s. Anyone should be able to obtain the Epic... it's the QUEST that is "epic", not the rarity or availability of the item.</P>
<P>I've read some hints that Epics should be 'rare' or 'limited' in some form or fashion, and I disagree with that line of thought. If Devs want to create/load in "Artifacts" or other super-rare items, that's cool. But the idea of a lengthy quest, the end of which grants you a reward that is prized and potent for the level attained and time invested, is something that any player, from casual to hard-core, should be able to experience.</P>
<P>With that said, I DO think it would be awesome if Sony would create Epic armor quests. Even if it's only for select pieces (and not whole suits), I think it'd be super cool. Lengthy quests, lots of lore, that anyone can undertake, for good rewards. That's how I hope they remain.</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>Yeah, but that's a somewhat hacky system. We've talked about doing full suits of armor, or grouping items into a specific 'set' and giving out a bonus, so it's definitely a possibility at some point. It's just not a high priority right now.
