				Should be plenty of content for future episodes just going through the general development news and key issues for the games. If you want to throw in some inside info at SOE that would be extremely cool also. I was listening to VirginWorlds #14 which made some very relevant points on the SOE podcast that I agree with - one especially that things sounded a bit scripted at times. Perhaps a little banter during the interviews would work well, although maybe not to the extent of the mogarmy show! Still, the content was extremely well delivered and you are all excellent speakers.<br><br><br><div></div>
