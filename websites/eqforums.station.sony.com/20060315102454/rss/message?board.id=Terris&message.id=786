    <description>Making another zone with suspended timers for everyone would be a big problem imo. Right now, if you're in a guild and enter your guild hall, it's all fine because it's a instanced zone. Any lag in there is only going to effect those that decided to go there and sit around.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now imagine if they made the guild lobby buff suspended for example. Imagine the crowding. The zone would be insanely laggy. No one would ever be in pok. They would simply make the guild lobby the new PoK. And of course people would want banks in there, more vendors, stones to all the places, etc. Think about the size differences.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just food for thought.</description>

      <title>DoN biased?</title>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I dont have DoN yet. But I can tell you I wont get it until this issue is resolved. Currently guilded players can enter the Guild Hall and their buffs are suspended, even when not in raid format. So a tagged player can get fully buffed, enter the guild hall and then LFG for hours, never losing a buff. (I cannot 100pct confirm this without the expansion, but&amp;nbsp;in game people are telling me it's a correct statement)&amp;nbsp;Unguilded players do not have that luxury. None of my toons are guilded and I won't tag them simply to suspend buffs. Thats a bias. Unguilded players should have the ability to suspend buffs IF guilded players can do it without being in raid form. Now if it were only in raid form that the Guild Hall actually worked for buff suspension, it's a different scenario. Maybe thats a fix. Another fix could be to make one the the neutral zones buff suspended for everyone. Everyone who is in agreement with me /feedback.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The Guild Hall is a nice addition for "Guild issues", but players should not reap benefits as an individual over an untagged player just because they are in a guild. Benefits should only be bestowed for guild functions.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Disclaimer: If I am wrong in my statement and unguilded players can enter the guild hall and suspend their buffs while LFG, then disregard this, but I think I am correct.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Don't get me Wrong Leg, I like you.&amp;nbsp; But I think you are 99% wrong with what you are saying.&amp;nbsp; Every expansion has its benefits, if you don't have Gates of Discord, you don't get the Guild Tribute nor the Leadership aa's.&amp;nbsp; If you don't get Planes of Power 1 ur missing out on a great zone called the Plane of Knowledge and 2 correct me if I'm wrong you don't get aa's, I wouldn't know this because I bought&amp;nbsp;all of the expansions when&amp;nbsp;I first started playing so didn't&amp;nbsp;give me a chance to see if aa's were given before/after PoP. &amp;nbsp;So yes you do miss out on that buff suspension deal, but just put your characters in an alt guild, real life buddies, good eq buddies something like that... I do agree with you on like 1% that I believe it shouldn't be the whole Guild Hall that gets the suspension, it should be limited to the lil hot tub in there, but I think it'd take a lot of programing to get it to lock buffs and not because of which pixel you are standing on.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I can see your point about certain expansions bringing certain benefits. But, even if someone "buys" the expansion, they still dont get the benefit. They have to join a guild. So if I choose not to buy the expansion, then heck no, don't give me the AA's, benefits ect. But if I buy the expansion...?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;As far as guild tribute goes, your right. If you don't own GoD, you don't get it. But....Guild Tribute is not available to the entire guild such as the Guil Hall is. It's activated and deactivated on raids by certain people. Your normal Joe Schmoe from &amp;lt;Guild_01&amp;gt; can't use Guild Tribute at 4am when there are only 3 members on, but he can waltz in to the Guild Hall.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;As far as PoK? Well, thats a zone available to everyone now, even if they don't have the PoP expansion...&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Make expansions, make me work harder to get new and better gear, make me work harder to get new and better AA's...all fine and dandy...&amp;nbsp;but you make me associate myself with a group of people, I got issues. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I bought it anyway. Simply because there were a couple things I wanted. But, you know me...none of my seven alts are tagged and Legion is still Nocturnal. I won't sway on that part. For me joining a guild needs to be more than just use of guild hall. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I still think it's biased. Don't expect a change from Sony&amp;nbsp;or anyone to agree with me, but you got my two copper anyway! My view may change slightly when the server's are merged. Maybe there will be an actual player base again. Maybe I won't have to search for hours to get certain buffs, only to have them waste away looking for group forever. At a time when buff suspension is&amp;nbsp;bliss to all players, only tagged get to use it...&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>you are correct, you cant enter guild hall unless you have a guild, and your buff timers only stop if you are in the guild hall, unguilded do not get this feature&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;there is a "guild lobby" which is not the same thing, but you get corpses summoned there etc..</description>
