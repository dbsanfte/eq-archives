      <description>They made GoM fire on any spell that &amp;quot;healed&amp;quot; a person, so that it would fire on heal over time spells (shamans wanted this more than anyone).  Since symbol &amp;quot;heals&amp;quot; for the amount of the buff, GoM can fire on it.  Since neither elixir or symbol can fire AH, the stacking issue doesn't exist and so those of us that are bugged to not fire on direct heals can fire on elixirs/symbol.  This is not the fix, and hopefully either the fix or refund will come with the mid march patch.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;My GoM does not fire on direct heals. It fires on HoTs and on buffs (go figure). Is this the fix?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GoM should fire on direct heals, please fix this problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;They release PoR and there is a line in there about GoM, &amp;quot;Gift of Mana will no longer be used up when you cast a 0 mana spell and now has a chance to trigger on heals other than just instant heals, including heal-over-time and percent healing spells. &amp;quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;That is fine and dandy if GoM was actually working and not being over written by AH. Again, /golf clap SoE.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since patch....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GoM working as before but AH still not working - sigh. Also - patch said HoT spells now have a chance to trigger GoM - NOT true, this doesn't happen. And now Healing Boon not working at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;spent 25 aa's on Abundant Healing - doesn't work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;spent 18 aa's on Healing Boon - doesn't work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The no aa refund/no fix policy is unacceptable. I'm seriously considering quitting EQ and going to D&amp;amp;D in 5 days. Bite me Sony.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Actually, Zenti, HoTs are firing GoM for me.  Rashere said that they would be refunding/removing AH if the fix for this issue isn't able to be implemented soon.  We'll see what &amp;quot;soon&amp;quot; means.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>A) Fixing this bug can't be nearly as complicated as releasing a new expansion.  There has been an entire expansion without a fix for this extremely important bug.&lt;br&gt;B) If what has been said is true (that AH/GoM are treated as focus effects on the same line), then I don't see how refunding the aa could possibly not fix the problem.&lt;br&gt;C) They have identified the problem, and as a computer science major in my final year of college, I know that this is oftentimes the most difficult part of debugging.  The fix is almost always far easier than finding the bug.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

Although it is second hand, i believe it to be accurate. In this post it is clearly stated that the reason for not refunding ABH is that we are stupid. If this would not fix the problem in the first place, i thnk they would have tried to avoid calling us idiots.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Furthermore, i believe in this thread, but somewhere for sure i have read that in order to refund an AA they have to delete it and recreate it. So it is actually less work to delete it entirely. Hooray.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, we can be fairly confident that a refund would fix the problem.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, sony has a really nasty habit of out of sight out of mind. It can usually be contributed to communication issues. If we dont wack them over the head when somethiung is out of whack, they go right on thinking all is well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=clericbalance&amp;amp;message.id=2282&amp;amp;view=by_date_ascending&amp;amp;page=2&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a good example of this.  We have got to remind them that this isn't an issue that is going away. We have taken 6 months (plus reportedly beta) of having this broken. If DoD issues so consistently took priority, imagine how PoR issues will. We have got to make it CLEAR that this is a high priority issue. See Orruar's post for some good perspective on how it effects us.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, i suggest that we have 3 options available to us: 1) live with the bug until they fix it, or 2) leave the game in disgust. 3) Politely and Consitently remind them that this is a high priority issue that we will not let go away.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;6 months when there is a obvious quick fix that can bypass our cryptic &amp;quot;core issues&amp;quot; is just way way to long.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;How do you come up with 15%?  You have a 15% chance to win the mana lottery to cast any spell you want. If my next spell is 1 mana I am not going to cast PR unless I think that is exactly what I think I need to cast. The other cleric in this does have more mana than I but not that much. You assume that I cast the same spells as he does in the same timing.  I do have better spell haste and that would make a bit of the difference.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;If GoM triggers you're going to cast DR of course, or if not up AHL. Yes you heal more but it makes no difference to the mana you use, unless you're the only one healing your target. And then you can compare only with clerics healing tanks on similar targets. Maybe the mobs my guild raid are different, but this almost never happen. Multiple clerics heal multiple tanks, or we have different roles.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;My point being, the GoM of that other cleric allows him to heal more but you share the result. What you don't share is the mana saving if you're chain casting. If not chain casting then you can manage your mana pool and end up at the same % level at the end.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Of course you heal for less, and contribute for less to the raid, but you can blame a bug. Claiming a 45% difference is a bit too much in my honest opinion. :)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;Niph has posted on another board that she's willing to wait and be patient for a fix instead of getting our AA's refunded.  From what I've read that's not the feeling of the cleric community at large and is certainly not my feeling.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;I'm just a messenger. GoM is listed as an issue, and clerics have been complaining here numerous times. If SoE is ignoring you then they are ignoring me as well, and there is nothing I can do.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;The response is what I found annoying also.  It showed a lack of concern about the issue and suggested that those without GoM who complain about it don't know how to manage their mana properly.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;I'm sorry if you feel that way, I didn't mean anything like this, only that 45% might be exagerated. There must be other factors involved.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

They should be thinking about how it can make most people happy who are complaining about GoM/AH stacking.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi ya,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, I am frustrated with the issue. I was mad at Niph's responce to me, I took his comment  personally. I will get over it. Honestly, my biggest mistake was to respond inside a flame thread. I know better and and sorry for continuing  the thread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I really don't want to see the flame go on in this thread. I picked the wrong thread to respond to. I really can't think of two people who actively do more for the class than Boanerages or Niph. These two have helped get both general cleric issues and specific cleric issues fixed, that effect me. Our Class correspondant and rep have done great jobs. I hold both of them in the highest regard. I am sure that they are telling us everything that they can. They should &lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; take the heat for this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The absolute lack of communication is what people are mad about. There has to actually be said something for either Niph or Boan to tell us anything. Do not doubt that this issue is taken lightly by either of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regards,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ialiene&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;hr&gt;Ialiene wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi ya,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, I am frustrated with the issue. I was mad at Niph's responce to me, I took his comment  personally. I will get over it. Honestly, my biggest mistake was to respond inside a flame thread. I know better and and sorry for continuing  the thread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I really don't want to see the flame go on in this thread. I picked the wrong thread to respond to. I really can't think of two people who actively do more for the class than Boanerages or Niph. These two have helped get both general cleric issues and specific cleric issues fixed, that effect me. Our Class correspondant and rep have done great jobs. I hold both of them in the highest regard. I am sure that they are telling us everything that they can. They should &lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; take the heat for this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The absolute lack of communication is what people are mad about. There has to actually be said something for either Niph or Boan to tell us anything. Do not doubt that this issue is taken lightly by either of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regards,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ialiene&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;The response is what I found annoying also.  It showed a lack of concern about the issue and suggested that those without GoM who complain about it don't know how to manage their mana properly.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;quot;The absolute lack of communication is what people are mad about.&amp;quot;  Exactly.  If nothing is said then the people who represent us should be asking questions.  Has there been any progress at all?  Is there an estimated date for the fix?  Have they even worked it into their schedule.  The months are ticking by with not much of anything said and very few updates.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>It has been said (I forget where) that there will be no proper fixes of anything- GoM, Last blood melee effects / dod aug effects, and so forth, until the next major content patch in February, which I believe is also the expansion release date. Its still ages away... but fingers crossed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>If you cast the same spell over and over again, the theoretical mana savings would be 15%. But as Ialiene mentioned, if you take advantage of GoM procs you can save more than that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Consider a 'best case' where you are casting Desolate Undead (310 mana) until GoM procs. Then you cast Word of Vivification (1375 mana). The mana savings in this case would be 66% (1375 / (310 * 100 / 15), if I have that right).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You get similar savings greater than 15% savings for using any big mana spell when GoM procs. Similarily, you can get less than 15% savings if you use a low mana spell when GoM procs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I tried this strategy on the last raid I did and it worked well. I memed some high mana spells (EE and Word of Replenishment) that I wouldn't ordinarily mem. The few times GoM procced I got to cast them for free.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Please implement /refundabundheal command which works only once.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Refunding AA without fixing the real problem might be a bad publicity for SOE because it shows their inability to fix the problem in timely manner, but another expansion coming out before fixing this problem is just ridiculous.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Seriously, this needs to be fixed and I really think the cleric class correspondent needs to understand that this is a big issue for us and treat it as such.  We don't want to hear how others &lt;strong&gt;with&lt;/strong&gt; GoM are managing their mana better, whatever.  We don't want to hear how refunding our AA's isn't a good idea (said on a different thread on a different board).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;What we want is for this to be fixed.  If it can't be fixed now then refund us our AA's so we can fix it ourselves.  Every other class enjoys the benefits of the AA they purchased except us.  As far as I can see from the lack of communication from Sony is that they are ignoring us hoping that we will sit here and take it quietly.  Druids would be freaking out of this were happening to them and I think now, that that is a good approach.  We have been way too quiet about this and it has gotten us nothing.&lt;/div&gt;</description>
