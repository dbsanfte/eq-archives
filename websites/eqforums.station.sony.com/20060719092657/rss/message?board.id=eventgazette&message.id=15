&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff size=5&gt;EQ Guide of the Month - April 2006&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;The EverQuest Guide Program is a program of volunteers. These volunteers dedicate their own time and energy to enrich the world of Norrath. As a Thank you to them Guides of the month have and will be chosen for their exemplary contributions.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;A href="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/gom/aspidistra.jpg" target=_blank&gt;&lt;IMG height=200 src="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/gom/aspidistra_sm.jpg" width=166 border=0&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff size=5&gt;Guide Aspidistra&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;1. Why did you become a Guide?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;When mes was less big den I am now, momma telled me dat mes gots to be nice to everting dats not fud. Mes no dat sum peeples tink trolls mean but mes proof dem wrong. Mes try to edyukat dem on da ways of gods and show dem dat trolls are gud too! &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;B&gt;ooc:&lt;/B&gt; I originally joined because it seemed to me that there were a lot of people out there who needed help and as an avid player, I had the time to unstick them, learn about their bugs and the like. Now that everything is more role-play focused, I embrace the challenge of helping people learn about the petition system for the help they need, but mostly strive to keep them entertained. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;2. What games do you guide on? For how long?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;Me applied fer da posishun of gladjiater at da Arena but dem said dat gnome puntins' not a sport and me dunnot tink dat fightin' so much fun. Did yus ferget alreddy? Ramember: when mes was less big den I am now, momma telled me dat ms gots to be nice to everting dats not fud. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;B&gt;ooc&lt;/B&gt;: I used to GM for a variety of MUDs before the advent of graphical MMPORGs. (Yes, I'm that old, darn it all!) Mostly, however, I am an EverQuest devotee through and through -- since its inception I've never found another game that has held my attention and sparked my wonder and sense of adventure quite the same way. Accordingly, I've never had the time or inclination to volunteer for another game. I originally joined the EQ program in 2000 but then took an extended break when I was married. I returned to the program in 2004. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;3. What is your guide race and class?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;Me is a luminary of Cazic Thule -- some peeples call us Trolls. Me wuz reincarnated in Neriak when dem froggies was doin' renovashun of Grobb, but now mes has returned to da swamp homelan. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;B&gt;ooc&lt;/B&gt;: Currently, I am a level 58 Troll Shaman&lt;BR&gt;In my original incarnation before my 4-year break, I was a Barbarian since evil races were not allowed at the time. My reincarnation has been extremely rewarding!&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;4. What is your favorite color? &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;Blue&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;B&gt;ooc&lt;/B&gt;: No, yel... Aaaaaaaaaagh. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;5. What is your favorite land (zone)? Why?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;Mes required by law to sey dat its Innythule Swamp. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;B&gt;ooc&lt;/B&gt;: Really, it's Kedge Keep. Yes, I know it doesn't qualify as "land" but that’s really the point, isn't it? I cannot describe my amazement (back 7 years ago) that the engine could handle swimming much less going in all directions much less figuring in a drowning and air pockets. To explore it was truly the greatest challenge of my play characters life and I take immense pride in knowing every twist and turn of that zone. It is an adventurer's paradise. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;6. What has been your best or favorite moment as a Guide?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;*picks teeth with bone* I dunno, dat last mud bath was pritty gud. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;B&gt;ooc&lt;/B&gt;: I think I enjoy it most when I get away with players thinking I am actually an NPC. In the recent Festival of Time, three of us were running the start and people kept hailing us but we just kept doing our script and someone /ooc'd "Stop hailing them, it's just creating spam... you have to let the script run!" and I giggled. Similarly, in the old invasion scripts, I always had fun turning on walk and just wandering about trying to act as much like an NPC as possible. I just love those moments when people say "There's a new named in the zone." instead of "Oh, looks like a GM is doing another event." &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;7. What is your favorite quest, event, or knowledge circle? What do you do the most of?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;Mes take personal sponsabiltee fer makin sure da Iceclad gnome farm has nuff cookies to keep dem gnomies nice and fat fer pickin. Yes huh! It is too a farm. Me not nos why dems live off ice but me dunnt care -- fat frozen gnomies is da best! &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;B&gt;ooc&lt;/B&gt;: I am a big fan of variety, but I think my favorite events have to do with story telling. Running the storyteller scripts or doing quests like Story of a Tormented Soul always seem to bring out the best role-players and I always enjoy learning the stories of the land too. Even when I run quests, I usually have some "theme" running in my mind that I try to play out... &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;8. What has been your worst of least favorite moment as being a Guide?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;Sometimez mes not find nobuddy to eet or play wif and dat can make eben a tuf troll have watery eyes. (Me always say dat its da bixie pollen tho...) &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;B&gt;ooc&lt;/B&gt;: I think it's a toss up between being taken for granted (e.g. players who demand service or demand quests) and worrying that people don't see the value of the program or don't get fun out of it (e.g. the phrase "Oh yeah, just another dumb GM event" strikes an unpleasant chord in my heart. I suppose they are closely related. There are definitely times that I wish I could have infinite flexibility and somehow "magically" give every player exactly what they are looking for -- the challenge is figuring out "What do they want??" Sometimes, I don't think they know themselves... &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;9. As a player have you every run into any Guides and events?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;Me runs into stuffs all da time. Momma sez I'm clum-see. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;B&gt;ooc&lt;/B&gt;: I was on one of the finalist teams for the Test of Tactics where our characters were transferred to one of the Zeks for server vs. server guild battles and I will always treasure my Golden Championship Ring. However, my absolutely most memorable moment was participating as a level 1 Halfling in the Halfling High Dive on my play server. Whatever guide thought to put us in a line, make us conga around the zone and then do the wave... was truly inspired. There is just nothing funnier than a train of 40 Halflings who are about to throw themselves off the edge of the world. Ridiculous funny!! &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;10. What is your favorite thing about this Game?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;When me dies, me gets reincarnated and mes gets to go die again and again! Dats like magic!! &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;B&gt;ooc&lt;/B&gt;: I think it's the feeling of adventure. I owe great thanks to a mystery player that I met 7 years ago -- I was a level 5 Shaman, and this bard offered to escort me across the Karanas. He stopped on the ascent to Highhold and said "Look up at this mural." I thought he was nuts, but we looked up at the mural on the wall and he said "I just can't believe that someone took the time and the energy to build in this much detail. It's a complete wonder everywhere you turn." and I just never looked at the game the same way. Each expansion holds something new and something exquisite and I still have great anticipation when I think about all there is left to explore. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;11. What do you plan to do in the future as a Guide? Any goals?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;I dunno, maybe me tries some new disguises. Me hears dat if yus find da right enchanter, yus can become a persistent dwarf. Me tinks dat sounds kinda fun! &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;B&gt;ooc&lt;/B&gt;: I am definitely interested in learning more about all aspects of the guide program. I've really enjoyed recently taking on the role of Quest / Event Coordinator for my server and I hope that I can continue to participate in other ways as well -- learning about the Training program, writing some quests, or just branching out into new styles of role-play and player interaction. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
