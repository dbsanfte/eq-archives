&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I love these generalizations you always see about little kids and PvP...&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Based on the age you've provided, you were only&amp;nbsp;13 when EQ came out. So, you were once a "kid" playing an mmorpg at some point, too. Let them have their fun and&amp;nbsp;learn&amp;nbsp;the game, give them a chance, and you may be surprised.&amp;nbsp;Lord that&amp;nbsp;knows that&amp;nbsp;as a long-time fan of the genre, I welcome any "kiddies" who are trying to learn the ropes in EQ, rather than going with the watered-down alternative... it shows&amp;nbsp;they're developing some &lt;EM&gt;taste.&lt;/EM&gt;&amp;nbsp; :smileywink:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Back on topic... Another server is really superfluous, imo. There's already PvP availble through the Priests of Discord. If there are&amp;nbsp;so&amp;nbsp;many players&amp;nbsp;interested in PvP,&amp;nbsp;and all those players&amp;nbsp;turn in their books and engage in regular guild vs. guild affairs, there should be plenty of PvP to go around and could even draw in more PvE'ers from the sidelines into the fray.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Of course, there'd be no serverwide rulesets unless&amp;nbsp;Sony put in some kind of token system... and&amp;nbsp;PvP'ers wouldn't have the joy of ganking and griefing any random player they&amp;nbsp;like with wanton abandon... but it's not about &lt;EM&gt;that&lt;/EM&gt;, right? It's about waging honorable PvP battle, right?&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I hope you guy's don't read the majority of the pvp topic posts. And if you do, I hope you realize the same people are posting and causing trouble. A new PvP server will be a breath of fresh air for some of us and it's going to attract the little kids too however some of us more seasoned players (me 20) will be playing as well in a respectable manner and enjoying it for many different aspects.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;To players: If you have a positive response to a pvp progression server, post and describe the type of server you would like. If you don't have anything reguarding the pvp server besides negative rants, Mods pls delete the posts so we can actually have a topic to discuss the idea at least so it doesn't get locked.!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;Actually, I think that turning in the books is a great idea providing that there are enough folks out there that want to play the pvp game.&amp;nbsp; It would certainly show the Devs that there is enough interest to make a new server for it worthwhile and if there really is enlough players that want to PvP in combine then the red players will still have no problem finding grps with other red players.&amp;nbsp; Therewould only be problems finding grps if there are not enough players to make it a viable way to play the game and that seems to be the crux of the issue.&amp;nbsp; So make a statement, when combine goes live, all the pvpers should turn in their books and see if there are really enough of you to warrant another server.</description>

      <description>So what you're saying is "If you want PVP raise your hand, and if you don't like PVP you're not allowed to post here" Well guess what, just like every other monotinous PVP topic you people keep making over and over and over, this one is going to have opposing viewpoints. Deal with it.&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Cougra on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;06-08-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;10:00 PM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;For me EQ is my PVE game and if I want PvP I play SWG or WoW. But of the PvP servers I liked the ruleset for Sullon Zek, I had a Beastlord 40ish lvl and a Ranger 30ish lvl there.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;As far as people against PvP posting in the PvP topics I dont care, do what I do in any topic I read. If its a flame or negative statement then I just scroll through it and dont respond to it. Focusing on the relevant information.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;What the Devs know for a FACT is that every PvP server dies down in popualtion after an initial boom.&amp;nbsp; they also know that if they create a new one half of Zek will leave, and 6 months form now they will&amp;nbsp;be stuck with two low population servers they wont be able to merge with each other.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;It would be too unpopular a move to mess with game mechanics for the sake of a PvP server, so the only hopes of longevity would be to lock the server at velious, or maybe luclin, because PvPers seem to agree that past that ruined PvP.&amp;nbsp; The flipside, is that epope wuld eventually run out of content so they would eventually quit regardless.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;No matter what, the long term prospects are doomed.&amp;nbsp; At least SoE has 1 decently populated PvP server (it only took 4 servers merging to make it that way), and to open up a new one might take away that for good.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
