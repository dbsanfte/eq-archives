      <description>Anyways the way I see it is if you had an evasive disc for rogues that let others in group get less agression like clerics 2.0 etc.  This would up rogues DPS by uping the raids dps.  Every time you turn off attack and hit hide to evade that is loss dps, everytime a monk fd's that is lost dps.  Now the snare thingy does absolutly nothing, that's a fact.  However, if you think that making less agro for your group means less DPS I believe you are wrong, and all this about fake rogues.  I don't think this guy is a fake rogue, he just ain't as selfish as other rogues that like to laugh at the dead zerker beside him.  Now if you actually got sony to impliment this well they won't.  The guy who works with aa's is brand new and doesn't want to change anything till he "get's the hang of it" (which means he just wants to get paid for doing nothing.  The guy that does spells auras and such still have shaman group spells last less time then shamman single spells(because he was too lazy to look at the time on each spell and what they did.  And the guy that deals with aura's still hasn't flagged the healing wards to not be hit by mobs so that they die on anything that you might think about using them for.  So therefore, basically you have a whole lot of people at sony getting paid for nothing, and if you think that you'll actually get a good idea thru to change an aura your outta your mind.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Besides let me ask you rogues this.  Would you rather an aoe snare(that acts like aoe taunt) or would you rather an aura you'd keep up and make it so you'd have to take off your attack less along with others in group?  Either way you all agree to take off snare I would think.</description>

      <title>Xorne's PoR Aura idea for rogues.</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=roguebalance&amp;message.id=4720#M4720</link>
      <description>Problem : In the PoR expension SOE gave up a trap making disc at level&#xD;
55 and 70. The problem is, they are useless and just increased the&#xD;
community anger towards SOE.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Solution : Most people here and on other forums keep complaining on how&#xD;
SOE screw them over by not giving them a DPS upgrade with aura (or for&#xD;
the last 6754 expensions). Whaa whaa whaa, big babies. SOE seem to have&#xD;
put in their heads that rogue are overpowered and even tho we know they&#xD;
are wrong we can't do anything about it except try to find other ways&#xD;
to make them balance our class. Now this might sound odd, but DPS isn't&#xD;
what a rogue is all about. Rogue is also about stealth and evasion.&#xD;
Just like Thief Eye witch can be described as "the rogue give hints to&#xD;
his groupmate on how to be more accurate" we could also be used for&#xD;
"giving hints or teaching our groupmates by example on ways to avoid&#xD;
being notice by the enemy". Give rogues an aura that will give the&#xD;
group the chance to get less aggro from spell / melee, just like the&#xD;
cleric, chanter and other class have on their 2.0 as an effect. Of&#xD;
course, the power of that aura should be tested etc so it doesnt&#xD;
unbalance the rogues. &lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Now you will say : &lt;br&gt;&#xD;
- "Whaa whaa, that's not a DPS upgrade!" &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; No, it is not, but at least it is something usefull.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
- "lol, you are stupid sir because with this the tank will get less aggro on raid and group lol roflmayo"&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Yes, except tanks can right click the aura an add them to the block list.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Now, please link this to any dev or what not at SOE so we can get&#xD;
something usefull out of PoR besides Razorarc. You can also leave&#xD;
comments or posts proclaiming me as your new best friend or something.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Not sure if this is a bug or not,&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;When you have Steadfast Servant out, and use AA "Escape", the Steadfast Servant Disapears :(.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;It just seems lame, if it is supose to work like that. So I realy hope it is a bug, and gest fixed!!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>One thing I have noticed lately is the mobs back. Backstab is crushial on this. If you want to parse more look at the difference between 1st person and other angles. Then go for the top down angle, more times then not I was not behind the mob like I thought I was. Try a different angle to help your parses, maybe you will see what you have been missing.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;They ever going to fix this aa, &amp;quot;nerves of steel&amp;quot;?  I was told to look for post saying it was getting fixed in upcoming patch.  I see post most of them are 2004 2005.  These post say that the fix is coming.  However it's May 2006 now, and well with the aa maxed 5/5 I had sneak/hide break on me 25/25 in echo caverns.  10/15 times in Tower of Frozen shades.  I /petitioned and /buged both times.  A very nice CS guy got on, made a copy of my rogue and verified that yes it is very bugged per the aa description.  Anyways, I am not the best at searching these forums for fixes and such.  I was wondering if such fix is truthfully coming?  I'm getting real discuraged since most of the post that talk about this is 2005.  Also are other rogues finding this aa totally useless?  And maybe not just rogues are monks/sk's/necro's finding it useless as well?  Thou since I am a rogue I'm mostly worried about the rogue portion since we only get escape ever 37 minutes, and other classes get fd what every min?  maybe sooner(I don't know).  Anyways I am posting to see if I am the only one having this problem, and seeing if a fix is coming sometime.  25 aa's I could have put to better use then an aa that didn't work. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Please post if you have the same problem, or if there is a fix in the works and I missed it. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If not fixed in 1 month I will repost on the aa till it's fixed. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Thank you.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=roguebalance&amp;message.id=4662#M4662</link>
      <description>   We are testing out something that would take the place of a top ten list, Which would be a weekly question to the Developer's in hope of getting a more in depth response . It seems to be going pretty well and think its a better route than top 10 lists. I'll let you all know more when its more permanant, but for this week here is the question I posed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;hr size="2" width="100%"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;The new Traps system that was implemented with the launch of prophecy of ro, for conventional &amp;quot;Old&amp;quot; Traps such as Velketor's Labarynth, Ssraeshza Temple, up to the current expansion has made the majority of the existing traps malfunction. The new trap system was not tinkered to these old traps yet the majority of rogues still have to deal with them on a daily basis and it makes  our daily routine in these zones very difficult. As it is now, you can get hit with traps before even having a Line of Site to disarm them among a ton of other errant bugs, Rogues are also not happy about not having sense trap turn you in the direction of the trap anymore as well. Is there any plans to go over the existing traps more carefully and cater them to this new system to make them functional again?&lt;br&gt;Suggestions for  slight improvements Sense-wise:&lt;br&gt; Make  sense face you in the direction of the trap once again and also allow you to sense the trap even if it is visible.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr size="2" width="100%"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Rogue AA for next expansion.</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=roguebalance&amp;message.id=4647#M4647</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Ok AA idea for next expansion.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I propose a 6pt AA.&amp;nbsp; It would be&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#99ffcc&gt;Battle Disarming&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#99ffcc&gt;The rogue has learned to reapply his attention&amp;nbsp;to a previously revealed trap&amp;nbsp;with amazing speed at will.&amp;nbsp; When disarm is pressed&amp;nbsp;without a target this passive ability will automatically target a nearby disarmable trap then attempt to execute disarm.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I dont think its overpowered cause we had it for years.&amp;nbsp; Its clearly useful to me I certainly would buy it.&amp;nbsp; And if they arnt going to reverse themselves on past decisions then im taking a forward looking posture and saying this is a good AA~&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>Purely from a raiding standpoint, is the pushback from Scoriae Bite procks enough to prevent you from using the poison? Is the dps from this proc meaningful? Do you load up on combat effects with this proc in mind? Would removing the pushback from Scoriae Bite be a welcome change? Are you sick of using the same buff prock for 3 years?</description>

      <title>Rogue DPS concerns... trying to think outside the box</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=roguebalance&amp;message.id=4623#M4623</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Trying to think outside of the box when it comes to ways to improve rogue dps and other class specific issues. While thinking outside of the box I am trying to remain as objective as possible in regards to the impact the “suggestions” would have and how viable they are in the context of the entire game and all the other classes. But hey… I’m a rogue, there is always a chance what I view as viable is viewed by another as overpowered, idiotic, etc…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;1.New upgraded version of our Blinding Speed (lvl 58) discipline – 25-30% overhaste for a duration of 1 minute. Recast timer of 1min 30seconds, Endurance cost around 800, Self only, uses the Thiefs Eye discipline model by populating buff icon in the short duration buff box (bard song box). Like Thiefs Eye it would allow us reap it’s benefits while using other disciplines but endurance cost is prohibitive enough that you can’t sustain it when you are not grouped with a bard. Overhaste does not stack with bard overhaste song. Gives rogues a little bit more burst dps for the times they aren’t grouped with a bard.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;2.Power Strike .. aka Endurance Burn – Rogue AA with 3 levels. Level 1 lets you do one single backstab strike at 1x your maximum endurance. Level 2 lets you do one single backstab strike at 1.5x your maximum endurance. Level 3 lets you do one single backstab strike at 2x your maximum endurance. Costs approximately 2500-3000 endurance with a refresh timer about the same as wizards/necros (2hr). The reason behind the lower comparative endurance cost compared to the cost that wizards/necros pay for their similar ability is because of the endurance regeneration disparity compared to mana and hp regen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;3.Position Liberation – modify the game mechanics to allow rogues to backstab: full damage full benefit from the 90deg rear arc, 80% damage full benefit from the two side 90deg arcs, frontal arc unaffected by this change but is still subject to the chaotic stab type rogue aa lines. From the side we would pay a 20% penalty to our backstab damage and still be subject to the normal mob-side rules (damageless riposte etc). Would bump up our position independent dps but still keep us slightly under position independent classes (monk/bst/zerk/ranger) in terms of return on investment for mob positioning. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;4.Offhand special attack – give rogues an offhand special attack(s) option that isn’t tied to normal attack or backstab. Lots of possible implementations here like 1) dps attack that gives an extra 15-20dps when used consistently. 2) a blackjack strike attack that does minimal dps but has a chance to interrupt casters with a 0 second stun (subject to corresponding agro from the stun of course). 3) a knee cap/tendon slice attack that does a short duration (1-2 ticks) snare (maybe 20% ?). All 3 special attacks on the same refresh timer so they are mutually exclusive of eachother. Possibly could even tie them to the weapon type the rogue is using in their offhand. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;5.Offhand flurry – innate or aa driven ability to flurry attack with the rogues offhand weapon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;6.Offhand triple attack – either innate and tied to our double attack % or aa driven and a straight % chance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;7.Sweet Spot – disc or AA that when activated gets populated into the short duration buff bar (bard song box) that allows rogues a chance to avoid AE rampage damage when the rogue is within 10% of max melee range. If done as a disc give it a flat 50% chance to completely avoid ae rampage damage. If done as an AA make it 5 levels with 10-12% chance to completely avoid an AE rampage per level. Duration should be fairly lengthy as should the refresh timer, open to ideas on specific duration(s). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Any opinions?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Top 10 Discussion/Ideas thread.</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=roguebalance&amp;message.id=4585#M4585</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Recap, what is already on our top 10 as of current.&lt;br&gt;1) Boost Sustained DPS&lt;br&gt;- Boost sustained DPS through the addition of triple attack or via backstab accuracy or other damage increases so that we maintain a clear advantage over other classes in sustained DPS.&lt;br&gt;- At present, parses suggest that rogues do not have the highest sustained dps among the dps classes. Rogues sustained dps should be special. Rogues feel that their sustained dps should exceed that of every other class under most circumstances and by a significant margin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) Disciplines / Burst DPS&lt;br&gt;- Move Assassin's Feint line off the Sneak Attack line timer.&lt;br&gt;- Move Twisted Chance to the Deadeye timer or its own timer. This discipline serves no purpose on its present timer.&lt;br&gt;- Add a new long duration discipline to boost burst dps.&lt;br&gt;- Re-evaluate the endurance costs of the Sneak Attack line.&lt;br&gt;- At present, parses suggest that in relation to many classes rogue dps is okay. However, a few classes are close enough to rogue dps and there are enough exceptions that rogues dps is no longer special, and according to parses one or more classes may be outperforming us in general. Rogues feel that their damage on raids should exceed every class bar wizards under most circumstances and by a significant margin. There are presently too many exceptions to the rule (see also: 7 - position dependancy). Under no circumstances should a tank class be competitive dps.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3) Better Player Made Traps&lt;br&gt;- Design of player made traps needs some work still. Agro from traps should be minimal.&lt;br&gt;- Please replace rogues current trap.&lt;br&gt;- Rogues, masters of traps and masters of damage, are not satisfied with the trap they received. They should either receive a better selection of traps or they should receive a more useful aura.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4) Modify the Backstab Formula&lt;br&gt;- Backstab hits for too little too often. Minimum backstab should be adjusted upwards or should occur less often.&lt;br&gt;- Backstab scaling should be more linear or be adjusted to allow for greater dagger upgrades.&lt;br&gt;- Gaining a part of a point of damage per expansion doesn't feel right, and eventually even elemental damage will be too much of an upgrade. Additionally, it would be nice if piercer ratios could be more akin to the ratios of other weapons (see also: 9 - Itemisation).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;5) Nerves of Steel&lt;br&gt;- At maximum ranks, a resisted, area effect spell can break Nerves of Steel. This is a bug. Please fix it.&lt;br&gt;- Although bugs shouldn't need to be on the top 10, this bug has remained unfixed for far too long.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;6) Shroud of Stealth&lt;br&gt;- Make it possible to identify mobs which see through SoS without conning them.&lt;br&gt;- There appear to be too many see-SoS mobs, particularly in instances.&lt;br&gt;- Zonewide AEs are increasingly common and break SoS for the entire zone.&lt;br&gt;- The &amp;quot;Your Shroud of Stealth keeps you hidden&amp;quot; message doesn't appear to be functioning properly. It's been suggested that this is because the message doesn't function on undead mobs.&lt;br&gt;- NPCs with whom players are supposed to talk in DoDH have helpfully been flagged as see-invis. They need to be flagged as see-SoS as well&lt;br&gt;- Shroud of Stealth needs to be highly reliable. Note that anywhere that a rogue could go with shroud of stealth, a bard or monk can already go.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;7) Position Dependancy / Backstab Failures&lt;br&gt;- Backstab failing due to Out of Range / Cannot See should not cause backstab / sneak attack to be greyed out.&lt;br&gt;- Too many raid targets are unpinnable or extremely difficult to pin with the result that rogue dps is becoming sub-par. Either more raid targets need to be pinnable / perma-rooted or rogue dps needs to be boosted to take the lost dps into account.&lt;br&gt;- Increase hitbox size of mobs, particularly on raid encounters&lt;br&gt;- Fix the &amp;quot;cannot see&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;out of range&amp;quot; issues with backstab. Suggested that this is caused by client/server syncing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;8) Poisons&lt;br&gt;Make poisons easier to use and less prohibitive in terms of time investment. Some suggestions of how to achieve this are:&lt;br&gt;- Implement some form of endless poison or poison conservation AA.&lt;br&gt;- Increase the drop rate of poison ingredients or make them purchaseable at a reasonable cost.&lt;br&gt;- Increase the yield of poisons per combine.&lt;br&gt;- Dramatically increase the yield of poisons per combine, making the poisons yielded no rent.&lt;br&gt;- Make old world and PoP poisons stackable&lt;br&gt;- Add a resist adjustment for poisons via AAs or new poison recipes.&lt;br&gt;- Implement new poison recipes.&lt;br&gt;- Poison skills have gone neglected for too long.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;9) Itemisation&lt;br&gt;- Add more +backstab damage items at all levels of play.&lt;br&gt;- Add more and better single groupable daggers to allow casual rogue dps to keep up with other classes.&lt;br&gt;- Itemisation at the high end needs to be more rewarding (drool-worthy) and play to rogues strengths.&lt;br&gt;- More variety in piercer graphics. If possible, try to avoid one dagger being a clear winner because inevitably everyone will end up wielding that dagger.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;10) AE Rampage&lt;br&gt;- Add an additional defence for rogues to avoid AE rampage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Keep the Discussion clean please it makes my job easier if everybody isn't going at  eachother. feel free to post ideas for the top 10 list or suggestions for the current items.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--   / message   --&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Suggestions on Rogue DPS</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=roguebalance&amp;message.id=4561#M4561</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;First off I would like to start with that everyone please post positively in the goal of increasing our damage output. Please stay away from posting negative ideas about other classes, or posts saying just &amp;quot;X-class has it, so we should&amp;quot; give positive feedback in why we should have it. I hope if we can keep this thread with positive posts, the devolpers can take some ideas from it and implement them later. If you have any ideas, post them, the more ideas out there the better it can help out us and the devolpers. If you dont like an idea, then post in constructive criticism about why that ability would not help our class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now remember on your ideas, devolpers do want to increase our dps. But they want to do it with moderation so we dont upset any other classes. So try not to do any outrageous ideas that would increase us by to much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would like to work off with ideas of our Top Ten to start us off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;1) Boost Sustained DPS &lt;font face="Times New Roman" color="#ff0000"&gt;(currently being evaluated)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman" color="#ffff00"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;- Boost sustained DPS by ~5% either through the addition of triple attack or via backstab accuracy or damage increases so that we maintain a clear advantage over other classes in sustained DPS.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flurry - Would be a beneficial to the rogue class in increasing sustained damage output of the rogue class. Their are several classes with this ability and it increased their dps, but it wasnt a large increase to their class. Perfect to what our class needs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Backstab Accuracy - With the mob's defense skills increasing, backstab is missing more and more. Backstab at lower levels had higher accuracy because skill and accuracy more matched the mobs defense. Increasing the accuracy of this skill landing would help both the raiding rogue and the casual playing rogue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;p&gt;2) Disciplines / Burst DPS &lt;font face="Times New Roman" color="#ff0000"&gt;(currently being evaluated)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Move Assassin's Feint line off the Sneak Attack line timer .&lt;br&gt;- Move Twisted Chance to the Deadeye timer or its own timer.&lt;br&gt;- Add a new long duration discipline to boost burst dps&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assassin's Feint has no relation to the sneak attack line. Therefore it should be moved to a timer which does not conflict with that timer. Say if a rogue sneak attacks a mob, but then a mob the rogue wants to mez. But the rogue cannot do this action for 30 seconds. Which sets up a confliction of disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discipline Timer 2:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Twisted Chance - Increase Chance to Critical Hit by 500%, Increase Chance to Hit by 10000% with All Skills&lt;br&gt;Duelist - Increase All Skills Damage Modifier by 100%, Increase All Skills Minimum Damage Modifier by 400%&lt;br&gt;Kinesthetics - Increase Dual Wield by 10000%, Increase Double Attack by 10000%&lt;b&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discipline Timer 3:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Deadly Precision - Increase Chance to Hit by 10000% with Backstab&lt;br&gt;Blinding Speed - Hundred Hands Effect&lt;br&gt;Deadeye - Increase Chance to Hit by 10000% with All Skills&lt;p&gt;Now if you look at all those disciplines, you can see a strong relationship with Deadeye, Deadly Precision, Kinesthetics, and Twisted Chance. So much to the fact that Twisted Chance is the direct upgrade to all of those disciplines (especially to Deadeye). With their strong relationship of those disciplines would be a just reason on why they should all share the same timer. Now if you look at the extra disciplines, you have Blinding Speed and Duelist. Since they have no relation to any other discipline they should either be put on the same timer, or on their own seperate timers and later on recieve upgrades to them. Especially since in future expansion the chances of level increase to level 75 would give plenty of level opportunity for upgrades of those disciplines. They are our current top disciplines used for us, and since they are both in the upper 50s, its time for them to recieve an upgrade. And I personally dont think having four offensive timers would overpower us, it would just offer more burst dps, but not anything to hurt other classes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for a new long duration discipline, I do not feel we need this. But more a clickable offense alternative advancement ability. We are one of the few dps classes out there who do not recieve a clickable AA ability that helps our dps. Some examples I would like to suggest are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Option #1: Accuracy and Attack, Short Duration (30 seconds to 60 seconds), Long Reuse (One hour)&lt;br&gt;Option #2: Poison Proc Buff, Long Duration (30 minutes to one hour), 100 damage to 200 damage proc, with a deagro jolt in it. Our evade ability has a strong chance of failure, so having an abiltiy like this would lower us from being on the top of hate lists. Which in the long run would help us be better damage output in group and raid situations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would like to point out to other rogues once again. Please post positive on ideas to help our class, do not feel intimidated on posting. All opinions count here, from casual to end game raiding. If you dont like someone's idea, post constructive criticism in why you dont like the idea. I feel if we all work together on coming up with good ideas. It would help the Sony Devolper Team to use our ideas in future patches and expansions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Gammak on &lt;span class="date_text"&gt;04-13-2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;12:29 AM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;70 rogue Tunare. Just some background info. I have played every class to 60+ other then beastlord bard and berserker. Bards I have just not had time for and like to live under the illusion that they are complicated beyond my understanding. bls and zerkers are abominations and should be put down for the good of man kind. Im old school I hate frogs lizards and yes even you cats... although less then frogs I really hate frogs and halflings. Anyway I have some Ideas for our class i thought i would share.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Something I think that would help our overall dps our ability to survive and a bit of self utility anyway. Innate life/mana/end taps . Starting at lvl 50 scaling up to lvl 70. Nothing huge maybe 50/50/50 at lvl 70 with a typical lifetap resist mod so that its not going to get resisted often. To me this is the ultimate theft and right up our alley. I think it should have a fairly high proc rate maybe with aa to increase both frequency and effectiveness maybe an aa to crit with it I dont know tons of options. I know this maybe stepping on the toes of sks and necros but ya know what the He77 with them they are way to powerful to be complaining about us. I dont want to see this as a buff or an aa other then the possible aa to make it better but an Innate ability that all rogues get at said lvl.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If that seems unreasonable to have something innate make it a disc but with much more powerful taps like say 500lt proc over 30 seconds or 1 min again with a fairly high proc rate and resist mod. Make us once again not only the king of dps but the king of thieves &amp;quot;yes bad joke intended&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Weapons nothing makes me more upset then fighting with other classes over good weapons. Pure melee live and die by there weapons. The best weapons that are now available to classes like rangers, bards and beastlords should in the future NOT BE!! Pure melee monks war rogue should be the only ones to have access to the best melee weapons. The other classes have many other abilities to help them we should not also have to fight them for the main thing we count on to do our jobs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;rant&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;I know rangers have it rough and can hardly survive a fight the way it is but i believe this is because we let them have our high dps weapons and frankly its like putting a gun in the hand of a child they dont know how to use them they over aggro and get themselves killed!!! They are better off playing with sticks and stones and other things you can find in the woods while hugging trees and humping bunnies. this way the worst that will happen is they will poke an eye out or break a bone with a thrown stone. Plz save the rangers further embarrassment and exp loss.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bards bards are great we all love bards. Bards make other classes do great things and bards can do nearly anything but they have about 2 million bard only weapons and there melee is pitiful. give em a flute or something and let them go to town dont let them take weapons out of the hands of needy rogues war's and monks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;beastlords have no impact on the game what so ever there existence is some sort of cosmic joke like berserkers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;rant off&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Something fun I would like to see is weapon customization even if it just came in the form of weapon dye. I know some moron will be running around with a hotpink warhammer but hey at least you know to steer clear of them when it comes time to get a group. Particle effects also would be cool. Make it costly for effects hell even make an aug slot for it and make the coolest ones drop off higher end one groupable stuff we dont want to waste raid loot on stuff like this but I think lots of people would one group for it. Customization has come a long ways since the days of eq classic when you could look at someone and tell what class and what weapons/armor they had just by looking. However at many lvls of the game everyone has the same weapon ie 1.5 and despair not just rogues but war's rng bls mnk clr brd etc etc let us change it up a bit. A flat black despair would look pretty cool let it arc some purple and blue electricity and you have an awesome looking weapon. The ability to add runes or glyphs to a blade would also be quite cool even if it were fairly limited. I realize I may have watered down my good ideas with retoric, slapshots and even a bit of bs but don't let that diminish them. Plz as always feel free to flame me im a big boy and I can cry myself to sleep with the best of them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jenyna&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--   / message   --&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

      <title>Poisons</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=roguebalance&amp;message.id=4528#M4528</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;I just finished casting my votes for the top ten and I can't help coming back to the fact that, stealth issues aside, there is almost no issue I have seen posted on these boards with regard to utility or dps or most anything else that could not be easily addresed through poisons.  (well tracking maybe, but that doesn't seem like as much a &amp;quot;need&amp;quot; as it is a &amp;quot;want&amp;quot;) It just seems like a really simple fix to me but I am neither wise nor learned in the ways of programming games...or much else really, heh.  Instead of new discs, items, skills and a whole bunch of other stuff, just make poison use more effective with stacking, standing application, (like casting spells with interrupts and all that stuff),  and improved ingredient availability.  I would also like to see some of them improved with regard to their strength and a few other issues but can live with them if they take care of the first three items I listed.  Other issues could be addressed later on but this seems like a logical first step.  Is it really that big a deal to do?  Or is it in fact something that is terribly complicated?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Just asking.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>
