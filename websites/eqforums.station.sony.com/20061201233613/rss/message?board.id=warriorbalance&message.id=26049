&lt;P&gt;Warrior question:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Historically, resurrection effects never depleted Endurance, only putting on items with END and stats gave more "empty" potential endurance.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; With TSS, this has changed, and we now have a completely empty endurance pool on resurrection, which really limits what we are able to do in a post res environment.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This actually represents a dramatic change from all precedent, when since Kunark throughout the rest of the game, we've been able to use at least one discipline on resurrection.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Now with the ooc regen system, we've got a minimum cooldown time of until reseffects wear to generate enough END to cover the use of even one disc, and that's not counting any AE's that are occurring.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; We do not have the ability to improve regen outside of the ooc regen system such as C7, or bard songs, etc.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;We would like to be returned to the state we have had since the implementation of the END system, which is to be resurrected in with a minimum level of Endurance.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Oddly, I am aware Warriors never got full endurance after a rez...&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Again I totally support the fix. And Divine rez should absolutely effect the endurance pool.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;But don't expect to have superpowers after 3 minutes, some endurance yes. Just like I'll have some mana, but not full.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;We never had full.&amp;nbsp; Not even close.&amp;nbsp; It would be closer to 30 mins before we got to full.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;What we did have is when we got rezzed, we would still have the endurance we had prior to rez.&amp;nbsp; Which was just enough to pop Fortitude/Defensive after AET with maybe a bit for bellow.&amp;nbsp; It still required the raid to pay attention to not snake aggro from the warrior.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Personally, I have no issues with them making endurance work just like mana and having it zapped when rezzed.&amp;nbsp; But if they are going to make endurance behave like mana for rezzes, they should make it behave like mana for EVERYTHING ELSE!&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;That means emergency mana recovery mechanism like mod rods and paragon should also provide for emergency endurance recovery.&amp;nbsp; Similarly, divine rez which gives you 100% mana, should ALSO give you 100% endurance.&amp;nbsp; Right now, even GM rez does not restore endurance.&amp;nbsp; I don't even mind the lack of long term endurance regen buffs.&amp;nbsp; But it's the double whammy of endurance behaving like mana *AND* the fact that there's zero way to even attempt an emergency endurance recovery that really makes this situation annoying.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;It effectively neuters the warriors when they get rezzed into a combat situation.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>Dont see why it cant be put back to where it was - out of combat regen etc... was supposed to enhance everyone from their previously rezzed up / low mana-end-health state to a speeded up version - not sure why knights got any reasons to object to allow warriors back to the position they were in pre boost for everyone except pure melee.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hope it gets retuned for you.&lt;br&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Isn't this also affecting all melees in general, or just warriors? I'm&#xD;
wondering if this happens due to a bug that was found during TSS Beta&#xD;
either spurred on from OoC or via Floating Death Mode which affect the endurance returned. Nedrom's&#xD;
the one to ask about it, I merely clicked his corpse :p&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;All enduranced based classes are having same issue's yet the rest do not require the endurance as quickly after rez.Rog's rarely use end, zerks use it alot but thats dps. Monks recieved abilities to almost gather endurance this expansion. &lt;A href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/spell.html?spell=10952" target=_blank&gt;Moment of Calm Rk. III&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp; so monks have a different route, Id really say yes wars were about only class that this trully affects in a game changing maner.</description>

&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;Yeah the 2k we recieved, was actually the 2k we had at bind. It just didnt get reset is what I belive, but superpowers nah we dont have those. But its good to have access to atleast a fortitude, thats been a wipe saver many raids.&lt;BR&gt;</description>

      <description>I really doubt they will change this back.&amp;nbsp; From what I was told, when I asked this question myself after TSS went live you shouldn't have mana or endurance after getting a ressurection.&amp;nbsp; Good luck though!&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Yeah come on. It's not so bad really. When I'm raiding, do i want my rezzed Warrior friend to get back into the tank chain on some rape mob rdy with defensive fast, hell yeah.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I dunno who you raid with but when I get rezzed in, alot of the the time the mana buffs are there before I even send out tells for em.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I'll give you a picture tho of what a Paladin does when he gets rezzed. Ok first thing you loot up fast and sit down to start medding. Then you load up BSG/Armor of Unrelenting Faith and Pious Fury (well I do, it's a cheap buff and helps fill up them early buff slots). I chuck in a couple clickies then do pious, BSG, then armor (of those 3 buffs, if i get dots piled on me and stuff starts overwriting from the front, that's the order i'd wanna lose em in). After this I med again and sort out my spell in line up. At this point I've got like 1 to 1.5 left on my rez timer. From this point you should have a couple nice mana buffs, and hopefully your mana regen AA/gear isn't too shabby. When you first stand up, forget healing, we're not rdy for that yet. Ideally you're gonna stick to dps for a bit, you can tank, if you're lucky you might have just enough&amp;nbsp;endurance for that rune disc - maybe not tho, you can fire some stuns and hold aggro.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;In this situation if we want to get mana for heals, if we *have to aggro* we have to do it as leanly as possible.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I think the balance is probably something like, when a Warrior gets up from his 3 minute holiday, he should be able to fire defensive, and maybe have a couple mocks and bellows in him, but will mostly have to rely on procs for aggro if the Warrior has to jump in on a boss.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Yep about the half of it, Id be really quite fine with coming back in with 0 endurance. If 2 things took place. 1 Intuition worked on endurance. Or 2 that the buffs we wear for raid&amp;nbsp;gave the same endurance regen as it does for mana. The it would be somewhat equittable, we have to wait but so does everyone else, its not re agroing a mob at 15 or 20 a tick regen with 0 endurance after you have 200 endurance. Because yes the disc will key and it means no possiblity of using a bellow at all. Where as any other class would be able to regen faster than they spent if using only 1 spell that had a very low cost on it.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Because we cannot even get a divine rezz and get our endurance back, any other class you get a call into raid, loot up then a cleric can clickyou with divine rez giving you full mana back. This is not an option so it isnt the same situation.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Funny thing is pre ooc druid/shaman calls never use to give me rez effects either.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Sucks that your end is taking the same hit as mana has for a long time, but as much as I agree the OoC changes have sucked... weigh the good with the bad.&amp;nbsp; You still regen to full post rez faster now than pre OoC.&amp;nbsp; Granted, does nothing if you're rezed back and expected to reagro a mob, but it just further put End into the mana field.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Maybe now they can add some end regen stuff since it would leave everyone on the same playing field post rez.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;The problem is, its not equal.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;A caster may have there mana pumped when there expected to work immediatly upon reanimation into a zone. Meaning situation hit with perfection of the spirit and a necro then pumps you for abit of mana each tick. Although this does not instantly fill your bar as long as the mana expended does not outweigh the regen of mana coming in. Eventually the caster will be FOM, shamans are given canni options that allow them to be returned to full mana and the cost of there own life.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Enchanters are given gather mana, wizards are given ways to immediatly increase there mana pool. Pal and SK if required to have them at a limited operating ability may be mana pumped or given any variation of buffs that will increase there mana regen to beyond 100 a tick. Where as wars recieve , nothing outside of personal regen or the 5 minute timer to be returned to full endurance. I touched on this awhile back.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The OOCombat regen is a bandaid for warrior's so that if there is a full raid wipe, we can begin the next encounter hopefully Full on end. It does not though add to anything in a combat situation where as all other caster/hybrid classes do have different ways to attain this should the situation require it. As the system worked previously we did return with about 2k endurance this wasnt a hack or anything wrong with it. But it did allow 1 fort to be used or a defensive with very limited bazu use.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;You are right in the respect that there is a discrepancy in the fact that some casters have means of regaining mana post rez in combat.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;What I disagree with from my perspective as a Paladin is that necro's will never pump a freshly rezzed paladin, the chances of me in mid combat getting clarity are next to nill as are the chances that I will catch a paragon because I might need it while others may not.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The theory that any one should come in with a rez with endurance returned is what I dispute.&amp;nbsp; Just as much as outside of Divine Rez, people shouldn't come back with mana in their pool either.&amp;nbsp; They are the same thing, one is yellow, one is blue.&amp;nbsp; Fight the fact that they are the same all you want, but they are.&amp;nbsp; Yes, Endurance needs to have added to it the bonus effects that come with mana as well, but coming into a fight, ready to go with atleast one disc.. that I disagree with.&amp;nbsp; That's like me coming alive with the ability to group heal, or have full well ready every form of agro I have... neither of which is the case.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Ironically, hybrids take a double hit in this due to using both endurance and mana.&amp;nbsp; Granted though, a second wind type of gathering endurance would actually be pretty cool to see.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;They aren't worth it.&amp;nbsp; Considering they get overwritten shortly after the fight, or generally if I am being rezzed in I am dead shortly there after again because of being unbuffed and trying to stop the bleeding, there's no point.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Generally speaking after rez in, I am looking to do two things because my tanking is too weak unbuffed against a lot of mobs we take on at our level.&amp;nbsp; Those two things are LoH, and AoV.&amp;nbsp; Unbuffed, if I get a lucky taunt off, it's rare I make it past 10-20 seconds.&amp;nbsp; No disc, no mana, and generally no other outs leaves me weaker than a fresh rezed warrior.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The other thing that people fail to realize, to regen the 400-1k mana I need per heal, still takes longer than a rez back into a fight is going to give me.&amp;nbsp; Ultimately, yes, I am too cheap to waste potions on a 1 minute stint that's not going to matter.&amp;nbsp; But yeah, 10 ticks at 100 per tick (exaggerated to my necro's lich level of mana regen) still leaves me at only having 1k mana in my pool.&amp;nbsp; If needed to tank, I won't ever hit that level because every time I can stun, that's where my mana bleeds to.&amp;nbsp; Self Heals/WoT out of the question as well because in a situation like that I couldn't do both if I wanted to.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Lots of things here.&amp;nbsp; first, you being too cheap to buy clarity potions means you got no place complaining you can't get clarity when rezzed in.&amp;nbsp; You could have it easily.&amp;nbsp; This is just one of a number of possible mana regen buffs you can get in this situation, and if your group/raid values your casting, then they will see to it you get at least some of them.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Believe it or not, if I am just rezzed in on a raid fight where the mob has anything approaching decent DPS, if I don't take the time to get buffs, I am not going to last more than a few seconds either.&amp;nbsp; That is just how things are.&amp;nbsp; This has zero to do with anything.&amp;nbsp; If your raid is in a situation of sending in people immedietly after rez to try and tank, without buffs, the raid is already in alot of trouble.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Now, lets look at a more realistic situation.&amp;nbsp; You get rezzed in mid raid.&amp;nbsp; You click your C potion.&amp;nbsp; You are now at 14 + 20(FT) =34(actually, with AA's and base standing regen, higher) mana per tick, while meleeing.&amp;nbsp; You are already gaining mana back faster than I am gaining endurence back.&amp;nbsp; If your enchanters are paying attention, you will actually get Intuition, for 44 mana regen just from that and FT.&amp;nbsp; If you raid happens to have a bard AEing mana, you are doing much better.&amp;nbsp; Add in mod rod, and SE(11 per tick), and your mana regen is not going to be bad at all, and these should be available to you post rez if it is a crisis situation, as getting healers and tanks back and effective is usually key when things aregoing wrong.&amp;nbsp; If things are not going wrong, it does not matter much anyway, as you can click your haste potion and be doing at least some DPS while those who have not died finish things off, then med.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Lastly, and importantly, this is not an us vs them situation.&amp;nbsp; If the issue is addressed, and returned to the way things where pre-TSS, &lt;STRONG&gt;it will have no negative impact on knights&lt;/STRONG&gt;, none.&amp;nbsp; It won't make warriors more competitive for group/raid spots, it won't affect relative class balance, it will just remove a negative thing that warriors(and other melee) have to deal with currently.&amp;nbsp; I am surprised that you did not complain about the last weekly question, dealing with strikethrough spam, as it affects knights just as much as this one.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Excuse me but doesnt divine rez work on a paladin ? because for a warrior it does 0. We gain no added endurance, but we do get 100% xp back.&amp;nbsp; Second, if you need mana to tank effectivly and its you or a raid wipe, you will find necro's willing to pump you as they do clerics. Necro's detest pumping any class they do it out of necessity not out of love, go sell that snake oil elsewhere.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;And with all your combined mana regen possible thru the personal buffs and the mana regen on the buffs you have from raid. Yes you regen mana well over 100 a tick. Lets not argue that and you can use a spell to hold agro that is a great deal less in cost than wars discs.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The question wasnt that a war can take damage better than a Knight on a raid level encounter 9 times out of 10 the answer is we can tank better half naked. The question was when we had 2k endurance when rezzed in and we had so few options to regen our endurance compared to the multitude of &lt;STRONG&gt;options&lt;/STRONG&gt; that every mana based class has. ou may not use these , but it doesnt change the fact you &lt;STRONG&gt;can.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</description>
