      <description>After a bit of work I managed to get my lvl 55 and lvl 70 auras for my Cleric. I wanted to verify the working of the lvl 70 aura verus the lvl 55 aura.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now granted a lvl 55 may not be as quick as me to get the lvl 55, but I still do not see the value of the lvl 70 aura. I do like the aura but I would only recommend that a cleric bother with the lvl 55 version as it stands.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lvl 55 aura&lt;br&gt;Mana: 416&lt;br&gt;Cast time: 6 seconds.&lt;br&gt;Effect: 5% melee damage reduction max 300 points&lt;br&gt;Time to aquire: 30mins.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lvl 70 aura&lt;br&gt;Mana: 500&lt;br&gt;Cast time: 3 seconds.&lt;br&gt;Effect: 5% melee damage reduction max 300 points&lt;br&gt;Time to aquire: 8 hours (3 group missions with no worth wild loot) Ohh and one boss mob has a nice 8k DD time delay nuke.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(The effects does not stack with the Vie line.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An example of a good aura. Monk lvl is 55 5% to dodge, ripost, and parry. Monk lvl 70 is 10% to dodge, ripost, and parry.</description>

So only useful for monk and melee classes that have these skills. Casters with only the dodge skill are out of luck.</description>

Monk lvl 70 is 10% to dodge, ripost, and parry.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We don't actually know what the level 70 one is, as no melee anywhere has their 70 aura yet. It might not be 10%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And additionally, it's &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; a 5% &lt;u&gt;addition&lt;/u&gt;. It gives you 5% &lt;u&gt;of&lt;/u&gt; your current chance in that ability. So if you do not already have riposte, it gives you nothing. If you riposte 5% of all attacks, you will now riposte 5% x 1.05, ie.. 5.25% of the time instead, giving an actual (real) 0.25% increase !!.. /cough.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=8475"&gt;Master's Aura&lt;/a&gt; sure looks like 10% to me~  Just because no one has the spell doesn't mean the data for it isn't out there.  Would be super hot if they would get the 3rd spell quest fixed though...&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Auras refresh MUCH faster then every tic. They currently refresh arround once every second or faster. You will almost never reach the cap asorbed unless its a 6000+ hitter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;5% melee damage asorbed through a free aura entire group is pretty good. Better then what a lot others got.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Paladins will trade you our 5% to heal aura for your 5% vie aura! I would trade in a heart beat heh.... Althought the level 70 version is currently mission in action, you can have our 3% level 55 version in the mean time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All the auras follow standard stacking rules. If a better effect is on you it takes precedence even if the icons stack.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

It makes it useful for grouping in exp zones, trash clears / specific scripts, but nulls it for raid bosses (then again, when was vie good on raid bosses except for ramp post Time and Ikkinz!). It is still nice as a cushion for hits, chain recasting vie is more of a mana drain than a benefit for raids, a help in groups however. The fact that it is constantly refreshing makes it very good though, the 300 runic cap was a concern for me if it wasnt refreshing fast, but after using it in so many situations, for the most part it is a 5% mitigation aura where runic cap has no relevance, except in raids.&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;hr&gt;Caladel wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All the auras follow standard stacking rules.

Before it was on Slot1 mitigation which Vie is (and thus would block the aura) but then changed to Slot2 mitigation, so it would stack WITH vie for a total of 15% mitigation (people have said the Devs stated this, however I didnt see them confirm via a post, but that was the impression I got when slot1 was changed to slot2), not so that the aura would be blanketed by Vie via the highest taking precedence rule (source of the gom issue ns!).&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I still wonder what the actual difference between the auras is meant to be... probably  5% 150 runic cap or 3% xxx total.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Lluianae on &lt;span class="date_text"&gt;03-07-2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;01:45 AM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;aye.  like I said druid regen buff stacks with their regen  and warrior AC buff both stack with ac buff spells also.    So auras can stack with spells.</description>

      <description>8 hours may be a bit high, but I did all the leg work on these, no write ups.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First mission I tanked with my monk. (1.5 hours)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Second mission the SK almost caused us to wipe. Went back to tanking with monk the next day. 3 hours both attempts added together so lets only figure only the 1.5 hours for the second attempt. Boss mob hits for 1900 and has a nice 8k DD time bomb that I wasn't expecting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Third mission went easy. (1 hour) Took a while to find the turn in mob, thats what I get for trusting ranger track.&lt;br&gt;So give it 5 hours.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I guess my point is being able to cast it twice as fast 3 second from 6 seconds while spending more mana is not a good upgrade. Look like a bug, and I would just like a comment, something you don't get from /feedback.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I did retest the vie line, it doesn't STACK you can have both but the highest one wins so 10%. Nice though considering most of the mobs I fight take vie off before they die.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reading skills aside (not just mine that is lacking here), I ran some test last night and it does refresh every tick.  The 300 damage is misleading.  Guardian on 70.1 hard can eat it, but trash could not.  Nor could the shades.  It seems to absorb spell damage too, or it counts spell damage as part of the 300.  The traps in Bellfast eat it immediately.  I am of course assuming trap damage is spell damage, but I guess it could be considered melee damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I need to find a good AE caster mob to see if actual spell damage can eat it.  I'm not sure if SH puts out enough damage in one AE, but I'm thinking if the entire group takes a hit it should be sufficient to test it.  That is the only one I can think of off hand that puts out that much AE damage that would not be suicide to test this on.  I'm not adverse to dying but convincing a group to commit suicide to test this would be a challenge.  For me to try to test this solo would be futile as any mob that can put out that much damage would have me at my bindspot before I knew if it dropped from max damage or death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, with the refresh every tick it is better than PoV imo as mobs tend to eat PoV in a couple of ticks and recasting it 5 to 10 times per fight is not an option.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Try taking in into the first of the Tak arc that you got the aura from. Most AoE's should be enough there I think *shrug*&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

      <description>Have taken 12000 base AE with it on recently (27% spell shield, so down to 8760 and yes I shouldnt be near bomber zombies in the first place, I blame mi**SMURF**ting autorun :) ) it remained on (whereas a 6k dd would remove), trap damage is perhaps misleading but it is meant to be 5% melee mitigation and not melee / spell.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lucy backs that up with- 2: Mitigate Melee Damage by 5%, 300 total.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>As Reorxx stated in reply 5: &lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;hr&gt;It does not stack in that if you have both PoV and the Aura you don't get 15% mitigation, you only get 10% (highest takes precedence). This appears to have been confirmed by testing a mobs max hit with the auras/PoV on and off.&lt;hr&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;From speaking to people in the Beta the dev's claimed that these were supposed to stack to 15%.&lt;br&gt;Are they going to leave it as is or make them stack for a total of 15% mitigation?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;T.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>I don't think they are going to make them stack. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I believe that the desire for those spells is that the Aura will be for the entire group as a bit of a way to take the edge off some of the miscellaneous damage (AE rampage,Riposte damage, etc...) people in the group might take through a fight. Vie on the other hand is meant to blunt a mob's direct attack on one target.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I believe that there are changes in the works for Auras in general (to deal with lag they cause) and the cleric Aura specifically (to better reflect the above intention), but I don't know what the changes are nor when they'll show up on Test or Live. (Hopefully soon on Test if they will make it for the patch next week)</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Guard effects, like the one on the aura, don't stack but rather take the highest effect similar to how haste or run speed works.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I'm actually changing this aura slightly, though, along with most other auras.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;As the auras were built, they recast their effects every 6 seconds on&amp;nbsp;everyone&amp;nbsp;in range, sort of like a bard playing a song.&amp;nbsp; Auras (all Spheres of Influence, really) are just areas within the game world that can apply an effect on a player when they enter it and remove it when they leave it.&amp;nbsp; Because of this, recasting the effects every few seconds isn't necessary in most cases and just adds unnecessary&amp;nbsp;load on the servers.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/FONT&gt;I've changed almost all the auras to be like normal spheres now where the effect stays on a player&amp;nbsp;for as long as they are in range of the aura.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;That led to a particular problem with the cleric ones since it would cause the effect to go away after it had absorbed the max damage&amp;nbsp;and then you'd have to leave the area and return for it to reapply it.&amp;nbsp; To fix that, I've completely removed the damage cap on the ability so as long as you are in range of the aura, you'll simply take less damage from melee attacks.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I've slightly reduced the amount of absorption to compensate for it being always on&amp;nbsp;and I've changed the spells so the level 70 version is more powerful than the level 55 one.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;This is still in testing, but barring any unforseen problems, should go out with the patch next week.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

Its something that players can see but yet not be overly powerful. Anything less will be difficult for players to judge. For normal groups this is one of my favorate auras.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I do think the Vie spell line should hang in there a little longer. Most normal group mobs hit me for 1k so it normally lasts 17 hits.</description>

&lt;P&gt;Aye, the Aura is nice as an overall mitigation aura for the entire group.... but when the big named pops, give your tank that Vie to handle the impact of an incoming mob... the aura will still be there when it's gone.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Kinda sad my SK didn't get an aura... as I had done the Chalice of Life quest before I even knew it was for an aura (and thus Takish was usually empty)... I know we got some nifty spells instead... but I guess I'll just have to settle for redoing the quest on my Enchanter to get that nifty song-buff.&lt;/P&gt;</description>
