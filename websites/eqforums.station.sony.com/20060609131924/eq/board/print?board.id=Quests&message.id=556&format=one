<DIV>About 6 months ago, my friend who 2 boxes a shaman and monk took me to Chardok for the first time.&nbsp; I instantly fell in love.&nbsp; The zone is a pain in the ass, and can really be frustrating, but if you go with the right people who know their way around, it can be a very fun and rewarding zone.&nbsp; It's been a good while since I've hunted in there with my friend, but after hearing about all the wonderful quests that Chardok offers, I decided to try and get as many of the items as I can.&nbsp; Please note that it is best (and sometimes required) to do these quests at level 51 or above.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The biggest hurdle to Chardok quests is faction.&nbsp; I'm sure many of you have done raids in Chardok, taking down named mobs for epics and the like.&nbsp; You've probably killed sarnaks by the hundreds in the Overthere and in the Lake of Ill Omen.&nbsp; These activities result in the complete decimation of your Brood Di'Zok faction, which&nbsp;includes the Chardok sarnaks.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The good news is, it can be repaired.&nbsp; You can rebuild.&nbsp; The best way to start would be to kill goblins in Frontier Mountains endlessly.&nbsp; This includes Nurga and Droga.&nbsp; Killing these goblins increases your Brood Di'Zok faction.&nbsp; These goblins usually drop Green Goblin Skin or Mt. Death Mineral Salts.&nbsp; Collect as many of these items as you can, you'll need them.&nbsp; The goblins might also drop a Drogan Warlord's Insignia, so grab one of those too and save it for later.&nbsp; Once you've killed enough goblins to be non-KOS (at least&nbsp;dubious), you can take these skins and salts to Chardok, and give them to the "midget" sarnak at the entrance, Herald Telcha.&nbsp; Give him 4 of each at a time.&nbsp; Hail him for the full details.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can also increase faction by&nbsp;killing mobs in Chardok B (Halls of Betrayal).&nbsp; This also increases Brood Di'Zok faction, since the mobs in Chardok B are considered "Betrayers of Di'Zok".&nbsp; Just be aware that this is riskier than just killing goblins.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Okay, so get that faction up to ally.&nbsp; I have heard that these quests can be done at warmly, but I wanted to be sure, so I got to ally.&nbsp; By far the easiest item to obtain is the <A href="http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=6903" target=_blank>Di'Zok Signet of Service</A>.&nbsp; All you have to do is go through the quest dialog with Herald and he will give you this ring.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Now it's time to get another ring.&nbsp; This one requires a bit more work.&nbsp; There are a few steps involved, but it's mostly just a lot of running around and killing a mob at the end.&nbsp; Click <A href="http://www.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1888" target=_blank>here</A> for a complete writeup of the quest.&nbsp;&nbsp;Tonight I finally got my faction to ally, so I did the quest.&nbsp; It took about an hour total.&nbsp; I had a druid friend join me for tracking, ports, and buffs.&nbsp; We&nbsp;got all the quest&nbsp;NPCs right away (didn't have to wait on any to spawn).&nbsp; When I was ready to do the final hand in, I had a 67 warrior friend join us, just in case.&nbsp;&nbsp;We easily killed&nbsp;spawned mob.&nbsp; I looted&nbsp;it's head, and went to&nbsp;Chardok and claimed&nbsp;my lovely <A href="http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=12316" target=_blank>Regal Band of Bathezid</A>.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I did this quest with my level 64 paladin.&nbsp; The Regal Band is admittedly a very good melee item due to the clicky damage shield, but it also has caster stats on it.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>My next goal is to get the Spirit Wracked Cord.&nbsp; I will post again when/if I obtain it.</DIV>
