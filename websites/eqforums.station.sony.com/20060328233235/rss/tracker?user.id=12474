      <description>Thanks Nehtaniel&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As I have never used the site since I set myself anonymous. I just checked a few of my characters a couple of minutes ago.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Got the same result as you with an empty cache and all previous cookies destroyed. :(&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So much for going throught and making myself anonymous :(&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The only thing that cheers me up is that the "Equipped Items" is so wrong on 2 of my characters it's laughable, half empty and items I have never worn or in one case even owned :D&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But as I never wanted anything to do with this site anyway, the developers can find the bugs for themselves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I hope the whole site rots and shuts down soon :(</description>

      <description>Humm!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There was a very good programme for one of the Open University courses about crime and punishment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It presented the 2 main reasons for locking people up as a staged and scripted debate between 2 fictitious politicians.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One who saw the justice system as a way to 'punish' wrongdoers and the other who saw the justice system as a way to 'deter' more crime.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The debate started with the presenter asking how they would deal with these 2 crimes:&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Illegal double parking in a city&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A terrorist who killed a large number of people&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;The 'deterrent' politician stated:&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Execute the Double Parker&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Release the terrorist&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;While the 'Punishment' politician stated:&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fine the Double Parker&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hang draw and quarter the terrorist&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;They then 'Debated' their points of view!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The long and short of it:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Deterrent' Politicians argument:&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;People die as a result of ambulances and fire engines being blocked. Executing a couple of Double parkers would deter almost everyone from 'ever' double parking again. So saving lives.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While the terrorist only wants air time and or martyrdom that will encourage more to follow. So ignore him as you can 'never' deter him or his like due to their beliefs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;The 'Punishment' Politician argument:&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Double parking is trivial, a fixed penalty fine would save the courts money and time. Plus the punishment  matched the severity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While the terrorist needed to be made to pay in a way that most people would think was the severest punishment that could be applied to such a despicable crime&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;That I thought succinctly put the 2 sides of what a justice system is about&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The only thing that is sure is it will be expensive to do whatever you feel a justice system should do!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You pays your money and you takes your choice!</description>

I am part of his 1 crowd :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As my highest Character is 53.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's taken as long a playing time to get from 50 to 53 as it did from 40 to 50 :P&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Which itself took the same amount of time as 20 to 40 :D&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As I am a casual player. Even though I have been playing since 2002. I'm not on every night, sometimes a couple of weeks at a time due to work plus work, for some reason I cannot imagine... humm! :D blocks anything and everything EQ???&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;50 to 53 took a looonnng time &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So I voted for 50 - 55</description>

      <description>I really hope you can find a fix you can understand Raputta :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The best description of how I cobbled a UI together is here &lt;a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/forum.html?forum=1&amp;mid=11411709209196352#1141240223156724894" Target=_blank&gt;Allakhazam Forum - Old Scool UI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The main problem, as I will state again!, with the 'NEW UI' for a lot of players is the stupid new spell icons that have no definition or contrast.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Plus as a lot of players have screens of 1024 x 768 or more nowadays if using a 17in LCD.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They are just to small. Then just make totally sure that they are totally unusable SOE put a border around the gems that seems bigger than the blur that masquerades a picture in the middle :P&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm nearly 46 my eyesight is still reasonable. (My arms are still long enough to get most things into focus :))&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the 'NEW UI' icons are useless &lt;FULL STOP&gt; regardless of tints and window size&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I tried copying the old icons over. But the displayed size and that gem border in the new UI rendered them almost useless as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So I too was FORCED to try and keep the old UI running with my limited computer knowledge. I originally /feedback on the 'Test server' during testing. But to no avail.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Luckily I have cobbled together a UI that I can SEE.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But it is still irritating.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I wish I had better eyesight. But I haven't, so I'm hobbling along from patch to patch. Hoping I can keep up with the changes. So far I have including the new bank. But the next patch. Who knows :(&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh! Finally&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you do follow my link to Allakhazam&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I did try Kivuli's "Default_old PoR compatible big bank" it's very nice and could be very useful. But the lettering was a tad to small for me. So I changed back to Oderry's 'Oderry_POR_BigBank.zip'</description>

      <description>Humm!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My young Enchanter Gnome has just started Research. After asking a couple of high level enchanters. (Hehe! one of whom was very surprised I really wasn't after a buff :))&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was given a couple of links and advice and the following list:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Training Beza trivial 60+ - Raw hide armour (Cap or Mask or Gorget or Shoulderpads or Cloak), Onyx and Spideling silk&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Journeyman Beza Trivial approx 100 - Raw hide armour (Belt or Sleeves or Wristbands or Leggings or Boots), Star Rose Quartz and Burned out Light Stone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Go him to Research 60 so far. Using the above combination with a mix of the listed Raw hide armour.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hehe!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I never thought of looking at EQTrader. I thought they were only tradeskills. While writing this I checked it out :)&lt;br&gt;If you check the note at the bottom of EQTraders 'Training Rune (beza)' entry it states. Quote: - "Notes: any size raw-hide cap, mask, gorget, tunic, shoulderpads, or cloak works in place of the raw-hide skullcap"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Good Luck in completing the quest :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Edited due to an inability to completely read all the above messages :D&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hehe! I missed the link in the previous note that takes you to the same page I found. making my posting just a duplicate of previous posters. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hehe! that will teach to check the forum at 2:30am after a great evening of play :D&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Denzyl on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;03-04-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;02:33 AM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

I noticed that &lt;a href="http://www.sps-systems.co.uk/trolleyed/4/3/5/110/index.htm" target=_blank&gt;Strategic Plus Software&lt;/a&gt; were taking orders for PoR.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Service and delivery. Means I will do business with them again, if they have anything I want :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As far as I know they are the only sellers of the retail edition of PoR in the UK.</description>

      <description>Humm!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Graphically nicely done. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The entrances from the Deserts. Do look imposing :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But once inside, design wise. It isn't a city anymore.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First I see why there are deserts all around Freeport. As they have had to burn all the trees to keep warm, because no one has seemed to have invented doors! The occasional gate. But a dearth of doors. Freeport thieves must be spoilt for choice :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then difference between the 'Good' &amp; 'Evil' side, this is my biggest disappointment. I was expecting a claustrophobic rabbit warren slum (Like Pratchetts Ank Morporks – Shades) But instead we get a couple of boarded up holes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The patrols of Knights and Militia look good. One bug though is the cleric type character in the Knight patrols seem to always far to close to the Knight infront, to the extent they often merge. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finally everyone seems to live outside as the city planners have either banned or forgotten the housing. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So overall&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;9 out of 10 for Entrances.&lt;br&gt;7 out of 10 for Graphics.&lt;br&gt;3 out of 10 for Atmosphere.&lt;br&gt;1 out of 10 for City Planning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;5 out of 10 in Total&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Better that Nektulos.

      <description>Humm!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I use a mish-mash of mainly the older UI.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because the older spell icons are readable. Not just a tiny coloured smudge that have no contrast. :(&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Overall the pretty bits of either UI aren't of any interest to me. I wouldn't score either of them highly in a design competition :P&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But I use the older frames. As it makes the icons large enough to see them. :(&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I liked the new mouse cursors. So I use them. :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So overall I learning XML and cobbling together an 'Old Codger's' UI to suit my needs :D</description>

      <description>Humm!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If 'not' getting an Experience Message is a bug&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While your looking at Freeport.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Guards in Nektulos Forest don't give an Experience message either. This was happening well before PoR. But I assumed was because you didn't want the guards killed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But as they always attack my characters as I try to sneak or skirt around them. I usually have to try and out run them or if I can kill them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While they drop swords and other loot. They never gave Experience messages.&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Denzyl on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;02-22-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;11:59 PM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

      <description>Thank You Kinada&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For for gracing this forum with your in-depth and intellectual insight into peoples reasons for using the old UI.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The main reason I use the old UI is that the new icons in the new UI are unintelligible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am most likely older than you and my eyesight isn't as good as I expect yours is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So I find the new icons are just small and colourful smudges with no definition to me. So they are useless.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you bothered to read most of the threads on the new UI. The icons are the major drawback. they are to small and unreadable. Followed by the fact the new UI doesn't run as well as the older UI.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am using the older UI as I wish to continue to play.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not because I cannot be bothered to re-learn the controls.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Up to the last change. All the UI changes were an improvement. It was a bit of a pain re-learning where everything was. But I did it, as each new UI was a MAJOR IMPROVEMENT.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The current UI was a major step back in usability.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If it turns out that after PoR comes out I cannot fix the old UI to work with it. Then I will have to go and find a custom UI that I can read. Then re-learn all the controls again so I can continue to play.</description>

      <description>Hehe!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don't have a paladin. But I am finding this argument over Unicorns as a mount fascinating.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First to clear up some of the haze. Overall Tornicade_IV entries are correct in the description of the Unicorn as a 'Charge' on a coat of arms. As well as his potted version of the lore.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The easiest Unicorn to find is the Coat of Arms for Scotland&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The generally accepted 'short' meaning of a Unicorn on a coat of arms is 'Extreme Bravery or Courage'&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now as for the meaning of and lore surrounding a Unicorn. Well, to save having to write it all out check these websites :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.unicorncollector.com/legends.htm" Target=_blank&gt;Unicorns - The Complete Story of Unicorns through the Ages&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.unicorn-dream.co.uk/unicorn2.html" Target=_blank&gt;The History of the Unicorn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you want a potted version of how the legends changed over time :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Medieval.&lt;br&gt;The Unicorn was a dangerous but extremely brave animal that defended the weak with its own life if it needed to to. So it was seen as a symbol of extreme courage and bravery. Also almost impossible to catch unless you had a handy maiden. But with a savage edge. Though more refined than a Lion. As it was in the Bible it must exist.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Victorian.&lt;br&gt;With the rise of romance came the rewriting of a lot of the older legends and stories. King Arthur being one of the best known. But also part of that was the taming of Unicorns. As a beast that defended the weak and pure. Nothing could be more weak and pure than a virtuous maiden. So the image of this savage beast feeding from the hand of a beautiful maiden, preferably one with no cloths on. This was an irresistible lure to poets and writers, especially as this could all be justified by citing the some of the lore. The rest of the Unicorn's savage history was soon forgotten&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hollywood&lt;br&gt;Well Hollywood likes nothing better than a bit of cleavage and a damsel in distress. So the Victorian idea fitted perfectly with the box office money making. Who wants facts, if it gets in the way of making money.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hehe!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now you should be able to continue your debate, with a least a little bit more knowledge of the lore behind your convictions. :)</description>

      <description>Hehe!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was on the test server. I did feedback that the new Icons were unreadable as they had no contrast and looked like smudges to me. I Got zero response :(&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As can be attested looking at all the threads on the UI in this forum alone there are a number of ways of getting the best mix of old and new.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The way I did it is as follows :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At first I tried the old Icon Graphics in the new UI. But in the end I created new UI folder called 'Real UI' copied the 'default_old' over to it and added the files below from 'default' to stop the in game error messages.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Currently the only 2 files from 'Default' UI you need to keep the old UI current are:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;EQUI_GuildManagementWnd.xml&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;EQUI_OptionsWindow.xml&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you want to keep the new login screen replace the old ones from 'default_old' with these:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;EQLS_background_01.tga&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;EQLS_background_02.tga&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;EQLS_background_02.tga&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;EQLS_background_03.tga&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;EQLS_background_04.tga&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the only part of the new UI I liked were the new cursors, I added them as well, they are the files with '.cur' endings&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for the up and coming changes. As long as there is no new XML code handling in the new files and they keep the same filenames as they currently use. Then straight files swapping may work. I would expect the following file will need updating:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;EQUI_BigBankWnd.xml&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;Plus of course any windows they add for any of the new game functions. These might work if they call the border and graphics the same way as the existing UI.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh and the score over on Allakhazam's forum for what UI :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/forum.html?forum=1;mid=1139019521260626086" target=_blank&gt;What user interface do you use?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course if they do change it all in a way that simple cut and paste fails. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then there is always the 2300 page 'XML for beginners' work bought me and the 2 XML courses that I wrangled out of them as well. As I told them that I needed it to help integrate our new 'Electronic Document Handling System' and our current Intranet. While this is tru...ish. I feel a more pressing need for this around the end of February, might be on the cards  :D</description>
