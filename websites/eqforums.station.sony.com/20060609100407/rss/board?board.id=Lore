      <title>So.....think we will ever find out about Tsaph Katta?</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Lore&amp;message.id=11289#M11289</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I have given this subject some thought and wonder if Katta will have any place in future storylines since he is a bard and was possibly 'saved' by the elves.&amp;nbsp; Lcea's not talking so what do you all think? Is there a place for Katta in the future of Norrath?&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>Do the gods have limits to their influence on Norrath?</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Lore&amp;message.id=11237#M11237</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Most of my curiosity towards this came from the story of how Solosek Ro "arched the spine of the serpent mountains" which ultimately caused the destruction of the Eldar forest. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;What Im wondering is, why, if Solosek Ro can change the shape of mountains, cant Tunare? When he did what he did, why couldtn she undo it? Perhaps she wasnt paying any attention? But wasnt that the time when all the gods eyes were on Norrath? Or did she not care? But why would she leave her most precious creations to destruction? Or was she not able to react? If she was not able to react by simply undoing what Solosek had done why not do something else, or get another god to? She might have convinced Karana to give the area more rain to compensate, but she didnt, or he wouldnt. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Why didnt she take out her revenge on his own followers? If Innoruk hated Tunares creations so much, why didnt he open a portal into the Eldar Forest, like had happened in Kithicor, and spill his hatred out onto it and destroy everything. Also, we have seen&amp;nbsp;many a gods creation go extinct. Why doesnt the god simply recreate them, or improve upon the original designe and reintroduce them?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Gods seem as though they can do whatever they want to us mortals whenever they want. Are there any guidlines they must follow or do they have a limit to their influence? &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;CENTER&gt;&lt;B&gt;Ardathium Vol. I-VI&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/CENTER&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;These brief details are conclusions drawn by me in my brief encounter with the ruins of this lost citadel. I cannot claim any word of this to be absolute truth, for the information I had available was vague, if not cryptic through the impenetrable veil of ignorance and time that shadowed my vision. Throughout the whole of Norrath's libraries and scholars, I was not able to find a single shred of evidence or legend relating to this place. Eerily, it was as if it had never existed, that the memory of Norrath itself had torn Ardathium from its mind.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Ardathium - that is the name of the place I shall detail as best I can in these pages.&lt;STRONG&gt; &lt;/STRONG&gt;A glorious citadel constructed by the first followers of Mithaniel Marr in what is now known as the Southern Desert of Ro. I know for certain that this place exists, or existed, though in unfortunate, irreparable ruin beneath the unforgiving sands of the desert. I have been there, and I have seen it. I cannot tell you where or how to enter this place, for I was forced to leave prematurely during my investigation of the site. An earthquake forced me to escape, or be buried alive with the city's forgotten dead. Unfortunately, the earth swallowed the city further into its belly, the topmost portion of Ardathium's tower was buried deep beneath the sands once more. I cannot say when or if the city will rise again through the will and labor of united men and it would be the wasted energies of a fool to hope for as much within our lifetimes.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In the two and a half days that I was alloted the opportunity to explore the standing portions of this place, I learned so little and yet, so much. A great library had once been housed within the walls of the white and golden city of Truth. Though most of the tomes have dissolved into dust in the cruel clutches of time, I was fortunate to find a few legible documents, preserved by the desert's heat. The script was ancient, but I recognized bits and pieces of the runic tongue of old. This story is one that I have concluded to be a possible fate of Sir Grenic Drere, the hero of our tale, and the fate of the city of Ardathium.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;CENTER&gt;--------------------------------------------&lt;/CENTER&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In the first years to crown the Monument Age, the Fortress of Ardathium was erected in the northernmost fields outside the Elddar Forest. Established by the half elven paladin, Countess Viannay, Ardathium would be the first of the great monuments established in the name of Mithaniel Marr throughout all of Norrathian history. Dedicated solely to the crusades of The Truthbringer in the name of valor, honor, and truth, Ardathium was one of Norrath's most beautiful, though tragically short-lived treasures.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Constructed of pure alabaster stone and crowned in statues and tower caps of solid gold, Ardathium was a sight to behold. Its white and blue banners rose high toward the heavens and the brilliant glinting of sunlight off of its tower's golden caps could be seen for miles above the lush, green canopy of the Elddar Forest to the south.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The Che Virtuson was established shortly thereafter - an elite force of zealous knights and priests dedicated to The Truthbringer and his divine word. A small commune of faithful peasants dwelled within the outer sanctum of the fortress' temple, though the fortress was primarily governed as a war-front against the dark evils that lurked in the eastern swamps of Innothule and the Feerrott. Countess Viannay appointed three Viscounts to her aid, dubbing each of them a General of the Che Virtuson and second in command to only her dominion over Ardathium.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Grenic Drere, a human paladin of Marr who had led several knights and faithful pilgrims to Viannay's aid during the first battles with the troll armies of the east, was among those appointed to lead at her side.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Ardathium would launch several campaigns against the massive trollish armies that dwelled in the swamps of Innothule to the east. Countess Viannay's fervent regard of the amphibious race as a poisonous plague upon the face of Norrath and her military prowess in conjunction with her unchallenged zealous faith in The Truthbringer would lead the Che Virtuson to several victories over their enemies -- all the in the name of Mithaniel Marr.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Unfortunately, Countess Viannay would not live to see the end of her life's work and her death would be the first step toward the glorious fortress' demise several generations later.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;CENTER&gt;--------------------------------------------&lt;/CENTER&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;During one of the greatest battles that Ardathium had mounted against the trolls of Innothule, Countess Viannay fell terminally ill to a foul curse placed upon her by one of the powerful troll shamans, Tjarduugh. Unable to lead her armies and confined to her bed chambers, Countess Viannay handed the reins of her armies to the Viscounts while the high priests struggled to counter the curse. After a mere fortnight of battle, Grenic Drere was the only remaining general of the Che Virtuson and the war had seemed to turn to an inevitable defeat within the clutches of the infectious shadow. His desire to avenge the Countess was overwhelming and upon the final moments of her life, Grenic vowed to fulfill Viannay's life's work.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The Countess' body was to be preserved through the magic of the priests and laid to rest in the grand mausoleum that housed all of Ardathium's heroes in the highest tower of the fortress. In the largest chamber of the tower mausoleum, Countess Viannay's body was placed upon a raised platform of alabaster and gold. She was dressed in ceremonial garb of silk and chain-linked armor and held beneath her hands, folded over her breast, was the hilt of her holy blade. Her body was covered with Soraviene's Veil - an artifact that would kill any creature whose faith was not solely bound to honor and virtue that dared to touch it.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;With the Countess laid to rest, Grenic ascended to hold the title of count over all of Ardathium. His vow to his mistress would become the consuming goal that gave meaning to his life. Two massive campaigns would be launched beneath Grenic's command against the trolls.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The loss of their Countess had fuelled a passion that acted as an impenetrable shield upon all souls of the Che Virtuson, and they were victorious. The troll warlord, a shadowknight known as Kzurott, and his forces were pushed out of the plains upon the first campaign, and the second would lead to the knight's demise. However, this victory would seem hollow, for Tjarduugh, the high shaman that had ended the life of their beloved Countess, remained and much of the troll army stood.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;CENTER&gt;--------------------------------------------&lt;/CENTER&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;No doubt fell upon Grenic's mind that Tjarduugh would launch an attack that would more than likely cripple Ardathium, if not destroy it. His men were weary and few amidst their immeasurable bravery and honor. The attack could not occur if Ardathium were to survive, and above all things, Grenic's vow to Viannay was held in the foremost of all his considerations.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;He ordered the pilgrims to leave Ardathium for their own safety, vowing to them that they would hear word when and if it was safe for them to return. The Che Virtuson were then organized and prepared to act as mediators of defense, for to launch an offensive with such an army of a mere five hundred soldiers and priests would be suicide and inevitably guarantee Ardathium's downfall.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Grenic sent a message with the pilgrims, who had to travel through the Elddar forest to reach safety as he had instructed them to do so. A small band of the migrating pilgrims stopped at one of the elven outposts on the eastern border of the forest.&lt;STRONG&gt; There, they left Grenic's message, which would reach Elwyean in the halls of Takish'Hiz. The great Koada'Dal wizard was quick to follow Grenic's request for his guidance and wisdom, for this several thousand year-old elf was the grand-sire of Viannay and had given his blessing for Ardathium's construction outside of the sacred forest.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The news was nothing new to Elwyean, for Ardathium's impending doom had not escaped the keen eyes of the elves. Elwyean advised Grenic that the destruction of the swamp would diminish much of the troll's forces and would leave them in scattered chaos. Grenic was hesitant, though he did not take Elwyean's advice lightly, for an elf's pledge to destroy a natural niche was not something uttered in every lifetime. The elves of the Elddar believed that the swamp was corrupt - that the trolls' darkness had seeped into every fiber of the land and that even the trolls' destruction would not uproot the whole of the evil that had infected the region. The wizard informed Grenic that the swamp would inevitably be destroyed by the elves, but it was up to Grenic to decide whether or not this act would be one in favor of his city's continued existance, or one executed after Ardathium's fall.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;CENTER&gt;--------------------------------------------&lt;/CENTER&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;After much consideration and prayer, Grenic conceded to Elwyean's advice and asked for his aid, for the swamplands were immune to fired kindled by human hands. The ancient, stoic elf understood and advised further that Grenic station his troops for defensive purposes, and to destroy the trolls that dared to flee toward the forest's borders. Hesitantly, Grenic agreed, knowing that the act would undoubtedly leave a mark on his soul for judgment in the hereafter. However, his heart and convictions were steely upon his promise to the late Countess and the protectino of the great city and everything it stood for.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Elwyean briefly returned to his people to inform them of the coming destruction of the swamp. The elves were on guard for any trolls that penetrated Grenic's forces, though none left the Elddar to directly aid the human citadel. Elwyean's return was heralded in a massive azure, gold, and red maelstrom of arcane fires that erupted across the swamplands. The magical fire could be seen for miles beyond the forest and its glittering flames raged on for days. Grenic's forces destroyed hundreds of troll warriors and civilians that fled for their lives.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;After twelve long days, the swamp of Innothule had been obliterated - the waters evaporated by the searing heat of the blaze and even the most robust of foliage reduced to pillars of ash. Elwyean never again returned to Ardathium or consorted with Grenic after the battle. Grenic's fortress was safe, though the cost of this victory would weigh heavily upon the knight's conscience and soul for the next several decades.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Summons were sent back to the pilgrims that had previously been sent away. Most returned, though a few opted to remain in the new settlements that had begun to establish upon the eastern coast of the continent. All were welcome back, though Grenic denied a celebration in the wake of a time of mourning for what had been done.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;CENTER&gt;--------------------------------------------&lt;/CENTER&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Years would pass and Grenic would see the prosperity of his city rise up from the ashes of its former turmoil. His remorse and shame would lift their scars from his soul and his thoughts would change to that of humble acceptance. Grenic revered what he had done as a necessity, for if he had not given into a tactic that would otherwise be dishonorable, all that he saw before him - the peace and happiness of his people, the people of Marr - would have fallen to damnation and ruin.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The next several decades would bring prosperity and peace to the people of Ardathium. Grenic would produce a son and daughter, Erolysia and Mitharius, twin children who would be named after the patron deity and his respected sister that the fortress had been founded for. Upon Grenic's death, Mitharius, a knighted warrior in the Che Virtuson, would ascend to Count of Ardathium. The great leader's body would be taken to the highest tower in the city and in the great chamber of Ardathium's Heroes, Grenic's body would be laid to final rest beside his comrades.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Ardathium would experience nearly a century of prosperity and peace beneath the leadership of Grenic's bloodline, though a great earthquake and the burning of the Elddar forest would leave the once-white and golden jewel of Mithaniel's legacy upon Norrath in irreparable ruins that would, in the passing eras, be consumed by the desert sands of Ro. The memory of this great city would be lost as the ages passed and turmoil wrought the minds of the modern cultures.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I hope that these words can give resurrection to the memory of this glorious place - that the descendants of its survivors and the scholars of Marr will come forward and restore the proper glory and respect to the memory of a might, though compromised knight's achievements and the history of Marr's first successful mortal campaign. &#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If this is during the time the Elddar Forest was still standing, how can Elwyean be called/considered a Koada'Dal? There were no distinct races of Elves at this time other than Elddar.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I know this isn't exactly lore, but I find the idea of this Gloomingdeep tutorial thing pretty stupid. What was the big problem with starting at the actual starting city of your race and leveling in its newbie zone like people used to? That way, you can get accustomed to your city at a low level, and personally I think it's just funner to level at your city's newbie zone then everyone being brought to the same place to level. It just cheapens the game.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>Archives of Old Expansion Websites?</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Lore&amp;message.id=11146#M11146</link>
      <description>Hey all. I've been trying to track down archival copies of the lore&#xD;
pages from the old expansion websites for Kunark, Velious and Luclin&#xD;
(from PoP forward, Sony still has that stuff available on their site).&#xD;
I found this site:&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
web.archrive.org&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
It has some stuff if you poke around enough, but is far from complete.&#xD;
For instance, I can get to the main page for Luclin from June 3rd,&#xD;
2001, but can't get to the Journal of Al-Kabor lore pages:&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
http://web.archive.org/web/20010603144205rn_1/everquest.station.sony.com/luclin/&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Does anyone know of a site (or have the files themselves) where I can&#xD;
see the actual old web pages? If not, does anyone have or know of a&#xD;
reliable source for the &lt;i&gt;actual, word-for-word&amp;nbsp; &lt;/i&gt;lore from those old pages?&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

      <title>Faction and Lore</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Lore&amp;message.id=11134#M11134</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I have found that faction hits often reveal a great deal about lore. Of particular interest (so as not to hijack another thread) are the factions in Kelethin and Felwithe. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;After each title of the quest I have listed the factions raised. These examples contain no faction hits so that the factions raised cannot be contributed to lowering opposing factions of them. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Bladed Weapons (Kelethin, Heartwood Master):&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/faction.html?faction=68" target=_blank&gt;Faydarks Champions&lt;/A&gt; &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/faction.html?faction=21" target=_blank&gt;King Tearis Thex&lt;/A&gt; &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/faction.html?faction=67" target=_blank&gt;Soldiers of Tunare&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Leafrunner Test of Loyalty (Kelethin, Aliafiya Mistrunner):&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/faction.html?faction=68" target=_blank&gt;Faydarks Champions&lt;/A&gt; &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/faction.html?faction=21" target=_blank&gt;King Tearis Thex&lt;/A&gt; &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/faction.html?faction=67" target=_blank&gt;Soldiers of Tunare&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Yet, there are no quests in Felwithe to raise the faction of Soldiers of Tunare or Emerald Warriors.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Killing the Pained Unicorn (druid epic npc) nets in these factions lowered:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/faction.html?faction=68" target=_blank&gt;Faydarks Champions&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;A href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/faction.html?faction=21" target=_blank&gt;King Tearis Thex&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;A href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/faction.html?faction=67" target=_blank&gt;Soldiers of Tunare&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;As such, I have yet to see any other faction for Kelethin other than Faydark's Champions, Soldiers of Tunare, Emerald Warriors, King Tearis Thex and Clerics of Tunare. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;So as such, I would think it supports the idea that Kelethin has no leader of it's own separate from King Tearis Thex or there would be faction to raise/lower it. Any thoughts on faction and lore?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Oria39 on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;05-24-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;04:53 PM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

      <title>Ruins in Timorous Deep.</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Lore&amp;message.id=11078#M11078</link>
      <description>I was wandering around Timorous Deep today and ran into an invisible wall just out in the middle of the zone, with some ruins past it under water. Not just tiny ruins, a pretty decent amount with some pillars and a large building. I ran for a while till I was able to get past the wall and go down to explore the ruins. They're like the ruins all over the Kunark, stone and such. But why would there be ruins at the bottom of Timorous Deep? Is there lore or something to suggest that TD was once above land? I just thought the ruins and the invisible wall were kind of strange. Loc is -28, -291, -136. &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://img129.imageshack.us/img129/5720/eq000066thumb5qg.jpg"&gt;Screenshot&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://img129.imageshack.us/img129/5154/eq000067thumb1dg.jpg"&gt;Screenshot&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://img129.imageshack.us/img129/2915/eq000068thumb5ij.jpg"&gt;Screenshot&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://img129.imageshack.us/img129/4247/eq000069thumb7go.jpg"&gt;Screenshot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Tulisin_Emarr on &lt;span class="date_text"&gt;05-21-2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;05:43 PM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Ok, I'm supposed to be working on a paper due this week, but for some reason I've been bitten by the lore bug all of a sudden, and I'm wasting hours and hours reading through old posts. Can someone please save me from myself here and just give a quick synopsis of a few things for me?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Basically, what I'm looking for is a quick rundown of the storylines for the expansions after PoP -  where are things taking place geographically (e.g. do GoD and Omens take place on Norrath or in the realm of Discord?), which are the starting and ending zones, who are the main characters, what's going on and what's the &amp;quot;goal&amp;quot; or finale for the expansion, etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seriously, if you guys can help me avoid the quicksand of forum-browsing all day, my GPA and I will be forever in your debt!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>So, some of the monster mission lore is wrong...</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Lore&amp;message.id=11066#M11066</link>
      <description>So there's those monster missions where you play Dain Frostreaver I, killing giants in the great divide and founding Thurgadin, Dain Frostreaver II, a Warrior, attacking Kael Drakkal, and Dain Frostreaver III (haven't done this one yet).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Dain Frostreaver I died in the Crystal Caverns killed by Drachnids (presumably) long before Thurgadin was founded, Dain Frostreaver II, the Priest King, led his people to build Thurgadin secretly, where they remained hidden for his entire lifetime (there never were the attacks and aggression against Thurgadin that incited his attack on Kael Drakkal), and Dain Frostreaver III fought the armies of Kael Drakkal, driving them back across more than half of the Eastern Wastes, until eventually being pushed back and slain at the hand of King Tormax himself at the end of the War of Yesterwinter, in a battle that took place at the edge of the Great Divide.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You can learn all this by talking to Loremaster Solstrin in Icewell Keep.  He's in a room in the bottom, where the bodies of the three previous Dains are kept.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[Sat May 20 22:58:41 2006] You say, 'Who was Dain Frostreaver I?'&lt;br&gt;[Sat May 20 22:59:33 2006] Loremaster Solstrin says 'Here lies the body of his majesty Dain Frostreaver I. As the son of Colin Dain, he was the first crowned Dain of our people and also the first to carry the name Frostreaver, which was given to him by our people for his skills of dispatching Kromrif in melee combat. Original keeper of the magic axe Frostreaver, which has been passed down to our current Dain, he was a close friend of Glight Snowchipper and aided him in engineering the crystal caverns. It was there he met his death on a mining expedition deep into the caverns. No one was ever quite sure what killed him, only that the bodies of him and his party were found bloated and corrupted by foul poisons.'&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[Sat May 20 22:59:37 2006] You say, 'Who was Dain Frostreaver II?'&lt;br&gt;[Sat May 20 23:00:28 2006] Loremaster Solstrin says 'Here lies the body of his majesty Dain Frostreaver II. Known as the Priest King, he was the only Dain whot was a loremaster before his father died and he was crowned Dain. It was by his will that we left our home in the Crystal Caves and founded Thurgadin. He worked closely with the architects and miners to ensure Thurgadin would be built secretly and defensively. Dain Frostreaver II died of old age with his dream intact, our city had yet to be discovered and our people lived in relative peace and safety for more than five centuries.'&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;[Sat May 20 23:00:43 2006] You say, 'Who was Dain Frostreaver III?'&lt;br&gt;[Sat May 20 23:01:34 2006] Loremaster Solstrin says 'Here lies the body of his majesty Dain Frostreaver III. Known as the War King for his hot temper and brutal combat tactics, he ran a brutally offensive campaign that routed most of the giants from the Great Divide and half of the Eastern Wastes. Eventually, with the powerful magic of the Kromzek and the overwhelming might of the Kromrif, his armies were forced to retreat to the border of the Great Divide where he was killed on the battlefield in single combat at the hand of King Tormax. This war is now known as the War of Yesterwinter.'&lt;br&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Recently I took a little trip to the Plane of Time (A) and spoke to a few of the residents.  While they had varied accounts as to how they actually arrived in the Plane of Time, several of them spoke of a troupe of gypsies who were somehow involved in placing them there.  Who were these gypsies, and why did they abduct people from Norrath and deposit them in the Plane of Time? &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I know it she is a hard to pin down woman at best! But anyway, I always thought she was a dark elf cleric guild master , who had the power to change into a high elf, and as such had infiltrated the Arcane Scientists.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I know she is (was?) the wizard guildmaster, and had also read that she is (was?) the actual head of the Arcane Scientists. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;(I got this from Alla mainly)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;But now according to the Story Window she is just the librarian, and not only that but she is now an enchanter!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Well I guess if she can be a cleric and a wizzie she can be an enchanter. And I guess she could have also been demoted down to librarian (ook?) but I wonder why this wasn't worthy of note in the story window?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Have I missed something? I know she is pretty tricky to pin down!&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Looks like this is the name of the next expasion, its been trademarked by SoE and there is a Serpentsspine . com  registered by them as well.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Serpents Spine of course is the moutain range in the centre of Antonica. and of course is near Rujarkian hills which could indicate the next player race may be Orcs or Goblins, the two races most tied to that area.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I think this expansion will encompass all of the old world adding on many missing areas found on the old EQ maps, I say this because they have already said EQclassic will be included with the expansion. They have also said you will not have to leave the expansion (or old world) to access all the new zones, and its also mostly going to be large outdoor zones that are not instanced.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I think we are going to finely see things like the Grand Plateau or the Unkempt woods or Wayunder Lake finaly apear as zones we can visit.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Nallae on &lt;span class="date_text"&gt;05-04-2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;03:46 PM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Maybe I have missed it somewhere but where are the Mines of Gloomingdeep supposed to be? I have a young character in the tutorial who is a forager and so far has foraged Sop Bark, Petrified Redwood, Oak Bark and Kromdul Carrot.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;These things are all foraged in Kunark (a couple are also foraged elsewhere). Sop Bark (Warslik's Woods), Petrified Redwood (Warslik's Woods, Overthere), Oak Bark (Kithicor, Warslik's Woods) and Kromdul Carrot (Warslik's Woods).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Anyone have more information on the location of The Mines of Gloomingdeep? If it is supposed to be in Kunark, how and when did Kobolds get there?&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;H1&gt;The Crusade of 1312 A.G.&lt;/H1&gt;&#xD;
&lt;H3&gt;1312 A.G.&lt;/H3&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;This is the time of the scattered and defeated Iksar empire. The great dragon, Trakanon and his allies of scale have left the empire in rubble and our people are divided yet again. The once grand city of Sebilis is claimed by the one who decimated it. The remaining Iksar are scattered among the outlands of Kunark. Their places of refuge are now the dwellings dark denizens. In the wilds a few castes come to unite. One of these are the remnants of the Crusaders of Greenmist. They are lead by a powerful shadowknight named Rok Nilok.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The army of shadowknights numbers in the hundreds. Within their ranks are a few mystics and legionnaires. The tribe names itself after their leader, they are to be named, The Crusaders of Rok Nilok and they shall purge the lands of Kunark.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The Crusaders burn across the Dreadlands and death comes quick to those who dare stand in their way. They slay many giants and many goblins. Their shall be no prisoners or slaves. The empire shall be rebuilt by the hands of the Iksar. All other shall perish.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Karnors Castle is the first major objective of the Crusaders. It has now been taken over by a goblin clan. The Goblins soon find themselves under siege. For twenty days they hold ground until the Crusaders choose to assault as a band of goblin deserters flee. A swift battle ensues and the castle is reclaimed. The Crusaders now set their sights on the city of Cabilis. While the march is designed Rok Nilok discovers something very evil. Nothing is known of his discovers. No record exists of it's evil. All that is known is that Rok Nilok made a pact and soon shall suffer for it.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;During the battle for Cabilis a strange rain falls which shrinks them to the size of dolls and their heads are set aflame. Nilok's head burns red. And the goblins squash the would be emperor and his minions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;...should it be taken seriously or not?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;What makes me say this is I was reading about the &amp;quot;Fall of the Combine Empire&amp;quot; MM and its a 180 from what the old lore tells about the Fall.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Originaly it was said Seru poisoned Katta and his &amp;quot;body&amp;quot; is placed in stasis by his wife in some secret location... in the MM Seru and Katta engage in a Duel and Seru kills him...though if you win Katta respawns, its clearly a Lot different from the old manual story and how npcs in Katta discribe the final days of the Empire.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This makes me wonder about other missions, should mm lore be considered an &amp;quot;outdside&amp;quot; source of lore? I mean technicaly its not &amp;quot;in norrath&amp;quot; as you are entering some sort of &amp;quot;time warp / dream state&amp;quot; when doing them, could they be taken as just someones interpitation of past events and you are reliving thier (twisted?) memory.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;What do you guys think about the lore coming out of them?&lt;/div&gt;</description>
