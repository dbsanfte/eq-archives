<DIV>The unwillingness of people to advance in Gates when it provided just that, a single group method which is difficult to attain flags for a zone,&nbsp;as well as how few people have done the easy single group quest to get into tactics argues very strongly against wasting time adding a single group quest.based access.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The best choice has been made... single group content with greater reward than the Elemental Planes that's open to anyone, regardless of flags.</DIV></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Gates was a colossal disaster, please do not use it as an example.&nbsp; Their 'retuning' of the expansion came after people such as myself decided I had made a good decision NOT to purchase it.&nbsp; I stand by that decision.&nbsp; It was and by all accounts from most of my friends that have been there, it&nbsp;still is&nbsp;Crap.&nbsp; /shrug But you may like it.</P>
<P>The common method to passing any of the Trials in Gates was a chanter charming a pet because if you were not heavily EP or Time geared, you were not going to pass. That is why there was 'unwillingness of people to advance in Gates'.</P>
<P>PoP was designed around the flawed premise of juggernaut guilds, and they partially 'fixed' it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since they basically ruined much of the game for people (making it more a job than a game (and yes it still can be challenging w/o what it has become)), people lost any interest and/or faith that Sony could pull their heads out of their collective rear ends and make something people wanted.&nbsp; I am not talking about the selected few raiders that got to head to the summit, but the bulk of the population of the game.<BR></P>
