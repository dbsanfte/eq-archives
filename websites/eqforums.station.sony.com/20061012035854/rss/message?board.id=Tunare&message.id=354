    <description>I've been away from EQ for about 3 years now. I spent that time playing most of the new age MMOs and never really found one that was quite as challenging as EQ. So I was just wondering how much has changed since I've been gone and if there are any guilds recruiting new members since I would like to have people to talk to while I grind up to higher levels. Currently im a level 3 Half Elf Bard but hopefully by the end of this week I'll be around 10 or 15.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gyher&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>I did originally play on tunare, but all the people I knew have left. Why is it so bad for the Eci people?&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I am from E'ci from before the merge.&amp;nbsp; I have played EQ for years continuously. I have played a single char as my main all this time (level 70 425AA) I have a couple of alts etc.&amp;nbsp; IMO This post is total BS.&amp;nbsp; This person is apparently spending more time posting about problems he is having such as perceived people griefing him, guilds he has tried to join that treated him badly, etc etc &amp;nbsp;than he is actually playing EQ.&amp;nbsp; Makes me wonder.&amp;nbsp; The merge definitely DID help with getting groups.&amp;nbsp; Was nice to see Plane of Knowledge go from 10-15 people in the afternoons to 100-150.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The above is completely innaccurate.&amp;nbsp; The vast majority of the server has blended perfectly fine.&amp;nbsp; There, of course, are those who are stuck on the fact that Eci got merged with Tunare or Tunare got merged with Eci and won't just drop it and play on the server they currently do, Tunare(Eci) which is what is listed on the server select.&amp;nbsp; The only time there ever really was any problems between Eci ppl and Tunare ppl was immediately following the merger which makes sense since both servers still had pride in where they came from, but even then for the most of the server got along with each other fine.&amp;nbsp; If anyone is still getting treated badly, then it is likely that they make a big deal out of it all.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The community is mostly towards how Tunare was in the past, due to the fact that Tunare was a fair bit larger than Eci.&amp;nbsp; But there are new twists and a lot of&amp;nbsp;Eci based things have&amp;nbsp;their roots set firmly as well.&amp;nbsp; Most of the guilds who survived the mergers have mixed rosters and it is all fine.&amp;nbsp; The big thing from Eci&amp;nbsp;that has taken firm roots is the public raiding channel.&amp;nbsp; Like the guilds it's pretty much blended well between the two.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;As far as the grouping stuff goes, it is most definitely better than it was the before the merger.&amp;nbsp; Immediately following the merger wasn't too much different but then in the time since then a lot more people have came back and it's not too bad.&amp;nbsp; Though it does depend on what time you are trying to get a group and somedays you just don't have any luck and sometimes you have too much.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;if you are from tunare before the merge if not  your a  ECI  person like my self  run dont walk to another server..  trust me   its not the same .. and not for the better...&lt;/div&gt;</description>
