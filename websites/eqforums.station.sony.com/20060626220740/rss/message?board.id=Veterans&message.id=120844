      <description>Past - Present - Future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Class "Balance" or "re-envisionment" is still the 800lb gorrila in the room.  Three expansions later and still several classes are feeling left out in the cold with no role left to them do to changes in the way game mechanics have been handled do to content design by the developers.&lt;br&gt; - What are the plans and timeline to address this issue.  Note, plans without a timeline are not plans.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Immersion - Once the hallmark of Everquest; immersion is now the by-word for other MMOG's.  What are the plans to bring back the feeling of a unified immersive world.  Immersion is accomplished with by the creation of a unified rules set, compelling unified in game lore, and graphical unity in look/feel that mesh all aspects of the game (not just those aspects in the 'latest' expansion).&lt;br&gt; - What are the plans and timeline to address this issue.  Note, plans without a timeline are not plans.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is an ever growing list of "bugs", missing features from previous expansion that where advertised and paid for yet never delivered upon, broken quests, etc.&lt;br&gt; - What are the plans and timeline to address these issues.  Note, plans without a timeline are not plans.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;LDoN vs. DoN.  It has been stated by the development staff and the designers that the current progression hope is for the player base to go from the tutorial zone, to thier starting city, to LDoN.  In LDoN they expect the player base to adventure from the low 20's to the mid to high 40's, possibly higher.  It has also been stated by the developers that they acknowledge that the risk vs. reward vs. time for LDoN is such that it is not a reasonably method for gear itemization.  i.e. The level 40 armor set you are saving for will be obsolete before you can afford it with LDoN points as you will be level 50 before you can afford it.&lt;br&gt; - What is the time line for addressing this issue.  i.e. if it's more than x number of months, it's essential the same as saying never to a growing segment of the player base.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In years past the SOE development staff has stated an almost limitless number of ideas of things the "plan" to do to improve the look/feel, mechanics, and balance of the game.  The small minority of those ideas when finally presented have resulted in the player base having to purchase the latest expansion.  The vast majority of those ideas have never been enacted on.  In fact many core items advertised as released product in the expansions have failed to be released ever.&lt;br&gt;- What are the plans by the SOE staff to be more transparent in milestones, and issues under development.  i.e. If SOE says that something is "under evaluation", what proof do the users have that the issue is being progressed on?  i.e. Why should we believe anything SOE says either at the Summit, or in advertising?</description>

      <description>I posted my "Evil Agenda, September 2005" this morning.  A lot of the recommendations came from this forum thread.  Thank you.  Here's a copy:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Loral's Evil Agenda, September 2005&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With the announcement of SOE's latest Everquest Community Summit it was time once again to sit back and ponder the best possible future direction for Everquest. Previous evil agenda covered everything from encounter variety to mentor systems and many of these items are now addressed. With the latest expansion released only two weeks ago, it becomes difficult to say for sure where the future should head.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We begin this Evil Agenda start with four larger areas for improvement and then include a list of a few smaller areas or areas already discussed previously (often at great length). Let us begin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. Further Improve Monster Missions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Monster missions added a whole new gamestyle to this six year old game and it has become a favored style of play for many since its release. Add 18 and 24 person monster raids to give any group of 18 to 24 players a chance to try out the raid style so popular with many higher level players. Offer missions for groups with three players. Continue to use monster missions as a way to experience lore by tying them to old moments in Norrath history.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. Continue to Tie Future Expansions to Old World Lore.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Many nostalgic players talk about the great days of Kunark and Velious. By making these two older expansions part of the core base of the game, SOE can then base instanced dungeons, monster missions, and even entire expansions off of these older lands. Many players now off in other lands may return if they see "Everquest: Ruins of Kunark II" on the shelf.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3. Improve the Dynamics of Combat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;New AAs like Gift of Mana show a new style of combat where random elements can change player behavior during combat. This leads to new and unique battles instead of typical "Step 1: complete heal, step 2: see step 1". Consider the heroic opportunities from EQ2. Work on encounters that increase difficulty without simply upping the creature's damage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4. Improve the 20 to 50 Game.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These past six months we have seen a new tutorial, new 10 to 20 missions, and two rebuilt newbie zones. New 20 to 50 missions and tasks will help players grow from these new additions to the later content found in Omens of War, Dragons of Norrath, and Depths of Darkhollow. New mid-level missions, more quests, new armor quests, or even an "epic-lite" quest would greatly improve the 20 to 50 game.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With those four major Evil Agenda points behind us, lets look at a few additional changes that would continue to improve the game:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Continue to tune spirit shrouds to ensure usefulness above level 55.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Find solutions to the limitations of the global model file.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Rebuild Plane of Knowledge to reduce lag, add features, and improve cultural bonding (like "Halastown").&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Add an sound effect as an option when receiving a tell.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Find a way to make new player models a possibility.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Add a separate con color for mobs within five levels of the player.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Improve the point-rewards for LDON gear from 20 to 65 to make LDON viable for gear progression again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Make "/" work for cross server and cross game tells instead of ";" and "[".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Further consolidate and simplify the user interface. Combine like windows.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I look forward to the future of Everquest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Loral Ciriclight&lt;br&gt;24 September 2005&lt;br&gt;loral@loralciriclight.com</description>

&lt;P&gt;I completely agree with this! Absolutely! The lore was sort of lost after the Gates of Discord....&amp;nbsp; The problem of course is that you start to run out of continents and planets at some point so depths of darkhollow put us down underground to explore.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;However, if you look at the map there are many areas that don't have zone names to them. Some of them were adressed in LDoN missions, but there are still many areas that could have an actual zone attached to it and form a nice expansion.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The area between Kithicor Forest and Quenos (The Karana's mainly) has pretty much been neglected. LDoN featured 3 camps very close to each other in North Ro, South Ro and East Commonlands, but the wide open Karana's got nothing..... Okay, there is one in Everfrost then. The LoY expansion mainly featured a connection from Odus to the pirate outpost. GoD and OoW featured new continents and/or planets and moved away from the Norrath Lore. DoN and DoD are very close together zonewise with DoN completely based out of Lavastorm, and DoD completely based out of Nektulos Forest.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The last few expansions have been pretty much focused on the Freeport to Lavastorm area, but the Karana's are underused and the closest new content that was added to that area was the Everfrost LDoN camp. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;A next expansion should bring new life in the Karana's. Possibly with "Underfoot" type missions underground just like DoD, and a few new zones that attach to the Karana's that have recently been discovered by adventurers. Looking at the map they could add "The Unkempt Woods", "Serpent Spine" and in the Feerott/Rathe area they can open up a zone called "The Dead Hills". Odus has areas on the map with names like "The Grand Plateau", "The Gulf of Uzun" and "The Barren Coast" that could be used to add an expansion to.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Maybe that is their longterm goal either way, to work their way across the continents of Norrath and add expansions to the various old world zones like they did with Nektulos and Lavastorm. What we surely do not need is another far away continent or planet. We need the old world to tie into new expansions. Kunark and Velious included.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>By the way, for those of you looking for quests to be fixed, Rainbird has been posting on the "Broken Quest" thread constantly last week, with fixes for many of the quests listed there (including finishing some of the ones he was unable to find evidence of), so action is being done in that regard.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One of the main things I'd love to see for the future of EQ include:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. Bring about incentives to travel again. The exploration quest in DoDH was excellent; I'd love to see similar quests for people of various levels to explore their home lands and continents.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. Get people of all levels mixing again, especially outside of PoK. One of the best things about LDoN during its peak was that you had L65's rubbing shoulders with L20's at the LDoN camps in old world zones. It would be great to see more of that in the future in general.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3. Pull some of the big mobs out of their instances so everyone can see them. Hulcror in WoS is a good example of that; people hunting in WoS (when he's up) can see him guarding the entrance to MPG and wonder when/if they'll be able to take him on. Ditto for many of the other big mobs in WoS. DoN sadly I found lacking in that respect; but it would have been nice to see some of the dragons wandering the noninstanced (especially Broodlands) even if they were unattackable. (Can't say for DoDH yet)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4. Add some more stuff in the Qeynos region; it seems everything is focused on the Freeport side of the continent (DoD, DoN, and 3/5ths of LDoN are all on the Freeport side). It would be nice to see more happening in Qeynos/Karanas. Maybe (and I know EQII's history is separate) we can see some Knights of Karana scouting areas in West Karana to build their stronghold.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;5. Progressive quests that you can work on throuhg your levels would be great in general.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;6. I would love to see Religion and Race become bigger factors in game, with the addtion of Racial and Religious specific quests and AA's.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Rawr More dragons.&amp;nbsp; I remember dang near wetting myself when I was running through DL one fine day and running smack dab into this big white dragon... Or Porting to&amp;nbsp;Wakening Lands&amp;nbsp;and have the dragon ready to gobble you up... West Wastes is an awesome zones here a dragon there a dragon everywhere a dragon. Its called Broodlands I think there should be a dragon wandering about...&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Yes a Blackburrow mission would be fantastic..As a Barbarian I lived in there..Nothing like the blind Corpse run down the tunnel at level 6 to get my uber&amp;nbsp;Rusty sword and some noob quest stuff bag.. It would be fun to lead the train of gnolls against the infidel for once...Alternately revamp Blackburrow into a high level raid zone....&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I am all for some fun in the Karanas...last few times I was there they were empty. THere is a lot of potential for future expansions like DoDH without adding new worlds but by getting people back to the old zones. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Update FEAR ...PLEASE ..This was for the longest time the most intense white knuckled, eyes glued to the screen raid..It lived up to its name..More of this please :)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Have the tutorial drop new players off in their home city instead of PoK and make the books unusable till say level 20. Alternately institute a quest where they explore a slew of the old world zones and bring stuff back.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I wanna be Dvinn or Emperor Crush and storm down and terrfiy the people in throne room.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;More Religion and Race effects please&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;4. Improve the 20 to 50 Game.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;These past six months we have seen a new tutorial, new 10 to 20 missions, and two rebuilt newbie zones. New 20 to 50 missions and tasks will help players grow from these new additions to the later content found in Omens of War, Dragons of Norrath, and Depths of Darkhollow. New mid-level missions, more quests, new armor quests, or even an "epic-lite" quest would greatly improve the 20 to 50 game.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;How do you feel DoD fits into this?&amp;nbsp; There are no level requirements in the DoD missions, and I think that's great.&amp;nbsp; I've done a couple with my daughter, and she's tickled pink about it.&amp;nbsp; We never could group before, because I was so much higher than her.&amp;nbsp; Now, with the monster missions, we both get decent XP, and can do something together.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;With those four major Evil Agenda points behind us, lets look at a few additional changes that would continue to improve the game:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* Continue to tune spirit shrouds to ensure usefulness above level 55.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* Find solutions to the limitations of the global model file.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* Rebuild Plane of Knowledge to reduce lag, add features, and improve cultural bonding (like "Halastown").&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* Add an sound effect as an option when receiving a tell.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* Find a way to make new player models a possibility.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;In addition to this, I'd love to see new graphics in all the old zones.&amp;nbsp; Especially now that the monster missions are taking us back to many of them.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* Add a separate con color for mobs within five levels of the player.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* Improve the point-rewards for LDON gear from 20 to 65 to make LDON viable for gear progression again.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* Make "/" work for cross server and cross game tells instead of ";" and "[".&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Another one of my pet peeves.&amp;nbsp; This drives me crazy like you wouldn't believe.&amp;nbsp; I'd add that we should be able to join chat channels from any game to any other just by typing /join eq.drinal.market : password even if I'm in SWG, or MXO or EQ2.&amp;nbsp; Right now, it's so dang difficult to join chat channels from other games into EQ, and should be simplified.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* Further consolidate and simplify the user interface. Combine like windows.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Here's another one about the UI.&amp;nbsp; Make the EtN UI download into a separate folder, so that everyone can use it if they so choose, without having to put it into a special custom folder.&amp;nbsp; This would also eliminiate the constant downloading of the entire UI when you wanted to join EtN.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I look forward to the future of Everquest.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Loral Ciriclight&lt;BR&gt;24 September 2005&lt;BR&gt;loral@loralciriclight.com&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I would like to see the ability to pass LDoN points to alternate characters.&amp;nbsp; Also, the points earned from each LDoN site would need to be copies to the alternate so that they could be spent.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;My main now has about 2k points from stuff that has been cashed in for refunds that he will never be able to use again.&amp;nbsp; With the extreme difficulty in getting LDoN groups these days many alternates will not be able to get LDoN spells that are very desirable.&amp;nbsp; Group Temperance and Remove Greater Curse come to mind.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I would like to know the status of the "class-reinvisionment" as well.&amp;nbsp; I want to Know what you are doing, and how much longer it is going to take to finish. Or if you totally gave up. Cuz i am tired of wishing and hoping that issues will be resolved if there is never an intention.&amp;nbsp; I would also like a much higher quality of CS.&amp;nbsp; Waiting 4 days to get a body back from a hacking bug that was created due to your patch or w/e, Is rediculous.&amp;nbsp; There needs to be a GM dedicated to every server, along w/ a few guides to help them.&amp;nbsp; What has this CS come to?&amp;nbsp; A bull crap reply about we are sorry but your screwed?&amp;nbsp; 300 dollars a year from me and I get the shaft?&amp;nbsp; CS needs major improvement, mostly in numbers as most of your GMS are overwelmed, but do good when they actually get to interact with the customer.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I agree that there should be class discussion, why do we play eq? so we can have alts that are better than our mains? NO, because we like our mains and we dont want to have to make an alt cuz they are more useful on a raid because our class is becoming so obsolete it is rediculous.&amp;nbsp; Expansions need to stop immediatly and issues that we want resolved need to be addressed and fixed.&amp;nbsp; I refuse to buy another expansion, if you release a new one and dont fix the classes, then i will refuse to subscribe, and just go play nintendo or xbox becuase i will boycott any Sony product.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>Please separate single group and raid progression. Single group quests should unlock single group content, and raids should unlock raid content. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A player shouldn't have to do single group quests in order to raid, or raid to get the gear to do single group content. (And for 'doing single group quests in order to raid', read 'waste the time of 5 people from their guild doing content that they've already done 20 times and find incredibly boring by now.')&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The worst offender is the Anguish signet quest. Being forced to camp 7 signets, most of which are just hard enough that most people can't solo them, but too easy to be worth good XP, for every member of a raiding guild is very frustrating. In every guild there are always people more willing to help out than others and the system places a disproportionate amount of burden on them especially when the guild reaches the stage of finishing off stragglers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Note also the complete failure of the Qvic/Txevu alternate access quests - no one does them because previously unflagged groups can't use them, and raiders would rather *raid* to get their people flagged than make people single group camp old content for recruits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A system like the current state of Ikkinz trials and DoN (won't pass judgment on DoD yet as the endzones are still obscure) where only one person needs to have completed the single group progression to request raids is fine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another problem is the single group progression: 68 spell missions in DoD have bosses that are too difficult for people not wearing raid gear, and the loot from the missions in general is not good enough in general to provide upgrades for the higher end non-raiders that were doing content such as MPG group trials.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Single groups should also have been able to earn access to Qvic or a similar "reward" zone without raiding - surely the 6 MPG group trials should get you access to something. Hopefully, dreadspire will be accessible to non-raiders and provide good rewards.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;One other thing I'd like to see brought up would be the evolution (de-evolution??) of customer service.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Yeah, I want to see banning/discipline numbers -- how many and what it was generally about, like exploit, poor sportsmanship, item/plat/account service.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I'd also like to see a category when you petition on account selling, best category I can come up with is exploit.&amp;nbsp; But I'd also like to know what is planned (or not planned) -- will CS stay as is?&amp;nbsp; Will it grow?&amp;nbsp; Will it be more visible?&amp;nbsp; What is the stated goal/mission of CS?&amp;nbsp; For example, are they to right wrongs caused by coding etc., mistakes, or is their stated goal to handle petitions in 1 minute or less?&amp;nbsp; Are they there basically for item/death loop type things?&amp;nbsp; Do they actually do anything about account/plat sellers (not even the quiet ones, the open ones that advertise in /shout, /ooc and in channels)?&amp;nbsp; I really appreciate CS and I certainly wouldn't want to listen to every single whiney/obscene/barely or completely un-understandable petitions, but I've always had concerns about their mission and responsiveness.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Perhaps it is just perception, and I know people have always complained about CS, but it does seem worse than the old days even with the more "automated" system.&amp;nbsp; I think a GM presence, actively seeable on /who all GM (is that button still in the premades for new characters?), would help a lot, even if nothing much was done, just that they were seen regularly moving through the world.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Again, maybe it is just perception but when we all see people running around with offensive names (not talking about phrases or stupid names, purely offensive names), knowing that they have been petitioned multiple times by multiple people, when we see the channel spammers come in night after night after night at the same time with the same name, when we see all the other bad things that we see, we feel like nothing is done.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I know guides are "just" volunteers (thanks to all of you who participate, you aren't just guides you are very special people), but I don't seem to run into very many events.&amp;nbsp; When I do, they are usually the riddle master or some pointless version of tag.&amp;nbsp; Now, don't start harping on me because I am talking about guide run events, not the dynamic events with the expansion launches.&amp;nbsp; Even if I chose not to participate in most of those (the war type events) I do appreciate dynamic as opposed to static content and while I would like to see old stuff broken get fixed, I do like the time and energy spent in making Norrath et al a changing place.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;And speaking of account/plat/item selling, I'd like to see an official published response on the matter (not on the forums but on the home page) especially in light of the servers in EQ2.&amp;nbsp; Something like, (a) No we are not intending to offering that service in the foreseeable future; (b) We have been considering and debating the issue and if we do allow it in the near future it will be on (new) (some) (all) servers; or (c) Yes, we do have plans to implement this within the next year on (new) (some) (all) servers.&amp;nbsp; LOL of course, I am hoping for (a) but I want to know if the reason we see so little visible action from CS is that they have a hand-off directive or if it is planned to be a feature.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;grrr... computer crashed I didn't see the previous post so my apologies if this does appear twice.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;In regards to the evolution of Everquest, were the revamps of Splitpaw and Mistmoore considered successes?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Scaling for popultion changes, do more people play there now (on average) as opposed to before the changes?&amp;nbsp; (not talking about sightseeing right after the change, now thta some time has passed)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Is the time spent considered well spent, or in hindsight would the efforts have been better spent elsewhere?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Personally, I liked the revamp of Lava.&amp;nbsp; I am neutral to the revamp of Nektulos, it does go together better with lava now but then there is no real transition into the EC,&amp;nbsp;I like some things about the Nektulos but I don't really like the boundary trees.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;But I've never been a fan of the Paw and Mistmoore changes.&amp;nbsp; So far as I can tell, less people hunt in them now.&amp;nbsp; Hard for me to judge though because I rarely bother to go in and do a /who.&amp;nbsp; I do sometimes though, if I'm doing a butcherblock ldon or hunting in SK.&amp;nbsp; I usually pop my head in to find that I am all alone.&amp;nbsp; It is true that I was often alone in Paw or Mistmoore, but just about as often there were other people there (more often in Mistmoore where there would sometimes be actual groups plural).&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>Personally, I would like to see Sony make an expansion that, when people are done farming with it, the expansion itself hasn't become a joke. People are duoing in MPG and RSS. That's. Just. Wrong. The overpowering of gear in this game is ridiculous.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The idea of people single grouping AoW annoys me, too. I want raid encounters that can never be single grouped due to the complexity of the encounter, like, say, Emp Ssra or the 10th Coldain ring.</description>

The whole point of getting gear is to become more powerful, which will ultimately trivialize encounters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now the level of difficulty is a question.  I would be ok with an end-zone, or part of a zone, for an expansion being only realistically doable by people who have raided in the expansion a bit (or in the case of smaller expansions like DoN, at least farmed the previous one a bit), and being unreasonably difficult for non-raiders.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, asking for encounters to be never single groupable is ridiculous.  So you don't think AoW should be groupable?  What about Trakanon?  Talendor?  Nagafen?  Warlord Skarlon?  For end game raiders, these encounters are trivial to do, but the loot is trivial also.  That's simple risk vs. reward.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You mention Emperor Ssra as not groupable, but I actually think that he could be.  Of course for the group doing it, all of his loot would be completely trivial.  They could bring along friends/alts for the loot, but what's wrong with that?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You want gear to not matter and skill to be the only factor?  Sorry, go play FPS games.  In a computer RPG, the character that you have built (both in terms of XP and gear) is extremely relevant to your capability for doing things.  That's just how this genre works, and there are quite a few of us that like it that way.  In fact, one of the major problems with the end game currently is that melee gear continues to scale upward, but end game caster gear provides little additional benefit.  For casters at least, end game gear needs to be much more powerful.</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana size=2&gt;Re-use of and revitalizing&amp;nbsp;older quest content.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana size=2&gt;Older quests which have rewards that are tremendously outdated and unappealing for a player to put for the effort to do these quests, could be given a new life by offering new rewards--items which appeal to players enough to do these quests (and of course the reward would need to be balanced properly in relation to the quest).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana size=2&gt;If not a new reward, then perhaps reward the player with a noticible chunk of experience, calculated on an average time the quest would take to do for the quest's appropriate level range.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana size=2&gt;Or a type of point or token reward system (again, balanced in regards to the quest's appropriate level range and amount of time to complete), that would allow players to do old quests, gain points or tokens, to redeem at a vendor for viable and appealing rewards.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;2. I would like to see Plane of Time fixed, it's had way too many issues of late. Mostly involving phases not popping when they should.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Keep up the good work, the MM database rocks btw.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;2. I would like to see Plane of Time fixed, it's had way too many issues of late. Mostly involving phases not popping when they should.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Keep up the good work, the MM database rocks btw.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;please submit your experiences to gemdiver or myself via email :) that includes info for our MM db as well as just general reactions about the expansion (please spellcheck first!) and maybe will be able to do a feature with peoples responses&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;To me, "evolution" implies two active processes - one in which new things are born, and an equally important on in which old things die.&amp;nbsp; The evolution of this game so far has concentrated exclusively on the former.&amp;nbsp; While I have very fond recollections of the old zones (at least the ones I got a chance to play in before getting swept up in the "new expansion advancement" mentality that permeates this game now), I think it is time for them to fade completely from existence.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;It pains me to return to zones that were once thriving with activity, that were the essence of all that was fun and active, and see them completely empty and meaningless now.&amp;nbsp; I can't describe the feelings in words, but I would prefer to keep them in my memories only.&amp;nbsp; So, I respectfully suggest that Sony consider finding a way to gradually remove the parts of the game that are now no longer played and have become largely irrelevant to the vast majority of active players.&amp;nbsp; While I do miss those times, sometimes quite intensely, I think it would be healthiest for them to pass from the conscious world.&amp;nbsp; I suspect this would be a very difficult job, since although those zones offer nothing relevant to the current game, they remain an integral part of it.&amp;nbsp; And I mean that from both a psychological as well as game mechanics perspective.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;It is easy for this kind of idea to get swept up into the inane discussion of "classic servers", but that temptation should be avoided.&amp;nbsp; The past never was really as good as you'd like to think it was, and so it is best to lock it safely away in memories rather than trying (and most certainly, failiing) to recreate it.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
