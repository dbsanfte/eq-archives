    <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;I think maybe they should have made this server one character per account just to avoid twinking. Of course people with multiple accounts, would still be able to hand things off to each other or you can get a friend to hold your gear while you log your main and bring your alt on, but the shared bank slot thing was a ridiculous addition to the game. I used to be vehement anti-twink back in the day. I think it ruins the game when someone who is level 10 with level 40 gear monopolizes a&amp;nbsp;camp for days at a time and then whines to a GM about KS when someone tries to take the one mob they need from the camp to finish the quest they are on because the jerk refuses to let them in for the minute or two they need. I used to make a game out of trying to catch people drop twinking then grabbing their gear and running with it. They were getting a lot of complaints about it, I suppose, because for a long time the MOTD said that if you drop an item or money on the ground, you did so at your own risk. I used to know many of the hiding places people used to use and I used to hang out invised or hidden waiting for someone to drop something then camp out. Some were&amp;nbsp;clever and stacked things inside tradeskill containers so you couldn't see the little bag on the ground, but I used to make a point of searching those, eventually, too. I used to run for the zoneline but lingered just long enough for the inevitable &amp;nbsp;/shout. I would then zone, happy with a job well done. :smileyvery-happy:</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;the progressive server wont be a success (in long terms)...at the latest till luclin opens&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;thats why:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;U&gt;The dream of an EQ-Basic/Kunark/Velious Server only:&lt;/U&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;this game was supreme back the day before luclin ports and pop books came out. fact is: thousands of people where sick about that (+ other things) and moved on to play 2nd class games like worldofdisney etc..&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;open 1 server pvp with RZ or SZ rulesets and 1 server pve preluclin (&amp;lt;lvl 60) and i swear, you (SOE) will be surprised, how many people will reactivate their accounts.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;just take a look at the present servers...every single oldworld zone is deserted cause everyone is playing the endgame-raid 24/7 .... this was not "the vision (tm)" of the game, remember?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;remember the high contested camp for the testament of vanear in highpass?, remember traveling an hour from odus to faydwer? remember the temple of ro class armor quests? the cool looking blue lambent armor for bards? remember the badge quest in qeynos?&lt;BR&gt;remember being jealous seeing someone wielding 2 short swords of ykeshas? the stein quest (oggok)? the tamburine quest collecting coins in every city? all this hard work to get the faction up as a bad guy till luclin came out?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;SOE, you really dont need to do the same errors like all other mmo-developers to stay competitive, i.e. an expansion every 6 months = less people per zone = ghosttown...eq is unique....go back to the roots...at least with 2 new servers (pve/pvp) non&lt;BR&gt;progressive. heads up for the first step in this direction with Combine!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;i recommend - instead of programming another&amp;nbsp;5 expansions&amp;nbsp; - to consolidate and optimize the oldworld (EQ,Kun,Vel.) with the improvements (mechanic) and content (quests) of the last years and voila..thousands of reopened accounts (iam sure on this one)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;there is a big potential of people who want to come back, dont let us wait till eq will become opensource one day to make our dreams come true...&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;all the best&lt;BR&gt;mitic&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>instead of making another "progressive" expansion they could do an expansion IN an preluclin server (i.e. vah shir starting city in kerra isle)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;its good to see so many people supporting the preluclin-server &lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I for one would like to see a pre-Luclin server, it'd be my home.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I renewed my account after reading about the progressive server.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I will probably cancel my account again once the moon opens like I did back when Luclin lauched and the old world dried up and died.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I don't think I'll get bored with the old world until after&amp;nbsp;I have 8 top level toons on my account and grandmastered all the tradeskills and done all the quests, should take me&amp;nbsp;years to accomplish at my casual playing pace.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I think the devs are aware that the progression server won't be an indefinite success, hence why they mentioned that once The Combine catches up with the live servers, it will be turned into a regular server and (if demand is there) a new progression server will be started.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I also think that a true classic server would be fun only for an even shorter time. How long do you think it will take until people run out of stuff to do and get bored? The nostalgia wears off.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I would never get bored for the same reason I still go through all the Zelda's over and over.&amp;nbsp; REPLAY VALUE.&amp;nbsp; Everquest has replay value written all over it.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Mix it with the nostolgia, and you can't get away.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Why do you think people that have played this game for 5 + years are coming to the combine?&amp;nbsp; They're totally restarting everything from ground 0.&amp;nbsp; Replay value.&amp;nbsp; The journey of everquest is SO fun.&amp;nbsp; Which is why I would never stop playing EQ if there was a classic type server.&amp;nbsp; I love the old world content so much, I would never stop playing it.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Would be nice to hear anything from the devs on this.&amp;nbsp; But I am imagining they will wait and see how much of a success the Combine Server is.&amp;nbsp; Hopefully they wont wait till the point when most of us leave the server (right around Luclin/PoP).&amp;nbsp; We have the odd person commenting saying that we are all crazy and this will never work but I think the vast majority wants a preluclin/PoP game.&amp;nbsp; Some may be coming here because it is a new server, some may be coming here because they want to be the first to do something somewhere, but most of us are coming to this server because we dont like the turn EQ took from Luclin/PoP and on.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;We could care less about this stupid idea of progression.&amp;nbsp; What most of us want is the old game before it was gimped.&amp;nbsp; I dont know how many people need to say that before SoE understands.&amp;nbsp; There is a large market for a server like this.&amp;nbsp; If you want to make non-gimp expansions to add on after velious go ahead.&amp;nbsp; I assure you this will cost way less and be far more successful then making EQ3.&amp;nbsp; :)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I know I cancelled my EQ2 account 1 month after&amp;nbsp;trying it.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Only took a few retards in my group causing me enough shared debt to say screw it.&amp;nbsp; Stop trying to reinvent the wheel and just give us what we want.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>While I certainly agree that for me the expansions of Kunark and&#xD;
Velious far surpass anything done since, I don't agree that a "classic"&#xD;
server with only these expansions in it would be a worthwhile&#xD;
endeavor.&amp;nbsp; Yes, those were the best.&amp;nbsp; Yes, after Luclin things went to&#xD;
hell.&amp;nbsp; Yes, PoP was the worst idea yet.&amp;nbsp; BUT, that doesn't mean that&#xD;
doing it all over again that way would be as good as it was the first&#xD;
time around.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
But what do you do when you're level 60 and have NToV armor?&amp;nbsp; Kill the&#xD;
Sleeper?&amp;nbsp; Hehe, I dont' think so.&amp;nbsp; So there's really not much left to&#xD;
do.&amp;nbsp; Theoretically once you've done that you've "won" that version of&#xD;
EQ, and the only thing left to do is either start over with a level 1&#xD;
toon, or quit the game.&amp;nbsp; Now it might take 2-3 years to get to that&#xD;
point, but when you get there you're done.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
That is the ongoing problem of every MMO.&amp;nbsp; Any game based on character&#xD;
growth either must allow continued growth of the character, or find&#xD;
itself in need of a continual stream of new blood to go through the&#xD;
whole process from the beginning again.&amp;nbsp; The problem with both of these&#xD;
is obvious and I won't bother going into them here.&amp;nbsp; In any case, there&#xD;
has yet to be a game that has found a better solution.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
I like the notion of taking a mature game and placing it effectively&#xD;
back in its infancy.&amp;nbsp; We know how it will grow, but not when.&amp;nbsp; We get&#xD;
the benefit of expansions without having to pay for them, as they have&#xD;
already been paid for.&amp;nbsp; It would be very interesting to have the&#xD;
expansions able to be opened out of order, so that we could see which&#xD;
are most valued or most popular in any case.&amp;nbsp; However it works out, I&#xD;
think that opening new servers always gets a lot of attention, and one&#xD;
where new discoveries are tracked would play right at those who always&#xD;
brag about being first to do whatever.&amp;nbsp; Good for them.&amp;nbsp; I doubt I will&#xD;
do anything first, unless I get lucky day 1.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Progression is more interesting than anything else in any MMO I've&#xD;
played so far, and when other games become matuer enough to make it&#xD;
worthwhile perhaps EQ will have blazed a trail in that area.&amp;nbsp; I think&#xD;
it's the wave of the future for mature MMOs wooing new players.&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Call me crazy, but I don't care what expansion I'm playing in as long&#xD;
as their is an interesting community beside me. And to the people who&#xD;
disapprove of raiding, please take note that your opinion is your own.&#xD;
Some of us find raiding to be one of the most enjoyable aspects of the&#xD;
game, and not just for loot. For a whole different experience that you&#xD;
wouldn't understand unless you've tried it.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Everyone has different ideas about what broke the game and it is&#xD;
impossible for SOE to satisfy all those needs in one fell swoop. Like&#xD;
Teresa said, the hope that The Combine will offer just a brief&#xD;
opportunity to fulfill &lt;i&gt;some &lt;/i&gt;of these desires is compelling&#xD;
within itself. In all honesty, it is about the closest any of us can&#xD;
get to what we are asking for on these boards, so it would be&#xD;
unfortunate to spoil it by dwelling on the issues that shouldnt be&#xD;
present in the idea of a "progression" server in the first place. No&#xD;
one at Sony ever mentioned anything about a classic server, or gave any&#xD;
hints that it will stop at a certain expansion. It is ment to &lt;u&gt;progress&lt;/u&gt;, &lt;i&gt;all &lt;/i&gt;the&#xD;
way. My condolences to those that saw this as an opportunity to shape&#xD;
the new server into their hopes and dreams, but it was not meant to&#xD;
entail these fantasies. To reiterate, it has one sole purpous: to&#xD;
progress. Not to limit. Those asking for anything else are just wasting&#xD;
their breath.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;I left&amp;nbsp;in April 04', waited and was part of&amp;nbsp;EQ2 beta- played until January 06'- when i couldn't stand it anymore.&amp;nbsp; Am now waiting for Vanguard (where it is rumored there will be an actual&amp;nbsp;'penalty' for dying- a rarity I know)- &amp;nbsp;I am seriously considering a return for the Progression server because im not overly impressed with the recent buzz revolving around Vanguard.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;As a casual player I would only be interested in the first two expansions as some others have stated.&amp;nbsp; Because of this,&amp;nbsp;I&amp;nbsp;will probably leave after Luclin is opened- either to a new progression server, a "classic" server or just leave again.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I do however understand the fiscal need to make the server "progress" until it catches up to the current servers.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; But If Im playing a max of 10 hours per week and enjoying the exploration of new areas of Kunark when&amp;nbsp;I am level 25, I don't want to be left in a deserted landscape filled with lv 65, 200+AA guilds farming BoT&amp;nbsp;for scrolls a month after the server goes online.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;For this, I sincerely hope that the devs make things significantly difficult to progress from expansion to expansion.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I agree that luclin ports and pok killed a lot of the original fun. Faction as one major roleplay aspect is another reason since luclin.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;But more important are the new level caps, xp modifiers and loot of the new expansions. The old world would still be deserted, as long as you have zones like tutorial and paludal caverns. What more powerful are you really if you got 5 or 10 levels more? It is still not enough for the new mobs anyway, but it makes all older zones obsolete.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Why do some of you people think that selling expansions is the main goal for SOE? They would get more money out of the game if they could hold the players with their monthly subscriptions without selling any expansions. These are made only to attract the bored players, take a lot of efforts and have to be given away for free after some time. Kunark and Velious seem to fit better just because they still required the old world and added more missing high end content.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;EQ was like a world in the beginning, then it became the "quake with rats". It was still hard (I think a lot harder than old EQ), but not nearly as complex as in the beginning. Of course that is just what a lot of players wanted, so I would not blame SOE. The success of the progression server will show how many players really like the old complex game.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>I likewise would like to chime in and agree with the OP.&amp;nbsp; I reactivated upon reading about this new server and wandering these forums for a few weeks, and I have ZERO desire to log in my main (pre-elemental lvl 65 mage), and when I log in my 44 rogue twinky, there's 2 people on the ENTIRE SERVER in my level range lfg.&amp;nbsp; And creating a new character?&amp;nbsp; I was the only char in Greater Fay for about an hour before I just got sad, lonely, and bored.&amp;nbsp; And guess what?&amp;nbsp; That's because the focus of the game went to max level raid content, but the player base has changed from being high school age kids with an abundance of time, to nowadays we're married professionals that just don't have the time to invest in hours and hours and HOURS of raiding.&amp;nbsp; Hence the playerbase left.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm on the fence.&amp;nbsp; My account is cancelled and will run out in a couple weeks, since the focus I'm seeing here is "Let's give the uber-ite raiding racers a chance to... race some more" rather than catering to their actual playerbase.&amp;nbsp; Hell, I remember when they fought the notion of an RP server because, according to Verant "Every server is an RP server.&amp;nbsp; This is a role-playing game."&amp;nbsp; I doubt we'd see that now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I miss the old world.&amp;nbsp; I miss the old game.&amp;nbsp; I miss grouping at low levels in Greater Fay.&amp;nbsp; I'll never re-capture that again, I realize, but that doesn't mean that I can't have new experiences in new lowbie zones, making new friends, making new stories.&amp;nbsp; This game used to be something epic, something grand, something heart-poundingly exciting (DVinn, anyone?), but now the game's all about min-max munchkin number-crunching on your magelo profile.&amp;nbsp; Sorry, but that's not for a lot of us.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for the suggestion that they could add more content to the old-world zones rather than increasing the number of zones in the game, let me further that notion by saying: why not ADD LOW LEVEL CONTENT?&amp;nbsp; I haven't played every class in the game, and I haven't played every area in the game, and if you give me incentive to replay exciting interesting new content in old zones, guess what?&amp;nbsp; Assuming I have people there willing to play through it with me, and a reasonably decent RP environment, I'm going to do it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The game used to be about having fun, and exploration, and the challange and fear of going places you haven't gone and doing things you haven't done.&amp;nbsp; Most of us haven't leveled every lowbie zone with every lowbie class, and you give us incentive to do it again, we will.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You introduce the POK books and teleporting, though, and it's over. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;End of story.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;U&gt;The dream of an EQ-Basic/Kunark/Velious Server only:&lt;/U&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;this game was supreme back the day before luclin ports and pop books came out. fact is: thousands of people where sick about that (+ other things) and moved on to play 2nd class games like worldofdisney etc..&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;open 1 server pvp with RZ or SZ rulesets and 1 server pve preluclin (&amp;lt;lvl 60) and i swear, you (SOE) will be surprised, how many people will reactivate their accounts.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;just take a look at the present servers...every single oldworld zone is deserted cause everyone is playing the endgame-raid 24/7 .... this was not "the vision (tm)" of the game, remember?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;remember the high contested camp for the testament of vanear in highpass?, remember traveling an hour from odus to faydwer? remember the temple of ro class armor quests? the cool looking blue lambent armor for bards? remember the badge quest in qeynos?&lt;BR&gt;remember being jealous seeing someone wielding 2 short swords of ykeshas? the stein quest (oggok)? the tamburine quest collecting coins in every city? all this hard work to get the faction up as a bad guy till luclin came out?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;SOE, you really dont need to do the same errors like all other mmo-developers to stay competitive, i.e. an expansion every 6 months = less people per zone = ghosttown...eq is unique....go back to the roots...at least with 2 new servers (pve/pvp) non&lt;BR&gt;progressive. heads up for the first step in this direction with Combine!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;i recommend - instead of programming another&amp;nbsp;5 expansions&amp;nbsp; - to consolidate and optimize the oldworld (EQ,Kun,Vel.) with the improvements (mechanic) and content (quests) of the last years and voila..thousands of reopened accounts (iam sure on this one)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;there is a big potential of people who want to come back, dont let us wait till eq will become opensource one day to make our dreams come true...&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;all the best&lt;BR&gt;mitic&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;

&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;You lost me after this:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;"the progressive server wont be a success (in long terms)...at the latest till luclin opens..."&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;This server is going to be amazingly succesful and if it has problems it will be after PoP opens and it becomes the expansion grind.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I do agree that there is a market for capped server that tops out at "X" expansion.&amp;nbsp; PVP especially needs to cap before all of the instancing.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I agree with this thread.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;It would be nice to have a server where twinking was not possible. I'm not saying twinking is "wrong", we all do it, but getting your own gear by your own hand&amp;nbsp;is/was a good chunk of the fun of EQ. I think people are overlooking this aspect a lot. So it would be nice if it simply were not possible. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;PVP and PVE servers would be great. Both were more fun back then.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I don't think that unlocking the progression stuff is a big&amp;nbsp;lure, not for&amp;nbsp;me anyway. Personally I'd stop it at Velious if I had to pick a specific point, or at least consider carefully which expansions should really be unlocked.&amp;nbsp;PoK and Luclin were the bane of EQ to me. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;I think maybe they should have made this server one character per account just to avoid twinking. Of course people with multiple accounts, would still be able to hand things off to each other or you can get a friend to hold your gear while you log your main and bring your alt on, but the shared bank slot thing was a ridiculous addition to the game. I used to be vehement anti-twink back in the day. I think it ruins the game when someone who is level 10 with level 40 gear monopolizes a&amp;nbsp;camp for days at a time and then whines to a GM about KS when someone tries to take the one mob they need from the camp to finish the quest they are on because the jerk refuses to let them in for the minute or two they need. I used to make a game out of trying to catch people drop twinking then grabbing their gear and running with it. They were getting a lot of complaints about it, I suppose, because for a long time the MOTD said that if you drop an item or money on the ground, you did so at your own risk. I used to know many of the hiding places people used to use and I used to hang out invised or hidden waiting for someone to drop something then camp out. Some were&amp;nbsp;clever and stacked things inside tradeskill containers so you couldn't see the little bag on the ground, but I used to make a point of searching those, eventually, too. I used to run for the zoneline but lingered just long enough for the inevitable &amp;nbsp;/shout. I would then zone, happy with a job well done. :smileyvery-happy:</description>
