				<DIV>My casting window is not coming up for my Main Character.&nbsp; I do not have a custom casting window, however I am using a custom UI.&nbsp; The really odd thing is that even if I change my UI to default it still doesn't come up for this character.&nbsp; However if I switch to another character&nbsp;the casting window comes up fine.&nbsp; I have tried completely renaming the UI_Charactername files to allow EQ to rebuild the character UI files and that still did not work.&nbsp; Anyone have an idea of what I'm doing wrong or any suggestions of what I could try?&nbsp; Is there a keyboard shortcut that hides the casting window?&nbsp; Even if there was it would show up after I wiped out the UI_Charactername.ini files, technically everything should reset then (it did except the casting window)</DIV>

				<DIV></DIV>One other thing is that my character doesn't auto-target when using a bow like it used to.&nbsp; Before I did my reinstall I used to be able to press the Range Attack button and the toon would automatically move to face the mob.&nbsp; It doesn't do that anymore, I have to manually keep turning my character in order to keep the mob on the screen so it doesn't give "you cannot see...." error message.
