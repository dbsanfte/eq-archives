				The "Nok, Nok Who's Powder" task (obtained at level 32 from one of the Iksar task masters in the Swamp of No Hope) contains this same direction as its next-to-last step. The directions say, "explore the ENTRANCE . . .," but I've been through every inch of that tunnel complex--and all three of its "entrances" (FV, PoK, and DL) many times over, with no luck. As there's only one cave in Firiona Vie that "leads to the Dreadlands," it's probably a safe bet that this one's broken.<br><br>NOTE: The directions in my task included a reference (hint?) about learning much from "the faces of the wild." So, I turned my attention to the two statues at the FV entrance . . . clicked them, tried climbing them, cursed at them, etc. Nothing. And thinking that maybe the task writers were playing fast and loose with the word "entrance," I backed up and investigated the many stones in that area (some of which seem to have runes or designs on them), hoping to find a friendly(?) face. Still nothing. Except multiple butt-kickings, courtesy of the local drachnids.<br><br>Merely FYI,<br>Ras
