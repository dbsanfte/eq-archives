      <description>Having 3 recipes that need the same INSANELY rare is irretating to say the least!  I've killed drakes in the Broodlands, Tirranon's Delve, and Lavaspinner's Liar and not seen any drake wing bones drop.  Am I hunting in the wrong places?  At least with the Brewing Trophy there was only 1 insanely rare drop (Stone Beans).&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>I'm waiting on 4 Drake Wing Bones to finish the task and get the reward.  I'm guessing that I'll have to remove the task and redo everything once the new task gets to the live servers?  Is there anyway to get credit for what I've already done and turned in?  Thanks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>The drop rate on Drake wing bones is really too low.  I believe you are huntng in the right places.  I got one from a nest mission and a freind said they got one in a creator, so I am wondering if they only drop in missions.  Does anyone know?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>I have been trying to get this trophy now for a while. No Bones dropping and prices in the bazaar stay at 3000pp per. What happened to the idea that a tradeskiller could be a GM at level 1! Apparently in order to hit 250 you must be level 70, cause I find it just barely managable to solo the occasional drake in Broodlands! I have trouble soloing in Lavaspinners Lair with the lack of room to kite and roots are very unreliable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Flatley Riverdancer</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I have changed this task,&amp;nbsp;but it needs a patch to go into effect.&amp;nbsp; I still have not heard an ETA for the next patch though I expect there will be one this month.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone know what this change was on test?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have 2 of the Bones and have 3 lines that require them.  One of the lines requires 2 of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can do 2 lines... or 1 line.... but if I guess wrong then I might still need MORE bones after the change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently I am simply putting off doing any of these until it goes live.  Would be nice if I could go ahead and do the unchangeing ones.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
