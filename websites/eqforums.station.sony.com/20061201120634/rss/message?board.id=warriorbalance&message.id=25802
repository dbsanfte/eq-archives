      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;i have seen people on the Boreds Post about endr Regen and i know befo thay did the Big change there was a Endr Heal bards had a song Bsts had a HoT Shammys had a heal for it but now none of them work.. now i am a War that raids Tacvi CoA and after i get a battle rezz to get back in the Fight im Really Low on Endr how about Fixing some of them Endr Heals and songs to help ot the wars to regen it for Fighting im not gear Great only have about a 8.5k endr Pool but it gos fast..&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;i seen some 1 Post for a Fear AA where we can not be feared At All would love to see that but dont think thay will seeing as theres to many raid mobs that AE fear if might end up costing more Lives then saving .. i know thay gave us an AA called War Cry.. but at 30 Secs best&amp;nbsp; its almost useless seeing as Killing a Time mob still takes about 90 Secs at Max DPS yes i still raid time for Fun and Alts Lol. and i want a Dbow just to say i got 1 ...&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;and there was a Disc i was goin to say something about but cant recall the name because i never use it ... it says that it increases the anger with all your Atks well it dont the Disc kinda dont work at all maybe Kicking up the anger mod on that would help out some i will repost&amp;nbsp; on this when i have the name of the Disc ..&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;thats all for now Folks see ya on th battle field..&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;Think you are confusing stamina regen abilities with endurance regen abilities. Stamina (bar) no longer exists so nothing that effected it works.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;As i sit here and read my AAs on a war i come down to 1 that is under the Gates Tab says Heightend Endruance and it says that this Ability raises the your Natural Endruance&amp;nbsp;regeneration rate by 1 Point Per ability Level..&amp;nbsp; now that we got the AAs down i wanted to know how come thay dont FIX the Old spells that Did help Sta regen Like the bard songs and shammy heals to STA to make them Help out the Endr regen maybe giving shammys Clrs Drus a Endruance HEAL for maybe at Most 1k that would help out Wars Zerkers Monks and other High useing Endr Classes Alot more so on raids after rezzes not every 1 is High end Geared with a 10k Endr Pool... regening my wars 8.4k Endr Pool is really really slow and i use it like Clrs use mana ..</description>

      <description>The view of the devs is that END regen isn't really needed that much except in the case of death. That portion will largely be reduced by the new downtime changes going in next week when TSS launches. IF you can manage to stay out of combat for a few minutes after your rez, you should have little trouble regenning your END to full. Of course the fun part is going to be the whole "stay out of combat" part during a raid.</description>
