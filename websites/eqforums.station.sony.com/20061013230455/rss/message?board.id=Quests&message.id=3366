      <description>&lt;div&gt;I just started the Vah Shir cultural missions and got to the point of having to kill wolves in Dawnshroud Peaks.  Well I found a few at first but then they got rare so I logged on my 70 Ranger to track on other account.  Well what I found was that the mobs were not in the &amp;quot;real world&amp;quot;.   I would track and after running around in circles following track I came to the conclusion that they must be under the world.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I sent in a petition and the GM response is the usual junk answer of, &amp;quot;I have investigate the issue and the number of NPC should be present in the are available there as also I like to tell you that the NPCs is having a spawn timer of their own.&amp;quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Well good for you but that doesn't explain why tracking the said NPCs I am completely unable to find them.  Did he even read that part in the petition?  I have seen this problem in the past with other MOBs to find out there was an issue.  These guys are suppose to be our support and we don't get the proper help.  I could have showed him but he chose to close the petition rather than get with to investigate and resolve the issue.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Enough ranting but if any devs happen to read this could you please investigate further.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;By mistake I delited the masters quest I was told by a GM it can be gotten again but there is something i have to do to get it, GM said thay can't just let me get it again and start it over.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Said I had to find out how to do it and ask friends in game. OK I have done this and after endless surching one guildy fround a place where it said to redo the first and second tasks. I did this and I destroyed my first books and got new books, But after doing that I still can't get the master quest/task called The Gray. Please if you can help me I would be very thankful.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;LOL bad spelling sorry I do say the grey but i wish it was that easy to get it back I wouldn't be putting a post here if it was as easy as spelling it right :)&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;(( I can see you don't have a clue as to what i am talking about))&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I already had the Master task and was working on it,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;But delited it by a mistake and you can not get this task back as easy as you can 98% of other tasks. Since the GM told me to come here to find the answer as to what I have to do to get it again He said&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;(( you can get the task back again to do it over BUT there is something you have to do to be able to get it back again)) He said it would be best to ask others if thay know someone who had to do it to get my info. I did alot of looking befor i did this post. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;So&amp;nbsp; sorry for my typo I am not a good speller. But for getting quests/tasks if&amp;nbsp; the npc don't respond anyone with a brain checks to see if thay spelled it right.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;This is not my first time getting Quest/tasks Anyway I thought doing a post I would get help??&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Maybe some day someone will read it and have a clue as to what i am talking about But thank you for your time anyway Zunnoab-Stromm At least you tried :)&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wolves in DSP can invis and they are non aggro to rangers, druids, and beastlords. Run some other class around the zone for a bit and you should find all kinds of wolves lol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did you have soe up or some form of see invis? With a 70 ranger i find it hard to believe you didnt have some form of see invis....cause several ranger self buffs have it built in......but thats the only thing i can think of that might have been causing this problem.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

There are traps on the paths/dried out riverbeds (or whatever they are). Anyone who paths over the trap spawns a wolf and gets a message that says something along the lines of &amp;quot;A bloodthirsty wolf jumps at you&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you stop and look around you will eventually find a wolf standing there looking a bit silly and doing nothing at all - provided you play a class that is by design non-kos to old world animals like Ranger or Beastlord.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trap that is easiest to find is on the path right after you exit the zone building coming from Netherbian Lair. Another one is on the path near the rock guys and one more on the shore of the pond the task sent you first. The traps reset on something like a 10 minute timer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I did the task about three weeks ago I found the best area to be south of the merchants near the hopper cave and north of a little lake near the big house. Hunt everything that paths through there, especially the zelniaks. It seemed to me they were sharing the spawn table. Once the area is cleared of mobs go to the trap locations, then back to the area north of the lake for respawns.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>No its true tho, mobs have been falling under the world in DSP for a long, long time now.  Its not just wolves, any of them can.  But yea like the previous poster said there are a few triggers in the zone that spawn bloodthirsty wolves when you get near them.  If you know where those are via your map you can go that route.  Most commonly known one is right on the path just in front of NL zone as you walk out into DSP.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I didn't think the blood thirsty wolves update the mission.  I spawned a couple of them and didn't watch to see if it update the mission.  I went there again with my Ranger and tracked several mobs and found them not in the &amp;quot;real world&amp;quot;.  This included, Zelniks, lightcrawlers, wolves and tribe guys.  A Dev needs to look into this but not sure how to get them on it.  I bugged it but you never get any response to bugs.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;You are correct.  When I did this task more than a year ago I had the same problem.  Many of the wolves were under the world.  Very frustrating.  The plus side was that /tar seemed to work sometimes and they were in casting range and the line of sight check didn't seem to care.  I think they've revamped /tar to check LoS now though... or maybe I'm wrong.  I'm not sure I just know it worked sometimes then. &amp;gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edit:&lt;br&gt;Come to think of it the ground in that zone must not check LoS anyway because my HoS song was working.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Zunnoab-Stromm on &lt;span class="date_text"&gt;05-21-2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;01:28 AM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
