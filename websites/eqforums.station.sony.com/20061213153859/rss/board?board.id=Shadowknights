      <title>TSS spells - comments and suggestions. [FTAO: anyone who has authority to change spell data]</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Shadowknights&amp;message.id=5746#M5746</link>
      <description>A comment was made in a thread on veterans forum that if anyone thinks spells need "fixing" or tweaking that details should be given as to what the problem is and why its a problem.&lt;br&gt;I've also included some suggestions.&lt;br&gt;hopfully I've articulated my thoughts well enough to show why i think changes are needed for some SK spells.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=10233&amp;amp;source=Live" target="_blank"&gt;Bond of the Blacktalon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;there is no way to focus or crit the heal portion of this spell.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;this&#xD;
means that from the moment you buy it, it's less efficient then a&#xD;
direct tap so long as you have crit aa and/or a magic damage focus.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;this goes for all sk tap over time spells since PoP atleast [didnt look back past that]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;but I'll deal with the numbers from TSS [and also include the numbers from the lvl 70 direct tap.]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bond of the Blacktalon&lt;br&gt;Decrease Hitpoints by 155 per tick&lt;br&gt;Mana: 507&lt;br&gt;cast time: 3 [1.6 iirc with hybrid spell haste]&lt;br&gt;Duration: 7 ticks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;155 x 7 = 1085 dmg/heal&lt;br&gt;1085/507 = 2.1 hp per mana&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;there is no way to focus the heal portion, either duration or potency.&lt;br&gt;the heal portion can not crit and a dmg crit does not crit the heal because the heal is a "recorse".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=10327&amp;amp;source=Live" target="_blank"&gt;Touch of Severan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Decrease Hitpoints by 1238&lt;br&gt;Mana: 719&lt;br&gt;cast time 1.5&lt;br&gt;recast: 12&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1238/719 = 1.7 hp per mana&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;but &lt;br&gt;a crit blast doubles the heals&lt;br&gt;a crit heal obviously also doubles the heal&lt;br&gt;a crit blast and a crit heal can occure on the same cast for quadruple heal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;with&#xD;
maxed crit blast and heal AA there is a 45% chance of a crit blast or a&#xD;
crit heal and a 2% chance of a crit blast plus a crit heal so far as I&#xD;
can tell.&lt;br&gt;so with those AA about 45% of the casts will yield a 3.4hp per mana ratio and 2% will be 6.8 hp per mana.&lt;br&gt;that averages out [if my math is right] to 2.48 hp per mana on every cast. [average over time]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;thats without taking focii into account.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#xD;
have a 60% magic focii, which acts at 42% on lvl 75 spells, the average&#xD;
percentage is 21%, so each DD life tap is on average 21% larger to&#xD;
begin with.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1238*121% = 1498 [1497.9 to be exact i think]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1498/719 = 2 hp per mana. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;using the same method to factor in the crits as i did above i get on average &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;about 45% will be 4hp per mana&lt;br&gt;about 2% will be 8 hp per mana.&lt;br&gt;the average I think will be 2.92 hp per mana [I think]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;so&#xD;
what possable reason could I have for using a 2.1hp per mana tap over&#xD;
time that takes 7 ticks to do the full amount? [how many mobs even last&#xD;
7 ticks + the time it takes to build enough agro at the begining ?]&lt;br&gt;whats more once you use that spell, that mob can not be messed for 7 ticks should the need arise [rare as it might be].&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"but", i hear you say, "you could have the DD tap and the tap over time memmed...&lt;br&gt;I&#xD;
could, or I could just mem my lvl 70 DD tap instead [and not I dont&#xD;
have room for 3 taps and whats more with 2 DD taps loaded they can&#xD;
almost be chain cast]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;lets look briefly at the lvl 70 tap&#xD;
efficiency, I wont do all the math but it should be evident from the&#xD;
base ratio that even with crit aa and no focii its more efficient&#xD;
aswell.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5338&amp;amp;source=Live" target="_blank"&gt;Touch of the Devourer&#xD;
      &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Decrease Hitpoints by 740&lt;br&gt;Mana: 448&lt;br&gt;cast time: 3&lt;br&gt;recast: 10&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;base ratio:1.65 hp per mana.&lt;br&gt;considering the lvl 75 tap is 1.7 I'm sure its clear&amp;nbsp; the lvl 70 tap at 1.65 will also be far superior to the TSS tap over time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#xD;
didnt bother laying out the Hp per second ratings as it should be clear&#xD;
that DD taps blow our tap over time out of the water by far.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;also&#xD;
i did NOT include the recorse from Remorseless Demeanor which adds from&#xD;
50% at rank 1 to 80% at rank 2 to 100% at rank 3 to the potency of DD&#xD;
life taps but not to tap over time recorses.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Solution!&lt;br&gt;ok to be useful this tap over time needs to fill 1 of 2 roles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;it either needs to be EXTREAMLY efficient or it needs to do A LOT of healing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;also&#xD;
there really isn't any point to having it heal LESS then the DD tap&#xD;
when even if one goes OOM its only 3.5 mins to med completely.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;now to specifics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;if it were up to me, this is what I'd do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;version 1 which provide for a significant amount of healing for comparitive efficiency to a DD life tap with AA but no foci.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bond of the Blacktalon [new]&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Decrease Hitpoints by 666 per tick&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Mana: 2264&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
cast time: 3 [1.6 iirc with hybrid spell haste]&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Duration: 10 ticks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2.5 hp per mana.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;OR&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;version&#xD;
2 which should be on average as efficient as a DD tap with AA and a&#xD;
decent focii. though the DD tap will win out for high-end players with&#xD;
50% or better focii.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bond of the Blacktalon [new MkII]&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Decrease Hitpoints by 310 per tick&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Mana: 861&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
cast time: 3 [1.6 iirc with hybrid spell haste]&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Duration: 10 ticks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3.6hp per mana.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;either of those 2 changes would make the tap over time compeditive with the direct tap.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;also&#xD;
at 10 ticks duration the healing increase should be larger then the&#xD;
damage increase given that most fights dont last long enough for the&#xD;
full duration of the damage portion to take effect.&lt;br&gt;but life taps are about healing more then about DPS.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr size="2" width="100%"&gt;now for more things i think need looking at, or atleast if who ever looks after spells could perhaps comment on why they cant/shouldnt be tweaked that wuld be great.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SK disease based "Spears", they either need a&#xD;
significant resist mod [like -150] or a disease debuffs needs to be&#xD;
added to SK terror spells.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;because Disease is the lease debuffed resist, being that it is not in the malo/mala line of spells.&lt;br&gt;and not often having that resist debuffed hurts the usefulness of the spear line, that combined with the new TSS spear "&lt;a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=10288&amp;amp;source=Live" target="_blank"&gt;&#xD;
            Rotroot Spear&lt;/a&gt;"&#xD;
that shares a recast timer with our other spears, so we have a DD thats&#xD;
prone to being resisted due to lack of debuffs and also not usable in&#xD;
combination with other lower level spears where the OoW spear was&#xD;
usable with other lower level spears except the ancient from GoD iirc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;the&#xD;
spear isn't useless but its far from "desirable" when a small tweak&#xD;
like giving it a resist mod OR giving SK's a disease debuff on our&#xD;
terrors would make it much more useful.&lt;br&gt;I for one hardly ever mem a spear, mostly its more efficient just to use a life tap.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr size="2" width="100%"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=10276&amp;amp;source=Live" target="_blank"&gt;&#xD;
            Drink of Decomposition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;sort of speaks for itself I think.&lt;br&gt;but I'll make the point anyway.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vald, frostcrypt and ashengate dont have any plant NPCs so far as I've seen.&lt;br&gt;most of EQ doesnt have any plant NPCs in high level XP zones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;yes&#xD;
a druid could turn some mobs into plants, thought many are uneffected,&#xD;
such as undead and giants, which make up the majority portion of high&#xD;
end TSS content.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;also&lt;br&gt;Limit: Resist(Fire allowed)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;so&#xD;
the 3% incrreased damage doesnt work on my magic based life tap or any other spell I have anyway,&#xD;
so that means that unless i have a heavly fire based caster DPS team in&#xD;
my group that that spell wont be used.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ah yes, a shaman could use &lt;a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=9999&amp;amp;source=Live" target="_blank"&gt;&#xD;
            Feralize&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;
...but wait ...if i have a shaman in my group that means I either have&#xD;
a primary healer, such as&amp;nbsp; a druid or a cleric and thus with a primary&#xD;
and a back up I wont be needing to use life taps to patch heal myself &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;OR&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;the&#xD;
shaman is going to be so busy debuffing, slowing .etc and then healing&#xD;
me, the tank, that they wont have time to waste casting a spell so I&#xD;
can use one specific sort of life tap which is only marginally more&#xD;
efficient then my normal life taps.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;so this makes the Sk plant only life tap useless mostly.&lt;br&gt;i have rank 2 and have never cast it, infact I've not fought a plant mob since I got the spell many weeks ago.&lt;br&gt;and&#xD;
with the ratity of plant mobs why would I have it memmed wasting a&#xD;
spell gem of which I have far more usefulls that I dont have room to&#xD;
keep memmed?&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr size="2" width="100%"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'd actually like to see the plant only life tap deleted and replaced with an ATK tap.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;not a DD + recorse but a spell that lowers the ATK of my target and increases my own or even my groups atk.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I know the Shamans do it... are there any SKs out there that solo big nasty stuff? I've just recently started fiddling with it... knocked off Shadowhunter in WoS, and Gryme/Aramin in PoD... havn't found Discordling Warfiend up yet, but he's on the hit list, and Grummus will probably be dying soon as well.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I'm a 74 female Erudite SK, mostly Anguish geared, 2.0... 577 AAs, 13k hp, 3k ac unbuffed.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Basically just seeing if there are any other SKs that mess around with this stuff. :smileyhappy:&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>we were playing around in AR. Spawned Shei during the fight i ate a few of his DTs then i noticed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;12750hp... **SMURF**? that doesn't add up. 35% adds up to 13000hp&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;i check my logs. yup 12750 everytime... i should note i am at 36% spell shield.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;now i'm full of questions... has the cap been raised? is it just a bug? is it only http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=2859&amp;source=Live ?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I almost dread that the caps have been raised... that would mean rethinking my current gear path ugh.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'd appreciate anyone else over the spell shield cap confirming my findings.</description>

      <description>I don't think this has been suggested yet, but why not have the SK pet self buff a calliav style blocker.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Raiders could use pets vs mobs with AEs (long as it's not ramp)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In groups it would give you a few extra seconds to mash pet hold. (it's just too tough keeping Goner alive in Ashengate an beyond curently)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While most SKs have abandoned pet use now do to how fragile ours are I've always had my undead squire as a companion since 99. I'd really hate to have to give him up now... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pet pulling is gone now (I understand it was never intended), but if they can't give SKs pets a viable role in single group encounters then let the spell line die and give SKs the boost to our personal melee DPS that we are losing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I always used our lowest pet to pull around corners anyway.</description>

      <title>Where do SKs stand in the DPS scheme of things?</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Shadowknights&amp;message.id=5707#M5707</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Most notably as compared to druids and shaman. I'm currently trying to decide on a class to make my comeback with, and these are what I've narrowed it down to. SKs seem like what I'd like, but not if they have horrible damage output.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If it means anything, I reffering mainly to solo and small group content. No raids or super high level stuff, as I don't have the time to get there anytime soon.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;When I did play full time I had a higher level beastlord with several hundred AAs. What would the SK be like in comparison DPS wise?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Thanks =)&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I know this has been brough up before but it has been nearly TWO years since this AA has worked properly. As a multi boxer that does alot of instances this AA has been practically a waste of AAs. I hate to&amp;nbsp;request a refund (when the AA rocks works) but after TWO years I doubt you guys can fix the bug. Can a dev at least respond stating if they are still trying to fix it or is it a forgotten issue? Thanks :)&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>SK spell nerfage - intentional??</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Shadowknights&amp;message.id=5660#M5660</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;So I happily acquire my new Lvl 74 nuke, or what passes for a nuke in the world of the SK.....&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I have spear of rotroot and muram loaded and cast the lvl 74 spell. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Ah! the lower spell is also greyed out - so they're on the same timer. Switch Spear of Muram for the lower spear of decay. Cast the lvl 74 spell. Same thind happens - both the higher and lower spell greyed on - apparently on the same resuse timer&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Casting Muram &amp;amp; decay is substantially more dps that just the lvl 74 spell. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So, as it says - was this intentional? If not can we have a fix please? and if it *was* intentional - why? and can we *still* have a fix please?!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>Time yet for Touch of the Cursed to be fixed yet?</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Shadowknights&amp;message.id=5658#M5658</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Since with the TSS expansion we&amp;nbsp;received upgrades to Touch of the Cursed (innate lifetap AA), isn't it time it's been looked at and&amp;nbsp;been fixed?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;"It's the first time we've heard of it!"&amp;nbsp; No, it was reported at least in December 2005, in this thread, only on the 2nd page: &lt;A href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Shadowknights&amp;amp;message.id=5267" target=_blank&gt;http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Shadowknights&amp;amp;message.id=5267&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;"But it's working just fine!"&amp;nbsp; Under some circumstances, it does indeed work.&amp;nbsp; Under other circumstances, it doesn't.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;"Can it be duplicated?"&amp;nbsp; Yes it can.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Condensed summary: this aa works in non-instanced zones, instanced zones using the /dzadd system, and LDoN instanced zones.&amp;nbsp; It does NOT work in /taskadd zones; with the following exception: if you bought an aa (ANY aa) while in the /taskadd instanced zone, Touch of the Cursed will fire.&amp;nbsp; If you did not purchase any aa's while in the zone, it will not fire in the entire six hours you might spend in that zone.&amp;nbsp; This seems to hold true for Creators, Lair of the Black Wing, Plane of Time, etc. etc. etc.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Since the TSS aa was made to be an extension of Touch of the Cursed (instead of the proposed new ability in beta, Touch of the Fallen), it extends a broken aa line.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Now, I will make one small disclaimer: I have not yet bought the TSS extensions to Touch of the Cursed yet.&amp;nbsp; But I do know that my existing rank 3 TotC isn't working still in /taskadd instanced zones since TSS release.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; That is, unless I purchased some AA during that instance.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;But the test is, log in a test SK with Touch of the Cursed 1, 2 or 3, or buy it beforehand; then&amp;nbsp;get a /taskadd instance, and check to see if it fires at all during melee.&amp;nbsp; If not, it's broken and needs to be looked at.&amp;nbsp; If it fires under these conditions, I'm out to lunch and apologize and/or need to try to post a tighter scenario of circumstances.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Thanks for reading.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <title>ShadowKnight Solution</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Shadowknights&amp;message.id=5656#M5656</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#000000 size=3&gt;Shadowknight Solution&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#000000 size=3&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#000000 size=3&gt;The shadowknight class is in bad disarray and is in need of improvements to make us balanced again. We do not want the ability to out tank a Warrior, nor the ability to out dot a pure caster. We do not want to become the end all or be all class. All we want is to be the class that we wanted to be when we started. The shadowknight was not a class that most people wanted to play because it is hard and involved to become a master of it. It was played because it was a class that is we brought everything to bear on a mob, then it would be hard pressed to win. We did not want to be able to solo 2 or 3 mobs at once, over overpower mobs that where far greater then us. We wanted to know that in an even fight we had the upper hand. It was about the fear and respect we commanded.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;It was never a class that was NEEDED to accomplish anything in particular. A good shadowknight was a great utility class. We could tank if need be, keep ourselves alive and even throw a small heal here and there. We could boost the group’s strength and stamina and give them a nice ac and attack buff. We could off-tank in raids and Main tank in groups. We could pull and in some cases we could split mobs better then a Monk if there was no mezzer around. I could list what all the problems are but most everyone else has already done that. I am here to give solutions to the problems.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#000000 size=3&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#000000 size=3&gt;The first and most important issue that needs to be addressed is our Harm Touch or lack thereof. This IS our most and ONLY class defining ability. This is the ONLY thing that used to let us stand out against everyone else. We had the most powerful single blast damage in the game. One Hit wonders that made people think...Man I do not want to piss him off! The Everquest manual said it was meant to be used in a dire emergency to help turn the tide of battle for us. It is now used as extra DPS because that is all it has become. As soon as it refreshes and our Unholy Aura is up, we HT whatever we are fighting. Even now with the pittance of an upgrade form 9k to 14k, it is still just a Long refresh nuke. I am sickened to see several other classes able to do almost if not more damage in a SINGLE attack/spell then our most Sacred ability. We cannot command any fear with our HT in a duel, and most mobs we use it against do not even know we hurt them. I can use HT during a fight and the mob will not even turn around on me if there is a warrior or any class with a couple hundred AA’s and a decent weapon. We do not want another AA to increase our damage, we want a new ability that is improved over HT a we want to Earn it by taking it from another Mob like the shadowknight way. Give us a quest at level 75 where any shadowknight with no AA’s and the same armor we would receive from a start-up kit for that level will be able to complete. An instance zone where we have to fight our way through several mobs where every mob will Harm Touch us. After we make it to the end, the final named mob we face will give us the ability after he uses it on us…..after he Death Touches us we DIE and lose XP(make it an unresable XP death) and then grant us the old 20K Death Touch ability. Let it replace HT on the original timer and have it set one the normal 1 hour without improvement. For all those that scream this is unbalancing, ask yourself why. Because we could DT a pre-velious mob and Kill it outright…Can a 75 SK not solo those mobs anyways? Can most classes not solo those mobs at 75 without the aid of others? Will a 20k DT even with unholy aura and improved damage item give us an unbalancing effect – NO. Why? Because Most of the time the mobs we fight have hundreds of thousands of Hitpoints, especial named and Raid encounter mobs and that is what HT/DT would be used for. Not only would it give groups a reason to invite SK’s but also guilds would be more inclined to take them instead of another DPS class. It would give us the edge we need in most cases and besides…how long does it take most groups to dish out 20k-40k…some can do this in less then a tick!! And on a raid this can easily exceed 1 second. If the mobs that we face now can easily be defeated by a DT then most classes need to be scaled back because I see them doing more then that in a single fight!!!&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#000000 size=3&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#000000 size=3&gt;Another issue that is not being addressed is our spells. The shadowknight was always about defeating an opponent by overpowering them and beating them into submission without the aid or help of ANYONE else. This includes the hitpoint and ac buffs, even the mana buffs of other classes. Granted…we where supposed to spend ever last drop of blood and mana to do this, including our speed bump of a pet Goner, but we where still supposed to overpower them. Or spells are drastically underscored for those purposes now. We have too many spells trying to accomplish too many different functions to effectively fight with them all. We can not change out spells in the middle of fight to get this affect and then remed another spell that we need, especial when most of our spells are on long recast timers. Our High end spells should become duel purpose spells like so many other classes. Here is a list of new spells that would evenly round out the shadowknight without overpowering them. The first spell is more of a status spell then a necessity of types.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#000000 size=3&gt;Fallen Paladin – This should be another class Quest spell (SOLOABLE). Instance us a dungeon where the ONLY mob inside is a Paladin wielding a Fiery avenger. After we kill and defeat him (level 75) he has only one item to loot, the spell. Upon summoning this pet, he should con darkblue to even. To prevent him from being overpowering he should be a reflection of the shadowknight. Have the Skeleton appear in plate armor (decaying and in different states of disrepair) and wielding that 2 handed Fiery avenger and make where it cannot benefit from any other weapons including the pet summoned ones. Let our new pet hit for a couple hundred points of damage per pop but have him swing slower…..NOW I know there are some screaming that this is over powering but let me ask you…what is the difference of 200 200 vs the now 65 65 40 65 65 40 65 65 40…they will be dishing out about the same damage the only difference is it will be in less hits and more damaging upon a single hit…and without the ability to give him other weapons, all he procs is the DD from the weapon and the lifetap. This will give us a Pet ALL our own that most people will see and say…HEY a SK pet…kewl looking. Also give it a higher then normal ac and more HP’s. It is the pet of a tank and should reflect it…Unlike EVER other pet class..WE DO NOT have a pet heal so we cannot use the pet to tank for us (yes I know enc’s do not have pet heals but they do not have a true pet… it is either the summoned daggers that they cannot control or a charmed monster but they do have the ability to cast powerful runes which acts just as good!)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#000000 size=3&gt;Lifespike Shielding – This is like our shielding spell now but add to the damage shield a lifetap effect. Each point of damage our damage shields do to the mob, we are healed for that much…..it is not like this is overpowering again…we get hit for 800, they take less then 20 damage from our damage shield and we are healed for that much…it fits into the play style and role-playing aspect of a SK.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#000000 size=3&gt;Tortured Soul – We need a utility spell that takes from the mob and gives to us. We have several different spells that do this individually but we need those to be combined together into only one or two. Tortured Soul could take AC (200), ATK (200), Resist (100 each), and Stats (25 each) from the mob and give it to the group or us. Do not add damage to this spell, let it be a debuff alone and let it either be a long duration spell (till the mob is dead) or a short duration spell that goes to the short duration box (last 30 seconds with a 24 second recast). &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#000000 size=3&gt;Loathing – Since shadowknights are supposed to be masters of hate and agro, give us an agro dot. The spell should act like splurt but instead of the damage doubling each tick, it is the hate that is generated. Again, this should be a spell that last until the mob is either dead or at least 2 minutes. Base agro should start around between 100 and 200.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#000000 size=3&gt;Dark Longing – This should be a Self Buff Group Lifetap proc spell. Similar to our self lifetap procs except it affects the entire group with Hitpoints and is still susceptible to critical blasts and Exceptional heals.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#000000 size=3&gt;Dark Consumption – This should be an improved Lifetap Dot. The new spell we have does 155 a tick for 6 ticks…even with the extended spell abilities it does not heal sufficiently. When we get hit for 1k+ and this does not even heal it, what is the point in casting it. We should get a lifetap dot that heals us for about 250 a tick for at least 6 ticks. Have the recast time set to 45 seconds to prevent overuse if you wish.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#000000 size=3&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#000000 size=3&gt;Another area that needs drastic improvement is our damage taking ability. Unless we are given new abilities to mitigate damage, we will never be in a position to successfully tank any of the newer mobs. An increase of 18.5% in both avoidance and Mitigation after AA’s would be sufficient to allow us to tank better without overshadowing the warriors, especial with their defensive skills, yet make us slightly better then chain and leather wearing classes who currently can get groups based off their dps alone.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#000000 size=3&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#000000 size=3&gt;DPS – Our DPS is currently the absolute lowest amongst the melees. This does not bother me so much because we where supposed to be the second best at taking it as well. Since we cannot do that, and even if you do boost the shadowknights tanking ability, our DPS leaves us little room to grow. Since both shadowknights and Paladins are geared for 2 handed use, we should be able to improve our 2 handed dps greatly there. Allow all the extra Shield AA’s while using the 2 hand bash. Also, increase the speed at which we can bash and the damage it does. Even if it was doubled, our dps would not go up that much but it would make us a lot better at tanking and dishing out damage. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#000000 size=3&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#000000 size=3&gt;Steed – This is not a needed fix but this would fit into the shadowknight forte. Turn our Horses into UNDEAD horses. Let us conjure forth an undead minion that will be more faithful in death than any living horse would as well. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#000000 size=3&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#000000 size=3&gt;New Skill abilities – We need at least on new skill and please make it a useful one. Gives us something useful like 2 handed block where we block any one attack against us with one of our attacks…this would drastically cut down on our damage but greatly increase our tanking ability…especial if it is only usable with a 2 handed weapon. Or give us an ability like Critical Life – where ever lifetap effect will automatically critical heal us/group for the next 5 minutes. Something new please.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#000000 size=3&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size=3&gt;&lt;FONT color=#000000&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman"&gt;Last fix that should be addressed is the lack of help that the Shadowknight community has. I have read and seen several post concerning the lack of support that we seam to be getting. There are few posts concerning updates and it seams that several of our problems are “currently being looked at” for years now…we might get some of the problems of kunark fixed in a year or two at this rate. We do not think our demands are to unreasonable and we want to have our class distinguished from necros (no offense, we love you guys) but we want to become somewhat more of a independent class. We have been asking for our OWN pet for years now, upgrades to our HT to be equivalent to the mobs we are fighting NOW not in an expansion or two when the new HT is just a weaker version than what it should have been with the LAST expansion. We have asked for better lifetaps and we have FINALLY gotten a halfway decent one…ALMOST!&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#000000 size=3&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#000000 size=3&gt;Well I am done with my rant and rave. I hope that there are some good ideals and can and will be used from here and I hope there is enough feedback that shadowknights are Changed and not just Looked at. You can look at a problem all day long but until you try and fix it, it will ALWAYS stay broken!!!!&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>Fear kiting above 50</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Shadowknights&amp;message.id=5642#M5642</link>
      <description>I took my 55 Teir'Dal SK to PoN to poke around and hope to fear kite while learning the zone. My first pull near the graveyard resulted in "your target is too high level to be affected by that spell" and FD failed to dump aggro. It was a DB mob (arachnid) which took a full bar of mana, my HT, and 65&amp;#37; of my buffed HP (Conviction) to kill. Frankly, I don't expect to be able to solo tank mobs straight up very successfully at this level.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Looking at &lt;a href=http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=127&amp;source=Live target=_blank&gt;invoke fear&lt;/a&gt; (L43 spell), it only works up to L52 mobs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=6986&amp;source=Live target=_blank&gt;Shadow Voice&lt;/a&gt; (L57 spell) works up to L55 mobs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Does fear kiting lose viability as a SK solo technique beyond L52? The mobs I am able to fear kite give less than a tick (0.8&amp;#37) of XP at 100/0 XP/AA split.</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;The top level 75 Rune could be around 3-4k and cost a&amp;nbsp;good amount of Mana (1K to 2K ish ?). The mana cost is to make sure it cannot be&amp;nbsp;chained used for a long period of time.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;This was posted on Evilgamer.net ( &amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="http://www.evilgamer.net/forums/showthread.php?t=874" target=_blank&gt;http://www.evilgamer.net/forums/showthread.php?t=874&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;) and got some good feedback. Posting it here to get a bit more.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Since one of our main rolls in current content seems to be CCing / offtanking several mobs at the same time and SOE seems to be giving us spells that are forcing SK's go down that road. IE Dreadgaze (aggroing many mobs at once), D-Skin (defensive rune proc - the more mobs that are attacking you the more it goes off) I propose adding a Soulshield type disc, that scales in effectiveness and power based on the number of mobs that have you first on their hate list!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Could call it Malevolent Guard ,or some wierd name like that.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It would work like this...&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;1 mob has you first on hate list, you use the disc, you get 18 seconds of 15%mitigation to inc melee dmg.&lt;BR&gt;2-3 mobs have you first on hate list, you use the disc, you get 30 seconds of 30% inc melee dmg mitigation.&lt;BR&gt;4-6 mobs have you on hate list, you use the disc, you get 48 seconds of 40%mitigation to inc melee dmg.&lt;BR&gt;6+ mobs have you on hate list, you use the disc, you get 1 minute with 45% mitigation to inc melee dmg (cap it there)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Give it a 30 minute re-use.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Some of the issues/worries that came up were...&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Q: "Whats stopping an SK from aggroing many green con mobs then engaging a raid boss with the disc capped out in power?"&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;A: The lack of many green con mobs in high end raid zones. Also you could put a level floor on the mobs that would effect the disc. For instance mobs&amp;nbsp;3 levels or more below the SK, would not effect the disc power or duration&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Q: This would make SK's overpowered in PvP&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;A: The disc power would only increase by having NPC's attacking the SK that used the disc. Would not effect PC's&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Q: "more realistically, aggroing 5 DBs, mezzing them, and &lt;I&gt;then&lt;/I&gt; engaging a red boss mob, which would still cap the disc?"&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;A: Because, the raid would still be better off having a warrior tank one hard hitting raid mob with defensive disc going, than the raid would be having to CC 5 adds, while at the same time having the SK tank a hard hitting raid mob.&lt;!--  / message  --&gt;&lt;!--  sig  --&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;This would be great, because it would really strengthen our CC/offtank power, coupled with Dread Gaze and D-skin. &lt;STRONG&gt;While not&amp;nbsp;encroaching&amp;nbsp;on warriors&lt;/STRONG&gt; being able to tank hard hitting boss mobs. If you think its too overpowered, just scale down the duration and mitigation&amp;nbsp;percentages utill you think its fair/doable. What do you guys think?&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;!--  / message  --&gt;&lt;!--  sig  --&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>Itemization that should be reviewed.</title>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;With the annoucement of a new item guy Maybe we should voice some opinion about certain items that we feel should be taking a look at.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The Consecrated Ball of Silver should have either some AC hitpoint on it or a proc (CS4 or Lifesap2).&amp;nbsp; Umbral Plate &amp;nbsp;Face Guard should have some more AC for sure but mod on it are generic since the effect is design to help melee aggro work better i wouldnt mind seeing some Strikethrough and Accuracy put on the mask.&amp;nbsp; There are&amp;nbsp;few &amp;nbsp;items in DK that are for Plate Tanks but yet we dont see Deterimental range on them (neck bracer or shoulders) since 2 out of the 3 tanks need this effect for trash clearing shouldnt one of these items be consider a great place to stick this effect.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The new guy said he was open for ideas and i am sure he will be great for the job but showing him a few glaring issues might give him a place to start.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
