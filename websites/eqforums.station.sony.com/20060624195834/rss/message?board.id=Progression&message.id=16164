    <title>Answer a question for me please</title>
    <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Progression&amp;message.id=16164</link>
    <description>&lt;DIV&gt;How hard is it going to be to unlock the next expansions? If I have to race to 50 to kill Vox and Nag to get Kunark open it kinda defeats the purpose for me. I would like to level and explore dungeons in some of the first expansions as I level to 50 and beyond. For example I would love to go to the Tower of Frozen Shadow in my 30's but if Velious is not feasible to get unlocked until I am well beyond that content I am still having to bypass content I would love to explore. Anyone have any thoughts on this? I sure would hate to get 50 and Kunark get unlocked and spend 50-60 in KC and Seb and miss out on a lot of content that Velious had to offer the 30-60 levels.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;personally what I would like to see are the following conditions for each expansion:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;a.) all previous content needs to be defeated (e.g.: for Kunark - Naggy, Vox and the old world planes need to be cleared)&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;b.) a minimum of 3 real life months need to pass before the next expansion can be unlocked.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;By doing so it would give both hardcore and casual player ample opportunity to enjoy an expansion before the next one comes along. If time passed will NOT be a factor we will see the Planes of Power in less than 6 months guaranteed.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Cheers,&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Even going with the shortest scenario, getting to PoP in less than six months is a stretch.&amp;nbsp; This is all assuming the unlocking mechanisms are straight forward and pretty much what everyone expects&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The old world planes will be unlocked in 2-4 weeks and then Kunark a week or two later. ~ 1 month&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Keying up for VP and unlocking Velious is going to take at least another 1-2 months. ~2 months (total)&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Velious is a wildcard in my mind... with modern day raid numbers/strategies I have no idea how much gearing up will be needed to knock out AoW and wake the Sleeper... Best case scenario at 10 keys/week with zero competition, that'll be 5 weeks to have a solid force ready to enter ST.&amp;nbsp; You're not going to kill AoW in Kunark class gear so there will need to be some gearing up with Kael/SS armor and NToV loot.&amp;nbsp; Absolute minimum of 2 months. ~4 months total&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;With Luclin&amp;nbsp;people need to key/bane for Ssra and Seru (and eventually VT), not to mention grinding out all those AA that they hadn't been able to get yet, some of which will be vital without zergish numbers. Gearing up isn't &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;important, but the timesinks will hurt. Even if you assume Acrylia Caverns won't be required and all you need is Shei, Seru, Ssra and AHR...&amp;nbsp; it's still a minimum of 2 months just for the massive amount of keying/banes required.&amp;nbsp; So, at the bare minimum under ideal conditions you're looking at 6 months before PoP is released.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;More reasonable would be a 9-12 month estimate.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>Without playing alts there really is no guarantee that you will be able to do what you ask no matter how long or short it takes to unlock each expansion.&amp;nbsp; Plenty of overlap on the level ranges of the first several expansions.&amp;nbsp; Original is 1 to 50, Kunark is a 1 to 60, Velious is 30/35 to 60, Luclin is 1 to 65 with AA's added in, LDoN is 15 to 65, PoP is 46 to 65, etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you always achieve max level in one set of content before moving on then you will miss out on a LOT of it all over again.&amp;nbsp; This is why having alts is your only real option.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
