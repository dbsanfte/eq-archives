&lt;P&gt;Reading an article off of EQ Casters Realm, Nektulos is getting revamped in the upcoming expansion (again) so if we give you the screenshots now, in 5 months it wont be that way hehe.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;hmm cant copy it hehe&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;"There will be a new Nektulos revamp that is much more traditional and less Hollywood-set-like.&amp;nbsp; This one has real trees and a real forest.&amp;nbsp; It is much more like the desert of ro revamp in that the layout is much the same as the original layout.&amp;nbsp; We were able to zoom around it a bit and it looked good."&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <title>Request - Screens of New Nektulos and Freeport</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=DoN&amp;message.id=451#M451</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;As a longtime player who moved to EQ2 I'd appreciate if people could link or post some screenshots of the new Nektulos Forest and Freeport. The slaying of Mistmoore peaked my curiosity and his ascension to godhood.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I also understand that reading through some of the lore that the outside of Neriak has been revamped, but does that mean the interior also and King Naythox Thex, who is dead by rumor in EQ2, has been cursed by some gem?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I'd appreciate simple links to lore. I stopped playing after Discord.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;I actually reactivated my account for the month to check things out. Neriak is same old neriak other than the Nektulos changes. I appreciate the summary and the summaries were valuable.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;I uploaded some screenshots of the new Ro to my EQLive profile today.&amp;nbsp; I'll get more for you as I visit there.&amp;nbsp; I also uploaded some gorgeous screenshots of the sky and water changes.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Look for Hushpaw on the Prexus server.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Let me give you a brief summary of what's happened from Gates to now:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Gates of Discord&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Vrex Barxt Qurat meddled in extra planar communication and this resulted in Overlord Mata Muram, a discordian dragon who commanded his own army known as the Muramites, attacked Barxt in his temple of Uqua.&amp;nbsp; To sum up the story here, the entire continent of Taelosia was enslaved by an expeditionary force, but following the Battle of Greenfields and the betrayal of a race known as the Riftseekers, the Muramites' portal into Taelosia was destroyed.&amp;nbsp; The players enter, overthrow Barxt before he can summon another extra planar being to try to destroy Mata Muram, and then after successfully destroying the Muramite presence on Taelosia, chase them &lt;EM&gt;back&lt;/EM&gt; through the portal into Discord.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Omens of War&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;We find out where Mata Muram has currently enveloped.&amp;nbsp; You find his castle, the Citadel of Anguish, which also acts as his personal prison where he delights in the torment of prisoners.&amp;nbsp; Here you also meet the Dragorn, the race that attempted to stand up to Mata Muram, and have subsequently been destroyed, and their culture completely stripped from under them.&amp;nbsp; Mastering the five trials intended by the Muramites to teach their soldiers how to invade other worlds (including Norrath), and gaining the trust of another Riftseeker, the players invade the Citadel of Anguish and dethrone Overlord Mata Muram.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Dragons of Norrath&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;With this expansion several curious gnomes belonging to a mining expedition manage to open a passageway of rocks and stone that had long since blocked off the Broodlands of the dragons.&amp;nbsp; Here, the first generation dragons are each born, under the special care of Vishimtar and Yar'Lir, a pair of storm dragons.&amp;nbsp; What we learn here is that Venril Sathir used the commotion caused by the Fall of Firiona Vie (which you can read about&amp;nbsp;here &lt;A href="http://eq.crgaming.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=9687 " target=_blank&gt;http://eq.crgaming.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=9687 &lt;/A&gt; - )&amp;nbsp;to learn from Trakanon of his initial breeding chambers in The Nest.&amp;nbsp; Plotting revenge, he uses a Curse that he's gotten a hold of to infect the Nest with - though he makes sure it has an incubation period so it doesn't go off immediately.&amp;nbsp; As the battle between Lanys and Firiona fall over the new dragons (and Lanys becomes successful in spreading parts of her empire) in the Broodlands, the adventurers are pressed into the killing of Yar'Lir, a storm dragon of incredible power.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;With her death, the Curse in the Nest is unleashed in its totality, and the shield to the Nest is blown open.&amp;nbsp; Venturing into the Nest, the players discover that the entire breeding process has been destroyed, irrevocably crushing the first generation breeding chambers of the Dragons on Norrath, and leaving only the local, weaker breeding chambers of Velious to remain.&amp;nbsp; When the players finally encounter Yar'Lir's mate Vishimtar, he is now deformed and caught in a black shadow, and uses his corrupted drakes to try to defend the Nest in his maniacally twisted final act that he is now bound to.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Depths of Darkhollow&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;After one more battle between Firiona Vie and Lanys T'Vyl in Nektulos Forest, the two manage to break open the passage way to Darkhollow.&amp;nbsp; It is learned up to this time that Lanys had, after consulting Venril Sathir on the curse he used against the Dragons, planned to use King Naythox Thex as her vessel with which to unleash the plague against Firiona and her supporters.&amp;nbsp; Firiona manages to overcome this just in time with her forces, and both disappear in a sudden explosion.&amp;nbsp; Venturing into Darkhollow, the players find the lost expedition of Gnomes who had turned themselves into clockworks to preserve their lives, and the collapsed Shiliskin Empire of Illsalin.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The Shiliskin Empire, under the command of the Lich King, Emperor Draygun, has fallen in all but name and now wages war with what's left of the Malgrinnor Outpost under General Veronhar.&amp;nbsp; Using the assistance of Jarzarrad the Prophet, the players are guided into a series of operations hoping to dethrone Emperor Draygun and thus break his hold on the undead servants of Illsalin, and in the process discover what really occured when the Drachnids destroyed Illsalin.&amp;nbsp; After an encounter with a being known as The Seeker, you yourself are cursed, and enter the Demiplane of Shadowspine, where you are taunted by a mysterious, vampiric voice.&amp;nbsp; Upon proving yourself, you are allowed to learn that the Curse carried by Venril Sathir was planted, and it really captured the souls, or "shadows" of those who have been consumed by the curse.&amp;nbsp; You find several of the drakelings who were caught during the breech of the Nest, the Shiliskin who were caught when Emperor Draygun used his book Shadowspine (which detailed the Curse), and finally Vishimtar and Emperor Draygun themselves.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Killing them, the mysterious voice is pleased and allows you to escape hoping to encounter you again at some point.&amp;nbsp; You proceed to kill each of the figures of the War of Five Crests - the subterranean war that resulted in the fragmentation of the Shiliskin Empire.&amp;nbsp; Gaining the power of their various states of the Curse of Blood, the players enter the Demiplane of Blood, where they conquer first the servants, and later the "prizes" of the Master of Dreadspire.&amp;nbsp; These include a corrupted paladin and his wife, a deformed singer, a lamenting woman, and a fallen werewolf hunter.&amp;nbsp; Besting them, the player is welcomed into the storage room of Dreadspire, where Mayong Mistmoore himself awaits and reveals himself as the true master.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;By killing him however, the players accept his invitation of power, and martyr him for his cause, allowing him to cast off his "mortal" bonds and accelerates him to a form of godhood as yet unknown.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Prophecy of Ro&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;With his newfound ability to interact with deities on their own terms, Mayong Mistmoore has needed his own plane - and what better than the source of the bards.&amp;nbsp; Throwing himself at the Plane of Music, he has corrupted it wholly and turned it into a macabre form of itself known as the Theatre of Blood, where he inhabits from the tower of Deathknell.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;In terms of Naythox Thex, no, he is not yet dead, he is quite alive, and quite angry at Queen Cristanos for delivering him as the vassal with which Lanys could unleash the Curse, which is a version of the Shadowspine curse...which would ultimately empower Mayong himself.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I don't have any screenshots of the new Freeport, but here's a video you can watch of it:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
