				<DIV>CLASS:&nbsp; Ranger</DIV>
<DIV>Raiding Experience : Guild recently got into Txevu, we've killed a couple named in there but have yet to make a serious drive towards the boss of the zone (and Tacvi access)</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>HP:&nbsp;&nbsp; Very Important<BR>Mana:&nbsp; Middle importance.&nbsp; Recast on our nukes puts me low only if I don't have a mana regen buff, or if I'm burning Hail of Arrows as fast as I can<BR>Endurance:&nbsp; Zero Importance<BR>AC:&nbsp;&nbsp; Important.&nbsp; It helps when soloing if not bow kiting, and also helps when assisting as a Tank Mezzer</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>HP Regen:&nbsp; Unimportant<BR>Mana Regen:&nbsp; Middle importance.&nbsp; Not that hard to cap, but recast on most nukes make it harder to run out of mana<BR>Endurance Regen:&nbsp; Zero Importance</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Strength:&nbsp; Middle importance until capped; afterwords, only importance is in keeping capped.<BR>Stamina:&nbsp; Very Important.&nbsp; More Sta = more HP.&nbsp; One of three most important stats to try to keep capped, or to get capped.&nbsp; After capped, only importance on gear is in keeping it capped.<BR>Agility:&nbsp; Unimportant.&nbsp; Little impact upon defensive abilities that I've noticed.</DIV>
<DIV>Dexterity:&nbsp; Very Important.&nbsp; One of three most important stats to try to keep capped, or to get capped.&nbsp; After capped, only importance on gear is in keeping it capped.<BR>Charisma:&nbsp; Unimportant.<BR>Intelligence: Zero Importance<BR>Wisdom: Very Important.&nbsp; One of three most important stats to try to keep capped, or to get capped.&nbsp; Third of these character stats after Sta and Dex.&nbsp; After capped, only importance on gear is in keeping it capped.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Cold Resist: <BR>Disease Resist: <BR>Poison Resist: <BR>Magic Resist: <BR>Fire Resist: </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>All resists are equally important.&nbsp; I don't look at these Very Important statistics when looking at gear however, because for the most part resists tend to go upwards as one acquires more and better gear from raids.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Attack:&nbsp; Very Important until one exceeds the cap, then only importance is in keeping at or near the cap<BR>Delay:&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>Damage: <BR>Range: </DIV>
<DIV>Haste:&nbsp; Important.&nbsp; Melee need to keep one (or two, or maybe even three) haste items on them to allow all but one to be upgraded with a non-haste item, but so long as there is at least one worn haste item, the presence of haste on any other potential upgrade is moot (especially with Enchanter haste spells being as high haste as they are).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The other stats in this grouping seem to be intended for weapons.&nbsp; Obviously, a high Range for a ranged attack is desireable - it helps to have a greater pulling range, especially with mob runspeeds nowadays, and the potential to avoid some mob AE's by using ranged instead of melee combat can permit the healers to concentrate more on those who cannot avoid the AE's thusly.&nbsp; Weapon Damage is Important in and of itself.&nbsp; Weapon Delay is also Important in and of itself (high delays on 2 handers reduce the number of ripostes taken and increase the Damage Bonus per hit, and low delays on one handers increase both the number of ripostes taken and the number of times per minute that the Damage Bonus is applied).&nbsp; Taken together, however, you get the Very Important Damage/Delay ratio.&nbsp; The ratio is of more importance than either the damage or the delay is, on their own.&nbsp; As a note, for archery attacks, the Damage on the arrow is Very Important (as opposed to just Important) because it is added to the damage of the bow when the game determines how hard that particular attack hit.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Combat Effects: More procs.&nbsp; 'nuff said.<BR>Shielding: Helps tanks more than it does me.&nbsp; I'll take it, but its Unimportant.<BR>Stun Resist: Helps tanks more than it does me.&nbsp; I'll take it, but its Unimportant.<BR>Strikethrough: Important.&nbsp; Worth keeping between the 25% and 35% marks if possible to do so without augs, especially as I don't get any Strikethrough AA's.<BR>Spell Shield:&nbsp;Important.&nbsp; Reduces the damage from AE nukes that I cannot avoid while raiding.&nbsp; Outside of raids, Unimportant because mobs don't tend to nuke that badly.<BR>Avoidance: Important.&nbsp; see AC.<BR>Accuracy: Important.&nbsp; Fewer misses means more damage dealt in the same amount of time.<BR>DOT Shielding: Important, but only for raiding, as few mobs outside of raids seem to bother with dots, and those that do can typically be cureed by the group in short order (unlike raids where the healers are busy concentrating on the tanks).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Skill Mods: Not sure if weapon skill mods do much of anything.&nbsp; Other skill mods, such as Dodge, Parry, Riposte, and tradeskill mods, can be useful depending on the skill being modified and how often it is used.&nbsp; The Parry +4% mod on my arms that I got in Time, for example, only help when I'm being attacked.<BR>Click Effects: Depends on the effect.<BR>Proc Effects: Depends on the effect.&nbsp; I'm partial to lifetaps, personally, as are many rangers and beastlords in my guild.&nbsp; Most tanks I know prefer stun or other aggro procs though.<BR>Worn Effects: Faerune is an important worn effect, for both the vision and the Enduring Breath component, but only one (or two, for freedom of upgrade purposes) is needed.&nbsp; Most other worn effects have since been changed over to stats (worn ATK, worn Regen, mana regen, etc.) so not too sure what you're looking for here.<BR>Focus Effects: Important.&nbsp; I've even given up an aug slot for Improved Heal V.&nbsp; Improved Damage foci are very useful for nukes, and Burning Affliction foci are very useful for dots (not that I've got many of those heh).&nbsp; The Omens change from ID and BA to elemental-specific nuke and dot combined foci makes it harder to find the appropriate foci for some casters, though the ranger 1.5 and 2.0 have made this a lot easer for me personally.&nbsp; The melee foci are also Important.&nbsp; However, I will sacrifice a melee or spell focus on a piece of gear if the new piece of gear is a clear AC and HP upgrade, especially if the new piece has more HP unaugged than my old piece did augged.&nbsp; The AAAA crafted augs are a very nice method of obtaining foci.</DIV>
