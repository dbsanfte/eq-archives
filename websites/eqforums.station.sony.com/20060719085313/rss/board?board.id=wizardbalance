      <description>Keep the mana cost as is (or lower mana cost), and make the effect&#xD;
start out at a 100% crit rate, then as time goes on have the crit rate&#xD;
start to drop.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

      <title>Just another wizard hanging up the robe</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=wizardbalance&amp;message.id=4695#M4695</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Hello fellow wizards,&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;After much thought, I have decided to hang up the robe and put away the staff once and for all.&amp;nbsp; After 6 years of enjoying Everquest and watching it's community grow immensely; I can safely say that my time invested was well worth it.&amp;nbsp; I made many friends and I would not give that up for anything.&amp;nbsp; This game has been a large part of my life...Of course sometimes bad(darn addicition, hehe).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Started back on Erollisi Marr back in the origional EQ era and took a break around Luclin.&amp;nbsp; Came back and transferred to Zebuxoruk/Xegony and met some good people there.&amp;nbsp; Had a chance to run with some of the big dogs and see the high end game.&amp;nbsp; I was sad when I had to leave due to not being able to devote the time to be in a hardcore raiding guild anymore.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Anyway, I wish everyone well and good fortune wherever Everquest or Real Life leads you.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;I know that you guys are working on the wizzy adventure stone, but is there anyway to get one?&amp;nbsp; This is my husband's toon and it's getting really frustrating that we can't take him with us without having to run him everytime.&amp;nbsp; Anything that can be done until they get it fixed?&amp;nbsp; Like maybe...giving him the stone?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Making mobs very vulnerable to attack from a Wizards magic, period... that way nothing would have to be changed and our DPS would go up considerable sustained and burst.&amp;nbsp; And people would want wizards knowing for a fact we could do serious damage to mobs.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>what are some Underused wiz raiding spells?</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=wizardbalance&amp;message.id=4688#M4688</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;what do you think are some vary underused spells that should be cast more on raids?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Been looking at some parses&amp;nbsp; of some&amp;nbsp;fellow wizards in my guild and noticed most&amp;nbsp;burn mobs&amp;nbsp;a few ways&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;on average most nuke this way:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;start our with cf or vox few tiems, after tank set in aggro they switch to bigger nukes likes acf/gc. then switch between sustained and big nukes depending how fast the mobs dieing(ie keeping your manapool with the mobs hp)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;other way i found few wizards casting on raids is starting out with a rain(usally tears of sun), acnient spear, then either cf , clicky nukes, acf&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;mw and while keeping ancient spear and the rain on as they refresh.&amp;nbsp; at 1st it thought this was silly to cast&amp;nbsp;rains and ancient spear( befor i seen the parses was like why you cast the spear, it has huge recast time, wizard that used it said dont let the recast timmer fool you!)&amp;nbsp;but then i looked at at thier parses and they are casting consussion bit less&amp;nbsp;with this method and&amp;nbsp;sometimes are really high in the parses. guess its the cast times&amp;nbsp;or something&amp;nbsp;that makes those pretty good dps spells. needless to say i think those 2 spells are vary underused:)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;last way is chaining mw(well starting out&amp;nbsp;bit slower of course and not on fights that last longer then like 8 mins)&amp;nbsp;then EF or acf when the proc is up(again depending hwo fast the mob is dieing). lot of times too the wizard will look for the druid epic call and jsut switch to ef for nuke or 2:)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;all 3 ways really seem about = in dps, but seems there are lot of underused spells out there:)&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>New Spell Line:</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=wizardbalance&amp;message.id=4679#M4679</link>
      <description>What if there was a new spell line for wizards that summoned stat&#xD;
food.&amp;nbsp; No, I don't mean mages, I mean wizards.&amp;nbsp; And the&#xD;
higher level the spell, the better the stat food, say, every 5 levels,&#xD;
until the 70th level spell had summoned food that was better than&#xD;
anything else you can get.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
But it would be norent / temporary, without exception.&amp;nbsp; Then&#xD;
wizards would be popular standing around in PoK again, as well as on&#xD;
raids, etc.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
It's only a "utility" suggestion, probably not nearly as good as doing&#xD;
something to their dps or porting roles, but then again, it migh&#xD;
revitalize them a bit.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

      <title>Some ideas for next expansion</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=wizardbalance&amp;message.id=4672#M4672</link>
      <description>wizards need more direct controle over sustained and burst dps.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;some current oversights need to be fixed mana wieve is not stacking with familiar foucus or bard focus effects.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For burst dps we need a effect that increases our crit rate to 100% for a short duration or a ability to reduce cast times on spells by a large margin ie 2 sec cast time for a limited dureation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For sustained dps we need 2 options a AA that for a certain duration cuts the mana cost on spells cast by 30 40 and 50% and stacks with mana preservation items.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;or a harvest line that gives back a percentage of the total mana pool on a shorter timer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some other ideas similar to the necro soul orb we could use a nuke that has a similar effect for mana. This would be a huge boon to wizards.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wizards also need a reason to have mele want to group with us we need a effect that can contribute to mele dps. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A nuke with a effect of making proc effects have a 100% chance to go off and have doubble the damage effect would be a good effect for us. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or a nuke that give a group member a chance to get a nuke of ours as a proc effect.</description>

      <title>Nerf or outdate clicky pants already!</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=wizardbalance&amp;message.id=4664#M4664</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;i love the wiz class but this is one thing that really makes me dislike the class, being balanced in aggro on an item from 4 expanions ago! &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;i'll just rant why i hate them, and yes i know this is a dead horse but the problem is still in the game after all this time!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;- im sick of seeing decent wizards turned down from raiding guilds becuase wizards without these pants simply are to far behind in dps( takes like 6 sec between nukes just to cast one deaggro, compared to losing maybe&amp;nbsp; .5 cast time between every nuke) and usally have much worse aggro problems which even lower their dps even more(cant realisticly concussion between every nuke without these pants!)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;- i hate having to click my pants between every spell refresh(sometimes 2-3 times back to back)&amp;nbsp;and still have aggro problems, its really starting to hurt my wrist, YET still have aggro problems with all this work&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;- i see nice legs from DP drop with a nice nuke focus but ohh wait cant use them becuase stuck using 140 hp/mana pants! i know some wizards upgrade their pants just to be lazy from all the clicky too, but then you notice their dps liek drops bigtime:)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;i like to ask the dev to&amp;nbsp; outdate these already, make mindcrash umm maybe 90 sec reuse and maybe add&amp;nbsp;20-30% scs&amp;nbsp;mod to familars&amp;nbsp;or put in an concussion aa(i really dont want to cast concussion between every nuke though, its just to stressful and hurts my wrist! want a way to shed all my aggro at once or something every now and then:)!). OR just nerf the pants&amp;nbsp;and fix wizards aggro&amp;nbsp;already if we are&amp;nbsp;still going to be balanced around these silly pants! just plz whateve ru do dont make wizards wait another expanion for their aggro to be fixed, prove you can fix simple issue like this and people will have more faith in the class!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;ps plz excuse the spelling, sort of wrote this fast but from the heart! after all this time we are still balanced around these silly pants!:(&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;Hey guys, with the release of the Combine server, my friend and I are going to start playing&amp;nbsp;(duo) again.&amp;nbsp; We plan to take it kind of slow and experience more lore than leveling and I was wondering how the wizard is at this point in time.&amp;nbsp; My friend is a warrior and I am torn between a druid and a wizard(i know the druid is an obvious choice because of SoW and healing/buffs). I have always loved the way the wizard class works though and I was wondering if it is safe to create a wizard(meaning updates/fixes are expected in the near future).&amp;nbsp; Any feedback from you guys is greatly appreciated!&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>Devs have been saying that changes are being discussed or in the works&#xD;

Anyone high up on the ladder mind letting us know what's going on with&#xD;
these changes you have been thinking about for the past six months?&#xD;
Suggestions have been made by the wizard community but it seems they&#xD;
have been falling on def ears. An update every six months is not&#xD;
sufficient to keep many of us playing this game. Without the prospect&#xD;
of change from our current situation people will start leaving, however&#xD;
if you let us know what you are up to it would help us hold out longer&#xD;
as long as we know that something will happen.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

Thank you.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

      <description>I'm trying to work up a spreadsheet to calculate a wizards theoretical max dps based on the spell he/she uses, casting time, focuses, AA's, and such.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway, so far I know that critical hit multiplier with Destructive Fury breaks down as the following:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Level 1: 2.07&lt;br&gt;Level 2: 2.15&lt;br&gt;Level 3: 2.25&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also that Mastery of Fury level 3 makes it 2.5, though I am interested if anyone knows the breakdown for Mastery of Fury levels 1 and 2. Also, if anyone knows the breakdown for the percent chance to hit breakdown for all the various crit AA's is, I'll love you forever if you share it with me, all I know is innate wizard chance to crit is 2% until you get AA's.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once its all finished, I'll be sure to post a link to a download for the spreadsheet on here for all who want.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Creating a new wizard?</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=wizardbalance&amp;message.id=4592#M4592</link>
      <description>Forgive me if this hits a sore spot with wizards, but is there really any reason to create a wizard over a mage these days? I like the idea of being the caster DD king, but when I look through the spell lists, the wizard damage doesn't look that significant over a mage to compensate for mage+pet. I leveled a frog wizard to 10 last night. I am trying to find a pure caster that I like playing.  I have a 23 Nec at the moment. I don't care for the weak pet, and thought maybe higher DD, or better pet might be more interesting to me. Wizards seem like a porting mage without the pet. Am I wrong?&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>DPS Status</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=wizardbalance&amp;message.id=4547#M4547</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;More of a question for Qamen or I suppose a dev that trolls here on the status of DPS changes and aggro. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Is there a plan to adjust and better balance casters versus melee or is it pretty much the lost cause as it appears.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;While doing Anastasia in ToB the parses were putting a Time geared rogue above the top 2 geared wizards on the server.  It is simply wrong for someone with 5 expansions past geared and still surpassing 2 top geared wizards in a 6.5 minute fight.  The evenly geared rogues did double the damage of the wizards, and to top that, when the warrior died the wizards were summoned first.  The AE was cured instantly so it had no effect on the wizard performance. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;While this is a single encounter, it is the same type of thing throughout EQ.  In no situation anywhere should someone with 5 expansions prior in gear be able to top the top of the line.  And no situation should someone be able to do double the damage and accumulate less aggro than someone that does half (excluding tanks whose aggro is obviously used differently). &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I have yet to see any Deathknell loot but I am sure it follows the prior expansions where melee get better ratios and higher mods while casters get a 5% damage foci increase which basically breaks down to nothing with the RNG.  I highly doubt there are caster aggro mods since there are none prior (epic excluded).  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So I guess I am just wondering if there is any word of change or modification.  When speaking to Rytan in Vegas he said there was some known issues in regards to wizards sustained and burst dps.  Small modifications helped in DoD but are still off by a long shot.   &lt;/div&gt;</description>
