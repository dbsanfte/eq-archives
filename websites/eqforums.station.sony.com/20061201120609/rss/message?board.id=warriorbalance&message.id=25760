      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Ive played my warrior for 6 years got 1150 aa and he's in coa or better gear. When i started my warrior i was the group tank period!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;Now 6 years later you give shadow knights and pallys the same taunt as us **HALFLING**?&amp;nbsp; All i have to say is when do we get spells???&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;When do we get feign death??? We have went this long with no spells and now you want to change the rules. Hi end pallys and shadow nights can tank all GROUP content just as good as i can the only thing a warrior has is his disaplines!! Now i see people whinning that they want that removed?? Warriors have stuck it out&amp;nbsp; maybe were not the whinning class's like the pally's or shadow knights but this has gone to far. As a warrior i get no spell no fd no rez no heals no life taps I should be best tank period hands down thats how it was when i started If you want to be a tank Start a warrior not cry till they change your class so you can tank.&amp;nbsp; Sony needs stop babying the pally's and shadow knights that want to be tanks but didnt roll a warrior !!! All i want is to be the best Tank Im a warrior i started a warrior to be the tank...Maybe we should start winning till we get spells or something !! &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>Warriors are GEAR DEPENDENT. It can be argued everyone in EQ is gear needy. Warriors need gear more than every class in EQ. Most groups will not accept a warrior with lousy gear, they will however accept alot of other classes with lousy gear. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Spells are cheap and are sold at merchants. The spells make up for lousy gear. Perhaps warriors should have gear that is sold at merchants cheap to compensate this unbalance. I understand that high level spells are harder to get, which gear should be also. The low level gear is impossible to get, yet spells are totally simple. I dont think everyone should get this benefit, just warriors. They used to place stuff like quests in EQ to accomplish this task. Warriors never were given exclusive quests for great gear, but they should have. There are quests for great warrior gear that takes a raid or severely dedicated group to attain. The flipside is other classes beg for some plat and buy the spells from an npc and dont need months of dedicated help and raids.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My experience in getting help to gear my warrior has been dismal at best. I can get help after everyone else has attained gear/spells that are 10 times more powerful, then they are willing to toss me a scrap. The best warriors are equipped with people that multi box and basically are soloing with more than one toon. I can't count how many groups that I just was happy with exp so others could finish spell quests and get epic upgrades.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warriors are not dead, but if you play one toon on EQ its a bad choice. Most warriors need several other toons in a support group. I say this from the point that I play 3 toons at one time. A great guild that is always there for you is awesome, but they want a war that is there all the time for them. This leads to problems, so guild usually will have a war that is a twink of the guild leaders. I won't discuss the guild war that has the best gear and is really just a shared account.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;True enough BB, and the progression server was a good idea. I mean more for the older servers like Povar, the one I'm on. How would&amp;nbsp; you like to be a new player on a server where most people are level 70 and few people are just starting out? Think how it will be when most people are level 75? Your going to want to play where the people are right?</description>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I actually like what they do with EQ2... in enough time, they revisit the old zones and make them more solo friendly for everyone.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Nektulos, which when EQ2 came out was horrifying (especially in realtion to the wuss Qeynos area version, Thundering Steppes), and really called for a group, was fairly recently revamped and made significantly more solo friendly, ostensibly to make it a little easier to play "catch up" with where the rest of the game is.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;It's one thing to want everyone to pay the same price for the road to where we're at, it's another to expect them to do so with much less of a pool of potential groups from which to draw.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I'd be totally in favor of seeing some revamps of many older zones to ramp down the difficulty and make them more solo friendly.&amp;nbsp; Also to make "junk drops" into high tribute to give some folks reason to hunt in certain places.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;I think many newer folks go for the newer zones because the gear that drops is much better than what drops in older zones. People go where the "value" is. Why go fight a level 50 mob that drops 7 ac plus 7 wisdom boots when you can fight a level 50 mob in a newer zone that drops 35 ac boots with plus 10 to wis, str, sta and cha. plus has 65 hps and mana?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Unless they modify older zones to drop gear that would be compareable to newer zones, they won't hunt there. No one hunts in GuK because the gear there compared to newer same level zones is junk. You can say that older players are more loyal, and there's some truth to that. Then again you can't expect newer players to toil along in the underbrush for 3 years either. They want to break that 10k hp unbuffed mark sooner, not later.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;That's part of the problem with a game as old as this, newer players end up farther and farther behind, if ways for quicker&amp;nbsp;progression for them&amp;nbsp;aren't &amp;nbsp;introduced they will just quit. The game can't grow without a constant influx of newer players.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

you can fight a level 50 mob in a newer zone that drops 35 ac boots&#xD;
with plus 10 to wis, str, sta and cha. plus has 65 hps and mana?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because it's a character development role playing game. You start out with a cloth shirt, a rusty sword, and determination to advance in a hostile world. Advancement might include those 7AC 7Wis boots being a singificant improvement over the cloth sandals you are wearing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If anything, the progression servers show what happens when everybody starts out the same. With a progression path &lt;u&gt;all&lt;/u&gt; can follow, some excell and some do not, will not, and are absolutely determined to not. They'd rather complain that the game caters to those that succeed than make the effort to succeed themselves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;They want to break that 10k hp unbuffed mark sooner, not later.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;And Dain's antechamber is full of grind Dain 1 MM players that would get better experiance and loot in MPG and 5 other zones. To the detriment of the game.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If people quit because EQ is not changed into a video console game with an up, up, down, down, left, right, A, B, Start "accelerated progression" code so much the better. Those people quit to play Doom 3, City of Heros, Halo 2, WoW, or whatever in a few months anyway.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Battleblade-Xegony on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;08-28-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;04:53 AM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;I understand that perspective Frodlin, I just think you expect more content for your progression level than whats feasable. For instance, if your at the top of the current tree now, and they add a taller tree. Your allready going to be in the upper branches of that taller tree with less room to&amp;nbsp;climb than casuals who are still in the lower branches or on the trunk.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Yet, they will still have significantly more content, that I already went through.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I seriously don't understand why people in their 40's dont' hunt in Sol B, or any of the&amp;nbsp;21 zones designed around their level, that they feel they need more... how people at or nearing level 70 don't make use of the truckloads of content aimed around their level, where they can and do get all sorts of upgrades (how many casual folks out there have DS access for instance?&amp;nbsp; It's definitely doable, and there's all sorts of stuff that primarily single group folks can and would use if they got off their butts and did it).&amp;nbsp; Instead what they appear to be asking for is twofold...&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;1. Me not to get a reasonable amount of content aimed at MY playstyle with MY ability to grow myself in mind&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;2. For them to have a similar ability to succeed in MY content without actually putting out the effort or drive that I have.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The fact it there are significantly more players who are MUCH more loyal to Sony, and this game&amp;nbsp;at or near the top than at any other level... they've proven already by the time they've put in, that they're around for the long haul.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;So your suggesting that SoE should balance the game purely for end game people and that only the top 10% of those progression wise need apply?...A team can't make money if the only seats available are the box seats for the few wealthy people, it's the 80,000 "cheapseat peeps", that feed a team.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I don't make that arguement as a casual either, I'm actually in the top 10% of sk's. I don't deny that challangeing content for high end folks keeps them comeing to the trough, but you have to realize the main feeders are general folks who aren't high enders. The fact I'm in the top 10% of sk's and I am only into anguish would, seem to prove there are far more casuals than raiders out there. At least at your level of the game.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Ironically, I can read and write with my one braincell, while it takes you several million. Rex, you just made me appear smarter than you without realizeing it. Is that part of your "confuse the foe" stratagy? Perhaps it's how you&amp;nbsp; taunt your mobs and thus why you fail to agro anything.&amp;nbsp;:smileywink:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;Rex...taunts "your smarter than me"....Mob..replies&amp;nbsp; "Really? Why thankyou..guess your not so bad, I'll go beat on the cleric awhile." :smileytongue:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Frodlin, you complaining about "balance" in the group format and I'm telling you that generic content is the result of balance for 16 classes with wide swaths of gear and aa differences. They can lock raid zones for casuals but they really can't justify locking general group zones simply to satisfy your desire to have mutliple group zones set up for your progression. People pay to play, that includes casuals and folks lower on the progression chart than you, who number far more than you. &amp;nbsp;Preventing them access because you want to balance the game based on your progression will force many people to stop playing, and thus stop paying.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The end result will be SoE looseing money. Now no one can play because SoE shut down a money looseing game. Congrats, classes are now balanced.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

People pay to play, that includes casuals and folks lower on the progression chart than you, who number far more than you. &amp;nbsp;Preventing them access because you want to balance the game based on your progression will force many people to stop playing, and thus stop paying.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Balance is required or a game isn't worth playing, for anyone, because your&amp;nbsp;neck is next on the chopping block.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Sony is actually waking up and realizing&amp;nbsp; that what's REALLY keeping the game alive is the fact that EQ owns everyone else in the industry in end game content, that appealing to the wishy-washy&amp;nbsp;masses is futile in a dated early game.&amp;nbsp; It's about time really&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Tanking in groups is tanking in groups. There isn't any "role" designed for any particular tank for group content anymore, it's generic, so all primary tank classes can do it. It's why pulling is generally easier now, seldom get more than two, in seb you could end up with 5 plus. Everything is done via generic aspects so any base group combination will work, you don't have to have a cleric, or have to have a warrior or have to have a chanter.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;That's what they want in the group format, more than likely because there are 16 classes so they overlap alot. There are too many classes to have "perfered" treatment for just three, that won't work because then you envariably end up with 10 classes&amp;nbsp; lfg all day. It's the combination of 16 classes plus the idea they want everyone in groups. So content has to be taylored in such a way&amp;nbsp;to allow the largest&amp;nbsp;asortment of group combinations&amp;nbsp;that all &amp;nbsp;work just fine.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Maybe if they enlarged groups to 8 or something they could build scenarios around haveing a MT, ramp/add tank and other combos we are more familer with in raids. However, since&amp;nbsp;I doubt that will occur your just stuck with generic mobs I can tank nearly as well as you can.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Why are Knights unable to follow a conversation?&amp;nbsp; Is there some genetic damage that occurs when someone presses either Paladin or Shadowknight at character select screen that annihilates their ability to look at a conversation and understand the context of it?&amp;nbsp; Should it be called something scientific like "Externally induced pathologic contextual disorientation"?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Sharbreena, rather than explaining myself, I want you to look at what I responded to... then look at my answer, then come back and report your findings, and please include a short summary of where your position represents any difference from mine.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Wait, never mind, I don't trust you to get it.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I wrote:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Sorry Josahd, you don't get to get away with it any more, &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;not a single one of you can claim that tanking in group content is balanced in EQ any more&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;, I challenge ANY of you knights to defend that claim and present why you feel it is.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Swain33 wrote:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffff66&gt;Why should it be?&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;/STRONG&gt;Im perplexed you want to be raid tanks, and now you want to nerf the knights ability to tank in groups.?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I responded with:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Are group roles out there specifically designed for warriors that equal tanking roles on raids specifically designed for Knights?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;No?&amp;nbsp; Then that's why&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Why what Sharbreena?&amp;nbsp; The answer is "Why tanking should be balanced in groups".&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I'm arguing for tanking to be balanced in groups... Swain33 was implying that because we have boss tanking on raids that we should somehow suffer an imbalance in group tanking, whereas my response points out something twofold:&amp;nbsp; 1. Tanking oriented roles have been designed for you in raids, thus there is no substantive difference in importance between our role and yours on raids 2. That doesn't happen in groups, thus tanking should be balanced.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

I personally cant see them having the time or desire to try to achieve balance at all levels - the challenge you provided is based on the fact that you think that group content can be and will be balanced at all levels of the game - so I challenge you to come up with solutions for balance to be achieved at every level of the game and can be fireproofed against future expansions introducing new abilities. If you cant then stop challanging people to answer a vague query - be more specific like Is tank balanced at the qvic level for grouping - is it balanced at the COA level for grouping and is it balanced at the DK level for grouping - you might have more joy in identifying where it is that group balance is not balanced and the reasons for it not being balanced.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

The changes done on ALL spells affect the lvl1 to 70 pure caster/ HYBRID user, and it maintains the growth of these classes rather faster than usual.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am still waiting to see how they plan to upgrade Warrior innate abilities that fast. Right now, considering the model Sharb is keeping on her only braincell, the devs have done a half ass job of completing as it should be. They really haven't gone all the way to basically make us a hybridized class, in which any martial skill for close combat is our to use and dominate. And they can't do it, for some odd reason. Takes 5 years to fix this? I don't think so, considering how cake it is to do knight mitigation changes and spell adjustments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Try again :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

(havent been called junior for 40 years) - Frodlin says no knight can come here and give a reasoned explaination as to how the group game is balanced - is he asking for us to say group balancing at all levels and justify that? - If he is then how can anyone justify it when it never is and never can be balanced at all levels - if he asks more specific questions like can you justify it at qvic level or COA level or DK then he might get some answers but he appears to be using this as an attack to justify something that just cant be justified i.e. group tanking at all levels of game play which i doubt that the developers can not do it due to lack of time and desire - sure they could as you suggest fix it however they would need to start now and devote all their time to the concept until they feel it is balanced and then you can wave bye bye to the next 6 or 7 expansions - no new content for 3 to 3.5 years, imbalancing (or perceived imbalancing) would continue for the next 3 years whilst they try yo fix this - how you feel about all warriors having same AC and same HP all maxxed out AAs for eons of time whilst they fix this issue? might be tolerated by the most patient of people but it wouldnt for the most of us - tell me what you feel is imbalanced at the coa level for group tanks and I'll tell you what I think is imbalanced at the DK level - you can then comment on DK level when you get there sunshine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
