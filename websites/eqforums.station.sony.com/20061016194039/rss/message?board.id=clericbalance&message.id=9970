      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;What a class can solo and how impressive it is, or at least seems to be, depends purely on the mob abilites. When I soloed Derakor the Vindicator he had a damage output of 425 DPS while when I farmed Ikaav in Kod'Taz some of them did over 480 DPS.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So why is soloing Vindi more impressive? Because he once was a raidmob. He used to wipe 50 men strong raids due to his RAMPAGE (one of the first mobs with this ability) and because he is UNSLOWABLE. We clerics kill mobs unslowed anyway so it's no difference for us, but if he would be slowable you would have seen Shaman or maybe Enchanter farming him months or years ago already - still it would be the same difficulty to kill him solo for us clerics.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Near Vindicator is a blue con mob (&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=16383"&gt;Miriku the Chaotic&lt;/a&gt;, level 64) that a cleric can't solo - because he is 100% MR and has higher regen than Vindi.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=36810&amp;resize=true"&gt;Valoria Iverson&lt;/a&gt; &amp;lt; Nightwatcher &amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The 7th Hammer&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Cleric's DS stacked is 79..correct. Though, any cleric that pulls 3-4 mobs at a time to use the Ward efficiently has to cast on EACH mob. Since the spell is designed as a reverse DS. It is very mana inefficient.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;T.</description>

Obviously we use mob/mor on any difficult mob solo.  I still use my mor legs from time to time when soloing, but yeah, it's too much of a pain to cast on each mob with 4 sec cast time when you have 8 sarnaks beating on ya =p  Either way, chardok ring is a good substitute to make up for some of the ds gap.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;br&gt;Still only getting about one proc for every 11 or 12 times of getting hit.  getting hit only--worse if you count the misses.   I have misses turned off but go back after fight and look at how many times i get hit vs how many times proc of ward goes off.    so including misses would be much worse even.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Have used it on about 16 or so mobs now and that is best I have gotten so dont believe it is just run of bad luck anymore.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;I have dex maxxed.    what else can I do to make it proc more?   are there any AAs that help?   cause currently this spell seems a waste.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There's nothing you can do to make it proc more (and btw, I had heard agi is what affects defensive proc rate, but both are maxed for me, so I never worried too much).  The main things you can do to increase your dps while soloing is a) get ds as high as possible: ds potions, chardok ring, and another clicky like yarlir ring or inktuta mask is great. b) pull as many mobs at a time as you can handle.  8 mobs at once makes for a high ds and defensive proc to be pretty insane dps.&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Orruar on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;12-06-2005&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;09:57 PM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;I hope you meant Mark and not Ward here.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;If you are re-casting Ward of Vengeance/Retribution 4 times if you are fighting 4 mobs, then yes you are using mana inefficiently. The Ward spells are self buffs and are active against all monsters that may be taking a swing at you.&amp;nbsp; You don't have to targe anyone with this spell. It is self-only.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Marks of course operate as you indicated.&amp;nbsp; I don't find them terribly mana inefficient though. When you look at the damage being done to the mobs over a fight, and compare it to the mana you'd use nuking, the numbers quickly add up in favour of the damage shields.&amp;nbsp; Look at the numbers from my bazu thrasher fight.&amp;nbsp; Damage shields did over 16k damage in the span of&amp;nbsp; 3 minutes.&amp;nbsp; Now, that includes me casting Mark of Retribution, Mark of the Blameless, as well as using a Kilva's Skin of Flame potion and the clickie effect from my Blazing Vambraces.&amp;nbsp; The monster hit me around 133 times during the fight, and took over 100hp each time they did so.&amp;nbsp; Ouch.&amp;nbsp; That's a good use of mana, I'd say. (parser is reporting 2 damage shield hits per successful monster attack -- one is the "regular" damage shield, the other is the "reverse" damage shield.)&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;As Thaere said, spellcasting fury.&amp;nbsp; If you want to solo, I cannot encourage you enough to max out all of your Spellcasting Fury lines (Gift of Mana helps a lot too).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; With Mark of Retribution alone, you are doing 550 damage when the ward goes off.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I have Spellcasting Fury 3, Fury of Magic 3, Fury of Magic Mastery 3, and Destructive Fury 3. A regular ward hit still goes off for 550; a crit goes off for 1237 though, which is a remarkable improvement. Destructive Fury 3 is not as important as getting all the levels in the previous three AA abilities. Those are the ones that increase your chance to land a critical nuke.&amp;nbsp; Of course those should always be secondary to your healing &amp;amp; survival AAs, but they are nonetheless important for any cleric who wants to solo.&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Looking at my Bazu Thrasher fight again, I got 29 procs total (this number includes weapon and Ward procs); fight took three minutes, so if I knock off 6 procs (one each minute for both of the procs on my main weapon), I'm still looking at 23 over 3 minutes; monster hit me 133 times and missed 68; looking at those numbers, I'm getting a Ward proc in every 8-9 swings, which isn't that far off of your numbers.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;While there are no AAs that will directly increase our proc rates (we'd need Weapon Affinity or something like that, I believe), the AAs that can indirectly help are the various Fury AAs, as well as your stat increase AAs (I know you said you had dex maxed out, but is that just with your current cap, or do you still have AAs to put into Planar Power &amp;amp; Chaotic Potential?) &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If you are indeed maxed in all these areas, then I don't know what else to say. This spell changed the way I solo and drastically increases the variety of targets I can consider as viable solo options. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;Yeah the ward of retribution actually gave me a reason to solo at all.&amp;nbsp; Before I got it&amp;nbsp;the last time I had soloed was level 12 in Crushboone.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Indeed, ward is great.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I'm currently tradeskill farming and pull multiple blue / light blue mobs with pretty much zero downtime.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Passers by seem confused as I stand about with 8 XP-giving mobs pounding on me - more so since my primary slot isn't even a weapon :) The only issue with so many mobs is chain summons - can be hard to get spells off when you are ping-ponging madly.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Well.. I decided to head to Wall of Slaughter today for a little bit. I set up at the south wall, near a few corpses from an earlier failed group (none of the members were online at the time, and their resurrection timers were quite old). and after slaying a feran, a chimera and a bazu thrasher, guess who should appear but the Bazu Bonesmasher.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So.. I medded up to full, got my buffs ready, and waited for the Bonesmasher to wander back towards me. I attempted to stun him ( my usual technique for getting Mark of the Blameless on the mob and ensuring I can run back to a safe spot before the monster catches up to me) but he resisted; I got rooted a little ways away from my usual spot, but cleared it with Purify Soul and managed to get back to my usual spot.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I had used Greater Avatar against a bazu earlier, so that was unavailable to me, but I cast Celestial Rejuvenation on myself and went about trying to kill the Bonesmasher. However (another example of bad planning), my Ward of Retribution wore off around the bonesmasher's 70% mark, and my Clarity X potion wore off shortly thereafter too.&amp;nbsp; It was all I could do to keep myself alive for a few moments while I tried to work in a cast of Ward and a reclick of the mana potion.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I finally managed to get both back on, and I felt I was doing quite well.&amp;nbsp; Mana was around 30%, and the bonesmasher was around 35%.&amp;nbsp; However, a passing warrior happened by, and seeing an apparently alone cleric and several slain groupmates, he fired off one of his high-damage disciplines and started hacking away. End result, I got credit for the kill, although I think I only did about half of the monster's remaining 30% health.&amp;nbsp; I'm not 100% certain I would have won the fight entirely solo, but I'm fairly certain I still would have won, without the warrior's intervention. At no point did I lose aggro, until the bonesmasher fled with low health.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The bonesmasher yielded a bazu plasma, a minor muramite rune and a tainted heartstone charm.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;So... I'll be going back, and I hope to get a "pure" solo kill. I'm sure I'll get it next time.. and I'll be sure to recast Ward of Retribution just before I engage!&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>You remind me of myself Elhana, trying the next challenge and persisting until you do get a true solo kill, for that sense of achievement im sure. I see you have EP legs, a good trick I use is the double mark pull: click legs, then as soon as it is done, cast Mark of the Blameless (clickies do not add a recast). In a short space of time (faster than depending on 2 spell marks), which if cast at a distance, the Bazu will be near you after the 2nd mark lands, and there you have him double marked and ready to take some damage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Keep on going and you'll beat him for sure :)</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I managed another (personal) solo milestone today, and that was slaying the Remains of Sythrax solo. I had tried a few levels ago (at 68 or so) and was pretty soundly defeated -- I got the remains down to 50% or so, but died nearly out of mana.&amp;nbsp; I tried again that same day and only managed to get the remains down to 70% and then died when I failed to channel a heal over numerous attempts.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;A few levels and perhaps a hundred AA later, I found the kill quite challenging but fairly doable.. I switched tactics from using quick heal to heal-over-time, and I used the quick root at start to ensure that Mark of the Blameless and Mark of Retribution took on Sythrax.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Sythrax hits hard and fast -- here's a copy &amp;amp; paste from my little parser.. look at the DPS -- that's how dependant porcupine DPS is on a mob's attack speed!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;fight lasted&amp;nbsp; 225&amp;nbsp; seconds ( 3.75&amp;nbsp; minutes) - DPS of&amp;nbsp; 254.2178&lt;BR&gt;total times missed:&amp;nbsp; 13&amp;nbsp; ( 13 / 29 ,&amp;nbsp; 44.82759 %)&lt;BR&gt;times I dodged:&amp;nbsp; 8&lt;BR&gt;times monster missed:&amp;nbsp; 91&lt;BR&gt;times monster dodged:&amp;nbsp; 0&lt;BR&gt;times monster riposted:&amp;nbsp; 2&lt;BR&gt;total melee damage:&amp;nbsp; 2161 ( 9.604445&amp;nbsp; dps)&lt;BR&gt;total nukes/procs:&amp;nbsp; 45&lt;BR&gt;total damage from nukes/procs:&amp;nbsp; 37236 ( 165.4933&amp;nbsp; dps)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;total overall damage (to kill):&amp;nbsp; 57199&amp;nbsp; ( 57199 + 0&amp;nbsp; from pet)&lt;BR&gt;average proc/nuke damage:&amp;nbsp; 827.4667&lt;BR&gt;average melee hit:&amp;nbsp; 135.0625&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I used Greater Avatar 2 before I engaged, which helps account for the higher average melee hit and the high number of procs &amp;amp; nukes ( I alternated the final 40% or so of the Sythrax fight with Desolate Undead and quick heals, and got a nice number of crits)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Next target is going to be a pure solo Bazu Bonesmasher... any other ideas/suggestions? I'd love to hear 'em =)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;I have dex maxxed.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; what else can I do to make it proc more?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; are there any AAs that help?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; cause currently this spell seems a waste.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;There are no AAs to improve the proc rate, but the Spell Casting Fury line of AAs (DD crits) do affect this buff and any proccing weapon you may have.&amp;nbsp; With a better chance to crit the DPS goes up even though the number of procs remains the same.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

Just that the expendable use was high.  I said that more to prove exactly how hard this really was, not to cheapen your victory.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I must have missed the memo, but using potions that you can buy from a vendor in pok doesn't make the feat any less impressive.  I actually went and soloed vindi about 2-3 months ago for fun as well.  It was completely self buffed + used 1 kei potion + I might have had SA from a BL (don't remember on this).  For ds, I used yarlir ring clicky, ds potion, and chardok ring.  Along with worn ds, that's 102 ds, which helps a lot.  I don't see how using any of these things makes it not solo though.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lliuanae, I'm curious as to if you had split the guards at all.  I couldn't find any way to do that solo, so I had to fight them at the same time and that forced me to use some rather creative techniques to complete the fight (died a couple times figuring out better ways to do it).  By the time the guards were both dead, vindi would be at about 80% and I'd be at 30-40m.  A tip for clerics soloing hard mobs: ghetto summon kiting with elixir up is a great way to "med".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway, back to the point of the post.  Anything a druid can solo, a cleric can solo.  And clerics can solo for decent xp in certain places.  I make 4aa/hour solo in chardokb, which is more than most classes get solo, so we can't really complain about not being able to solo.  So all in all, I think clerics are the most powerful solo class in the game right now (comparing both xp gain and difficulty of mobs we can solo), but we are extremely gear dependant on soloing.  In contrast, my necro with like 4k mana can solo for 5aa/hour without breaking a sweat, though he'd get owned by any mob that can summon.</description>

ElhanaMistfall wrote:&lt;BR&gt;Ouch, Thaere, that may have just been bad luck.&amp;nbsp; It's true, the chimerae run pretty darn fast (I think they are the fastest ones there) but if you can manage to keep them fighting you til they're a bit lower than 20% it may make things easier.&amp;nbsp; Trying to root them when they're about 25% may not be a bad idea, or if you're feeling brave, wait a bit longer before healing yourself (since the mobs won't break at 20% if you're also fairly hurt).&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;I was pulling to the "south wall" camp (if you zone in from Noble's Causeway, it's to the left out of the entrance passageways) and even if a mob does run in that area, you can usually finish it off before it gets far enough away to aggro another monster.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;One time I did this at the "wagons" camp and the monster ran straight at Velitorkin. It wasn't pretty *laughs*&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I bought some of the ensnaring concoction spheres and have been planning on giving those a try, although at a cost of 100 each, I have been loathe to use them.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;Problem with rooting is the only non proccing weapon I have is my epic 1.0 (bleh).&amp;nbsp; I depend on procs and DDs to do damage.&amp;nbsp; Even if I did that I could spend 5 minutes waiting for the chimera to do enough damage to itself againt my RDS to blast it with a nuke to kill it.&amp;nbsp; How inefficient is that!?!?!&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;You know what?&amp;nbsp; I have to agree 100%.&amp;nbsp; My RL friends and I are in a similar boat.&amp;nbsp; We are all in the same end-game raiding guild.&amp;nbsp; We all have 400-650 AAs.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;And while there are still plenty of AAs we want/need, when we group together on the weekends we hardly ever "grind xp."&amp;nbsp; Yes, most of the places we group happen to be great XP, but the AAs we ding are almost always secondary.&amp;nbsp; It's the completed mission or the droppeed item(s) we are looking for.&amp;nbsp; My friends and I are extremely goal oriented.&amp;nbsp; We will go to a non to minimal xp zone to get a drop for a quest rather than grind XP in RSS.&amp;nbsp; If a guildmate needs help with something (and they can catch us before we start doing anything), we would rather help them than grind xp (even if its just doing a couple of creator runs to get 80 crystals to get an item for a twink/alt).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;For me soloing is a means of killing time: I'm waiting for our guild raid to start or I have signed on early on a saturday morning and I am waiting for my friends, or I am LFG and no groups are quickly forthcoming, so I go solo instead of sitting in the Guild hall twiddling my thumbs.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;I think a cleric's biggest problem soloing at the moment is that we have not soloed much in our EQ lives, so we don't have the experience so we end up failing when we try.&amp;nbsp; This discourages us from trying again :smileysad:.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I know that before I got my ward of retribution spell from DoN I had not successfully soloed since crushbone (about level 12).&amp;nbsp; Up until DoN, I felt I needed a group to&amp;nbsp;accomplish anything.&amp;nbsp; And this is coming from a long time raiding player with at least near end game gear since POP and one who has spent DKP, AAs, LDoN points, DoN crystals, and plat to improve his melee and solo abilities.&amp;nbsp; So, what is an "average" cleric expected to do when there are no groups looking for healer and not enough "role" fillers to create a group of his own?&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;However, I spent a large part of my day yesterday soloing with some success in Wall of Slaughter, at the south wall camp and also in the entry tunnel between WoS and Noble's Causeway.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I had a few tradeskill drops (bazu blood, various level skins, trean flies, some gems, a Kuuan Lodestone, and an icy shard) and generally had a lot of fun.&amp;nbsp; I mostly enjoyed it for the challenge, but also for the (somewhat small) chance of decent loot, even from the non-nameds. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The running mobs are certainly a problem, but if you are careful you can pull them far enough from the main wandering area so that you can finish them off before they get far enough to aggro something else.&amp;nbsp; When the monsters turned to run, I'd stun them ASAP then root them.&amp;nbsp; I'd try and channel a nuke through after they summoned me and kept hitting me; with Ward still active, usually root would break relatively quickly and I'd get a nuke off; the monster would now be around 10% or lower and quite a bit slower.&amp;nbsp; Repeat with another root (or stun if it's refreshed), another nuke, and by then it was usually a simple matter to finish them off.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The experience was not on par to what I can earn in Hate or even Veksar (since the fights take a lot more out of me) but for challenge and fun, they can't be beat.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Two days and I still haven't seen the Bonesmasher again, or any of the weaker nameds, but when I&amp;nbsp; do I'll post an update as to my success -- or failure.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
