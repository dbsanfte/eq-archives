    <title>Here is my list of PVP issues</title>
    <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=PVP&amp;message.id=10552</link>
    <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I felt the need to post my list of PVP issues that are not being addressed:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;1.&amp;nbsp; PVP Issues list that have been in "Discussion" since Aug '04.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;2.&amp;nbsp; Ruleset that has no CLEAR defining line of "rights and wrongs".&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;3.&amp;nbsp; Lack of enforcement of any stated rules (i.e. not enough GM presence on the server.)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;4.&amp;nbsp; Lack of knowledge of the rules by the "Governing Body" (in conjunction with item 3.)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Those were the top 4 for me.&amp;nbsp; The merge just broke the camel's back.&amp;nbsp; What I feel is happening is I am being fed a bunch of stuff as a stalling or delaying tactic by the people who produce a broken product.&amp;nbsp; It's unfortunate, considering my 4.5 year tenure playing this game will officially&amp;nbsp; close as of May-June (subscription runs out.)&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I personally think I gave it all the benefit of the doubt.&amp;nbsp; Loose ruleset that left WAY too much room for interpretation, I continued to play.&amp;nbsp; Non-existant consistency within the GM staff on ruleings, I continued to play.&amp;nbsp;Loopholes (see interpretation) for the GM's to do nothing what so ever, I continued to play.&amp;nbsp; Complete disregard or changes at such a pace it makes a snail appear to move at light speed, I think 4.5 years is enough.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I believe it has been suggested somewhere that SOE started these changes so that they could finally let EQ die out and propagate EQ2 as their next cash cow is becoming a reality.&amp;nbsp; Granted, this is a personal opinion, but think on this: Why would they have to merge servers if the population was there?&amp;nbsp; Obviously the&amp;nbsp; population is going somewhere.&amp;nbsp; I know I have.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;With that, this is my final farewell to Rallos Zek (now just Zek), the home for me for the last 4.5 years.&amp;nbsp; I have moved on.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <title>Other issues that need addressed on pvp servers</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=PVP&amp;message.id=8655#M8655</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Since the conversation has been predominantly about server mergers lately, I wanted to take the time to start a thread on other issues that you consider important on the Zek servers.&amp;nbsp; For the most part, we're just going round and round on the server merging threads and until we are provided with more details, such as a date for a merger or other details ironed out, it will be difficult to make much headway.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;What other issues are each of you encountering that may need addressed? The main other items that I have seen discussed are :&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;-hacking problems needing to be dealt with&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;-pvp spell resists needing to be implemented for spells over level 65&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Another &amp;nbsp;issue mentioned by members of a couple servers were :&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;-the sk spell dread gaze (ae terror spell) aggroing pets of the members of your raids.&amp;nbsp; The most suggested solution to this was to make the spell similar to wizard ae spells so that if you're in the raid, it doesn't affect pets of members of the raid.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Any other pressing issues besides the main items on the Issues list that feel need to be addressed currently? &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Well first of all I think one of the most detrimental problems&amp;nbsp;which needs to be&amp;nbsp;adressed has got to be hacking. It totally undermines the reason to pvp. But I think that has been said several times already.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I would like to ask around about&amp;nbsp;a minor matter&amp;nbsp;: The possiblity of making the monk's Dragon Punch ability slighty easier to resist. I'm a chanter and&amp;nbsp;have 465mr (to be honest I'm actually not 100% sure it's even mr it checks against. If it's not then I'm sorry for my presumption)&amp;nbsp;and I still only seem to resist it like 1 out of 10 hits. Now as a caster, fighting a monk in high end game with 8k+hp unbuffed etc, well unless I have a corner to pin myself into to anull the effect of DP it's almost a certain loss. If&amp;nbsp;I'm fighting a monk in a&amp;nbsp;cornerless environment&amp;nbsp;it's damn near impossible to make my mana and hp last against his sick&amp;nbsp;melee dps and his DPs constantly knocking me back and interrupting my runes, nukes etc even with maxed&amp;nbsp;defensive aa's, decent mana preservation (30% on beneficials) etc. Maybe it's just me and a few others suffering from this. Sometimes I've been successful in&amp;nbsp;taking one step forward after being DP'd and then "regaining my concentration", but&amp;nbsp;my cpu is pretty&amp;nbsp;sucky and lags alot&amp;nbsp;in most&amp;nbsp;post-pop zones so that strategy is pretty impossible to rely on in any way.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Throw in a Ton-Po's Staff of Understanding and&amp;nbsp;as a pure caster - at least as a chanter -&amp;nbsp;you're going to either run or die if it's 1v1. Especially for me as a chanter fighting a monk I have to kill him with in 6 mins of him using his mend for the&amp;nbsp;1st time. So if I simply rely on rapture/nuking (with SOTI)&amp;nbsp;him to death a monk in high-end game will with like&amp;nbsp;85% certainty out-regen and&amp;nbsp;outresist my (pretty feeble) nukes even with maxed crit nukes and devastating (destructive? I forgot)&amp;nbsp;fury aa's. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So basically I have to rely on him killing himself on my DS (27 selfbuffed, with 9th(!)&amp;nbsp;coldain ring,&amp;nbsp;feedback and AHR neck), my pet (if he doesn't opt for killing it) proc'ing&amp;nbsp;DD's on him and the occational rune while I emphatically re-rune myself. Atm the DP is what makes the difference. After epic and&amp;nbsp;aa rune is clicked it's very likely that a monk can deny me the chance&amp;nbsp;to channel my 2.5 sec cast time rune&amp;nbsp;untill I'm dead, through using his DP.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Hope I'm not offending&amp;nbsp;anyone, and I'm aware that it is a small matter. Just wondering if anyone else agrees with this.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I don't disbelieve you, on the other hand, it is very apparent that most guilds employ said hacks. I wish tulius would explain the no drop transfer bug, or is it a hack? I dunno. It's not that I ever log my other characters, would just be nice to see them all decked out.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Easy for them to raid hard to get to places when 99% of them appear to be using MacroQuest to warp directly to named mobs and such.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Make sute to be hardcore about enforcing the rules set on Zek.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Fix hacking.&amp;nbsp; The way to fix hacking if not possible to prevent it in game, is simply to BAN anyone caught using a hack in PVP.&amp;nbsp; We have been PVPing against another guild on our server a lot these last 10 days, it is enough of a chalenge to fight against people who generally out gear you significantly as in Qvick versus Elemental, it's another thing when some hack on top of that.&amp;nbsp; Warping at low hp is common.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Start permanently BANING the offenders using hacks in PVP, and soon you'll see even the dumbest hackers get the mesage and discontinue using them.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Traning:&amp;nbsp; if the new ZEK server is following Rallos Zek rules, training is a NO-NO.&amp;nbsp; People like Tulliusa warrior&amp;nbsp;from &amp;nbsp;(Wudan) on the RZ server make a living by training everytime they are in trouble or being beaten.&amp;nbsp; I am takling reapeted traning with exp deaths.&amp;nbsp; Example the other night we were fighting at the Broken Wall in Barindu (where the entrance to trail 5 and 6 GOD&amp;nbsp; are.)&amp;nbsp; Tullius had an expedition going so he could zone in to an instance in safety.&amp;nbsp; We were holding the Barindu area (some people were also with an instance but others did not have it up.)&amp;nbsp; Tullius since he could not PVP his way out (being outnumbered), was coming out of the instance traning 5-6 mobs on us, rezoning back.&amp;nbsp; He did this at least 4-5 times in one hour time lapse, causing experience kills to a number of people.&amp;nbsp; This type of obvious traning behavior should receive ONE warning, and a permanent BAN on repeat offense.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;SOE you MUST ENFORCE these rules with a huge penatly like a ban, or otherwise Zek will be a server which no one will be left playing on soon after the merge. Merging the 4 servers maybe a good idea, but now you must ensure proper customer support by having a LARGE number og GM's on Zek, and ENFORCING the rules in a strong fashion.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So let's recap:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;1.&amp;nbsp;Requesting a large (4-5 GM's nightly) &amp;nbsp;GM presense on ZEK&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;2. A strong enforcement of the ruleset (start baning people who break it repeatedly)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;3.&amp;nbsp;Ban people who HACK in PVP &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;4. Ban people who TRAIN in PVP&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;5. Use these 1st 29 days of trial on the Zek server to be really **SMURF** about enforcing those rules.&amp;nbsp; You can clean out 99% percent of the people who will be causing probles through baning their accounts due to hacking/traning in PVP.&amp;nbsp; Maybe it il cost you losing 20-30 accounts, a small price to pay compared to the 100-150 you will lose either moving to a blue server or cancelling accounts due a small group of hackers/trainers.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;As far as PVP class balance.&amp;nbsp; Give warriors a PVP discipline or AA&amp;nbsp; ability similar to Berzerkers to temporary&amp;nbsp;snare/root opponents in PVP.&amp;nbsp; There are hundreds of warriors playing and only a handfull of berzerkers, make warriors more usefull in PVP by giving them this ability.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Razzinel Defiant&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>There is no way there will ever be a GM in every zone to ban people from training. And no matter how honest you may be, no GM should ever take your word for it that someone trained and ban them. Even if a GM is in the zone and it looks like a person is training it is questionable. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Example:&lt;br&gt;I am a rogue sneaking up on a raid through mobs to take out one of their members, they see me coming and send a pet to break hide and agro me. What should I do? I will continue heading through the mobs to them and hit escape, they got trained, but really what else did they expect when they caused it? Does the GM ban them or me?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trains like that are a part of the game, deal with it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Any rule that is dependent on GMs to save you will fail.</description>

&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;First off, what would you expect happening when 1 rogue tries to sneak up on a raid? But if that did happen, you could try running away from them and then hit escape. It is YOUR choice to try to&amp;nbsp;train the&amp;nbsp;whole raid. And that is against the rules. Anyways if they can send a pet on you, you shouldn't be around too many mobs to train.&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;

      <description>Pets do not agro mobs if they are not attacking them, so the argument that I must not be around many doesn't work since it would only be attacking me. And hitting escape will not stop the pet from hitting me so it is pointless to run away since it will just break hide the next round of melee, hardly enough time to run out of an area.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I do attack raids all the time and this does happen once in a while also someone casting while far away, a bard stunning then fading to get mobs to agro on me, or just shooting an arrow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Point is you cannot tell who started a train many times, bard run in on your raid with mobs then fades, you run them back to the bard's group, GM sees which part? blames who? Rules like that are impossible to enforce fairly.</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;GMs see both and bans both for training?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Edit- Btw a raid would not need to train a group. They can just pvp and kill them.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Caliel on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;02-01-2005&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;11:55 PM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;It is your choice to disturb a raid.. and youre saying you will stand with mobs to taunt them since "if they break your sneak hide you train them"&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;It is your choice to be in the mobs.. and your choice to run up to them and escape.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I once scouted a guild in vex thal and they broke my sneak hide.. youre saying i should have trained them?? youre a irl a**h*le&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;I really pray their will be heavy gms watching the server because asmuch as I want the server merge... if it is a training hell like sullon or tallon etc I know TONS of people will quit.. making the new zek server look like a sullon&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;I had a similar situation once with a newt guild.&amp;nbsp; I was on my friends rogue, and the newts were in VT doing a raid.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; At the time we had a no-train agreement with them, but I was just scouting to see how they were doing.&amp;nbsp; I intentionally did NOT train them, nor open the door(they were at Blob1).&amp;nbsp; However...&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Someone on the raid thought it a good idea to send a pet thru the door to break my invis....&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; it did, and I hit escape losing aggro on the mobs...&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; HOWEVER, because they broke the invis it caused the mobs around there to move closer to the door(where I was) consequently aggroing their raid.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Now I did not directly train them, nor even want them to break my invis but that was their choice.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Oh and while escape does make the pet stop hitting you...&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; it doesn't stop the pet owner from /pet attack zola to reaggro you after you've burned escape.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Oh...&amp;nbsp; Btw, incase anyone is just wanting to suggest:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; No attacking people on raids.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I want to let them know that that didn't work to well for us, because soon it became that everytime someone was in a pvp zone they were "Raiding"...&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; whether it was a 1 group on Trakanon or a farm group killing one of the trashnamed in BoT.&amp;nbsp; I understand that some people don't like pvp nor trains.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; However, sometimes politics gets to be alot gayer leading to the way I hear RZ is right now where you get "Blacklisted" for pvping people because someone is always a friend of someone else.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;1.&amp;nbsp; Hacking - zone crashing:&amp;nbsp; This affects the most people at one time.&amp;nbsp; If they are raiding a zone it resests all mobs and ruins hours of play time for 60-100 people.&amp;nbsp; There is NO WAY to counteract this as a player.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;2.&amp;nbsp; Training:&amp;nbsp; This also affects alot of people but at least players can try to stop someone who trains.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;3.&amp;nbsp; Hacking - player crashing:&amp;nbsp; People can cause players to go link dead and thus can kill them and loot items.&amp;nbsp; Again, there is no way to counteract this as a player.&amp;nbsp; This would be #2 on the list but only affects one person at a time and the affects of it can be minimized by players but making all loot no drop.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Everything else (class balancing, spell balancing, etc) is WAY down the list.&amp;nbsp; You must take care of the first 3 in order to even give this server a chance.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>Bards need a MASSIVE nerf.  Bards are in essence enchanters with the same spells, Better armor, More hitpoints, Can cast while running, Super Speed, and more melee damage.&lt;br&gt;Please remove the running and Casting ability, increase resistablity.  Bards are not supposed to be a "super class" capable of doing everything another class does and better.  THey are a jack of all trades and not supposed to be that great at any particular skill.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Crimson potions dont need to be nerfed.  To the person that says whole groups die to mezz... if thats the cause your group needs to have its collective head examined.  Mezz is not particualarly unbalancing when its so easily broken by people nuking/hitting you on your opponents side, or your own group to break mezz&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You need to make class balanceing your #1 priority IMO.  Melee cut through casters like a hot knife though butter, even high geared casters have little chance if they cant heal and are hit for an average of 400hp a hit every second.  To balance this Cast times on pvp spells either should go WAY down and/or most nukes pvp need to be made nearly unresistable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A melee can bash stun ect to stop a caster from damaging... theres little most casters can do to stop a melee from cutting them to ribbons when thier hit times are so fast.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Clerics need more damage potential as do enchanters, mages, and shaman.</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;The player (in this case, a rogue) that chooses to follow a raid for the sole purpose of harassing them, or scouting, takes a risk that someone in that raid will see them, and cast on them. Your statement, Ranny, is akin to a burgler suing a homeowner for shooting him in the leg after breaking into their house. The PnP is there to protect legitamate PvPrs. If Im following a raid as a rogue I fully expect that if Im discovered or attack them to get hit and possibly die, its&amp;nbsp;a risk I chose to take. Or I could choose to simply come back with my own raid force and challenge them, or, leave them alone? Yet somehow if I harass them by myself and aggro mobs because they chose trying to kill me for being an annoyance, Im the victim. Yet again, more pathetic reasoning from the SullonZek crew or whatever server you come from. I cant even think of anyone left on Vallon who thinks that way. Just dont be stupid and get toon into&amp;nbsp;a situation you cant handle and XP loss wont be an issue.
