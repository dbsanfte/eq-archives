    <description>First Monday I've had to work in 4 weeks. Oh well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So how did your weekend go? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was a miserable weekend weather wise, so I stayed in all weekend. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Friday, guild tried to Raid Uqua, but we didn't have our game on. Messed up the timing and barely made it ot the second gas chamber. Lots of frustrations that night.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Saturday, I spent the morning in EQII, running my troubadour around Feerott, gathering supplies for my armorsmith, and examining the zone. Still trying to find some good harvest spots there. (Been crawling the rivers more or less so far). Saturday afternoon/evening I was in EQLive thouhg. Finished the "Deserting the Ranks" mission for my Dreadspire access key. Also helped a guildie with a small Epic 2.0 fight. DnD group had a makeup game that night as well, just a light session though of relatively light RPing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sunday, did my laundry and the usual stuff. Spent much of the day in EQII once again harvesting Tier 5 stuff and doing quests and such. Guild tried Uqua once again on Sunday, and it went MUCH smoother than Friday. IMO, it was possibly one of the smoothest runs we've done yet. (3rd success, and hopefully last success we'll in Uqua in a long time). DnD game was going to be cancelled originally but the GM's alt plans fell through. So we had another session and got up to the next big event (for next weekend).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And now a 5 day work week.... *sigh*&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sister's moving out west this week. I think she's planning on driving from Halifax and stopping at my parents tonite. If so, mom will pick me up tonite so we can have one last family dinner and stuff.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Friday night I went out to dinner with my girl friend, she was going to drag me to see the breakup but I got out of it and we never got to the movies that night.&amp;nbsp; :smileywink:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Saturday morning she woke up and was very very sick.&amp;nbsp; Throwing up, high fever and headache.&amp;nbsp; I told her she wasn't allowed to drive back home (about 45 minutes) and in an attempt of defiance stood up and fainted.&amp;nbsp; Here I am freaking out so I left her in the care of my mom and went to my foot doctor appointment.&amp;nbsp; They can find absolutely nothing wrong with my feet and said I should try to work a little but no more then for 4 hours at a time.&amp;nbsp; So after Michelle was feeling better she drove home and I went to work from 6:30-10:30pm.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Sunday all my pain in my feet have returned with a vengence.&amp;nbsp; Going to have to get MRIs done.&amp;nbsp; Went to a family birthday party and all was well until my cousins and one of their friends showed up.&amp;nbsp; You can refer to them as the overweight ho squad.&amp;nbsp; I went outside to get a beer from the cooler and the 3 of them are talking LOUD with the rest of my family around.&amp;nbsp; My aunts/uncles, great aunts/uncles etc.&amp;nbsp; "She's such a **HALFLING**, oh she is so fat how can she get a man that would want her.&amp;nbsp; She's so dumb."&amp;nbsp; And more things I can't say here.&amp;nbsp; I walk over to the table and start a fight.&amp;nbsp; "Out of the 4 of us at the table over 18, I am the only one who can look down and see feet, has a Diploma, a Job and no abortion history.&amp;nbsp; 1 of you had a baby at 16, 1 of you is 5 months pregnent.&amp;nbsp; Between the two of you only 1 knows who fathered her baby."&amp;nbsp; It shut them up for about a second.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Late last night I'm begging for a pain reliever so my mom says she has some Vicadin left from her last surgery.&amp;nbsp; The bottle is gone so I'm guessing my older brother took it.&amp;nbsp; But she has some Tylenol with Codeine so I pop one of those.&amp;nbsp; Took longer then I expected but it finally kicked in around 10-11pm.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Today I woke up and my old heel pains have returned and now ontop of that and the ankle pain my back is hurting.&amp;nbsp; I'm so **HALFLING**ing confused as to what is wrong with my body.&amp;nbsp; Just chop off my legs and give me some steel rods so it stops.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>Friday night I worked and hubby gave me his graphics card as it seems to be making his machine crash, so I can now run around the bazaar with all traders on and no lag :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Saturday I didn't get much done in EQ, I was extremely tired and had to take my daughter to her jazz recital dress rehearsal. Came home and slept until it was time to go to the actual recital. Although it was long and my son got rather bored with it all, my daughter danced really well. It was only at the end when someone commented to me how amazing it was that she was dancing so well that it occurred to me that she missed the entire first term of lessons with her infected him, and now I can't even tell she was ever sick, no limp, and she approached every physical activity with the zeal she had before she was ill. Made me very happy :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sunday was hubby's brthday so we headed out to the botanical gardens and walked around some of the trails for a couple of hours, before heading out to lunch. I had a nap in the afternoon while they went out for a bicycle ride and then came back to watch the movies he had got. I went to work, was a long night, but not too hard, adn I got to relax for an hour after I got in before I went to sleep.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Still off work today, back tomorrow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;Conan got a lion haircut at the vets, his fur was so matted becuase he is too fat to lick his ass!&amp;nbsp; &lt;span&gt;:smileyvery-happy:&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp; He is on antibiotics for a bladder infection..he had peed several times on the carpet so I figured something was wrong.&amp;nbsp; I've bee n using natures Miracle which is an enzyme that supposedly breaks down the urine smell...still reeks in here. Ugh!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Didn't do too much, went to the Old City Cemetary and took some pics, had dinner and a drink at the pub across the street, watched a lot of TV..&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Nature's miracle works great.&amp;nbsp; i generally soak the carpet, soak it up with paper towels, then soak it again.&amp;nbsp; also, if you get a blacklight, you can see where you may have missed the application, urine shows up a shiny blue to black lights.&amp;nbsp; using a steam cleaner only seems to make it smell worse for me.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;hope the antibotics work, bladder infections are nightmares to the nose.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;yup, but the reason i soak it up the first time is to get it out of the pad.&amp;nbsp; then i drench the whole area, past where the wet spot is.&amp;nbsp; the black light really does help if you have a place you can find one.&amp;nbsp; there migth be areas you don't know he peed making the place smell.&amp;nbsp; but like kyth said, if the pad is one of those pads that just wont let go of the smell (some pads are made with a urea compound supposedly), you may have to replace it.</description>

      <description>If the smell does not go away you may need to replace the pad in that portion of the floor.&amp;nbsp; Sometimes that odor just will not come out of the pad and continues to linger no matter what you do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Was off Saturday from my temporary job and was pretty much stressed out for the first time in a couple months (amazing how working almost 70 hours in 6 days will do that to you).&amp;nbsp; Did an impromptu Hole raid with the guild, had fun there.&amp;nbsp; After that was over I excercised for a little while because I was going stir-crazy, that helped a little.&amp;nbsp; Somehow ended up getting only about 4 hours of sleep before having to work another nearly 12 hour shift on Sunday, got even less sleep last night before having to work the same shift today.&amp;nbsp; Yet somehow today I felt re-energized and back to feeling good again, which is great since after the past 2 days I was worried that I was going back to how I felt a few months back which would be terrible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also Sunday night I got together with some friends to watch the first PPV for the newly reformed ECW, it was ok but disappointing compared to the old ECW.&amp;nbsp; How their new weekly show ended up on the scifi channel I will never know.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>A slow quiet weekend for me.&amp;nbsp; Friday we rented "Nanny McPhee",&#xD;
cute movie if you are into that sort of thing.&amp;nbsp; Other than that I&#xD;
did a minimal amount of outdoor yard work and helped with the laundry.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
EQ wise I finished lev 35 in Stonebrunt went and got my next 3 levels&#xD;
worth of spells and moved to Gunthak.&amp;nbsp; There I learned the&#xD;
inadvisability of doing anything solo without Lev up.&amp;nbsp; Died in the&#xD;
water trying to get to the zone.&amp;nbsp; Fortunately several GoTT members&#xD;
were there and they pulled my corpse to land and got me a Rez not that&#xD;
the CR would have been that troublesome.&amp;nbsp; Still Thanks guys!&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
Freeder is now halfway through 37 from kiting undead up and down the&#xD;
beach.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I don't know if you've gotten a diagnosis, yet, but it sounds like plantar fasciitis to me.&amp;nbsp; The plantar fascia is a tendon that runs from the heel to the ball of your foot.&amp;nbsp; When that thing gets irritated and swollen, it hurts like a **HALFLING**.&amp;nbsp; The cortisone shots should help it out quite&amp;nbsp;a bit, but the only way to really get rid of it is to rest the foot as much as possible and take NSAIDs like ibuprofen or Aleve.&amp;nbsp; Your doc would probably recommend something stronger like Voltaren or something.&amp;nbsp; It does take a while to get rid of it completely, though.</description>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Comic Sans MS" color=#993300 size=3&gt;Been working on tradeskills on mah Assassin in EQII before the TS nerfage (am ah really the only one who enjoys the full TS aspect? and the only one who sees the reality behind it?)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Comic Sans MS" color=#993300 size=3&gt;Watched 'Seven Samurai' on Sunday, fantastic movie, was sad that the same 'characters' who died in 'Magnificent Seven' died in the original (was really hoping Kikuchiyo survived, and nice to see the 'Brit' character threw his sword after getting shot, just like Brit did in Mag7) and ah hope to get that 2-handed sword Kikuchiyo had in the latest Adventure Pack (and hope mah Assassin will be able to use it)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>This weekend it suddenly got warm in my country. We went from a high of 58F on thursday to 77F on saterday and around 86F sunday, yesterday and today. Yeah this counts as an official heatwave where I am ;) Basically people here dont have AC in their homes, because its never warm for long enough time for it to be worth the money. I know to most of you it sounds wimpy, but it was sooooooo hot! Hehe, so I layed low most of the weekend, barely touching my computer (since without AC my room gets to about 93F during the day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We did go raid the Hole for giggles on saterday, which was a lot of fun! All cramped up in the little hallways with the 17 people that were there. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sunday we celebrated my nephew's second birthday. He got some cool toys, he seemed real happy with the big plastic car I gave him. That day also was my country's first match in the World Cup against Serbia Montenegro, so we all ended up watching together. This year even my brother-in-law, who is originally from Marocco, and his family joined us in watching and cheering them on. They won with 1-0! :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All in all a very relaxed, though really warm weekend!</description>
