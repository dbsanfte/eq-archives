      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Taste of Blood should be a passive ability imo.&amp;nbsp; It's another AA that I've purchased but will never use.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I think our raid utility has improved dramatically.&amp;nbsp; Burst dps is roughly equivalent to rangers and Aura of Spirit is actually noticable during mana intensive events such as stitch.&amp;nbsp; Fero is still useless for the most part.&amp;nbsp; I generally only use it when PL'ing melee toons that have low attack.&amp;nbsp; Would be nice to see a combat effects modifier on it.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I would love to see our mitigation restored, but this issue was commented on during beta and seems very unlikely that they will change this in the near future.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Agree on the taste of blood.&amp;nbsp; Or - it should&amp;nbsp;have a much much more noticable effect if it ever does manage to trigger.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>The fact they put an trigger buff with such obvious stacking issues on our pet should really say that it shouldn't be there. If anything it should be just on the beastlord instead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Or modify the effect entirely.&amp;nbsp; A short group recourse effect on a successful pet kill that acts like a small scale (fairly weak) paragon might make this AA worth using.&amp;nbsp; Melees get a passive AA similar to this (killing spree) so I don't think tagging it directly on the beastlord is the appropriate thing in this case.&amp;nbsp; As far as I'm concerned, they can just remove this AA.&amp;nbsp; I'll never bother using it in it's current state (activated vs passive).&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>"Regarding point 5 on haste. The Shaman spell Talisman of Celerity was&#xD;
upgraded to 60% haste in October but the single cast version (which we&#xD;
share with shaman) was not???"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The shaman haste line was "bleh" because they got single target hastes originally at later levels than enchanters.&amp;nbsp; What shaman got was quickness, alacrity, celerity, etc.&amp;nbsp; Then when shaman were finally given a group haste it was actually less haste than their single target version.&amp;nbsp; "Talisman of alacirty" was actually more like "Group celerity"(50% haste), but at the time shaman could actually cast SLTW(60% haste).&amp;nbsp; After wayyyyyyyyyyyyy too long the spell finally got changed so it was actually a group cast of their best haste spell.&amp;nbsp; *shrugs*&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Either way, our haste issues are annoying and well documented.&amp;nbsp; I still feel that a slight change to the level based duration formula would allow beastlord hastes to be reasonable without penalizing younger end/shm with major mana penalties or anything of that sort.&amp;nbsp; *shrugs*&amp;nbsp; I'll mention it again and see if it goes anywhere.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;So they have actualy created a group SLTW through the backdoor. Probably done this way to avoid further arguement from other hasting classes who didnt get an upgrade. Its a shame they couldnt change the name of spell though. Maybe this time they will look at it in a new light.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I would say it looks like a fix for shamans rather than a nerf to all ther classes. Shamans getting group 60% is how it should have been since inception. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The most commonly agreed BST haste issue is duration, not speed. With 46% haste item and 50% haste spell i reach 96% so the extra 10% doesnt really do much. Chanter haste has a damage modifier though which is worth getting.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Yeah, there's really no argument against increasing the duration on haste.&amp;nbsp; In fact, theres really no argument against most of the stuff i listed.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I know the devs are busy but several of these are trivial, non-controversial fixes :(&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Be patient and 4 years from now they will give us a haste spell that has an appropriate duration. Trouble is, there wont be anyone playing the game by that point. Saryrn population is way down again. People came back, raced to 75 and then left again in droves. TSS group content is just flat out boring and uninspirational, UNLESS, you make a tiny drakkin and build it up through the tasks and quests related to crescent reach. They did a good job on that end of the expansion but the high end grouping content is flat out boring to me. I found PoR and Dodh more interesting really. Maybe its the new items. The itemization is just really poorly thought out. For example, a helm drops in direwind that&amp;nbsp; has 36 AC but lower hps than dodh drops, a belt with 28 ac and low hps and NO foucs effects at all, a face item with 49 AC!!! and low Hps and then we come to the TSS armor items, base armor chest has 45 ac, legs 32 AC, lower than the helm and belt AC in relation to the way AC was typically spread out over items (chest usually had way more AC than a helm or belt slot item) and the HPs are really nothing to get excited about.&amp;nbsp; I know beastlords arent a mitigation class and I do look for hps and focus effects over AC but I still cant get used to lowering my AC to up my HPs by some small amount. I do it but reluctantly.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Weapon drops have worse ratios and lower AC than DoN weapons, EVEN with the recent adjustments. As a non raider, I look to groupable or soloable content to upgrade my gear incrementally with each new expansion. I worked my way through the AO spell are in PoR to&amp;nbsp;get the new pet proc spell and absorbed alot of deaths tanking that named but it was worth it. &amp;nbsp;I look for some new pet focus to get excited about questing or grouping for. So far, I see no reason to get excited about grouping in TSS with my main because he just wont see any meaningful upgrades. I know the itemization guy on this expansion is new, but isnt there any way for him to look at guidelines from previous developers to get a better grasp of what real itemization is? It is very disappointing to realize that there just isnt much besides gimmick familiars and some explore augment to this expansion for a casual player.&amp;nbsp; I cant comment on the raid content because I dont raid,&amp;nbsp;but I do read the forums and I dont see any real talk about the high end raid content in this expansion. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I buy expansion with the hope that I will be able to advance my main with new gear from the expansion. I dont mind working for the gear if it is truly an upgrade but I just dont see any real upgrades for the casual player in this expansion. Sure bazaar geared beastlords will find some but I doubt there are many level 75 bazaar geared beastlords left in the game ( I really hope not) Most&amp;nbsp; have the dodh, PoR and at least DoN gear upgrades. WHERE ARE THE REAL UPGRADES IN THIS EXPANSION MERLOC?&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I didnt think the new itemization guy had that much to do with the original itemization for TSS. He has done some work amending items and is continueing along those lines as far as we have been led to beleive.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I do agree though that the itemization over the last 2 expansions has been poor to mediocre. Maybe I am noticing this more as my guild is starting to catch up on expansions and so gaining better end&amp;nbsp;mob gear and we have passed that point were end mob gear is surpased, or rather not surpassed by new expansion loot.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>Hakaaba for president!&amp;nbsp; I fully agree with about everything there.&amp;nbsp; One of the core problems with our pets though is they take damage like an orc pawn... fixing that might eliminate a lot of the need for mammoth guard changes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;100% agree, feel this will mainly fall on deaf ears though. These are all questions that have been raised on here, on the BL boards, by Tastian, etc,etc, etc. Shame all we ever get is some vague suggestion that they are looking at it only for it to be forgotten or overtaken by new expansions etc. We are a class that is failing to advance (alongside other classes that are also being neglected) at the rate to keep up with where we should be.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;Regarding point 5 on haste. The Shaman spell Talisman of Celerity was upgraded to 60% haste in October but the single cast version (which we share with shaman) was not???</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I fully agree here, though stacking Spellbreaker and Mammoth might be a tad too powerful.&amp;nbsp; In any case, if we get Mammoth Hide added (to all pet classes), then Spellbreaker should also be added to all pet classes.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Of this list, the cure and the mitigation issues are the largest for me.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
