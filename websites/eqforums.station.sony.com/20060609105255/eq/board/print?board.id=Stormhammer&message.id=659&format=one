				<DIV>first off, I don't play on stormhammer, I sort of wish I did, but the fact that I play two accounts just doesn't make it economically feasible.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The rewards for GM Events have always been really nice, in general.&nbsp; However, (even on the nonpremium servers) a better system could be devised.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>In fact, the framework is already in the game, thanks to LDON.&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>For stormhammer, an "event points" pool could be created, where by attending, players are given points to spend on gear they choose.&nbsp; Special rewards could still be awarded for people who would normally earn them, though everyone who attends would be assigned a number of points.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>All this would take would be a little work on the GM Client to allow a command to assign the points.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Thoughts?</DIV>
