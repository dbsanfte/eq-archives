    <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I'd like to see extensions to some popular old series quests like Coldain Insignia Rings, prayers shawls, Qeynos badges and such. That'd be fun, I think.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;I think one of our biggest issues atm is our Dire Charm spell.  It is practically useless in all the last two-three expansions.  We either need an upgrade to the Dire Charm spell or increase its level of effectiveness.  What is the use of having a spell if its not going to work.  I think that once u hit level 70 you should be allowed to DC mobs at least up to level 60. &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I returned to EQ after being gone for a year.  I can tell you,that my playgroup loves many of the new zones and tasks.  We were able to level to 70, and are working on the GM tradeskills so we can have better gear.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We camped all of the runes for our 66-68 spells, but find it very difficult (as a small guild with only 10 members) to get the 69 + 70 runes.   We would love to see an alternate quest to get our spells.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;(Please don't post that we should join a bigger guild, or get our raiding friends to help us) &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our playstyle is not casual. We play every night.&lt;/strong&gt;   We just prefer the single group content.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We wouldn't mind a  DIFFICULT and LONG quest to get them. We would just like an &lt;em&gt;alternate&lt;/em&gt; single group path ..(since spells are required to actually do our job)&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Will we ever get an update to the quest top 10?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think we are at a stage that the list should either be abandoned completely or get a major revamp&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Just want to second the suggestion of quest series in which faction matters, but unlike the DoN system in which both sides have mirrored rewards, having asymetrical rewards and thus meaningful choices.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I would love a quest that allows us to learn a new language (that Luclin language would be cool to learn for example). I would also like it if there were cool things to do with languages other than annoy other players by saying things they can't understand.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I like the new quest window that logs when you completed one of the 'one-time-only' quests. As a constant quester I think it would be great if Tasks (SIngle or Shared) were also recorded , as well as how many times you attempted and completed it.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;All the quest windows we seem to have now need to be amaligimated. The Task/Quest window, the Journal window and the Adventure Window all serve a similair sort of purpose.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If all the old repeatable quests could be made into the new style quests (I know this would be a colossal task!) then we would not need the Journal Window.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If Tasks/Quests were recorded in the same (much more cooler leader-board style) way as the Adventure Window then they could sort of be added together too...&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;It would just be nice to see things a bit more integrated, as it is in EQ2.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;EQ2 treated quest items in a different way - in that they didn't take up any inventory space - but I don't think i would like that. I like being able to pick things up and look at them :P But seeings as quest items are often little things - perhaps a sort of purse or satchel would be cool for just holding quest items?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;oh - another thing : I like the Tribute Masters alot and am always handing the lassie in Surefall Glade lots of stuff. But it has always bugged me that I get no faction when I hand stuff in. I know you are rewarded in terms of buffs, but you know, you would think the locals would be happy about all this stuff you bring them. I mean - I have a career total of 40k ish, but not a single faction increase? Ungrateful lot :P&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Also, when I complete a new quest I never seem to get faction from the quest giver. Most of the old style repeatable quests you used to get faction from the quest givers after completion - usually just his local faction(s). But the new quests never seem to give out faction. I did the trade skill quests in North Qeynos - you would think they would be happy I was keeping their sea lanes clear! But I didn't even get a faction increase from the 'Merchants of Qeynos'... its just not joined up thinking if you ask me :P&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Rostov on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;10-06-2005&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;03:03 PM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

      <description>Adding more armor progression quests from 20-50 like the ones we already have after you get out of the tutorial. Maybe you could replace or update the current low mid range (what level are they now anyway) class quests we have now, anyone remember crafted armor, as well as add more for higher up. This was sorta brought up in the summit but maybe you can put it into the number 2 spot since we have no consensus here (I think we had a good consensus there).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think more quests that go into the task system would be awesome, id love to see moving/adding more quest into the task system. At least as a replacement for having to use the journal or notes for simple stuff like what was it that guy said again.</description>

I think it's better to wing the people off of the armor progression quests about at 20 or so because that's about the time in which they can actually start getting their own upgrades  as well as gain money reasonably fast enough to start buying or making better armor.  Having these quests go all the way to lvl 50 would be more harmful than helpful.  People would start getting to 50 and hit a brick wall when it comes to how to upgrade their character.  Post 50 the upgrades are more sensitive to how well you preform than they are from 20-50.  I'd rather have 20 or 30 levels to spend actually learning how to best to choose what is a good upgrade when making bad choices isn't going to be nearly as costly as it will no be if you don't have to start learning until you're over lvl 50 when many armor upgrades cost more than most level 50-60 players can make in a week while playing normally.&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;I much prefer being given quests to do rather than having to go to the bazaar. They could make them all require groups to complete the quests. They could be equivalent to or even slightly less/more than the cultural quest armors are for those levels, maybe even different stats, like focusing more on WIS for shamans. Many of the trade skill armors are fillers, not really meant for using as a complete set, especially if you want to focus on a certain stat. This give more alternate paths to getting armors. The point about grouping, learning how to upgrade your character, and costs can still be found. I didn't use every piece I got from the 10-20 armor quests.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;hr&gt;The main thing I have against the task window is that eliminates completely the need to solve anything.  The task quests are simply presolved quests with ingame walk throughs.  There is nothing at all to figure out.  Tasks are tasks not quests.  In case someone doesn't understand what I mean, tasks are a list of things that someone told you what exactly to do and you go do them.  But a quest is something that you get asked to go do, but you have to figure out some of what needs to be done yourself, yes you're told some things directly but other things you have to think out yourself or solve a riddle or make a jump of faith based on a subtle hint in the text.  The best quests have always been the ones which the community had to help each other to solve each step.  So unless they include something that requires players to figure something particular out at a variety of steps anything moved or added to the task system will not be a quest but a task. &lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;They don't necessarily have to go into the details they do for many of the armor tasks and the money tasks. They could merely just record the quest text you get while doing/getting the quest. If your suggesting a different method and window, sure, id go for that too. I don't want hand holding in doing the quests, I just want a record of the quests. Would also great to be able to look up past tests i've completed.</description>

I think it's better to wing the people off of the armor progression quests about at 20 or so because that's about the time in which they can actually start getting their own upgrades as well as gain money reasonably fast enough to start buying or making better armor. Having these quests go all the way to lvl 50 would be more harmful than helpful. People would start getting to 50 and hit a brick wall when it comes to how to upgrade their character. Post 50 the upgrades are more sensitive to how well you preform than they are from 20-50. I'd rather have 20 or 30 levels to spend actually learning how to best to choose what is a good upgrade when making bad choices isn't going to be nearly as costly as it will no be if you don't have to start learning until you're over lvl 50 when many armor upgrades cost more than most level 50-60 players can make in a week while playing normally. &#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;I much prefer being given quests to do rather than having to go to the bazaar. They could make them all require groups to complete the quests. They could be equivalent to or even slightly less/more than the cultural quest armors are for those levels, maybe even different stats, like focusing more on WIS for shamans. Many of the trade skill armors are fillers, not really meant for using as a complete set, especially if you want to focus on a certain stat. This give more alternate paths to getting armors. The point about grouping, learning how to upgrade your character, and costs can still be found. I didn't use every piece I got from the 10-20 armor quests. &#xD;

They don't necessarily have to go into the details they do for many of the armor tasks and the money tasks. They could merely just record the quest text you get while doing/getting the quest. If your suggesting a different method and window, sure, id go for that too. I don't want hand holding in doing the quests, I just want a record of the quests. Would also great to be able to look up past tests i've completed.&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;They have that it's called the NPC Journal window, not that anyone really uses it.&amp;nbsp; Lots of people claim it causes more lag when activated, and that it also logs tons of stuff that is useless too (which it does).&amp;nbsp; The way that the Task windows work is they tell you what to do next after you do the last thing.&amp;nbsp; So if anything your suggestion of a new window for quests would be the best way to go.&amp;nbsp; The best way would be for it to work as a mixture of the NPC journal window and the task window.&amp;nbsp; Have it automatically group the texts that are for certain quests into a grouping instead of having to flag them ourselves as such.&amp;nbsp; It'd be nice if they had the texts from different npc's go into the correct order.&amp;nbsp; Like if was doing a quest and you've done part that is at the beginning and then another part that is towards the middle, it would have the texts you got from the first npc's then ??? for the ones you haven't talked to till it comes to the NPCs in the middle that you talked to, then ??? for the ones after that again.&amp;nbsp; The most important thing in my mind to make them actually quests instead of just tasks would be the fact that they would only update when you get the next set of text from one of the quest NPCs, instead of when you loot quest item_002 off of mob_8347.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;hr&gt;Requiring groups isn't going to make any difference.  It's not a matter of using the bazaar.  In truth there are already quests out there between lvls 21-50 that give armor pieces.  What I'm saying is that by lvl 20 you need to start learning how you get gear normally.  There isn't any need to have NPCs standing around in PoK or where ever handing out tasks, even group tasks, for lvls 21-50 to get their next set of armor from.  Sorry but people are not going to bother learning anything about how to choose what armor is best for them if there's a new set of quests every 5-10 lvls to gear them up.  They will just do the PoK ones and use those till the next set comes along or they run out of tasks they can do to get the gear.  There is no lack of paths for gear between levels 20-50 like there had become for lvls 1-20 (mostly from the rise of rec/req lvls on armor).  What this is asking for is to just make the progression from 20-50 more mindless than it already is.&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The NPCs for these should definitely _not_ be in PoK. In fact id rather the task givers in POK now were removed and each starting city given the full range of armor quest instead. (If they don't already, cabilis doesn't, but there are alternate armor quest in Ak'anon for the same visible pieces at least.) The whole experience of leaving the tutorial only to end up in POK sucks imo. What's the point of having a starting city again? All those newbie quests wasted. However, I sorta disagree that there are many armor quests in the 21-50 in line with the current progression, especially when you consider iksar warriors who cannot wear most of the plate armor given in those quests. There are quests dont get me wrong, but many are not even close to what you get from the pok quests. The original class quest armors (crafted etc) are good (id maybe retune them a little stat wise to fit with the stat increase in newbie armor and redo the quests), they fill 20-35 slot or at least are suppose to. From 35-50 you have The Twilight Sea quests. What im really suggesting is adding another 1 or 2 alternate paths for these types of class or even race armor sets and tuning them up a little to be at least in line with current progression. There still ample opportunity for a new player to learn to choose armor. I can understand not wanting to give players a free ride through 1-50, but I don't think that’s what would happen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then again maybe you have other armor quest in mind?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;hr&gt;They have that it's called the NPC Journal window, not that anyone really uses it.  Lots of people claim it causes more lag when activated, and that it also logs tons of stuff that is useless too (which it does).  The way that the Task windows work is they tell you what to do next after you do the last thing.  So if anything your suggestion of a new window for quests would be the best way to go.  The best way would be for it to work as a mixture of the NPC journal window and the task window.  Have it automatically group the texts that are for certain quests into a grouping instead of having to flag them ourselves as such.  It'd be nice if they had the texts from different npc's go into the correct order.  Like if was doing a quest and you've done part that is at the beginning and then another part that is towards the middle, it would have the texts you got from the first npc's then ??? for the ones you haven't talked to till it comes to the NPCs in the middle that you talked to, then ??? for the ones after that again.  The most important thing in my mind to make them actually quests instead of just tasks would be the fact that they would only update when you get the next set of text from one of the quest NPCs, instead of when you loot quest item_002 off of mob_8347.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They could also do something to improve the NPC journal by changing it so that the NPCs that give quests are flagged as that, and get listed in like a quest npc listing when you talk to them.  Would save loads of time having to wade thru the death messages of the trash mobs you kill that just have flavor text on them.  Speaking of which a filter to remove the text that is just flavor text from the NPC journal would be very nice.&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Totally agree. If they redid the journal window the way you flesh out it'd be exactly what im asking for. Oh and I agree with the filter stuff too, they need to add more filters. I'd love it if I could filter my taunt failures.</description>

      <description>Long involved quests with raids needed get progressively harder to complete as expansions get older. The two biggest ones i can think of are : Breakdown in Communications and Aid Grimel tradeskill quest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Breakdown: -- Grand summoner ring (used to be part of progression but now  a standalone target and basicly not raided)&lt;br&gt;           -- Inktu'ta/Txevu are basicly only raided for flagging purposes. The BiC droprate is abysmal compared to the risk/reward issue. Increased droprate/alternative access/drops (maybe rare drop off the Key Tacvi bosses would solve issues)&lt;br&gt;           -- The qinimi group event requires 6 people (u NEED a full group) In current progression this event can be done with less but you still need 6 people IN ZONE to start the event- This can be very annoying as the event is quite easy to beat and quite short. It is rather an inconvenience to drag off a full group&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aid Grimel -- Flagging requirements: With Time being able to be flagged within time thru phase 3 there is less and less need for backflagging the whole pop progression. The same effect on a lower level is achieved with the alternative access quests, Kill God for backflag and level restricted or flagged zones. Basicly the quest looks like dieing out due to flagging which you can;t possibly do with hardly any guilds fully backflagging/flagging. (Maybe tie flags to acces to zone so alternative access quests/entrance flag will automaticly grand you the needed flag for Aid Grimel and/or Time flag flagging you for all phases of aid grimel)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are other long involved quests out there but i don;t know which ones of these fall in the same category and might need some tweaking to keep the quests viable/alive</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;On the item #2, increase level difference for LDoNs, it has made grouping easier, but if you have a group that spans the levels, the higher levels get very little XP. I now&amp;nbsp;will politely decline&amp;nbsp;to go on an LDoN with people more than 7 levels below me, unless it is a close friends alt,&amp;nbsp;and at 55 if i am the low man in the LDoN i let the high person&amp;nbsp;know he most likely will not get much XP. &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
