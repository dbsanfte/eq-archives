<DIV></DIV>I think that charm augs are purposely confined to group/solo quests, in order to "promote" various things, such as questing, grouping, and exploring new expansions. I think this is a pretty decent model, and have no issue with a few specific slots being confined to specific types of play. As a matter of fact, I wouldn't mind seeing charms placed back in group content rather than raid, for this same reason. As for the two raid augs that DO fit in charms &lt;shrug&gt; typo?<BR>

<P>I can't really begin to express how much I agree with this person.</P>
<P>The charm slot has been so bastardized from its original purpose already (the PoP charm was a travesty) and it's sickening to see it slide downhill farther with the raid-dropped charms. The very original charm concept that was shown was a charm&nbsp;whose stats were affected by how much cloth armor you wore. The LoY charms (where the slot was introduced) held decently to the principle of non-constant stats that were awarded based on some gimmick. The PoP charm gave constant stats based on how much raiding you did, and ruined the charm slot for probably 2 or 3 years. DoD did a fairly nice job of presenting some neat charms (like the random stats one from Undershore) but unfortunately also introduced powerful raider charms.</P>
<P>The augment slot in the charms was filled at first with the LDoN augment, then later with the Slipgear's Gem and the new Wanderlust augment. The Slipgear and Wanderlust augments provide an easy-out for people too lazy to spend months in Lost Dungeons, but also yield worse maximum stats, which is fine. Allowing a greater shortcut via raid-dropped augments (essentially hand-feeding the sheep herds even more heavily) should be avoided. Let them graze for some things like the rest of us.</P>

<P>Edit: Uhh, this came out harsher than intended. I just don't believe charm augments should be a raider thing; they should be for everybody, and something we can relate on, to help us associate more strongly with one another, rather than broadening the gap between non-raiders and raiders.</P><p>Message Edited by Enokhaon-Innoruuk on <span class=date_text>12-11-2006</span> <span class=time_text>08:44 PM</span>
