    <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;hr&gt;Tweeeak wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Your next point claims that I am undergeared for the content that im attempting when compared to my example 14-17k tank. Without any buffs im sitting on around 5k of hp and 6.5k of mana. While this may not be up to some's standards, its not too bad for someone without a guild. My point was this: even after gaining some items and new more efficent spells... mana is still a problem for druids.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I didnt offer to fix this problem by simply increasing our mana regen. The problem lies in the fact that our spells are too inefficent, not matter what gear level etc... i shouldnt need a 10k mana pool to keep up a 17k tank...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;You missed the point. The mobs are hitting for 2k, you are undergeared for them. Having a 17k tank makes healing easier for you and reduce your gear requirement but not to the degree that you are looking for.&lt;br&gt;Yes you have ok gear for someone who isn't guilded but you can do better while still remaining unguilded. No you don't need 10k mana to heal any tank. You need to have a mana pool and the mana regen for the areas you are fighting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You say you leveled in PoStorms for a bit. If there was no level requirement to zone in there could a level 25 druid solo effectively there? Why not? Are their spells and mana regen not able for it? Why is that? Can a 50 odd druid solo there?&lt;br&gt;Can a 7k tank tank Riftseekers? Why not? Can a 10k with good AC tank tank there?&lt;br&gt;Can a 70 druid with 12 worn mana regen heal 2k hitters? Could a druid with with max mana regen and +60% equipment mods to healing,&amp;nbsp; another 20-35% (I can't remember the current %) AA mod to healing and 20% mana preservation do better then that other druid?&lt;br&gt;Is that the difference in efficiency you were looking for?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Btw just curious what 2k hitting mobs were you fighting?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Well as a mage I am wondering why you made the pet toys/armor for TSS not a vendor item.&amp;nbsp; Its stinks, so now you force me to grind and grind and grind trying for the spells.&amp;nbsp; Please grinding is not fun.&amp;nbsp; You offer a way to make the pets more durable for higher end zones, and we thank you.&amp;nbsp; But why did you turn around and send us into a grinding hell.&amp;nbsp; I have spent every day since TSS launched trying for my spells and nothing.&amp;nbsp; I have druid, Ber, Bard, Necro, and cleric so far but no Mage.&amp;nbsp; And the one area which is supposed to drop them is camped 24/7.&amp;nbsp; If you did not want to put them on vendors then why not a rune based system atleast when a spell does drop it means I could get something I need.&amp;nbsp; JUst a thought, or increase the spell drops for mage pet spells.&amp;nbsp; Guilds are holding camps 24/7 trying to get spells for all mages and even alts.&amp;nbsp; Come on Dev's fix this please, or take a look at it.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Thanks&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;Howdy,&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I play a ranger mostly, he's my main and I can't get enough of the guy.&amp;nbsp; Personally I'd like to see a change in the double damage cap when a mob is moving or rooted.&amp;nbsp; Removing the double damage will make it easier for&amp;nbsp;rangers to solo, of course most mobs will summon however it would make it more interesting when I have my LFG sign up and I'm waiting around.&amp;nbsp; I feel that we're a weaker soloing class compared to other Hybrids and especially casters.&amp;nbsp; When I see a necro soloing level 65+ mobs in mere minutes it makes me sick to my stomach when it takes me 10 to arrow him down.&amp;nbsp; Or even a Beastlord and his pet can tank the WoS trash mobs with ease... again I need pepto for the situation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Maybe a decrease in the penalty would sufice, say 25, 50 or 75% less damage on a moving; rooted mob would be nice, however I understand if it's not possible.&amp;nbsp; Rangers do get some nice abilities,&amp;nbsp;and I can't complain all day long on each class yet I'd like to see Rangers get a boost in soloing.&amp;nbsp; The whole DD and Healing spells sounds nice in theory but 80% of the time I have my LFG up and after hours of sitting in PoK or Guild Hall awaiting a /tell, I give up and log off.&amp;nbsp; I solo a lot as you can see and I kite multiple mobs just arrowing them up all day long in HoH or PoV -- even other zones, those are just the main ones that have a low population and a wide open space.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;An increase in healing and DD won't get me a group any quicker, but helping me solo would make it that much more interesting while I'm looking for a group.&amp;nbsp; The changes can have a good outcome, just listen to the people and their input -- we need changes but not drastic ones.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Tegeran</description>

      <description>Since when does class balancing mean that all classes can solo the same? My mage solos ok, my chanty kinda sucks and my cleric is bog-awful (yes I know you can, but it's a PITA compared to proper solo classes). However, my mage is handy in a group, my chanty is **SMURF** useful and my cleric vital, so to me they are balanced. I must admit I haven't played a Ranger since 2000 (when they truely sucked - archery was awful), but from a group perspective they seem to offer amazing DPS, so surely they shouldn't be that uber at soloing as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please can we keep some differences between the classes? &lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;it's funny that every time someone complains about their class, the first thing they bring up is DPS... omg, cleric_03 cant nuke except for undead mobs, and of course, they cant slow them or snare them so they die trying to get a heal off and not able to solo much... druid_with_CH_chain has dots but shaman and necro dots do more, and even though they get a 14 minute and an ae snare, they should have their dps boosted to solo better and do more damage on raids... paladin_insert_rant_here doesnt have the hp, ac, or dps of a warrior, even though they have hp and ac buffs, and heals, and can waste undead mobs without thinking about it...&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;honestly, if you want dps, play a wizard, mage, necro, bezerker, rogue, monk (if you dont want range dps) or ranger (kings of range dps). if you like to be a highly needed support class and get groups all the time, roll a warrior, (or even a knight these days), a cleric, a druid, or enchanter/shaman... if you want to solo, roll a necro (or buy another account, and box a shaman and melee class together)...&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;yeah each class has their drawbacks (mages have wanted snare or root for how long??? and if its not overpowering for a 20k nuking wizzy, or a 1200dps stacked dot necro with pet, how can it affect a DD only mage with pets that are just slightly better than necro pets with significantly less dps than nec or wiz?) but each class has their strengths and advantages to suit each persons play style... i like soloing and not having to group with potential ninja looters, people that cant assist, control agro, or people that roll as a plate class, on my silk items and spells that drop because they can sell them or use on an alt... i found what i liked and stuck with it, thru the thick and thin (necros used to not even be needed on raids back in the day, pre-PoP expansion because we had minimal dps, and only were needed for mana feeds and to FD and rez a cleric on wipes). &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;so post and complain constructively about improvements to your class (heck, they fixed a friking ton of stuff for necros in the last 24 hours before TSS went live, due to the vocalness of the necro community about how bad they were screwing us, with examples cited) but dont cry about how you want your whole class redone because x class does more dmg than you. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;We have shamans in my guild that are the tank for epic 2.0 fights, mobs doubling or quadding for 2k's... shamans have slow, which is a huge boon to any fight, be it solo, group, or raid... their dots DO contribute to DPS but if you gave them uber dps like a dps class, then you have to penalize them somewhere else to maintain class balance (as a whole, not just dps) and i think every shaman would scream bloody murder if you lost heals, or cannibalize, or root, or a line of hp buffs, etc... and i see more shamans screaming about how much they die after they slow a mob, and you want more dps so you can get more agro? &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;no class is perfect (heck, necro is closest thing to it, and we still have to feed mana to other classes, dont have a viable resist debuff, and with buff slot limits coupled with high resist/immunity, our gruop recourse spells for ac, atk, etc are useless) but we have our strengths... play your class to its strengths or roll a new toon that fits your play style. if anyone can complain atm, i think its enchanters with the new expansion...i'd hate to not be needed for mana regen, crowd control is farmed out or negated with good pullers or necros mezzing (if they did indeed fix mez/charm/all-or-nothing resists this patch), and they have crap for dps, and shamans can buff/backup heal/slow so why get a chanter? they still have place on raids, but thats about it as far as i can see (/tosses the poor chanters a bone).&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>I completely disagree with the above post. I have played a shammy to 70&#xD;
and all I can say is WOW. I am almost always full mana, and I am&#xD;
usually both slower and main healer for my group. I throw a couple of&#xD;
dots out on each mob and still only use 30% of my mana. One canni takes&#xD;
me back to almost full. &lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
I can find a group almost anywhere I go. I am constantly asked to&#xD;
join/switch guilds because we have the best buffs, the best slow and a&#xD;
pretty good heal. &lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
To anyone who read the above post, don't hesitate to roll a shaman. I can promise you wont regret it. &lt;br&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;I totally agree with Era001, I have played a Shaman since 1999 and have watched the class become the red-headed step child of SOE. Our pets are a joke most will last just long enough for you get get off a gate if you happen to be soloing, they have the HP's of a Everfrost Skellie. Shaman heals are another joke, the cast time is long and the healing power low, useless. I remember when a shaman was the only class that could solo Lozdial and how powerful it felt when you did it yourself today anyother pet class can out solo a shaman on this mob. Most of our DoT's are a joke because they take so many cast just to kill a mob and if you are not using VP the mob will break root every 10 seconds. Just last night I had to be the healer in a 69.1 instanced and had one hell of a time keep enough mana to constantly heal the tank. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Compared to other classes the Shaman would be the last one I would choose the make if I started a new toon, just not worth the time and effort, easier to create a Necro and just solo away.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>I don't really see what shamans have to complain about this time around.&amp;nbsp; Your DPS just got a major kick in the pants with Talisman of the Panther and Sting of the Queen, healing is always useful, you got a great upgrade to your Malos line, and slow is still very much in demand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It looks like a good expansion for shamans, if you ask me.&amp;nbsp; Which no one did, but I asked some other shamans earlier. ;P&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>For long time, i have seen how SoE has hated shammies.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
I started to play shaman at year 2002, been off and on with playing, so truly not hard end-player.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
This is kinda open letter for SoE (and not against any other class in game, so please, give it a rest):&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
Thank you for killing Shaman out of game - finally.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
It took you many years, but well, nothing easy, and in the end the succeeding waits.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
for being Shaman in this game it has no value anymore. none. zero.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
Hybrids, other classes, has runned over totally.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
Only thing left is solo where you can, if you can.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
And lemme say: without snare, FD and such, with root's what breaks every 10secs, you can think it's pretty darn hard.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
To be honest, in these new zones - impossible.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
Old world rules, yeah, but that's all. and nothing much new in&amp;nbsp; there..&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
Mobs hits hard, heal-casting-times way too long to keep pet alive,&#xD;
cannot go melee 'cause mobs hits you death in secs because interrupting&#xD;
heals, heals what surely ain't so good what everybody says.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
Once upon a time, there was place in EverQuest for Shaman - Nowadays&#xD;
need to Quest for that place, what usually hides itself pretty well.&#xD;
/sarcasm off&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
DoT's takes long time to make even somekinda effect, and to shamans: nicely nerfed compared to other classes DPS.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
DD's sucks - always have, always will.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
Healing? oh, don't get me started. Shaman's ain't no healing class.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
Buffs? only thing what is needed from shamans, every 1 and half hour or&#xD;
so. Tho, with these new fun stuff, items, there's no need for buffs&#xD;
either! when Stats are maxed, well, they are maxed, only need is hp.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
DPS? well, to think. I just looked the logs. Kill a mob nowadays in&#xD;
group took like about 40-50 seconds or less. first to slow, (mob is on&#xD;
90%, other melee going in) then put Leopard (or higher if has) to&#xD;
main-melee (mob is on 70%) and own pet, other melee's (mob in 30%)..&#xD;
there's no time left to DoT or DD. that's only DPS what shaman can&#xD;
bring to group. On Solo? killings takes long&amp;nbsp; time, o yea, there's time&#xD;
to DoT, between selfhealing, because pet cannot hold aggro or be enough&#xD;
strong to take those nowadays hits from mobs. Shaman aggro is Great!&#xD;
just Slow and sit - have to start to look who can keep aggro on&amp;nbsp; that&#xD;
without mob running to shaman. there's no place&amp;nbsp; to med up. that's why&#xD;
there been Canni. no need to sit to regain mana, and aggro is&#xD;
controlled to main-melee.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
Manaregen? there was reason, yap, for having Canni to Shamans. To get&#xD;
to even somewhat near same dps as wizards etc. Even tho, like i many&#xD;
times noticed: with soloing it was really complex thing to have Canni V&#xD;
done during battle, because mobs are attacking shamans 'cause pet&#xD;
cannot hold aggro. Easy death that way. With this new&#xD;
mana-regen-system, wizards DPS is awesome. Just Nuke and sit - Sit and&#xD;
Nuke. no need to use mana to others buffing or anything. well, can, if&#xD;
wants to, but there's surely no need. and while someone pulls mobs -&#xD;
there's that enough time to med all used mana + more, and be ready to&#xD;
next blast-off.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
With this new expansion, shaman's finally lost their place in anykinda of DPS.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
Caster's and all regains mana faster than shaman can during battle, if shaman is slowing.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
Cannot keep up. period.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
Tho, what's to keep up? Not good DD's or DoT's, there's no other use&#xD;
than that slowing and proc-spell. DPS sucks on every way compared to&#xD;
any other class, even to dr00ds! /shame /sarcasm off&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
There was nothing&amp;nbsp; to shamans, except making BeastLords even better&#xD;
position way over shamans for group - for dps and slow's and all other&#xD;
nice, but useful, group-heal-mana-regen-buffs etc.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
Shaman is now only solo-character. And not even good in that anymore.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
Well, maybe if you buy TSS, you are high-end-player, got all those nice&#xD;
clickies, you in über guild, etc, things can be and Are different, but&#xD;
otherwise - keep dreaming having spot in this game. Tho, looking the&#xD;
spell-list of TSS, am not suprised&amp;nbsp; that there isn't anything useful&#xD;
for Grouping nor much to soloing either (wasn't able to find snare nor&#xD;
fd from spell list) - just same old stuff, only with very tiny bit&#xD;
bigger/harder stats. Not even harder Slow!&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
No wonder i get from other players saying "why to take to group shaman, let's take beastlord or enc..". Oh well..&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
To new players: DO NOT MAKE SHAMANS - MAKE BEASTLORDS INSTEAD. or wizzies for dps. trust me.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
SoE has hated shamans now like 2-3 years. all the time nerfing and&#xD;
making other characters more powerful and more useful for groups,&#xD;
compared to shamans.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
as one writer on this topic said wisely: once upon a time, all characters had their places in this game and in groups.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
With all these new expansions, new characters, Items, AA's etc. - that&#xD;
has gone. So you can almost select what ever you like to your group -&#xD;
and there is huge amount of classes, what can now do shaman's job as&#xD;
well - even better!&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
Idea for SoE: why don't you finally kill shaman all the way - Don't&#xD;
make us suffer for our stupidious selection of character years ago -&#xD;
Just send Note to all Shaman's and transfer shamans to BeastLords for&#xD;
example. and Delete Shaman-characters, that nobody cannot create them&#xD;
anymore. Isn't that way, you have wanted for years... or then give&#xD;
shamans something darn useful, what you have given from shamans to&#xD;
others (like uber slowing): give to all races of shamans snare and FD..&#xD;
then we start to think, that there is still spot for shamans and you&#xD;
still like us even nerfing our power compared to others.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
Alas, to see how you think, will be "wipe the darn shamans away"... that prolly will happen =) &lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
But don't make us suffer for our stupid idea for choice of character to play.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
You're in Our world now!&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
that's my 5 copper&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

Shaman's ain't no healing class.&lt;BR&gt;Buffs? only thing what is needed from shamans, every 1 and half hour or so. Tho, with these new fun stuff, items, there's no need for buffs either! when Stats are maxed, well, they are maxed, only need is hp.&lt;BR&gt;DPS? well, to think. I just looked the logs. Kill a mob nowadays in group took like about 40-50 seconds or less. first to slow, (mob is on 90%, other melee going in) then put Leopard (or higher if has) to main-melee (mob is on 70%) and own pet, other melee's (mob in 30%).. there's no time left to DoT or DD. that's only DPS what shaman can bring to group. On Solo? killings takes long&amp;nbsp; time, o yea, there's time to DoT, between selfhealing, because pet cannot hold aggro or be enough strong to take those nowadays hits from mobs. Shaman aggro is Great! just Slow and sit - have to start to look who can keep aggro on&amp;nbsp; that without mob running to shaman. there's no place&amp;nbsp; to med up. that's why there been Canni. no need to sit to regain mana, and aggro is controlled to main-melee.&lt;BR&gt;Manaregen? there was reason, yap, for having Canni to Shamans. To get to even somewhat near same dps as wizards etc. Even tho, like i many times noticed: with soloing it was really complex thing to have Canni V done during battle, because mobs are attacking shamans 'cause pet cannot hold aggro. Easy death that way. With this new mana-regen-system, wizards DPS is awesome. Just Nuke and sit - Sit and Nuke. no need to use mana to others buffing or anything. well, can, if wants to, but there's surely no need. and while someone pulls mobs - there's that enough time to med all used mana + more, and be ready to next blast-off.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;With this new expansion, shaman's finally lost their place in anykinda of DPS.&lt;BR&gt;Caster's and all regains mana faster than shaman can during battle, if shaman is slowing.&lt;BR&gt;Cannot keep up. period.&lt;BR&gt;Tho, what's to keep up? Not good DD's or DoT's, there's no other use than that slowing and proc-spell. DPS sucks on every way compared to any other class, even to dr00ds! /shame /sarcasm off&lt;BR&gt;There was nothing&amp;nbsp; to shamans, except making BeastLords even better position way over shamans for group - for dps and slow's and all other nice, but useful, group-heal-mana-regen-buffs etc.&lt;BR&gt;Shaman is now only solo-character. And not even good in that anymore.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Well, maybe if you buy TSS, you are high-end-player, got all those nice clickies, you in über guild, etc, things can be and Are different, but otherwise - keep dreaming having spot in this game. Tho, looking the spell-list of TSS, am not suprised&amp;nbsp; that there isn't anything useful for Grouping nor much to soloing either (wasn't able to find snare nor fd from spell list) - just same old stuff, only with very tiny bit bigger/harder stats. Not even harder Slow!&lt;BR&gt;No wonder i get from other players saying "why to take to group shaman, let's take beastlord or enc..". Oh well..&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;To new players: DO NOT MAKE SHAMANS - MAKE BEASTLORDS INSTEAD. or wizzies for dps. trust me.&lt;BR&gt;SoE has hated shamans now like 2-3 years. all the time nerfing and making other characters more powerful and more useful for groups, compared to shamans.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;as one writer on this topic said wisely: once upon a time, all characters had their places in this game and in groups.&lt;BR&gt;With all these new expansions, new characters, Items, AA's etc. - that has gone. So you can almost select what ever you like to your group - and there is huge amount of classes, what can now do shaman's job as well - even better!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Idea for SoE: why don't you finally kill shaman all the way - Don't make us suffer for our stupidious selection of character years ago - Just send Note to all Shaman's and transfer shamans to BeastLords for example. and Delete Shaman-characters, that nobody cannot create them anymore.

&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Have you completely lost your mind?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Shamans are one of&amp;nbsp; the MOST desireable classes to have on raids. AND in groups&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I seriously don't think you have played&amp;nbsp; your shaman charactor for more than 20mins in a long long time.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I have a lvl 75 Shaman bot that I built&amp;nbsp; the same time i Built my Main (monk)&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I Solo'd the shaman to 60 for the hell of it then decided I wanted to play a Melee instead as I liked hitting things..still kept the shaman going finally trans'd him to another account after Luclin came out so I could have a healer.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;My shaman Healed my Monk Thru ...WoS -PG-RiftSeekers u name it ..&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Shamans are awesome , not only can they keep entire group of melee's alive on AE intensive raids Via Cures , Group Hots and&amp;nbsp; Single Heals /HoTs&amp;nbsp; but they can make that group's DPS increase significantly with Panther line of spells coupled with Champion.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;If you simply don't want to heal or can't pay enough attention to the game&amp;nbsp; to preform that roll effectively in groups ,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; A shaman can&amp;nbsp; replace an Enchanter for many groups&amp;nbsp; with&amp;nbsp; Root Knockback AA and root parking in general. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I really don't think you have played the class enough to comment on them. If anything shamans are pretty overpowered in comparison to&amp;nbsp; Druids in particular.&amp;nbsp; Although druids are great too , people are too busy whineing about&amp;nbsp; being druids so they don't play and we don't have any for raids&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;(and yea they&amp;nbsp; are&amp;nbsp; in high demand on raids too) &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Druids complaining about group content i can kinda understand although I always liked having a druid as snare is king in most exp content and bstlord snare sucks (as does their dps)&amp;nbsp; Berserkers are so rare i don't see how they are even factored in ....Necro Snare dots the mob and has a fairly short duration&amp;nbsp; and is resisted more often than Druid snare which causes problems&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Inorder to Use SK snare you would need to have an SK tank in the firstplace ... and geared Sk's with enough brains to tank aren't exactly common either outside of your guild.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;And druids are awesome on raids ....BECAUSE CLERIC CH is awesome.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;we got 6 clerics on Anguish raid ....generally 5 are in CH rot and 1 is on spam heals /vei /hot&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;who heals/cures &amp;nbsp;the groups (+the clerics) &amp;nbsp;?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Shamans and Druids&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;druids need to stop whineing&amp;nbsp; , join a raid guild and feel the love.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;I lead raids for my guild at the moment (just got into Demi) and shamans are huge on raids, utterly indispensable, cant get enough.&amp;nbsp; Guild asked me recently what class I would like more of... Shammies plz! Gimme more shammies!&amp;nbsp; They are so powerful in raids.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;"SoE hates shammies"&amp;nbsp; really...&amp;nbsp; what an attitude.&amp;nbsp; Raid leaders and raiders love them to death.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

I started to play shaman at year 2002, been off and on with playing, so truly not hard end-player.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
This is kinda open letter for SoE (and not against any other class in game, so please, give it a rest):&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
Thank you for killing Shaman out of game - finally.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
It took you many years, but well, nothing easy, and in the end the succeeding waits.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
for being Shaman in this game it has no value anymore. none. zero.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
Hybrids, other classes, has runned over totally.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
Only thing left is solo where you can, if you can.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
And lemme say: without snare, FD and such, with root's what breaks every 10secs, you can think it's pretty darn hard.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
To be honest, in these new zones - impossible.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
Old world rules, yeah, but that's all. and nothing much new in&amp;nbsp; there..&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
Mobs hits hard, heal-casting-times way too long to keep pet alive,&#xD;
cannot go melee 'cause mobs hits you death in secs because interrupting&#xD;
heals, heals what surely ain't so good what everybody says.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
Once upon a time, there was place in EverQuest for Shaman - Nowadays&#xD;
need to Quest for that place, what usually hides itself pretty well.&#xD;
/sarcasm off&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
DoT's takes long time to make even somekinda effect, and to shamans: nicely nerfed compared to other classes DPS.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
DD's sucks - always have, always will.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
Healing? oh, don't get me started. Shaman's ain't no healing class.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

Buffs? only thing what is needed from shamans, every 1 and half hour or&#xD;

position way over shamans for group - for dps and slow's and all other&#xD;
nice, but useful, group-heal-mana-regen-buffs etc.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
Shaman is now only solo-character. And not even good in that anymore.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
Well, maybe if you buy TSS, you are high-end-player, got all those nice&#xD;
clickies, you in über guild, etc, things can be and Are different, but&#xD;
otherwise - keep dreaming having spot in this game. Tho, looking the&#xD;
spell-list of TSS, am not suprised&amp;nbsp; that there isn't anything useful&#xD;
for Grouping nor much to soloing either (wasn't able to find snare nor&#xD;

&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
To new players: DO NOT MAKE SHAMANS - MAKE BEASTLORDS INSTEAD. or wizzies for dps. trust me.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
SoE has hated shamans now like 2-3 years. all the time nerfing and&#xD;
making other characters more powerful and more useful for groups,&#xD;
compared to shamans.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
as one writer on this topic said wisely: once upon a time, all characters had their places in this game and in groups.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
With all these new expansions, new characters, Items, AA's etc. - that&#xD;
has gone. So you can almost select what ever you like to your group -&#xD;
and there is huge amount of classes, what can now do shaman's job as&#xD;
well - even better!&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
Idea for SoE: why don't you finally kill shaman all the way - Don't&#xD;
make us suffer for our stupidious selection of character years ago -&#xD;
Just send Note to all Shaman's and transfer shamans to BeastLords for&#xD;
example. and Delete Shaman-characters, that nobody cannot create them&#xD;
anymore. Isn't that way, you have wanted for years... or then give&#xD;
shamans something darn useful, what you have given from shamans to&#xD;

then we start to think, that there is still spot for shamans and you&#xD;

&#xD;
Alas, to see how you think, will be "wipe the darn shamans away"... that prolly will happen =) &lt;br&gt;&#xD;

But don't make us suffer for our stupid idea for choice of character to play.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
ExXavior&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yes, SOE hates the shaman class. I think maybe it dated SOE's sister&#xD;
once and then the shaman class broke her heart, the heartless **SMURF**.&#xD;
So now you can see why SOE is trying to slowly annhilate the shaman&#xD;
class through devastating blows to their pathetic power such as ohhh let's see here... the top&#xD;
slows in the game, nearly endless mana with canni, best buffs in game, extreme usefulness of alchemy, never being turned away from groups.... oh wait, maybe&#xD;
SOE doesn't hate the shaman class. Actually, they don't. You're wrong.</description>

      <description>Does the link from the original post exist somewhere? It currently just redirects to the front pages of eqplaters.

But I'm not reading 34 pages of class-based rants to find out if the link was moved/updated, what this thread was about, etc. :)</description>

      <description>I'm still waiting for a statement of what role, exactly, an enchanter&#xD;
is supposed to have within the game.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Since the&#xD;
re-envisioning was announced, there have been 3 expansions so far (DoD,&#xD;
PoR and TSS), without focusing anything on the role an enchanter has in&#xD;
solo, group or raid environments.&amp;nbsp; If enchanters are supposed to&#xD;
be buffers or debuffers, improve the quality and variety of buffs /&#xD;
debuffs.&amp;nbsp; If enchanters are supposed to deal damage via charm,&#xD;
improve the charm mechanics and balance risk-reward issues.&amp;nbsp; If&#xD;
enchanters are supposed to be in-camp crowd control, improve the&#xD;
survivability and resist issues.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Since the announcement of class re-envisioning, I have yet to see a&#xD;
statement from SoE as to what an enchanter actually is supposed to&#xD;
do.&amp;nbsp; We are left with the original class description, which is&#xD;
approaching 8 years old.&amp;nbsp; Without a statement, we are left to&#xD;
evaluate changes that have been pushed to the live servers and&#xD;
interpret from this what the class is intended to do.&amp;nbsp; With The&#xD;
Serpent's Spine rolling out today, I have only seen changes that are&#xD;
sprinkled across these three sub-roles.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Enchanters get&#xD;
improvements to most of their existing spell lines, with little&#xD;
preference for either.&amp;nbsp; The mechanics of charm are still&#xD;
disasterously broken -- enchanters should not be able to perpetually&#xD;
charm pets that are significantly better than pet classes.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
Enchanters are needed for 2 basic buffs -- Clarity and Haste.&amp;nbsp; The&#xD;
other buffs (Aleander series, Umbra series, etc.) are almost totally&#xD;
useless.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Crowd control in high-end content is too dangerous&#xD;
for the class that specializes in crowd control.&amp;nbsp; I can see&#xD;
nothing that has improved group desirability, and precious little&#xD;
change to raid roles.&amp;nbsp; (I will admit that I'm not really raiding&#xD;
modern content, so I may just not be seeing raid changes that others&#xD;
might see).&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
My conclusion:&amp;nbsp; re-envisioning was a platitude.&amp;nbsp; It never&#xD;
meant anything.&amp;nbsp; While I believe SoE to have had, at one time, a&#xD;
sincere interest in redefining the roles of different classes within&#xD;
the games structure, it has not translated into a distinct, deliverable&#xD;
product.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I'm talking about group situations here.&amp;nbsp; SK's being able to heal themselves is not that significant in a group situation when you already have a healer.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In fact, with harder hitting mobs&amp;nbsp;a cleric will have an easier time keeping a warrior alive than a similarly geared Knight who has a lot less hitpoints, less defensive ability, and less AC.&amp;nbsp; Now, the only significant benefits to being an SK&amp;nbsp;are the ability to FD and the effect on the SK weapon.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;When soloing, the SK might be on par with a warrior.&amp;nbsp; But even then, all the warrior has to do is buy a bunch of healing potions and he's probably better off.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt; Whenever people parse mobs at guild raids,&amp;nbsp; the top Warrior usually has almost&amp;nbsp;TWICE the dps as the top SK or Paladin (unless it's an undead mob- then Paladins are overpowered).&amp;nbsp; These are knights that have their 2.0's, and their dps is basically garbage compared to warriors, let alone other classes.&amp;nbsp; Warriors can already tank better than Knights, and with the right weapons- which most of the warriors in our guild have- they have NO trouble gaining aggro in group or raid situations.&amp;nbsp; So, basically, at the high end of the game knights are cheated.&amp;nbsp; They can't tank anywhere near as well as a warrior on raid mobs, their dps is not anywhere near a warrior's, and in my experience&amp;nbsp;top-end knights&amp;nbsp;can't hold aggro any better than a top-end warrior who has the right weapons.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Please give Shadow Knights more dps.&amp;nbsp; Can you up the weapon skills cap to be at least on par with Warriors, or AA's that increase weapon dps?&amp;nbsp; Just something so that we're not&amp;nbsp;so nerfed in the end game.&amp;nbsp; I think Knight dps should be at least comparable with Warrior dps- most people mistakenly think it is, but parses seem to tell a different story.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>There has to be a penalty for being a "hybrid" class such as a knight, paladin or SK.  Warriors should be able to out tank and out dps knights, that is the trade off for being a "one trick pony" versus classes that have tremendous versatility.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That an SK would actually come here and complain about needing more DPS when you already have the versatility that you do is laughable at best.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;Warriors=more DPS than knight, and it IS unfair (this coming from a warrior) pally/sk should have a better damage capability because of being hybrid...at the cost of a tad lower defense considering they can't hold aggro from end-game warriors anyhow.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Apparently&amp;nbsp;warriors are going to get snare with this next expansion.&amp;nbsp; Basically, what's happened over the years is warriors have gotten more and more versatility compared to knights while tanking and dps&amp;nbsp;abilities&amp;nbsp;have stayed relatively the same.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;A step in the right direction would be&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;remove the weapon skills caps that Knights have.&amp;nbsp; Even then, high end warriors&amp;nbsp;will still out dps knights because they can&amp;nbsp;duel-wield.&amp;nbsp; Even if dps were the same at the high end, warriors would still be superior at tanking tough mobs.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;As far as berserkers- they are overpowered compared to all other dps classes.&amp;nbsp; Their dps is on par with wizards, and they can take a few hits besides- only thing is they have to worry more about positioning and discs&amp;nbsp;than wizards.&amp;nbsp; Rogues have been shafted, especially with this last expansion.&amp;nbsp; They have to worry even more about positioning than berzerkers, and their dps is still lower.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>If thats true, then its just more "line blurring" between the classes and a very bad idea in my opinion. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The things that makes my character feel like "my character," is everything that is unique or rare about them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The name; As unique of an appearance as possible (unusual color schemes, etc); Titles, if any; Unusual or rare gear; Skills and abilities that other classes don't have. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everything I hate about my characters are the things that make them seem the same as other people in the game. Like seeing someone else with a similar name... or a similar color scheme... the fact that thousands of people appear to be wearing the exact same armor and have the exact same face as me... the fact that its not rare to find people with exactly the same weapons, etc. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To me, class reinvisioning shouldn't be just taking things from one class and giving it to the others. It should focus on making each class more and more unique and more and more useful to every other class. We don't need more classes that can snare. We don't need more classes that can rez. We don't need more classes that can mez things. Those are the things that make those classes that can do those things special and if more classes have them, the less special they are. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>
