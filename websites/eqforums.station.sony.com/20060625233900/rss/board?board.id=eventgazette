&lt;CENTER&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff size=5&gt;EQ Guide of the Month - May 2006&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/CENTER&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;The EverQuest Guide Program is a program of volunteers. These volunteers dedicate their own time and energy to enrich the world of Norrath. As a Thank you to them Guides of the month have and will be chosen for their exemplary contributions.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;CENTER&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/CENTER&gt;&#xD;
&lt;CENTER&gt;&lt;A href="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/gom/AinureOOT.jpg" target=_blank&gt;&lt;IMG height=200 src="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/gom/AinureOOT_sm.jpg" width=149 border=0&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/CENTER&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff size=5&gt;Senior Guide Ainure&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;&lt;I&gt;Oh my! I'm honored! Thank you!&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;1. Why did you become a Guide?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;CENTER&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;I had traveled the lands of Kesmai in a realm called Legends of Kesmai, but alas, my friends and family had found a new land called Norrath. Gone were the days of battling evil in Kesmai, but it seemed Norrath would give us all a place to call home, where we could continue in our endeavors.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;I'd been "Assistant Head Guide" in a game called Legends of Kesmai in the '90's and really enjoyed it. Games such as UO and EQ grabbed the interest of the LoK players, and it went down for the final time. EQ grabbed my interest too, and on April 9, 1999 my "main" was born. Over the first year or so I had occasion to speak to Guides a few times and I was impressed by the caring and sense of community they seemed to give this huge game. Although I'd had experience as a Guide and worked in Tech Live on AOL way back in the day, I never thought I'd be chosen to walk among the Guides in EverQuest, but I decided to apply in late 2000. My surprise when I received my invitation was overwhelming, and so exciting. In January 2001 I joined the Guide program, and have loved it ever since.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/CENTER&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;2. What games do you guide on? For how long?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;CENTER&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;I've been a Guide in EQ-PC since January 2001, and joined the EQII team when the program first started there.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/CENTER&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;3. What is your guide race and class?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;CENTER&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;High Elf Wizard! However, my first incarnation of Ainure was an Erudite Wizard. Then, for a period of time I was a Vah Shir Bard. But, in my heart I've always been a High Elf Wizard - both in the Guide program and in all realms where I've traveled.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/CENTER&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;4. What is your favorite color? &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;CENTER&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;Lavender - it's a peaceful color.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/CENTER&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;5. What is your favorite land (zone)? Why?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;CENTER&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;Guess I'm old school, but I still love the top of a hill in Ocean of Tears, watching the sunset over the water. &lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/CENTER&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;6. What has been your best or favorite moment as a Guide?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;CENTER&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;Oh my! There are so many! Overall I think the best moments have been when I've been able to make a difference. Back in the day of the petition queue, we often had to say "no", but if I could tell that player "no" with an explanation that they could understand and watch their anger turn to understanding, that was a favorite moment. Today it's getting a /tell from a player just to say Hi and share their adventures. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/CENTER&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;7. What is your favorite quest, event, or knowledge circle? What do you do the most of?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;CENTER&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;Favorite quest - Lost Unicorn. Not only is this quest fun to do, but it was the one where I turned a player into a Unicorn! It was one of my first quests after being promoted to Senior Guide, and I wasn't quite used to the commands. When a player gave me the item intended to heal the unicorn it caused that player to be my target, just as I used the command to make myself "well." Of course, since the player was targeted he became the unicorn. ACK! Thankfully he zoned to clear my mistake, but it did take some talking on my part.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;Favorite event - Halfling High Dive. Those little Halflings are just so cute when they throw themselves over the cliff!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/CENTER&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;8. What has been your worst of least favorite moment as being a Guide?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;CENTER&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;Camp disputes - especially for high end mobs. Remember Ragefire? Back when Guides still dealt with these matters, I had one night in particular that had me to the point of tears. No matter how much I tried to talk to these people, the more I seemed to fail. Finally, after what seemed like hundreds of /tells, I told one of the guild officers "Contrary to popular belief, you do not own Norrath!" As soon as I hit *enter* I wanted to take it back. This was NOT the way a Guide should respond! That quote was proudly displayed on that guild's website the next day. Funny thing though, I met those people - from both guilds - at the Boston Fan Faire, and when they saw me they exclaimed in unison, "Contrary to popular belief...." and we all had a good laugh.&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/CENTER&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;9. As a player have you every run into any Guides and events?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;CENTER&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;Oh yes, and I've participated. It was fun watching how other Guides interacted in quests/events from the other side.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/CENTER&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;10. What is your favorite thing about this Game?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;CENTER&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;The sense of community, by far is my favorite thing. To be honest when I first started playing EverQuest I never thought there could be the same sense of community that we had in Legends of Kesmai, but I was wrong! The Guide community is truly a family, and as a player the friends I've made over the years are all treasures, much better than any bling I might loot.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/CENTER&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;11. What do you plan to do in the future as a Guide? Any goals?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;CENTER&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;To be the ruler of all of Norrath! Oh, ok, not that I guess.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;My goals in the Guide program have always been to try and make a positive difference and help others in the program share that. Norrath is a wondrous place, filled with the greatest people in the world. If I can do anything as a Guide to make it just a bit better, then I've reached my goal.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;Thank you for the honor of being named EQ-PC Guide of the Month. It is truly humbling, and an honor I will endeavor to uphold always.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;&lt;I&gt;*Ainure curtsies gracefully and says "Thank you all for everything you do to make this community the best of the best.*&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/CENTER&gt;&#xD;

      <title>The Event Gazette Issue 8 - "Festival of Crowns"</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=eventgazette&amp;message.id=16#M16</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff" size="6"&gt;The Event Gazette Issue 8&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff" size="5"&gt;“Festival of Crowns”&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;As you enter a district peopled primarily by High Elves, you notice an unusual bustle of activity. Nobles and commoners, maids and butlers, sages and priests are all running to and fro; they are sweeping and polishing, cleaning and setting all manner of things in order.&amp;nbsp; When your curiosity draws you near enough to investigate, someone shoves a broom and dustpan into your hands. "Make haste," the breathless voice urges, "The Festival of Crowns is nigh!" &amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;When you look lost after hearing these words, the speaker raises an eyebrow and speaks with exaggerated patience. "The celebration of the coronations of Kings and Queens of old is about to begin, and festivities will continue until the Royal Ball. Do you not wish to know who will win for being the best entertainer?"&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr size="2" width="100%"&gt;&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff" size="6"&gt;Event Reports&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff" size="5"&gt;Al'Kabor&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;Keisu the Kitten had to find her way home. Keisu found some play friends to take her home. She followed the pretty red beetles into the cave off the shore outside her city. She was nipping and teasing them with her claws then jumping and teasing them again. Then she got lost and kept finding her way back to the human tents. Her new play friends took her all the way home to her mommy in Vah Shir. She had a total of 6 friends all come and go along the trip through the dank and smelly Paludal Caverns.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/issue008/alkabor%20keisu01.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/issue008/alkabor%20keisu01_sm.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/issue008/alkabor%20keisu01.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/issue008/alkabor%20keisu02_sm.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr size="2" width="100%"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;img src="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/icons/servers/abayle.jpg"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;The Battle of the Bones came to Antonius Bayle!&amp;nbsp; Fourteen participants answered the call of battle.&amp;nbsp; Fighting was furious, but eventually we had our winners.&amp;nbsp; Corpsebride (Basn) came in first, Testtubebabies (Zanshin) came in second, Umeda (Kanad) came in third.&amp;nbsp; Congratulations and thanks to everyone for participating!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/issue008/antoniusbones1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/issue008/antoniusbones1_sm.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

It has traveled far, and is in great pain.&amp;nbsp; "Please help us!" he cries to the nearest Vah Shir.&amp;nbsp; It turns out that the messenger is a Kerran, and his island is in great danger because a Discord Spawn has taken the island hostage.&amp;nbsp; Players, eager to help, quickly spirited the Kerran messenger's notes to none other than...&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/issue008/antonius%20boots02.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/issue008/antonius%20boots02_sm.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;Jilan Bootmaster!&amp;nbsp; Chief Commander of the Shar Vahl Royal Guard! -- Who also makes boots in his spare time. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;Jilan, with the assistance of several players and the guild Ravages, quickly assembled a small raid force in Kerra Isle.&amp;nbsp; Seeing the intrusion, the monster quickly issued a challenge.&amp;nbsp; "Impertinent mortal...you may choose in which form you want me to kill you all.&amp;nbsp; Big or small, I'll still annihilate you!"&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;So of course, the players chose BIG.....and the fight was on!&amp;nbsp; More than two groups of players plus Jilan, were pitted against the Great Jholizum, who had assumed the form of a large Djinn.&amp;nbsp; Several minutes later, the Djinn lay defeated and the Kerrans were freed!&amp;nbsp; -- Except, perhaps, for an awrat or two who were still mesmerized by the intruder and kept attacking their saviors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/issue008/antonius%20boots03_sm.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/issue008/antonius%20boots03_sm.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr size="2" width="100%"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;img src="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/icons/servers/abayle.jpg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;It's a warm and sunny day in the East Commonlands, and Veolae Avainor is out for a stroll.&amp;nbsp; She has a pet...that looks like a pint-sized Griffin, and she calls it Little Feather.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/issue008/ab%20little01.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/issue008/ab%20little01_sm.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;Veolae and Little Feather started out the evening by entertaining a German-speaking Froglok.&amp;nbsp; Little Feather screeched, flew in circles, and flew away to fetch little gems.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;Those tricks made Little Feather hungry, though, as he shamelessly flew in front of the gathering players with his beak wide open.&amp;nbsp; So the players started feeding him, and he grew...and grew...and grew.&amp;nbsp; Soon Little Feather was much bigger than the inn they were next to!&amp;nbsp; Finally, Little Feather rocked the zone with an earth-shattering belch, dropping one last large gem to the ground in the process.&amp;nbsp; Then off into the sunset Little Feather flew, with Veolae frantically chasing after him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/issue008/ab%20little02.jpg"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;img src="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/issue008/ab%20little02_sm.jpg"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr size="2" width="100%"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;img src="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/icons/servers/abayle.jpg"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;Here are a couple of screenshots of what Unamiel does best, storytelling!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/issue008/ab%20storyteller1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/issue008/ab%20storyteller1_sm.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&amp;nbsp;

Among the revelry of bandits and the growls of plerg plarg fiends, however, a sad and pathetic mewing echoes through the chamber.&amp;nbsp; "I'm lost!&amp;nbsp; It's Mother's Day in Shar Vahl, and I want to go home!"&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;Thus began the adventure of Keisu, a level 10 kitten.&amp;nbsp; In a few minutes she had an escort of two Barbarianesses from Halas and a shifty-eyed goblin.&amp;nbsp; Keisu called forth all of her spiritual energy to cast a few meagre buffs on the party, then off they went, slicing through patog plarg and plerg plarg fiends toward Hollowshade Moor.&amp;nbsp; At the end of the tunnel, gifts were awarded and tearful good-byes exchanged, and Keisu was off to see her mother.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr size="2" width="100%"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;img src="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/icons/servers/abayle.jpg"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;The ball, the ball!&amp;nbsp; Tonight is the Grand Felwithe Costume Ball and I haven't a mask to wear!&amp;nbsp; Such was the plight of the perennial Koada`Doll of the Ball, Lady Ilaria.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Although she had a fabulous gown and mask ready to go, the mask was feathered and beaded and, well, looked to her cat like an aviak chick.&amp;nbsp; Cat wants lunch; mask gets destroyed; cat still hungry.&amp;nbsp; So what's a high elf debutante to do?&amp;nbsp; Go to the Plane of Knowledge and ask for help!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/issue008/ab%20ball1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/issue008/ab%20ball01_sm.jpg"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;After begging and pleading with the citizenry of Myrist, Lady Ilaria was able to get a few souls to craft a Shade Silk Mask, Reinforced Acrylia Mask, Wu's Fighting Mask, and other fine – and more durable – choices.&amp;nbsp; One guild got in on the act and hauled one of its expert tailors to the Main Bank to help.&amp;nbsp; The Lady distributed masks from prior years as her rewards, but, at press time, STILL had not made her final selection . . . wonder what she finally wore?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/issue008/ab%20ball02.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/issue008/ab%20ball02_sm.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr size="2" width="100%"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;img src="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/icons/servers/abayle.jpg"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;A Dark Stranger strides into the Plane of Knowledge.&amp;nbsp; "I am on a mission important for the very survival of Norrath," he says, "and I need to bring with me five who are worthy."&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/issue008/ab%20spirits02.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/issue008/ab%20spirits02_sm.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;A short while later, the Dark Stranger's team was ready to go:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; a Dark Elf warrior; High Elf wizard, enchanter, and cleric; and a Mage who, like the Dark Stranger, was human.&amp;nbsp; The Dark Stranger knew very little of what lay ahead – all he was provided was a dark scroll with cryptic notes from the great wizard who had sent him, and four specially prepared gems to capture the essence of four elemental spirits.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;Off to South Karana they went, and there they faced the Spirit of Air.&amp;nbsp; Next they went to the Rathe Mountains, where the Spirit of Earth was awakened not too far from the land of the Hill Giants.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Then they moved to Lavastorm Mountains where the Spirit of Fire was warming up over the mouth of an open volcano; and then to the Ocean of Tears where the adventurers chased the Spirit of Water around the Ancient Cyclops Island before finally cutting it down.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;None of this prepared the adventurers for their final, most important task.&amp;nbsp; "We must go to the place you call the Arena," said the Dark Stranger, "with all possible speed."&amp;nbsp; Once there, the Dark Stranger held out the four gems in his hand and, approaching the center of the arena, dropped dead on the ground!&amp;nbsp; But when his body hit the ground, a rotting apparition stood in his place . . . and it did not want to be disturbed!&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/issue008/ab%20spirits03.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/issue008/ab%20spirits03_sm.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;They hacked, they slashed, they healed, and they nuked.&amp;nbsp; Thirty minutes of furious fighting later, the apparition was slain.&amp;nbsp; As the Dark Soul's essence reanimated the Stranger, the Stranger with the last of his earthly energy completed the ritual that allowed him to take the Dark Soul's place.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Having no further need of his worldly possessions, the Stranger distributed bags of loot to his party (including one uneaten muffin) and set off to perform his new duties.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr size="2" width="100%"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;img src="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/icons/servers/abayle.jpg"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;An otherwise normal night in the Plane of Knowledge...and then, in flies a little blue drake named Scath Coldclaws.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Keening and hissing, he flies around the banks and lobby ramp, and then opens his mouth.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;"Do you like stories?&amp;nbsp;

One person makes a wish, and the second person grants the wish but adds an unintended consequence.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/issue008/ab%20coldclaws01.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/issue008/ab%20coldclaws01_sm.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;"I wish for a fine blue horse."

Saplings snapped and gave way to the feet of the gargantuan beasts.&amp;nbsp; Giants were common in the mountains, and few noted their passing save the ones fleeing for their lives.&amp;nbsp; The brothers moved on, unchallenged, striding forcefully to the giant hill. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/issue008/bertox%20giants01.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/issue008/bertox%20giants01_sm.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;A roaring voice ripped through the mountains.&amp;nbsp; "How many of our kind have you killed, fiends?&amp;nbsp; How much giant blood has rained upon the ground?&amp;nbsp; Too much I say!&amp;nbsp; Oh, the joy I will fell as I smash the life out of you pitiful adventurers!"&amp;nbsp; As the voice echoed and then faded into the canyons, a palpable silence pervaded the air, as if nature herself had been shocked into speechlessness.&amp;nbsp; Without warning, the heavy silence was shattered with the crashing of even heavier boulders and the horrified screams of those about to die. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;From over the crest of the hill galloped a lonely wizard upon a hazel stallion, her robe flapping violently in the wind.&amp;nbsp; With words of power on her tongue and gesturing wildly, she flung spells madly, not even bothering to dismount. The air grew frigid as a screaming giant was consumed in ice.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; With a powerful blast of arcane wind the giant toppled mightily, shattering into millions of fleshy shards.&amp;nbsp; With a quick, aching glance at their fallen brother, the remaining giants descended upon the spell slinger, their minds consumed with fury.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/issue008/bertox%20giants02.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/issue008/bertox%20giants02_sm.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;A giant fist smashed downward, crushing the stallion and slinging its rider. The bruised and battered wizard struggled to pull herself up, mind in a daze from the violent impact.&amp;nbsp; Slowly scraping herself off the ground with her staff and now standing on shaky legs, she summoned the last of her energy for one last incantation.&amp;nbsp; A momentous bolt of lightening struck down from the heavens, blasting the remaining giants into sizzling piles of flesh.&amp;nbsp; The wizard staggered, and the fell with a thump, but if you listened closely you could hear one small sigh, and the mountains grew quiet once more. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr size="2" width="100%"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;img src="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/icons/servers/bertox.jpg"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;Lady Ilaria sat up in her room sulking, how could this happen to her?&amp;nbsp; Her beloved (well not so much now) cat had torn her mask apart. Normally, she would get another one but it was just hours before the ball.&amp;nbsp; Oh yes, the ball.&amp;nbsp; Where dreams come true and faces are exotic with various designs of creatures from around Norrath.&amp;nbsp; Illaria had always placed first, with costumes that made men gawk, little children close their eyes and cause other women to gossip.&amp;nbsp; She did not know what to do; she could not live down her reputation and refused to go at all if hers was not the best.&amp;nbsp; However, just because she was beautiful did not mean Lady Ilaria was stupid, she knew how to get what she wanted.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/issue008/bertox%20ball01.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/issue008/bertox%20ball01_sm.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;She traveled and searched for skilled tailors in the Plane of Knowledge, where many were willing to help her out for the possibility of becoming famous with their designs.&amp;nbsp; However, no one grew famous, except for possibly Lady Ilaria as she made her way to the ball in a mask that surpassed all.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr size="2" width="100%"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;img src="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/icons/servers/bertox.jpg"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;A Gnome Enchanter by the name of Credius Snuty was seen on the loose May 12th spouting a challenge of illusionary proportions.&amp;nbsp; It appears he was challenging the intelligence of Norrath by playing an advanced form of "hide and seek".&amp;nbsp; Many looked for him in the Lake of Ill Omen and finally he was found...in the form of a puma!&amp;nbsp; Tune in next month around the 16th for another chance of finding the slippery Enchanter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr size="2" width="100%"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;img src="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/icons/servers/firiona.jpg"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;Korethin wanted to make sure and thank Cildaran for assisting him in testing out Plane of Knowledge safety procedures.

After sending out a shout or two she soon had a crowd listening. Seems she had found a story but part of it was missing. The players joined in and aided her in finishing the tale of Pabos and the package he was delivering. Pabos was caught in a storm and attacked by goblins while finding shelter. He was joined by a small dragon, Akh herself, Pawspinner and Jeromeru to defeat the goblins that were defeated.

I never thought I would have come out of that alive. Corruption in the militia, assassins and what not. Wait, I’ll start from the beginning...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;A Couple weeks ago I was approached by the Captain of the Freeport Militia. He asked my to Infiltrate the ranks of the Militia in order to find out about the corruption that is rumored to exist within the ranks. Well, I thought this would be a simple get in and get out deal, boy howdy was I wrong. It only took me a day to learn who was doing what, but to get those dirty swine to trust me, took a little longer. So anyways, I finally get my chance to net these corrupt militia when my plan comes to a halt. I overheard a conversation about Assassins coming to hunt me down come nightfall. That got my heart racing. I didn't know how many of these assassins there where, but from the conversation I over heard, they where dark elves. Luckily for me I found a band of travelers willing to help me out, none dark elf&amp;nbsp; types. I asked them to escort me out of Freeport, and they agreed. As soon as we came out into the open past the Freeport city walls, the Assassins attacked. Not knowing I had company with me, they sprang forth from behind some tree stumps and charged swiftly at me. The Dark elves calm to an abrupt halt, staring at a horse who was standing high on it's hind leg's. THUD! The horse came crashing down. The Dark Elves jump out of the way. And that's when the others had the assassins surrounded.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;~~Torval Rorson~~&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr size="2" width="100%"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;img src="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/icons/servers/stromm.jpg"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;Jeroth Desqual had issued a challenge!&amp;nbsp; To Warrior, Paladin or Shadow Knight (level 40-50) to defeat Jeroth’s fellow fighters (3 fighters) and bring back the Silver Amulet to him from each fight.&amp;nbsp; The final fight was against Jeroth as the Spirit of Honor in the Arena in East Freeport.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/issue008/trial%20of%20champions.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/issue008/trial%20of%20champions_sm.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Spirit of Honor awaits his Champion as his fellow fighters as the Spirit of Steel, Spirit of Heart and Spirit of Fury surround him in preparation for the final fight.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/issue008/trial%20of%20champions2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/issue008/trial%20of%20champions2_sm.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr size="2" width="100%"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;img src="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/icons/servers/stromm.jpg"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;On Saturday May 6th we held the Event Royal Rumble for the levels 52 to 60.

I was pondering this, and whether they might be hungry for the freshly baked cookies in my pack, when suddenly I was transformed!&amp;nbsp; All at once, instead of my normal self -- a most average looking human -- I was instead... a boat! I nearly shrieked in terror, but contained myself.&amp;nbsp; "Oh my, I have fallen under an enchantment!" I exclaimed.&amp;nbsp; I was rather proud of myself for handling it so calmly.&amp;nbsp; I tried to move, but was completely unable. There is precious little that a land-bound boat can do. Even when it was only recently a human.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/issue008/stromm%20strange01.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/issue008/stromm%20strange01_sm.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&amp;nbsp;"I wonder how one might break the spell.&amp;nbsp; Has anyone any ideas?' I asked politely, still wrestling with my own internal distress.&amp;nbsp; Though I could not restrain myself from lamenting aloud how "'A land bound canoe is of little use, alas!"&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Some nearby kind souls attempted to cast cures upon me, but to no avail. Others just laughed... a messenger of the gods came, mounted on his white steed, and looked at my predicament.&amp;nbsp; Yet he, too, seemed to lack any notion of how to cure me. While I was attempting to ponder over ideas on what I might attempt, or seek the aid of others to attempt, suddenly I was transformed yet again!&amp;nbsp; This time, I was a tan horse! At least horses can move, and see, and breathe, and eat... so this was some improvement.&amp;nbsp; I was able to blink, expressing my surprise.&amp;nbsp; That all by itself was a relief!&amp;nbsp; Even so, I was not yet restored to my proper self. "Well now, this is a bit of a change too!"&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/issue008/stromm%20strange02_sm.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/issue008/stromm%20strange02_sm.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&amp;nbsp;I saw a rather smug expression on the golden knight, the messenger of the gods.&amp;nbsp; Somehow, that smug expression made me slightly suspicious that he may have had some small part in my second transformation.&amp;nbsp; I daresay the prayers of their own messengers would be attended to more carefully by the gods than my own poor offerings. Still nervous and concerned, I blurted out, "Milord, I do hope you are not attempting to imply that I am ... a horse's rear end?!?"&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;Many nearby laughed, thinking this was a good joke.&amp;nbsp; The golden knight took his leave, and I was left to fend for myself. I took a few experimental steps forward... and with each step, I rose higher.&amp;nbsp; This was another astonishment! Yet at the same time, it was intriguing.&amp;nbsp; Perhaps if I mounted high enough, the enchantment would break?&amp;nbsp; Well, 'twas worth a try.&amp;nbsp; The local Adventurers seemed too filled with mirth to be of any aid at present. Bizarre as the idea sounded, it worked!&amp;nbsp; Ere long, I began to feel more like myself.&amp;nbsp; As I rested atop the Library Myrist, I began to feel more completely myself.&amp;nbsp; Eventually, I was restored enough to make myself float.&amp;nbsp; So I cautiously ventured forth, and sank gently back to the ground where I had been at first. I cheered, and announced to the Adventurers that I had been restored!&amp;nbsp; Many congratulated me on my recovery, including some of the ones who had been a bit cold before.&amp;nbsp; Naturally, I forgave them their former coldness, in my relief at my restoration.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;I had not anticipated an adventure of my own, in the peaceful city of New Tanaan.&amp;nbsp; Yet so it was, on that fateful day.&amp;nbsp; As night stretched its cloak over the city, I was weary and ready to seek my rest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr size="2" width="100%"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;img src="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/icons/servers/tribunal.jpg"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;Barbarian skullduggery revealed.&amp;nbsp; Necromancer’s are reviled, Halfling’s are blamed.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;Late night on the ninth of May, Bramador, a brave and sometimes too adventurous Barbarian, was lurking about the Necromancer Guild in Freeport.&amp;nbsp; Just what he was doing there, Bramador was not willing to admit to, but he hinted that the ‘Priest’s of Rivervale set him up.’ &amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;While he was nosing about in places that most respectable folks would avoid, he seems to have been informed that his prying eyes were not to be permitted to pry any longer.&amp;nbsp; What he saw, again he would not reveal to our source. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;A small explosion and a bright flash of light were reported by nearby residents to the Necromancer Guild, almost immediately followed by a cry for help.&amp;nbsp; The mysterious Bramador, began begging for help.&amp;nbsp; It seems that the Necromancer’s in a fit of pique, sent a rather vile curse upon his luckless head, removing his sight.&amp;nbsp; Helpless and lost in Freeport, bumping into strangers, and an occasional cactus, Bramador seemed to be truly cursed.&amp;nbsp; His cries fell upon deaf ears, hardhearted citizens of Freeport wantonly attacked him, beating him with clubs and rocks, they drove him away from them, until he stumbled over the docks, and fell rather ignominiously into a patch of cactus. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;After picking himself up, and standing about rather helplessly, his voice hoarse from all the shouting, a voice of calm reason was heard.&amp;nbsp; “Bramador, stranger, what do you here?&amp;nbsp; What evil seems to have befallen you?”&amp;nbsp; Etruscan was at his side, worried about what new mischief might be afoot in Freeport.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;Bramador, was vague, blaming the Necromancer’s for his loss of vision, and claiming that only the small folks in Rivervale could help.&amp;nbsp; Unfortunately, he was in Freeport and Rivervale is a long and perilous journey for one man to make, particularly when that man could not see anything at all.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/issue008/tribunal%20lava01.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/issue008/tribunal%20lava01_sm.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;Etruscan was not willing to make the journey himself, instead, he called upon a couple of his friends, Styles and Yikes, to assist the luckless Barbarian in his quest to get to Rivervale.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;After about twenty minutes of discussion, Styles understood how he might guide the big oaf over to Rivervale.&amp;nbsp; With no way of seeing, he had to explain every step to Bramador.&amp;nbsp; Unfortunately, he forgot to warn Bramador of the occasional tree, root, bush, or rock that got in his path, so Bramador was heard to curse rather vilely as he bounced off of the offending scenery.&amp;nbsp; He only lost two teeth, and ate a small amount of bark, or so he reassured us.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;Eventually, our brave team of Styles and Yikes, brought Bramador safely to the “Priests of Rivervale” who seemed to of cured Bramador of his mysterious curse.&amp;nbsp; The secrets that he carried with him he also revealed to the Priests, but unfortunately, for us, he would not reveal them to our source.&amp;nbsp; When asking the Rivervale clerics about it, they shrugged and said, “Barbarians, who can understand them?&amp;nbsp; We certainly do not know what he was up to there, nor why he felt that he had to come to us to be helped.&amp;nbsp; Any competent cleric could have cured his blindness, heck even a Troll Shaman could of fixed him right up.”&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;It had been a long time since the Scale brood had begat a clutch, and even longer still since one had come this close to hatching.&amp;nbsp; The Scale clan was tormented by the other species of basilisk in the region, especially the tyrannical lava basilisks.&amp;nbsp; Their souls as black as their scales, they thrived on Scale eggs.&amp;nbsp; However, this particular set of brood mothers had reached their breaking point.&amp;nbsp; This time it would be different.&amp;nbsp; This time they would not sit idly by and lose their newest brood.&amp;nbsp; The hunt was on.&amp;nbsp; The Scale clan scoured the terrain for signs of their eggs or the lava basilisks.&amp;nbsp; They were soon to find their black skinned foes, however, the immense size and the power of these black demons was more than the smaller Scale clan would be willing to handle.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;Understanding this, they beseeched the humanoid creatures that were roaming the land to help them.&amp;nbsp; Their pleadings soon fell on understanding ears.&amp;nbsp; Lezan and Farrah, two noble humanoids, soon came to the clutches defense and slay the would-be diners.&amp;nbsp; After recovering the Scale’s clutch of eggs, and the brood ensuring that all was as it should.&amp;nbsp; The Scale brood returned the eggs to their nests and quickly rewarded those two saviors of the next generation of Scale.&amp;nbsp; Then, after the rewards had been given, the mothers quickly returned to their nest and continued their long vigil of motherhood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr size="2" width="100%"&gt;&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff" size="6"&gt;The Classifieds&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff" size="4"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Al`Kabor&amp;nbsp;

Write what would be an excerpt from Denny’s memoirs if he were to survive the adventure.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;b&gt;RESPONDANT SAID:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;Day 13, I for the past 3 nights have been scouting the local historian and records department. Through my previous nights of random fires, deaths of the local domesticated pets and livestock I have had to be more causes of my actions due to heightened security. I found what appears to be a place of hiding within the building which I can hide till night fall when I can enter his chambers. He has no guards thus will pose little challenge in my mission. I will kill him in his sleep take the precise citizenship paper he is hold for Master Jun'vi which he recently had to restore after a brief bar accident. This building is also roofed with thatch and in this dry season of the 15th moon will provide as a beautiful escape as it is engulfed in the flames that will originate from the historians corpse. This will spread from the night air to the other buildings around the perimeter setting more dwellings on fire. Before anyone realizes what has happened and gone missing I will have returned home mission complete and handsomely rewarded for my efforts.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Pex on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;06-07-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;03:00 PM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff size=5&gt;EQ Guide of the Month - April 2006&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;The EverQuest Guide Program is a program of volunteers. These volunteers dedicate their own time and energy to enrich the world of Norrath. As a Thank you to them Guides of the month have and will be chosen for their exemplary contributions.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;A href="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/gom/aspidistra.jpg" target=_blank&gt;&lt;IMG height=200 src="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/gom/aspidistra_sm.jpg" width=166 border=0&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff size=5&gt;Guide Aspidistra&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;1. Why did you become a Guide?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;When mes was less big den I am now, momma telled me dat mes gots to be nice to everting dats not fud. Mes no dat sum peeples tink trolls mean but mes proof dem wrong. Mes try to edyukat dem on da ways of gods and show dem dat trolls are gud too! &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;B&gt;ooc:&lt;/B&gt; I originally joined because it seemed to me that there were a lot of people out there who needed help and as an avid player, I had the time to unstick them, learn about their bugs and the like. Now that everything is more role-play focused, I embrace the challenge of helping people learn about the petition system for the help they need, but mostly strive to keep them entertained. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;2. What games do you guide on? For how long?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;Me applied fer da posishun of gladjiater at da Arena but dem said dat gnome puntins' not a sport and me dunnot tink dat fightin' so much fun. Did yus ferget alreddy? Ramember: when mes was less big den I am now, momma telled me dat ms gots to be nice to everting dats not fud. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;B&gt;ooc&lt;/B&gt;: I used to GM for a variety of MUDs before the advent of graphical MMPORGs. (Yes, I'm that old, darn it all!) Mostly, however, I am an EverQuest devotee through and through -- since its inception I've never found another game that has held my attention and sparked my wonder and sense of adventure quite the same way. Accordingly, I've never had the time or inclination to volunteer for another game. I originally joined the EQ program in 2000 but then took an extended break when I was married. I returned to the program in 2004. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;3. What is your guide race and class?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;Me is a luminary of Cazic Thule -- some peeples call us Trolls. Me wuz reincarnated in Neriak when dem froggies was doin' renovashun of Grobb, but now mes has returned to da swamp homelan. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;B&gt;ooc&lt;/B&gt;: Currently, I am a level 58 Troll Shaman&lt;BR&gt;In my original incarnation before my 4-year break, I was a Barbarian since evil races were not allowed at the time. My reincarnation has been extremely rewarding!&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;Blue&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;B&gt;ooc&lt;/B&gt;: No, yel... Aaaaaaaaaagh. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;5. What is your favorite land (zone)? Why?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;Mes required by law to sey dat its Innythule Swamp. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;B&gt;ooc&lt;/B&gt;: Really, it's Kedge Keep. Yes, I know it doesn't qualify as "land" but that’s really the point, isn't it? I cannot describe my amazement (back 7 years ago) that the engine could handle swimming much less going in all directions much less figuring in a drowning and air pockets. To explore it was truly the greatest challenge of my play characters life and I take immense pride in knowing every twist and turn of that zone. It is an adventurer's paradise. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;6. What has been your best or favorite moment as a Guide?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;*picks teeth with bone* I dunno, dat last mud bath was pritty gud. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;B&gt;ooc&lt;/B&gt;: I think I enjoy it most when I get away with players thinking I am actually an NPC. In the recent Festival of Time, three of us were running the start and people kept hailing us but we just kept doing our script and someone /ooc'd "Stop hailing them, it's just creating spam... you have to let the script run!" and I giggled. Similarly, in the old invasion scripts, I always had fun turning on walk and just wandering about trying to act as much like an NPC as possible. I just love those moments when people say "There's a new named in the zone." instead of "Oh, looks like a GM is doing another event." &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;7. What is your favorite quest, event, or knowledge circle? What do you do the most of?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;Mes take personal sponsabiltee fer makin sure da Iceclad gnome farm has nuff cookies to keep dem gnomies nice and fat fer pickin. Yes huh! It is too a farm. Me not nos why dems live off ice but me dunnt care -- fat frozen gnomies is da best! &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;B&gt;ooc&lt;/B&gt;: I am a big fan of variety, but I think my favorite events have to do with story telling. Running the storyteller scripts or doing quests like Story of a Tormented Soul always seem to bring out the best role-players and I always enjoy learning the stories of the land too. Even when I run quests, I usually have some "theme" running in my mind that I try to play out... &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;8. What has been your worst of least favorite moment as being a Guide?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;Sometimez mes not find nobuddy to eet or play wif and dat can make eben a tuf troll have watery eyes. (Me always say dat its da bixie pollen tho...) &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;B&gt;ooc&lt;/B&gt;: I think it's a toss up between being taken for granted (e.g. players who demand service or demand quests) and worrying that people don't see the value of the program or don't get fun out of it (e.g. the phrase "Oh yeah, just another dumb GM event" strikes an unpleasant chord in my heart. I suppose they are closely related. There are definitely times that I wish I could have infinite flexibility and somehow "magically" give every player exactly what they are looking for -- the challenge is figuring out "What do they want??" Sometimes, I don't think they know themselves... &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;9. As a player have you every run into any Guides and events?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;Me runs into stuffs all da time. Momma sez I'm clum-see. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;B&gt;ooc&lt;/B&gt;: I was on one of the finalist teams for the Test of Tactics where our characters were transferred to one of the Zeks for server vs. server guild battles and I will always treasure my Golden Championship Ring. However, my absolutely most memorable moment was participating as a level 1 Halfling in the Halfling High Dive on my play server. Whatever guide thought to put us in a line, make us conga around the zone and then do the wave... was truly inspired. There is just nothing funnier than a train of 40 Halflings who are about to throw themselves off the edge of the world. Ridiculous funny!! &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;10. What is your favorite thing about this Game?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;When me dies, me gets reincarnated and mes gets to go die again and again! Dats like magic!! &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;B&gt;ooc&lt;/B&gt;: I think it's the feeling of adventure. I owe great thanks to a mystery player that I met 7 years ago -- I was a level 5 Shaman, and this bard offered to escort me across the Karanas. He stopped on the ascent to Highhold and said "Look up at this mural." I thought he was nuts, but we looked up at the mural on the wall and he said "I just can't believe that someone took the time and the energy to build in this much detail. It's a complete wonder everywhere you turn." and I just never looked at the game the same way. Each expansion holds something new and something exquisite and I still have great anticipation when I think about all there is left to explore. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;11. What do you plan to do in the future as a Guide? Any goals?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;I dunno, maybe me tries some new disguises. Me hears dat if yus find da right enchanter, yus can become a persistent dwarf. Me tinks dat sounds kinda fun! &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;B&gt;ooc&lt;/B&gt;: I am definitely interested in learning more about all aspects of the guide program. I've really enjoyed recently taking on the role of Quest / Event Coordinator for my server and I hope that I can continue to participate in other ways as well -- learning about the Training program, writing some quests, or just branching out into new styles of role-play and player interaction. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;Even though Saryrn may only run a few quests a month. They sure do like to report on them.

&lt;P class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;It was a tale of adventure and gnomes as five stalwart adventurers braved the perils of Kunark to reunite two gnome brothers and deliver them to the entrance of the good outpost in Firiona Vie. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;The band of adventurers found Bofas Steamgear, one of a pair of shipwrecked gnome brothers, washed up on the shores of The Overthere.&amp;nbsp; Although a warrior, Bofas was afraid of almost everything that moved, but was most afraid of magic portals...seems that his brother's wizard portal collapsed on him one day, leaving him stranded amongst a dozen angry mobs!&amp;nbsp; So the band of adventurers, led by a female Koada`Dal Bard but also included a gnome mage and cleric, a half elf ranger, and a wood elf druid, began a long, perilous jaunt.&amp;nbsp; Through The Overthere to Warsliks Woods they traveled, then east to the Field of Bone, south to the Swamp of No Hope, and then into Trak`Anon's Teeth. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;Once in Trakanon, even the very trees rattled as Bofas and his brother, the wizard Safob, shouted at each other to try locating Safob. But find each other they did, as the air then filled with joyful shouts of reunion.&amp;nbsp; But the work of adventurers is never done, and now the party trudged off back into the swamp and headed toward Firiona Vie. Once at Firiona Vie, prizes were given out, tearful good-byes were exchanged, and two gnome brothers vanished into the city!&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;It was that time of the year again, with the grass glowing verdantly and the sun shining in its greatest majesty, when the young children of Rivervale gather together and, with youthful bravado, strive to prove their worth and bravery. It was time for the run. Dozens of Halfling youth, many with clothing in various states of disarray, crowd forward, and with incredible discipline, awe, or both, listen raptly, silently, to the noble Halfling standing upon a podium. Attired in glorious blue plate mail, shining like it was shorn from Lady Vox herself, he cleared his throat as he spoke, "This year, as every year, is time for the Run. I challenge the boisterous youth of this community to show your daring! Every child here has a chance to finish with the number one spot clenched tightly in their grasp. There will be danger, there will be trials and tribulations, but in the end, there will be victory! Those who wish to undertake this daring adventure, please follow me down to the docks where you can meet my lovely dark elf companion. Don’t worry, she doesn’t bite. When we arrive, I will establish the final rules, and she will help prepare you for the Race. Dark murmurs spread through the crowd as many remembered fighting the Dark Elves with their Leatherfoot Brigade, while the rest had only heard of Dark Elves in the scary stories told around the camp fire. Buttons straining on their puffed out chests, a large contingent of Halflings left down to the dock, discussing nonchalantly of who was going to come in first.&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;Swords strapped up, foot hair trimmed for better aerodynamics, the Halflings adventurers assembled before the shimmering blue announcer. With a grin on his face, he began to speak to the crowd, "That you are here now shows you have some gumption, but it will take more than that to complete this race. Complying with tradition, the race will be through the ill-omened &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;st1:place&gt;&lt;st1:PlaceName&gt;Kithicor&lt;/st1:PlaceName&gt; &lt;st1:PlaceType&gt;Forest&lt;/st1:PlaceType&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;. The undead prowls this forest as thick as the grass on the Karanas. As you find yourself in precarious situations throughout the race, remember one thing. When running from a fiend, you need not outrun the fiend, just the closest other Halfling." Uncertain glances passed between the young Halflings.&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;After the shining &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;st1:time hour="12" minute="0"&gt;noon&lt;/st1:time&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt; faded to dusk and the dusk melted to darkness, the Halflings were ready. Many a prayer could be heard being whispered amongst the crowd. As the clock struck ten, a horde (though one of minute stature) rushed from the gate of Rivervale into the bowels of Kithicor. Many an undead soldier tore itself from the hard dead ground, dragging pitifully screaming Halflings down to their painful deaths. The Halflings, attracting too much attention as one big group, fragmented into many packs fleeing from the undead.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;The Halflings knew they were safe from the wicked grasping of the undead when they broke up.

&lt;P class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;But then came the howls. Ravenous packs of wolves surrounded the small groups, grabbing limbs and ripping them away from their owners as they descended for the kill. The howling and screaming could be heard through out the night. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;A href="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/issue007/eqbertoxmaddash04.jpg" target=_blank&gt;&lt;IMG src="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/issue007/eqbertoxmaddash04_sm.jpg"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/A&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;A href="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/issue007/eqbertoxmaddash05.jpg" target=_blank&gt;&lt;IMG src="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/issue007/eqbertoxmaddash05_sm.jpg"&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;As a faint sun began to peak over the horizon, three bloody, dismayed, and distraught Halflings entered the cabin that marked the end of the race. Their clothes shredded, eyes sunken and bloodshot. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;A href="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/issue007/eqbertoxmaddash06.jpg" target=_blank&gt;&lt;IMG src="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/issue007/eqbertoxmaddash06_sm.jpg"&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Where there should have been emotion on their faces, there were only stoic facades. The well of emotion had been used up fleeing, stepping over the corpses of murdered comrades and hearing the wretched wailing screams of those who fell behind. The crying had stopped long ago. They received their viciously earned rewards, and seeing that the challenge and danger was over, finally began to relax once again. The Halflings who emerged from the forest that day brought back to Rivervale three battle hardened veterans, men who have seen blood and death and hardship, to replace three of the boys who had left the day before. Though they suffered mightily, the returned to their homes with a strength that would be unmatched for years to come.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; &#xD;

&lt;P class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;On Saturday, April 29th the Stromm Guides had a "Meet the Players Day!" We told stories, chatted with players and had a rather lengthy duck walk all throughout PoK, ending in the Library. The reason for the duck walk was "to find it" and while players joined in ducking and walking they were told "it's very small, and red or green or yellow or something." They played along and when the walk ended I jumped up and said "I found it! It was all the new friends who played with me!" I thanked them and gave them cookies and milk for playing along. It was fun!&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

Retell the story of your escape to your friend.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN **froglok="" font-size="" verdana="" font-family="" 9pt=""&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal **froglok="" text-align="" justify=""&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal **froglok=""&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;B&gt;RESPONDANT SAID:&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;I was playing out back like ma'am told me to, but I also wondered near the woods. I know I was not supposed to go there and father has told me many times not to go to close to them. Before I knew it and before I could scream a gang of nefarious goblins came out of no where and grabbed me. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal **froglok=""&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;All I remember was feeling them pushing me into this large sack, then THUMP! Everything went black. I woke up the next day hearing this weird grunting and snorting kind of noise. It was those goblins that grabbed me. I then saw this large creature of unspeakable disgust, smelled like rotten meat. It appeared that the goblins and this creature were speaking, and every so often they would look at me, and then the goblin would get all excited. The orc would shake is head. Before I realized they were selling me to this creature, I was again stuffed back into that sack and THUMP, all went black again. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal **froglok=""&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;I woke up in a cage, appears that they have bought me and I am now a slave to them. Well I did not want to hang around here to long. I watched and observed these creatures and soon saw that around dusk everyday they would leave me alone for just a few minutes. These few minutes felt like forever. I finally saw the opportunity to make a run for it. I kicked out the weak bars they held me in by and then jumped out the back window and ran off into the darkness. A few minutes later I heard them scream out a cry of anger, and then the blowing of the battle horns blasted in my ears. I could feel my heart pound in my chest as I ran faster and harder than I have ever ran in my life. I continued this for miles and miles. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal **froglok=""&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;I did not know where I was at or what I was running into, but I know it had to be better than what I had just left. I ran until I could not hear the noise of the horns. I collapse on the ground in pure exhaustion. I was awakened by the sound of horses and the voices speaking our native language. They were traveling merchants on the way back to my home city and were willing to help me after I told them all the trouble I had been in. I have learned now to stay away from the forest like my father has taught me.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;

These volunteers dedicate their own time and energy to enrich the world of Norrath. As a Thank you to them Guides of the month have and will be chosen for their exemplary contributions.  &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/gom/yourang-cshome.jpg"&gt;&lt;img border="0" width="152" height="200" src="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/gom/yourang-cshome_sm.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff" size="5"&gt;Senior Guide Yourang&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;1. Why did you become a Guide?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;Probably for the oddest reason -- an offhand comment from a dear EQ friend -- a ranger, of course :-). I am a Guild Leader of a large guild on one of our servers ... and one day a member of my guild made a brief comment that, &amp;quot;You should be a GM the way you like to help people.&amp;quot; It got me to thinking about the guides I had met along the way. Almost all of them seemed to me to have a real happiness in what they were doing. (I tell people who are interested in being a guide -- that if you just want to for the &amp;quot;uber&amp;quot; equipment and the &amp;quot;wizzy&amp;quot; commands -- you probably will be gone in a month -- but if you like people, have patience and a sense of humor, then this is an awesome thing to do!) It got me thinking. On a whim, I applied and was lucky enough to make it to Prexus with a great bunch of appies, where a couple of ancient guides (Aeegir and Juxtaron) unlocked the fun of both helping and role-playing.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;2. What games do you guide on? For how long?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;I have only been a guide on EQ -- and that not much over a year now.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;3. What is your guide race and class?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;I am a wuss mage! High elf, of course!! :-)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;4. What is your favorite color? &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;ROFL!!! GREEN! The guide photo would not show it because I changed the look of my guide toon to be different from my play toons! But my play main has been dark green from day one!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;5. What is your favorite land (zone)? Why?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;No question -- Charasis! I think the combination of the puzzles, the wings, and the complexity make this one of the best the developers ever did! When it was a hot zone, it was an awesome place to play. And when fabled --- WOW!!!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;6. What has been your best or favorite moment as a Guide?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;No doubt --- another small thing. After trying for 2-3 weeks to help a player who was having trouble with a quest -- I finally figured out what he was doing wrong. The /petitions and asking guildies had failed. I was baffled. When I finally figured it out (in the library you had to duck down and see just the edge of a drop) it took me a day before I could figure out a fair hint for him. 3-4 weeks later he found me in PoK and thanked me, and told me it meant so much to him that he had sent a letter to Sony! I doubt he actually did, but it made my day to hear how much that help meant to him!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;7. What is your favorite quest, event, or knowledge circle? What do you do the most of?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;Lost Item! Sooooo much fun for newbies. 3/4 of the time you get excited players. I have a huge set of hot buttons set up now from all I have learned about doing it. It is a great quest for Unrest or Crushbone, but if these zones are empty Kurns is usually a great place for old quest #111!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;8. What has been your worst of least favorite moment as being a Guide?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;I hate it when re is a problem and I am convinced the player has a good point, but I can not find an appropriate way to help the player. The P&amp;amp;P guidelines, much as I wish I could stretch them on occasion, make a great deal of sense to me. But as an active player myself, running out of legal ideas and having to refer to /petition is always frustrating. Fortunately, a few months into guiding I discovered something that made that a ton better. If I could let the &amp;quot;player&amp;quot; side of me show (&amp;quot;Aaargh! I hate it when something like that happens to me...&amp;quot;), sympathize, and try my best to provide legal hints and workarounds before I refer to /petition -- I was stunned how much the players loved that approach! I could introduce the need for a /petition with something like &amp;quot;ooooo! For that one we need the help of the big kids in San Diego, way over my head...&amp;quot; I would even suggest how to phrase the /petition and what to include, and might be able to suggest workarounds. Literally 95 out of 100 times, the player was so grateful for the sympathy, being pointed in the right direction, etc ... that they left the PST as very happy campers even for very frustrating problems! And, if I set expectations that it might take 2-3 days for someone to get back to them &amp;quot;unless they were very lucky...&amp;quot; then often I would get a PST the next day &amp;quot;Wow! I already heard!&amp;quot; People really like it when you really listen, and try to help, even if your options are limited.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;  &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;9. As a player have you every run into any Guides and events?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;Yes -- a few times. It is fun to watch and learn from other guides ... and quietly be able to, sort of, help the guide without the guide knowing he or she is being helped by setting a tone of fun in responding. And best, I learn a lot about better ways to do things by being able to see how members of my group are responding in /gsay or guild to the guide's efforts.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;10. What is your favorite thing about this Game?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;I love the quests and exploring! I am a role-player at heart. As a player -- a dear friend and I love to explore new areas for our guild -- die often, learn enough to take the rest of the guild there.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;  &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;11. What do you plan to do in the future as a Guide? Any goals?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;I don't have a clue!!! My short term goal is to make better use of the Persistent Characters. I don't have enough experience with them yet, but since I am on solo a lot, I am convinced they are the answer to trying to find better interactions with senior players that the quests sometimes do not do for solo events. Longer term, I need to find more solo quests that are good matches for level 50+ players. At some point in the distant future, I would like to qualify to help out on the personnel or policy teams. Oh yes -- and I need to figure out if Sony will sue me if I name my new dog Fippy! :-)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

anticipation.&amp;nbsp; Hidden in the shadows deep within the place known as&#xD;
'The Hole' Kasin Blaike watches carefully as a small group of Dark&#xD;
Elves hunts nearby.&amp;nbsp; His hand twitches slightly, waiting for the&#xD;
perfect shot.&amp;nbsp; These dark elves must be stopped before they find what&#xD;
he lost...&amp;nbsp; It would probably be easier to kill them and get it over&#xD;
with, but perhaps... yes.&amp;nbsp; Perhaps he can just bribe them.&amp;nbsp; Let them do&#xD;
the work for him, and when they find his precious item... he will&#xD;
'reward' them.&amp;nbsp; If they only knew what they were finding.&amp;nbsp; If they only&#xD;

Write what would be an excerpt from Denny’s memoirs if he were to survive the adventure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;RESPONDANT SAID:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I wiped the feline blood from my dagger and applied more of the poison crafted from the spiders beneath Lavastorm. The Registrar had to die, I gave him every opportunity to provide me with the papers. Alas I needed no witnesses alerting my presence to the many guards nearby. This mission is what I had trained for. I slowly moved down the corridor blending with my environment sneaking ever so closely to my destination. Yet another guard stood between me and my destiny, slowly drawing my dagger creeping up to him I was certain he would show no challenge to my ability to end him. I drew back my curved blade taking careful aim and thrust.... I missed.... The feline was completely surprised but too young and scared to immediately counter attack. I had to quickly act to keep others from being aware of my invasion. With my long sword I slashed and you could see the poison flowing in his veins dropping him to the floor with a terrified look in his eyes. I sheathed my sword and drug him into an empty room. I could hear the growl of the Beast Masters warder. I was close but so far away. The Lord of beasts would surely put up more of a fight that even I am not ready for. So I go back to the basics of what I was taught. Concentrating on my body making it once again blend into the environment I cautiously eased into the Beastlords lair. I could see my target the silly catman displayed it as if it were a wondrous treasure. The Master of beasts had no idea of my attendance in his quarters but his warder acted uneasy as if it could smell the blood that I had spilled. I dared not to attack now because his animal alone would prove such a fight to me that I was unworthy to be in. I just had to wait for the right moment and keep concentrating on keeping my body hidden. And then the moment came, a young feline entered the room asking his master for some much needed training. This was just the distraction I needed. I grabbed the citizenship papers and leapt out the window. I had to be careful going out of the city I was so impressed by my accomplishments that I wasn’t watching my speed and lost my stealth. The guards were on me so I had to quickly summon my stallion and make my leave.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;The Librarians of Myrist, who have been charged with the&#xD;
chronicling and keeping of historical records regarding Norrath, are venturing&#xD;
forth into Norrath to spread timeless tales of ancient history and help the&#xD;
peoples of EverQuest remember their past. They will also be gathering stories&#xD;
and chronicling any new events worthy of being written down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;a href="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/issue005/fot_librarians.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/issue005/fot_librarians_sm.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;

the Plane of Knowledge and their feasts are expected to start up next week.&#xD;
Their feasts have been known to spread many a yarn, scavenger hunt, test of&#xD;
character, and waist lines.&lt;span **smurf=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/span&gt;Unfortunately, they will only be out and about for a short time. So make&#xD;

the event started. Once we got started the players had fun cheering on their&#xD;
favorite giant, and buffing him. In the end only the sand giant Ahkim Sandy was&#xD;
left standing. The Referee passed out a couple of small prizes to some of the&#xD;
crowd for their good role-playing. There will be a return match on the 23rd of&#xD;

haven't survived the ages challenging any force that passes them. The spirits&#xD;

when she gets older. A gang of nefarious goblins have kidnapped you and sold&#xD;
you to the Orcs to slave in their mines. Fortunately you managed to escape and&#xD;
find your way back home. Retell the story of your escape to your friend.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;b&gt;RESPONDANT SAID:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;As I ate my stew in earnest, I could see her study me out of the corner of my&#xD;
eye. I knew what she was thinking. But, I would feel better if she announced it&#xD;
on her own. "Ok. I can't take this. You are filthy, Dolly, and you're&#xD;
starving! Even for a Dwarf!" She continued to stare at me with her sky&#xD;
blue eyes. Eyes only a half elf can have. I carefully set my spoon down and&#xD;
began to fiddle with a loose string of her table cloth. When she frowned at me,&#xD;
waiting for an answer, I sighed and let my hands drop to my lap. Taking another&#xD;
deep breath I began, "Ok, I will tell you all that happened. I was&#xD;
practicing my stances with a stick when I heard noises-" Liz cleared her&#xD;
throat, "I hope you weren't where you weren't supposed to be. I know you.&#xD;
No matter how many times you tell me that you know what you are doing, you get&#xD;
in trouble. A week later you are here! Tattered and dirty. With leaves that I&#xD;
know are not common in the forest I live in. You were at the forbidden pond in&#xD;
the dark wood, weren't you?" She was right. Liz is always right. Human&#xD;
intelligence and Elven wisdom combined to make her. I realized her eyes were&#xD;
glowing and I knew with a start she was looking at me through infrared. She&#xD;
could see my heart beating faster. I swallowed and worked my tongue. "Yes,&#xD;
Liz. I was practicing stances when I heard a noise, when I looked behind me, I&#xD;
was ambushed. One of them hit me on the head and I blacked out." I touched&#xD;
the tender spot on my head where the club found a fancy to strike me.&#xD;
"What else?", Liz's eyes were beginning to soften, but she was still&#xD;
going to present me to the Elder for my being-where-I'm-not-supposed-to. Liz was&#xD;
fifty years older than me. She raised me when my parents died. A definite life&#xD;
friend. A friend to keep away the trouble and invite it at the same time.&#xD;
"They sold me to some Orcs and-" Liz's eyes were hard again. Under&#xD;
that gaze my mouth went dry. I had to work my tongue to get some moisture&#xD;
before I could continue. We both hated Orcs. Orcs were responsible for her tribe’s&#xD;
death and my parents murder. Being an experienced woodswoman, she, with my&#xD;
help, ensured the safety of the nearby villages. I respected and feared her, with&#xD;
good reason. Once I had enough spit, I continued, "The goblins sold me to&#xD;
the Orcs for a slave. The Orcs were traveling with a new caravan of slaves for&#xD;
their mines. When I got there, they put a pick in my hands and worked me till&#xD;
my hand were raw, then made me work some more." My hands are bandaged.&#xD;
"If they saw you sleep or sneak something to eat before it was time to eat&#xD;
there, the slave drivers whipped you." They fed you slop made of other&#xD;
slaves that died from exertion and sickness, seasoned with leftovers of the&#xD;
Orcs dinners and rancid mushrooms. If you were lucky enough to catch cave bugs,&#xD;
they gave you enough energy to last another hour or two. "When it was time&#xD;
to sleep, the Orcs were impressed with my strength and let me sleep with only&#xD;
ropes holding me bound. I managed to use a nearby sharp piece of rock to cut&#xD;
loose when everyone else was asleep. "The watchers that were standing&#xD;
guard overlooked me as just wiggling from uncomfortable." I grunted a&#xD;
humorless chuckle and continued. "The Orcs were careless and left one pick&#xD;
untouched nearby. I waited 'till the guard finished his round and started to go&#xD;
switch out for some sleep. While they were making the change, I darted for the&#xD;
pick with as little sound as possible, the way you taught me. "A new guard&#xD;
was just now taking his place, but he still had sleep in his eyes. He didn't&#xD;
see me until the last minute that I put the pick through his skull." It&#xD;
was Liz's turn to grunt. She picked up her mug and studied the black coffee in&#xD;
it, waiting for me to continue. "I managed to gather a little food for the&#xD;
trip back here. It took me longer than I thought. I misjudged the lay of the&#xD;
land, and ran out of food the third day..." I ended my story frowning at&#xD;
my stew. Remembering the cut off shriek of the Orc I killed. Feeling his warm&#xD;
blood, I lost my appetite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr size="2" width="100%"&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="5" color="#ffffff"&gt;EQ Guide of the Month - February 2006&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;The EverQuest Guide Program is a program of volunteers. These volunteers dedicate their own time and energy to enrich the world of Norrath. As a Thank you to them Guides of the month have and will be chosen for their exemplary contributions.  &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt; The tree whisper gently in the Greater Faydark as an energetic Wood elf points to her latest burse. “See that. Don’t believe everything you heard about ducks okay.” She tells a small Gnome taking down notes as quickly as she can. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;img width="200" src="http://eq2players.station.sony.com/images/en/guides/guide_of_the_month/EQ_GoM_0206_sm.jpg" height="192" border="0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="5" color="#ffffff"&gt;Guide Vantique&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;1. Why did you become a Guide?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;I originally became a guide in 2004 so that I could help the players of Everquest.  As a Customer Service Manager for many many years, it seemed natural for me to assist and it always seemed that there were never enough guides to assist in things that the players wished to do.  I wanted to be able to extend myself to assist in things I know I would want to do as a player.  The more I guided, though, the more I loved it, and wished to be more part of enhancing the players experience within the Realm of Norrath. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;2. What games do you guide on? For how long?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;I have guided on EQPC or EQ1 for 1 year, 4 months now, and have loved every day of it!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;3. What is your guide race and class?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;My guide race is a weee short purple wood elf, who has claimed the class of Bard, however all who know me will tell you, I will fumble strings on my instrument and trip over things left out in the zones.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;4. What is your favorite color? &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;My favorite color would have to be green, as it reminds me of the woods, and trees, and lush green grass in which is provided to us, but purple just seemed the be more of a fit for the clumsy one.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;5. What is your favorite land (zone)? Why?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;My favorite zone to be in is Greater Faydark.  Granted, many times you will find me congo'ing in the Plane of Knowledge, however, I truly find myself at home within the tree city of Kelethin.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;6. What has been your best or favorite moment as a Guide?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;WOW!  There have been so many!  If I truly had to pick one moment in time to freeze that I could relive forever, it would be the infamous &amp;quot;Congo&amp;quot; line within the Plane of Knowledge on the Druzzil Ro Server.  There were about 50 people who followed along, shouting their names, and singing weee rhymes as we circled New Tanaan several times.  I remember at one point in time, I had turned around to see the players, and had so many people behind me at the time, I completely froze!  I remember the players going, &amp;quot;Uh, is the dance over?&amp;quot;  As soon as I could gather my senses again, the line continued, louder, and more fun than ever!  &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;7. What is your favorite quest, event, or knowledge circle? What do you do the most of?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;Well, now again, there are so many, but if I had to pick one, it would be the Festival of Love.  The event, the quest, and the whole part of it seems truly uplifting to me, and I get all giddy just thinking about it!  The players enjoy it, the guide team enjoys it, and I have done many a wedding during this festival! &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;8. What has been your worst of least favorite moment as being a Guide?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;To be honest, I have not had a least favorite moment, as all of it has been quite enjoyable for me.  The only thing that maybe disheartening for me, would be watching fellow players and guides leave to join the outside world.  As much as I know it needs them, it is like losing a friend at times, and breaks my heart.  &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;9. As a player have you every run into any Guides and events?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;Back a couple of years ago, I participated in a Rumble event, and enjoyed every minute of it!  Since then, I have been able to participate in fishing tournaments, other Royal Rumbles, and a High dive, or two.  Maybe it was three or four?  *Giggles loudly!*&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;10. What is your favorite thing about this Game?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;My favorite thing about EverQuest is the People.  I love the players, the guides, and those awesome GM's that I have the greatest pleasure with.  From high end raiders, down to the new people who have come in, and are looking for guidance.  From my guild mates, to my guide mates, these people are what keep me alive the most!  I have a very close relationship with many of the players in this game, and they are what keep me here, and keep smiling!  And sometimes, there are those mischievous ones, who keep me tripping! *Cackles loudly then SNORTS!*  &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;11. What do you plan to do in the future as a Guide? Any goals?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;Oh I have lots of goals in mind as far as the guide program.  One of them is possibly continuing my guiding experience within the lands of EverQuest 2, and at some point in time, I would like to assist and serve the program as an Elder Guide. However, until then, being able to pass Senior training to assist and serve not only guides, but players as well, is my biggest goal to attain at the moment. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;I would just like to say, Thank you very much for giving me the honor of being chosen as Guide of The Month.  It truly is an honor!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt; *Vantique the Clumsy One bows, then falls flat over on her face!*&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>EQ Guide of the Month - January 2006</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=eventgazette&amp;message.id=4#M4</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff size=5&gt;EQ Live Guide of the Month - January 2006 &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;I&gt;The EverQuest Guide Program is a program of volunteers. These volunteers dedicate their own time and energy to enrich the world of Norrath. As a "Thank you" to them, Guides of the month have and will be chosen for their exemplary contributions. &lt;/I&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;I&gt;Heralds speak of a strange occurrence outside of Blackburrow. Rumors spread of a few small gnome reporters trying to capture an image of a young Human bard standing tall before the Gnolls. The story grows as does the number of Gnolls defeated. What can be gathered as truth though is a small questionnaire being passed around about Shaighla. &lt;/I&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;H2 align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=165 src="http://eq2players.station.sony.com/images/en/guides/guide_of_the_month/EQ_GoM_0106_sm.jpg" width=200 border=0&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;FONT size=5&gt;Guide Shaighla&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;1. Why did you become a Guide? &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;I became a guide way back in 2001. The game has come such a long way. With my 20 years of RL customer service, I set out as a young guide to treat the players in the game the way I related my customers. I wanted to treat the other players with respect, dignity, empathy, and real concern. I listened to their complaints, gave them an ear and suggested ways they could help avoid situations and repair them on their own. I always believed in letting the player control their destiny. I used my god given tools to help when I could and explained with empathy when I couldn't do what they wished. I always attempted to give them advice as to other routes to get a satisfactory solution to their problem. I never forgot there was a real person behind the character.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;2. What games do you guide on? For how long? &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;I put all my efforts into Everquest 1. I have often considered going to other games, but I like to keep a balance in all I do. I'm not yet ready to give up my friends in this Norrath or the adventures I enjoy, so I am not yet ready to move on. I'm a little leery of splitting my time in two directions, but the day may come. I've been a guide twice, my time is getting close to 2 years combined.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;3. What is your guide race and class? &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;My guide is race is human and I am a bard. At heart I want to entertain the masses.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;4. What is your favorite color? &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;My favorite color is blue. It became my favorite color the first time I hailed a blue skinned Dark Elf. They were so cute with their well formed bodies. I then vowed to only wear blue and keep my hair a grey/blue shade to go with it. My love of blue is in no doubt a direct result of the illegitimate blood line. My mother's Great Grandpappy is said to be a Dark Elf himself.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;5. What is your favorite land (zone)? Why? &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;My favorite land is Qeynos Hills and the river banks of West Karana. These were my earliest hunting grounds, and where I ran in the fields of wild flowers in my youth. I'll never forget the fear of the first Giant that stood on me, the first diseased grizzly that bit me, or the first time I lost my body down a tree stump in Black Burrow. The hills and dungeons of my earliest youth will always be held the fondest in my heart.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;6. What has been your best or favorite moment as a Guide? &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;My favorite moment as a guide has to be the Harvest Event this year in which GM Deodan stepped in to play one of the actors when my partner was ill and had to leave. This was the costume event and low and behold, one of the citizens came traipsing out of the Beholder entranceway (where we sent them to get changed) dressed as GM Deodan himself and spoofed him verbally! This actor had no idea he was doing this to his namesake. I was laughing so hard I could hardly type and it was very well done. This definitely a memorable moment for me. There have been many other memorable moments, but this one does stand out.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;7. What is your favorite quest, event, or knowledge circle? What do you do the most of? &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;I have loved my time on Stormhammer with the opportunity to play in the GM events each week. These are definitely my favorite and will really miss them now that Stormhammer has ended. Second to these, I love to roam the lands and chat with people doing boring camps and threaten to hunt gnomes and offer them Genduxcis (Duck Duck, sp) sand....uhm...Gnome sandwiches. People in small groups are my favorite. It's so hard to pick a favorite!&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;8. What has been your worst of least favorite moment as being a Guide? &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;I'm a very optimistic person so picking a least or worst moment as a guide is far more difficult then a favorite. I like to learn my lesson quickly from the bad and move on to the good. My least favorite would be back in November 2002 when a serious personal matter took me away from guiding. Writing my resignation letter was my worst moment. I'm glad I could eventually come back.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;9. As a player have you every run into any Guides and events? &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;Unbelievably, I have yet to ever run into a guide event as a player during my time online. I have however, run into guides occasionally and I like to chat to them and tease them and just torment them! Well gotta have some fun.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;10. What is your favorite thing about this Game? &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;My favorite thing about the game is the definitely the people. It's wonderful to be able to sit in my office and have a social realm to play on! I've met and gone on trips with many of the people I've played with over the years, and miss my friends and guild mates when I can't play. The people keep me here, both guiding and playing.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;11. What do you plan to do in the future as a Guide? Any goals? &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;My goals as a guide mimic my goals in life. Keep a healthy balance in all I do. I guide, play and enjoy RL in a balance and I hope to continue that. As my RL is less busy I may have more time to commit to guiding and possibly could add EverQuest II as a game and guide to my enjoyment at some point this year. Part of me would like to join a training team or maybe become a Senior Guide, but I would have to give that some serious thought. I have to be certain I have enough of me available to give any role I take it's full due. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;Thank you for the honour of being a first Guide of the Month. "Shaighla bows to all and holds up her Valtron's brew in Cheers."&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;font face="Arial"&gt;The Event Gazette Issue 2 - "EXTRA! EXTRA! Gnomish festival ends with a BANG!”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our diligent reporters searched far and wide looking for reports of more Gnomish calibrations.&amp;nbsp; From Al`Kabor scavenger hunts for missing parts, to renegade tinkered robots on Prexus.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here are some etchings from those events. While these are the only images we have, these are not all of the events that we have heard taking place. . . &lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/issue002/bristlebanepvp.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/issue002/sm_bristlebanepvp.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;
The calm before the storm. PVP fighters gather on Bristlebane.&#xD;
&lt;/div&gt;&#xD;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/issue002/cazicthulepvp.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/issue002/sm_cazicthulepvp.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;
Cazic Thule also was host to the brave, yet tiny, gladiators.&#xD;
&lt;/div&gt;&#xD;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/issue002/fenninroscavenger.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/issue002/sm_fenninroscavenger.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;
A scavenger hunt was on the agenda for Fennin Ro.&#xD;
&lt;/div&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/issue002/prexusrobots1.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/issue002/sm_prexusrobots1.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;
A clockwork menace plagued Prexus...&#xD;
&lt;/div&gt;&#xD;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/issue002/prexusrobots2.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/issue002/sm_prexusrobots2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;
&lt;font face="Arial" size="4"&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;Until heroes gathered to defeat the rusty menace.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We hear from our Gnome friends that this Festival has finished, but that we should keep our eyes dry and our ears open next month as the sounds of love fill the air. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr size="2" width="100%"&gt;&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;font size="5"&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Classified Section&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;font face="Arial" size="4"&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;Did you know that Guides ran 176 quests/events in Everquest Live last month?

      <title>The Event Gazette Issue 1 - "Gnomish featherweights fight fiercely in Tinkerfest fueled fracas"</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=eventgazette&amp;message.id=1#M1</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Dateline Norrath - &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Tinkerfest kicked off this month with Gnomish battles across Norrath. Our intrepid reporters were on the scene for two of these strange affairs. The first on Tunare and the second on Maelin. While these were the first such events to be captured in images, reports of more events are being heard daily. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Many thanks are due to the Guides who were instrumental in bringing these events to the notice of the world. Without these brave and resourceful volunteers, such events would probably never see the light of day. We hope to hear from these unique individuals as they are able to make reports in the future.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;This unusual affair began yesterday when adventurers around the world&amp;nbsp;were interrupted in their quests. A gnome addressed everyone who would listen and spoke of&amp;nbsp;a grand melee that&amp;nbsp;was about to take place. This was to be no nomal feat of strength, however. No, this clash of the titans was to be miniature in nature. It would pit newbie casters of Gnomish heritage against each other in a fight to the death. Only the most cunning would survive.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Levels and armor and high-powered spells had no place in this battle of the mini-casters. All combatants were of level one and could use only spells and fists to determine who would reign on this day. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;At great risk to their own personal safety, our reporters brought back these etchings of this unusual event.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;The participants gather. Note the friendly demeanor despite knowledge of the impending violence.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;A href="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/issue001/event02.jpg" target=_blank&gt;&lt;IMG src="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/issue001/sm_event02.jpg"&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The action begins. Some of the combatants take up strategic positions in hopes of striking a surprise hit on unsuspecting passer-bys. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;A href="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/issue001/event03.jpg" target=_blank&gt;&lt;IMG src="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/issue001/sm_event03.jpg"&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Oh, the Gnomanity!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;A href="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/issue001/event04.jpg" target=_blank&gt;&lt;IMG src="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/issue001/sm_event04.jpg"&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Fisticuffs were a legal form of combat that supplemented the use of spells. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;A href="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/issue001/event05.jpg" target=_blank&gt;&lt;IMG src="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/issue001/sm_event05.jpg"&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;An aptly-named Gnomish gladiator.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;A href="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/issue001/event06.jpg" target=_blank&gt;&lt;IMG src="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/issue001/sm_event06.jpg"&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;One on one duels were common...&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;A href="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/issue001/event07.jpg" target=_blank&gt;&lt;IMG src="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/issue001/sm_event07.jpg"&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;With a typical outcome for one of the fighters.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;(Maelin)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;A href="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/issue001/event08.jpg" target=_blank&gt;&lt;IMG src="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/issue001/sm_event08.jpg"&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The Gnomes gather...&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;A href="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/issue001/event09.jpg" target=_blank&gt;&lt;IMG src="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/issue001/sm_event09.jpg"&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;It does not take long for action to ensue. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;A href="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/issue001/event10.jpg" target=_blank&gt;&lt;IMG src="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/issue001/sm_event10.jpg"&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Wherever you turned, there was a threat or a target.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;A href="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/issue001/event11.jpg" target=_blank&gt;&lt;IMG src="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/images/content_images/gazette/issue001/sm_event11.jpg"&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The casualty list grew rapidly as the event went on. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;In the end there could be only one...well, three...well, actually, three per event. The Gnomes who emerged victorious were:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Tunare - &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr 0px? **SMURF**?MARGIN-RIGHT:&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;1st Tinkerfesting&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;2nd Gnorax&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;3rd Xenikpus&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Camo and Leginye were lauded for their outstanding spell-by-spell running commentaries of the action!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV dir=ltr&gt;Maelin - &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr 0px? **SMURF**?MARGIN-RIGHT:&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV dir=ltr&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;1st Fortehwin&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;2nd Nildapus&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;3rd Zenditin&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV dir=ltr&gt;So, keep your ears open and watch for announcements from strange Gnomes. You never know when they will be in your area looking for Gnomes of high-quality, but low skill to partcipate in another trial by combat!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV dir=ltr&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
