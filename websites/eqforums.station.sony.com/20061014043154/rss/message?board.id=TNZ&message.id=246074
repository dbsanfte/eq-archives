    <description>I haven't seen mushrooms in test tutorial the 3 or 4 times I tried earleir this week. They were there on another server, I think Cazic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The mushrooms used to pop under the wood walkway/ramp behind where the corpse priest stands now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

      <description>In the tutorial, Xenaida asks you to find her some mushrooms. Unfortunately, the new corpse Priest is standing where they usually are, and no mushrooms are visible. Has the location of them changed ?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Paris&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;You still have the problem though that newbies tend to die a lot and corpses don't decay anymore until the rez timer expires. That is going to mean an awful lot of corpses piling up around the corpse summoner NPC. Get enough of them and the zone will lag and may even crash from time to time. Since tutorial is instanced, the instance itself may disappear and leave everyone who was playing in that particular instance stranded without their corpses. I never understood why corpses were changed to not decay until after rez timer expired. Once someone loots a corpse and leaves it behind, it was always understood that they weren't actively seeking a rez for that corpse any longer. If someone wanted a rez in the past, they would simply loot and leave one item on the corpse, extending the decay timer until a rezzer could be found. Also, when you drag a corpse now to a safe place to loot, and it doesn't vanish when you finish, you have the inconvenience of having to drop the corpse or else if you forget you end up running around with a corpse still dragging basically making you look like the dork who comes out of the men's room with a streamer of toilet paper attached to their shoe. Another thing, if you have multiple corpses in a zone, and need to find it, locate corpse spells can end up leading you to a corpse that you don't want and you have to keep searching for it. Sometimes it homes in on a corpse that you already located and makes it frustrating to find the one you are looking for. For casters with the spell, all it costs them is mana, but for thse of us who use chipped bone rods, we are wasting an item that costs us time and money to acquire. With only 3 charges, if I have 4 or more corpses in a zone, I may never locate the one I am looking for.</description>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Comic Sans MS" color=#993300 size=3&gt;Ah had that problem ^ with mah DESK in Nek2.0, died twice, second time was after going LD and as everyone who has been killed after going LD your corpse could be literally anywhere in the zone (including places you can not normally get to), found the first one (which had died and been looted the day before) but it took 3 corpse-finders/summoners working together to find mah latest fully-geared corpse (the summoners started from all 3 ZI and pretty much did a complete search of the zone twice each before the correct corpse was found, didn't matter where they started from they kept finding the wrong corpse)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Comic Sans MS" color=#993300 size=3&gt;Ah've been against the death penalty being introduced to Gloomingdeep from the start, lower the level outside by all means, but leave the Mines alone&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Comic Sans MS" color=#993300 size=3&gt;Btw, exp loss was dropped from 11 to 6, does that mean gear staying on corpses also dropped by 5? And if not, why not?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;I am wondering if the corpse summoner is a good idea at all. It really teaches newbies nothing about having to track down their corpses and takes away the whole "reason" the level was lowered in the first place. I would love to hear (read) someone /ooc "Krenshin is down! Come loot your corpses!"&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;Ehh, with guild lobby and the corpse summoner there now, they don't have to worry about corpse runs anymore.&amp;nbsp; i do think it was sort of silly to make them pay for deaths by losing exp if they cannot get rezzes though.&amp;nbsp; not that there's a ton of exp loss, but...&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;The corpse summoner probably works acroos multiple instances ot the tutorial.&amp;nbsp; I died on lumensen in the tutorial at 11 before the change and spawned naked in the WRONG instance.&amp;nbsp; I was very frustated by not being able to get back to the instance where my corpse was no matter how many times I told Arias rejoin my companionsand logged out/in, rebooted, ect.&amp;nbsp; It would be very discouraging to a new player to get most of their glooming gear and not be able to recover it for a day or so.&amp;nbsp; Better to move the shrooms if the summoner is there to work around the wrong instance respawn.</description>

      <description>Yes it was because of the tutorial instances that the corpse summoner was put into the trutorial.&amp;nbsp; You can't do a CR if your corpse is in a different instance then you are.&amp;nbsp; People will still have plenty of time throughout their journey to learn about real CRs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;but honestly, who does corpse runs anymore?&amp;nbsp; if youve died, you're going to want a rez and you're not going to get a cleric to run to the zone for it.&amp;nbsp; you're going to summon it, get a rez, and get rebuffed.&amp;nbsp; if youre group died, your gonna summon to the guild lobby.&amp;nbsp; if your group cleric/pally/necro/shaman/druid didn't die, you're not going to need to do a cr.&amp;nbsp; the problem with the corpse summoner in the tutorial is the way corpses stay around when there is experience on them.&amp;nbsp; you cannot get an exp rez inside the tutorial, so the corpse doesn't go away.&amp;nbsp; how many newbs know about the /hidecorpse key?&amp;nbsp; if the summoner has all these 7 day corpses hanging around, the mushrooms are going to be hidden, lag occurs, and people cannot easily find their corpses.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;You guys should make a level 6 cleric exp rez for like 1% experience just so the corpses can go away.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;That will deffinatly help matters out but something still needs to be done about the corpses and the lag.&amp;nbsp; Any new players will think the game is all laggy like that.&amp;nbsp; PoK usually is but no reason to turn them off before they get there. lol</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;OMG this is the most horrible thing I have ever seen. If you are trying to teach newbies about death and corpse runs, then having an NPC that summons corpses is not the way to do it. I went on today just to see what everyone was talking about and it was awful. There were 100 corpses stacked up around this priest and the area was lagging horribly. Not only that, but all the NPC inside tutorial were bald and&amp;nbsp;in their underwear. I hope we aren't on the verge of another naked models bug.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;It doesn't help that newb corpses stay around for 7 days...maybe reduce the timer to a few hours at most?&amp;nbsp; I don't think anyone who can get into the tutorial can rez as it is....doesn't make much sense to let the corpses rot and stink up the place...I saw the&amp;nbsp;NPC's wearing clothes-pins on their noses the other day.</description>
