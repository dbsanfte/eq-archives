<DIV>1)&nbsp;Perhaps the recruiting functions should've been here at POK or Bazaar. More logical places, with more </DIV>
<DIV>incidental traffic. Nice idea of offering a port to Lake Rath, but still...</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>2) Agree with another&nbsp;poster regarding activity announcements. The assumption&nbsp;appears to&nbsp;be that&nbsp;people were going to be logged in all the time. Probably not the most realistic of assumptions. Apparently, some announcements</DIV>
<DIV>started popping up in the website, but towards the end of the festival.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>3) What benefit to the general population does a race of 1st level characters provide? For fun factor, would</DIV>
<DIV>rather see a game of gnome ball between the "tall" races of each guild.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Personally I can't comment of the event as a whole, as I decided to spend the weekend at the beach. So far, have not heard any overwhelmingly positive comments in game.</DIV>
