				<DIV></DIV>eq was a different game when vp got revamped. 60hp+ gear in the bazaar was considered very nice to most the population. people in time were looked on as gods, anyone who wasnt in the elemental planes loved ldon. The items linked from the&nbsp;revamped vp seemed awesome to many. OOW and beyond&nbsp;changed all that though. Like the dev said, it was made for the time.
