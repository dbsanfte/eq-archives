				<DIV>Offtopic perhaps... but I met my wife online in 1997 on mIRC, we moved in with eachother in 1998 - she moved to me in The Netherlands in 1998, we got married in 1999, I started playing EQ in 2000, stopped playing in 2001. Moved to the United States in 2002 (she is American, I am Dutch), I played EQ for only a few months in early 2003, and then quit completely till Feb 2004. Its now January 2005, I have a lvl 60 chanter, and am still happily married.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>For the record, I value my real life a heck of a lot more then the game, thats why it took so long to get to 60 <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-wink.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0> - and possibly why I am still married and very happily so! <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0></DIV>
