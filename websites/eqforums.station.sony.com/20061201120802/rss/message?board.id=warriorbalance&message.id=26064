&lt;P&gt;It's more of the mechanic of the spell than it's usage or any class balance issues...&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;With the way SK spells have trended, the pally version is like&amp;nbsp;a "mitigation tap"... I think a better anti-version of Challenge for Power should have been a short duration buff castable on others that &lt;EM&gt;decreases &lt;/EM&gt;aggro generation and adds the mitigation effect.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;It would be a bit more valiant,&amp;nbsp;seem like a lot less selfish, and from your quote, would probably be a bit more useful for helping/saving others than something that doesn't replace your faster casting and lower mana cost stuns as an aggro tool.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Both will not do very good DPS - that quite frankly is because we aren't allowed to be the masters of all weapons - Knights are special and get near Epic Quality 1Handers, while we have to make do with weapons intended to be weilded two at a time. We can pay AA (when we're high enough in level) to get some small improvement and get the equivilant of a small ratio boost - while Knights get huge ratio boost absolutely FREE.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;It sounds good in theory, but take out a Paladin with a BoFF with aggro proc and a 2.0 with 2 aggro procs (since you can) and the swing aggro gap is fairly sizeable. Also you must remember that all Knight triple attack AAs are aimed at 2h use only. Whereas Warriors can quadruple attack without restriction. Knights do trade out a fair amount of aggro to use a 1h actually. Also we trade out a lot of DPS for using a 1h weapon.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Also talking about things one class gets and another doesn't. Paladins don't get the possibility of wielding 4 procs. We don't get a natural aggro modifier for being who we are. We get one aggro mod item which kinda sucks really.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Yet again I still agree with Warriors being able to use shields from 100% to 0%, but don't be under the illusion that there's no trade off, that's just naive.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Honestly I think the shield issue wasn't that warriors "wanted' to use it, not many use it even now in group settings. They wanted the "option" to be able to use it practically in a group.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Sk's didn't too poorly either, our agro spells were all upgraded and they are unlinked now so I can chain cast ToV and ToD and the new ac, agro over time, buff goes to the song box and not the buff box. Not to mention the cloak and shroud spell upgrades.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;And for those of us not in the most Uber gear, it's nice to know we can use the shield effectively. Some thing's can be a little easier now, the cleric won't have to worry as much, etc.&amp;nbsp; If I want to use a shield I can use one, and yes, It's a big benefit, especially when using shield block (HUGE). IF the content is trivial (to me), NO, I won't use it.</description>

&lt;P&gt;Let me give some more current information, that stuff is pretty old.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=postbody&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Ability #4707: Veteran's Fury &lt;BR&gt;Description: Increases damage dealt when you land a critical hit on a melee attack by 10% per rank. This ability does not affect special attacks. &lt;BR&gt;Cost per Level: 3&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Ability #4722: Mercy Kill &lt;BR&gt;Description: Increases the level of NPCs that can be slain by your finishing blow to 66, 68 and 70 per rank. &lt;BR&gt;Cost per Level: 3 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Ability #4725: Rage of Serpent Spine &lt;BR&gt;Description: Each rank of this ability increases the maximum amount of attack you can gain from items. &lt;BR&gt;Cost per Level: 5 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Ability #4730: Endurance of Serpent Spine &lt;BR&gt;Description: This ability increases your natural endurance regeneration by 1 point per rank. &lt;BR&gt;Cost per Level: 5 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Ability #4733: Greater Ingenuity &lt;BR&gt;Description: Years of experimentation have led to the discovery of how to gain additional performance (in the form of critical spell hits) from weapons and other items. Each rank in this ability should increase your critical hit chance with such items by 3% per rank. &lt;BR&gt;Cost per Level: 1 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Ability #4736: Ingenuity Mastery &lt;BR&gt;Description: Extensive experimentation has enabled you to deal more damage with your critical hits done by spells and abilities of magical and mechanical items. Each rank in this ability increases the crit damage of such items by 10% per rank. &lt;BR&gt;Cost per Level: 1 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Ability #4739: Killing Spree &lt;BR&gt;Description: After slaying an enemy, you have a 3% chance per rank to enter a battle frenzy that increases your offensive damage for the next thirty seconds. &lt;BR&gt;Cost per Level: 5 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Ability #4742: Hold the Line &lt;BR&gt;Description: Hold the Line increases the amount of hit points healed by healing spells that land on you by 10%, but reduces your offensive damage by 25% as well. &lt;BR&gt;Cost per Level: 5 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=postbody&gt;All those are in except Ingenuity Mastery it appears, which got the axe...&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=postbody&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=postbody&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Ability #591: Savage Onslaught &lt;BR&gt;Description: This ability increases the chance to make a flurry attack upon a successful triple attack. &lt;BR&gt;Cost per Level: 5 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=postbody&gt;Yes, there's another 3 levels of Flurry&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=postbody&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=postbody&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Ability #618: Overbear &lt;BR&gt;Description: This ability gives you a chance to bypass your opponents' special defenses such as dodge, block, parry, and riposte. &lt;BR&gt;Cost per Level: 3 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=postbody&gt;I don't remember if this got the axe or not, I don't beleieve it did.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=postbody&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=postbody&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Ability #605: Shield Specialist &lt;BR&gt;Description: As long as a shield is equipped, each rank in Shield Specialist confers a 2% damage bonus to attacks made by a weapon held in a warrior's primary hand. &lt;BR&gt;Cost per Level: 5 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This has been dramatically changed.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=postbody&gt;Each rank gives 5% more damage in the primary hand when a shield is equipped in the offhand.&amp;nbsp; There are 5 levels, so this confers a 25% boost to main hand damage when maxed while a shield is equipped in the offhand.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=postbody&gt;Also, as a secondary feature to go along with this, but usable at all times, Mock and it's upgrade, Scowl, have been moved to their own timer separate from Bazu AND Cyclone Blade (And it's upgrade, Vortex Blade).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This is a pretty dramatic upgrade, you'll want to watch your END, cause you'll be able to burn through it SUPER fast.&amp;nbsp; The good news is the ooc combat regen rate is VERY high, I was able to go from 0 to 13k endurance in 2 mins once I hit the regen timer.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=postbody&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Ability #606: Mark of the Mage Hunter &lt;BR&gt;Description: When activated, Mark of the Mage Hunter reduces the damage of incoming spells by 200. &lt;BR&gt;Cost per Level: 9 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This is a really sweet AA, and it's had it's timer removed, there's a max absorbed of 5khp.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=postbody&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=postbody&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=postbody&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Ability #607: Hamstring &lt;BR&gt;Description: Hamstring is a crippling attack that slows your opponents' movement rate and reduces their ability to effectively use armor for a short peroid of time. Each additional rank in Hamstring increases the amount of AC denied by the Hamstring attack. &lt;BR&gt;Cost per Level: 3 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Hamstring got the axe... in it's place, we're getting 5 more levels of Sturdiness.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=postbody&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;SPAN class=postbody&gt;Ability #611: Battle Leap &lt;BR&gt;Description: Battle Leap enables you to spring forward into combat. Your momentum will confer a boost to your attacks for a short period of time. When used, Battle Leap will remove any levitation effects. &lt;BR&gt;Cost per Level: 9 &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I love this AA, for the fun more than anything else.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; It shoots you about 100 feet in the direction you're facing and gives you a pretty decent attack boost.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The primary use in my view is&amp;nbsp;for engaging raid NPC's giving you a big jump ahead of others to let you gank initial aggro fast.&amp;nbsp;It's also helpful for running away from mobs.&amp;nbsp; &#xD;
&lt;P&gt;One that was also missed was Grapple, which is a reverse of Press the Attack, with a shorter refresh.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;"&lt;SPAN class=postbody&gt;Yes, there's another 3 levels of Flurry"&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN class=postbody&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN class=postbody&gt;When this and the Sturdyness upgrade went in, I started having some hope for this expansion.&amp;nbsp; Frodlin did some awesome work to get us a decent set of AA's.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN class=postbody&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN class=postbody&gt;"The good news is the ooc combat regen rate is VERY high, I was able to go from 0 to 13k endurance in 2 mins once I hit the regen timer."&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN class=postbody&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN class=postbody&gt;Basically, when you stop fighting, a timer starts, when the timer is up(30 seconds iirc), you can sit, and get vastly improved regen for mana/hp's/endurence.&amp;nbsp; From the time you stop fightimg, till you are topped off, is 3 minutes.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN class=postbody&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN class=postbody&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;I'm sorry BB... but when I see you congratulating yourself and claiming that "Warriors" ought to be pretty happy in general, it leaves a sour taste in my mouth.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The only Warriors that are happy with the changes are the 70+ Warriors with the equip and abilities and AAs to take advantage of these changes.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Out of all the low-end Warrior things you listed you're such a proponent of... I don't see you making as loud a fuss about practically none of that changing...&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>I think Warirors should be pretty happy in general.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yes, there are some issues but they are not as major as they were in the past. Look at what has changed - OoC regen, Mock and Bazu unlinked, some (despite going overboard with nerfing TSS) more difficult content where Warrior intended greater survivability allows us to shine rather than being Knights without powerful spellbook, Commanding Voice, healing potions, ....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sure I could be a "glass is half empty" person and roll into the next "big issue", but in fact more was put into the glass and all of it was fairly significant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You once commented that level 56-68, where my Pally twink was very dominent AND I POINTED IT OUT, was merely a transitory phase that players went though quickly. Now you apparently claim I lack concern and that 70+ players aren't a fairly large portion of the population where issues like aggro come to a head.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mock and Bazu are unlinked. Shield Mastery (or whatever it's called) has 5 levels, each one improving a (high enough level) Warrior's DPS when using a shield.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There was some progress.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I guess there's no pleasing you and you need to start some threads discussing level 70- Wariror issues. Heck, I might even - AFTER I see what TSS contains and if I have a conviction that there are some important issues remaining that need to be addressed (beyond giving Warirors an ability like WoT or DS, which Frodlin is quietly advancing).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;What I disagree with is your blatant use of your 56-68 Paladin as the benchmark for what improvements need to be made for 70+ raid geared Warriors.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I too am waiting to see what from TSS gives Warriors the boosts they need to contend with your 56-68 Paladin twink... but all the things you are so happy about are all major boosts to your raid geared Warrior, and do absolutely nothing for the Warriors competing with your Pally twink...&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Really though, if you do look back at alot of stuff that BB meantioned, he was using the ease of his Pally comparing it to the hardships of the warrior for the most part, in the same said content.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;BB has been on these boards going nuts about certain issue's that needed to be done. Alot has been done, so he has backed off, and is happy that things actually happened, rather then just "evaluating".&amp;nbsp; I have to admit, I am the same way right now. I feel really good about the things that have been addressed. I don't know exactly what the new expansion has to offer yet for lower levels, so there is nothing I can really say for sure right now. I can say I am concerned, but I can't say there is nothing there till I've looked into it. BB bassically has to do the same thing.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;If BB come up yelling already, about the massive overlook of lower level warrior's, how would that look? I'm sure it would look like for someone that has been able to aquire ALOT of what they asked for in the last two expansion's, he is just never going to be happy. However, that's not the case, he is generally happy. It show's that SOE is listening, and that everything is not ignored. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;And although you would more then likely aggree with BB on a mission for lower level warrior's, there would be other knight's saying "Your just never satisfied, and you'll never be happy!" Maybe not you, but I guarrentee they would be in here in flock's if the warrior definition's was back in the top 3 or 4 active threads on these forum's. All of them to go head to head with BB in his "Never satisfied" rants. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I'm just saying, BB is being wise not to raise a bunch of issue's right now. Need to go play the game and enjoy what is there for now, and come back after we know what is not there.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Actually... that's my biggest peeve... the massive overlook of lower level warriors have been thrown around these boards quite often when talking about balance... comparing BoDs to DoN axes, Stuns to Bellow...&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Warrior aggro issues hit the class the hardest at the lower end... with weaker weaponry and little to no access to major aggro boosting items/effects:&amp;nbsp; the Warriors competing with the Paladin twink BB loves to showboat.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;I tried to bring that up, a while ago,&amp;nbsp; a few time's (you both backed me up a bit). I don't remember where it is, and don't remember who said what, but I do remember one major thing that made me kind of just give up for that time period.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Someone posted that it's only natural as you level up, that you would be able to get more skills. At the time, I was pretty new to the board's, and it really effected me, because it was kind of a brutal post. A couple other time's same type of situation happened, so I kind of got away from that, seeing as it wasn't coming up.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I remember saying something to Frodlin about the top 10 list effecting only the higher end, and it came off as an attack, which he defended (not brutally). He was right at the time, but I can't help going back to that point, where I was sure it wouldn't effect anyone but the high end and/or higher levels, and in hindsight, I was right. The top ten asks for&amp;nbsp; warrior help in mostly general (at the time), yet when fixing things, it only included the top five levels, and then only the top level for the best stuff. They (not Frodlin, but the team that does this stuff) didn't let any of it scale down, and instead started it right at the highest five levels (and again now). When talking about levels from 1 to 70 (and now 75), the top 5 are not the mid levels, they are the high levels.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I guess to get anything for the lower end, you must be more specific in the top 10 list. Giving a starting level, and how it should scale up, instead of starting at the top level, and no scaling down.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Shield use is a general weak setup for Warriors... and it can be claimed that the weakness only&amp;nbsp;magnifies class imbalance as higher AC shields are obtained and Shield Block is available.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I don't, however, believe that the ability to use a shield viably should be reserved for only high-end Warriors... thus my disappointment in seeing only higher end shield use addressed.&lt;/P&gt;</description>
