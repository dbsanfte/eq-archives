				<DIV>In July of 2000 I created an Everquest character Summerfawn so that I could be in the game and chat with friends. I had separated from my husband early in 1999 and had a lot of new time on my hands. In August while fighting with a Ranger named Simone, she invited a little blue dwarf warrior named Oskar. After the first night of fighting together we ended up sitting on the Kelethin platforms talking until 4:00a.m. the next morning. We continued to fight together, getting to know each other and having fun on the game. I knew soon after playing with him that I was feeling more than just friendship but at the time was very negative toward men and relationships in general. I did not want to tell him I was in love with him so I told another player who in the end told him. He loved me too, that was the good part. In December of that year he travelled from Kansas City, Missouri to Florida to meet me in person. We went to Disney World for a week and just got to know each other, then I took him to meet my then teenage son and all the friends he had been talking to in game that were my real life friends. Our characters married in the game on January 6, 2001. Oskar proposed on the shore of Lake Rathetear. We dated for three years travelling back and forth from Missouri and Florida or meeting in different places. On January 6, 2004, we married in real life. The same day our characters married in the game. We had an Everquest wedding dressing in costumes that looked like our characters and having our ceremony at the Excalibur Hotel in Las Vegas which is a medavial castle. Recently, we celebrated our one year anniversary. We still play Everquest, having 12 accounts between the two of us. We love the game and love each other very much. You can look at the wedding pictures if you like by going to our guild page at www.heartsofesprit.com/wedding/</DIV>
