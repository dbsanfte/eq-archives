<DIV>Hello From E3 on day Three!!</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I am sitting in the Tech room waiting to get some more pictures to show you.&nbsp; Brenlo put up a few in his <A href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=brenlo&amp;message.id=61" target=_blank>Coffee Diaries</A> yesterday.&nbsp; It was tough getting to the show today, we took Brenlo's car because we had to check out of our hotel.&nbsp; Trying to find parking at the convention center is "fun," no really it was a joy <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-wink.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I am still a bit excited about what happened yesterday evening.&nbsp; Brenlo and I went out to dinner in Hollywood and as we were walking back to the car we noticed a crowd of people crossing the street.&nbsp; They had just finished the Premire for the "Longest Yard," and everyone was heading to the after party.&nbsp; I got to see Adam Sandler and tons of other celebrities but&nbsp;I won't bore you with that for now...</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The booth is a hopping place this morning there is lots to see, I plan to get the camera out and take more pictures today.&nbsp; I probably won't get to post those until Monday though.&nbsp; For now here is a picture of Antonia on day one with an EQ player.&nbsp; Look he has a Fan Faire shirt on.&nbsp; <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0></DIV>
