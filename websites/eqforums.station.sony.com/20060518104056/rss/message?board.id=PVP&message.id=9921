    <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Welp, after the last week of this merge, I can say that recently I'm a lot less motivated to play.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Let's see:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;No GM presence on the various Zek servers prior to the merge, resulted in multiple people being intentionally corpse camped until servers were brought down so that they lose their gear, potentially permanently.&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Lack of REAL and PROMPT GM assistance for those players who had to suffer this problem.&amp;nbsp; Some people getting character restores from DAYS previous to the merger, having lost experience, items, and flags.&amp;nbsp; These items are probably gone forever, or at least until they go through the entire process of reacquiring.&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Lack of educated, intelligent GM monitoring of major PvP zones has allowed people who have promised on this very board multiple times that they'd break the PnP policy whenever and however they could to do just that without any sort of real fear of being caught and banned.&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;This STUPID and possibly predjudiced actions of GM's when they are present, ie:&amp;nbsp;casting a blind on one side PvP'ing but not the other...&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;The lack of any REAL GM response to people breaking PnP policies to disrupt raids and crashing zones.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;This is the short list.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;In short, the Sony CS has done it's absolute worst to support a smooth transition.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Sony CS, you suck, and I see nothing to indicate you're going to do anything at all to even prove that you really exist (other than smurf this post).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I predict that when you finally turn on the server transfer, and you better [procreational expletive voluntarily censored] do it, and do it soon.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Why?&amp;nbsp; Because, I've been so [blasphemous expletive voluntarily censored] fed up with all the broken promises you [elimination orafice expletive voluntarily censored] guys have made over the years, I've dusted off an old magneto optical drive, taken digital photographs of my monitor with a clock, calandar, and daily paper in plain view with these promises you've made, and have burned those images to an optical WORM platter.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Should Sony chose to break yet another promise and not allow characters off this fiasco of a server, I'm burning 20 copies of the optical platter, with a letter of explanation to&amp;nbsp;10 of the most voracious Class Action law firms in this country and another 10 copies with letters to the top 10 PC gaming magezines, and lastly, I'll send copies of the letters to all your various competitors out there.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Go ask your corporate attorneys about the validity of using WORM media in court, and how absolutely fantastic evidence it makes.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I for one have had it.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;You have 10 days to improve things, otherwise, I'm sure we'll see each other in person in court at some point in the future.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Did you ever stop to think that if it WAS "chivalrous zek", and people fought honorably for the sport of it rather than just to be jerks to other people, that maybe people would be enjoying some fun and fair pvp instead of leaving in droves?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Gm presence is fine on zek. I would agree that this would be an issue IF there were as many rampant trains and violations of the pnp around that you say there is, but theres not. From what i've seen most pvp tends to be train free, and ccing is definately minimal. Some extra gms around is always nice, but its not really an issue to start canceling your account about imo heh. Training and ccing are just not big enough problems on zek to get so pissed off about it heh.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;okay buckeye, go and arrange a PoTactics raid, spend an hour getting 72+ players together, spend an hour clearing and collecting the named mobs, then engage fake Rallos, then when you're taking him down, get trained and have your MTs mezed. There ya go, several hours down the hole.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Welcome to real life, and if you can't stop a couple trainers with 72 people you just plain suck. Sr/mb/dt/mez anyone? Also is that how they take down rallos on blue servers? Just pure zerg power huh? :smileyvery-happy:&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;ESAD moron.&amp;nbsp; A raid force composed of a mix of Planes and non-planes geared folk (mostly non-plane geared folks) really needs to concentrate their entire raid force on that particular raid.&amp;nbsp; Besides that a DA'd bard can easily survive 1 or 2 groups at zone in, and easily bring a train to the raid, fade, then start mez'ing tanks and clerics before the raid really has a chance to figure out what's going on.&amp;nbsp; It's NOT THAT simple.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;This game engine doesn't lend itself towards PvE RAID content with PvP mixed in.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Tell you what, you let me know when your next non-instanced raid is and I'll arrange to have a few people see how good YOUR guild is at stopping people from popping in, training, and causing a disruption.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I'm not supposed to tell you this, as its top secret info that only the elite train masters are supposed to know, but i guess i'll make an exception. Trained mobs are 100% proximity aggro, its childs play to grab them off an incoming trainer and run them away, most people just don't know how to do it or don't try. Also while its true that they can get the mobs back onto them, they will have to fight you and any other concerned raid members for aggro, and at this point their da should be gone and they should already be sred and mbed, kapish? :)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;On top of that however, the no train policy IS being enforced on zek. Check out www.hateguild.net, ghettin has a ss of talking to the gm who talked to us dealing with all the complaints people had toward us. Also some more top sekret infoz for you, it is now a dockable offense to train as a member of hate, thx and have a good day !!&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;True Buckeye, but there's a few things that are assumed here:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;1.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The raid&amp;nbsp;is expecting a train.&amp;nbsp; In the case of our last Fennin Ro raid, we were behind probably 20 see invis mobs, some with DT I believe, and all pretty much insta agro.&amp;nbsp; Somehow Brenny gets by ALL of these mobs, without anyone seeing him and agros Fennin Ro to train him on our raid, then agros the last 4 mobs on the bridge closest to Fennin's temple.&amp;nbsp; Even in spite of that, we did manage to get Fennin under control and had the 4 adds under control for a short time.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;2.&amp;nbsp; People have the appropriate spells up agro a mass of mobs off a trainer.&amp;nbsp; Not always the case.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;3.&amp;nbsp; The trainer isn't using some sort of warp hack.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;4.&amp;nbsp; You can get the train derailed before additional people inherit agro, or there's no low health agro.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Anyway, I don't think this matters much any more.&amp;nbsp; Sony CS sucks, and isn't motivated to do much about it.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I believe Zek will be a non-issue in 6 months...&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;None of those things are really that hard given that you react as soon as you see the person in the zone. Never ever assume that just because you are behind mobs they can't get you, as you said, they could be hacking. However even their hacks won't keep the mobs on them if you derail them, and they won't stop dts/mbs. The&amp;nbsp;only solution to all of the problems you listed seems to be to load the spells get ready for incomming trains etc until you see the person leave the zone or die. My guild has been dealing with trains ever since it was created, and we are still here. The fact that everyone makes trainers out to be as people who are invincible and cannot be stopped is just ridiculous.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;No, the problem is that soe cannot enforce their rules. Since gms have to actually watch the person training, or they admit to it, for them to do anything about trains, and that there are hardly any gms on the servers that people can do it without fear of getting caught.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;No, the problem is that soe cannot enforce their rules. Since gms have to actually watch the person training, or they admit to it, for them to do anything about trains, and that there are hardly any gms on the servers that people can do it without fear of getting caught.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;If enough people do a /report at the TIME of the train, then a GOOD GM can use that to review and verify, it's worked before and what I was told to do by a GM.</description>

&lt;P&gt;Yeah exactly WHAT will a /report do?&amp;nbsp; There is no system emote or message that states "Brenny brings a train towards you."&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;You sound like one of the idiot GM's that told me to submit a /report, and when I started pressing the point asking them if they REALLY knew how this game worked, suddenly they stopped responding to me.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Also, multiple /petitions on training apparently only pisses the GM's off.&amp;nbsp; I've heard of many instances where GM's have asked that only ONE person submit a petition about a trainer as multiple petitions actually piss them off.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Sony has not set themselves up to police this game properly, and the engine itself is not designed to be policed easily.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The fact that after 6+ years of this game (upwards of 8 if you count ALL the development time), they've yet to make it easier to catch these rule breaking idiots would seem to indicate that Sony really doesn't give a rat's butt about the situation.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;from what I've been told, a report does more than simply report the last 20 lines of chat, it takes a 'snapshot' of the zone and submits that.&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;To quote:&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The /report command instructs your client to send authenticated data from your chat window to the EverQuest servers for logging. The purpose of this command is to create a record of any text sent to you by another player that might be in violation of the EverQuest Rules of Conduct or the EverQuest license agreement. The usage of this command in game is a little bit misleading. The syntax of the command is "/report CharacterName", however the true function of the command sends the bottommost ten lines of your chat window.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;To properly use this command, use &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Shift-PgUp&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; to scroll until the suspect text is in the chat window, then type "/report CharacterName". You should then file a "/petition" (see Contacting a &lt;A href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/manual/manual.jsp%3fhandle=supgm" target=_blank&gt;Game Master&lt;/A&gt;), explaining the fact that you have filed a /report, with a brief explanation of what the /report is meant to show&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;I'm assuming you guys already know that /report is pointless in trying to report training as there is no text that will show up in any of the chat windows that says:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;"Enemy guild player X intentionally trains 150 mobs towards you and fades/fd's/succors/evacs/insta-gates."&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;So...&amp;nbsp; What would be the point of using /report to try and get action on a person training from the GM's?&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I was told by a GM to do a /report at the time of the train, so that's what I do.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Just so you know, the /report will log the lines of chat you report in their database. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;However, nobody will look at it unless you also petition and mention the time of your report. It is a way of lodging evidence.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
