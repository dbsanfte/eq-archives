<P><BR>I love these generalizations you always see about little kids and PvP...&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P>Based on the age you've provided, you were only&nbsp;13 when EQ came out. So, you were once a "kid" playing an mmorpg at some point, too. Let them have their fun and&nbsp;learn&nbsp;the game, give them a chance, and you may be surprised.&nbsp;Lord that&nbsp;knows that&nbsp;as a long-time fan of the genre, I welcome any "kiddies" who are trying to learn the ropes in EQ, rather than going with the watered-down alternative... it shows&nbsp;they're developing some <EM>taste.</EM>&nbsp; <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-wink.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0></P>
<P>Back on topic... Another server is really superfluous, imo. There's already PvP availble through the Priests of Discord. If there are&nbsp;so&nbsp;many players&nbsp;interested in PvP,&nbsp;and all those players&nbsp;turn in their books and engage in regular guild vs. guild affairs, there should be plenty of PvP to go around and could even draw in more PvE'ers from the sidelines into the fray.</P>
<P>Of course, there'd be no serverwide rulesets unless&nbsp;Sony put in some kind of token system... and&nbsp;PvP'ers wouldn't have the joy of ganking and griefing any random player they&nbsp;like with wanton abandon... but it's not about <EM>that</EM>, right? It's about waging honorable PvP battle, right?</P>
