    <title>Why would a new player choose this server?</title>
    <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Progression&amp;message.id=1012</link>
    <description>&lt;div&gt;I was just wondering why a new player to EQ might want to come on this server. It dosent seem likely seeing that most expansions come with the game for just $20. (good price btw). I think the idea of a progression server is really really good but it seems only the veteren players can really appericate this. Dont get me wrong, I think this server will fill up fast but I expect the majority of players will be Vets looking to rekindle that old EQ feeling. Perhaps get some player who left the game to come back also, I know this server is the reason Im thinking about reactivating my account. But to say it will attract new players...  I dont see it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Otaris&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>I think the nicest thing for a new player would be to start out like all the others at the beginning of the game, working through the progression just like the veterans starting at the servers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Low level old world zones filled with players, instead of the emptiness at the lower levels people run into right now when they are dumped in the Plane of Knowledge with tasks that do send you all over the place, but all the places seem empty.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not be tempted by the desire to 'catch' up to the long-time players, the need to level as fast as possible just to be able to be where the majority of the players are.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just a few pros that come up when I started thinking about it.</description>
