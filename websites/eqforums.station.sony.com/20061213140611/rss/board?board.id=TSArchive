      <title>Letter from the Executive Director of Customer Service</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=TSArchive&amp;message.id=5#M5</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Greetings, &lt;/FONT&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;My name is D. Scott Mattson and I am the Executive Director of Customer Service for Sony Online Entertainment. I have 15 years experience in the Customer Service industry with an emphasis on Call Center Management in the high tech arena. Before coming to Sony Online Entertainment I worked as Director of Player Relations and Product Management for the Electronic Arts Company. I had the pleasure of launching multiple MMOG titles at EA as well as managing the day-to day operations of the in game staff of all the online game titles for EA. I am thrilled to be at Sony Online Entertainment and wanted to communicate to you the many new improvements that we will be providing to our customers to enhance our quality, streamline our operations and improve our response times. Please let me have your attention for a few moments to outline these improvements. &#xD;
&lt;P&gt;First, we have been working on our knowledge base for the past few weeks so that we can establish a solid foundation for our Tier 0 support (Tier 0 support is where the customer can run a query to find their own answer). As we are finding that people are familiarizing themselves with search engines, we feel that our knowledge base is a user friendly tool for our customers to seek answers on their own. We have recently completed a full audit of solutions for all of our games, so any solution that you find should be up to date. Of course there will be situations where you will not find your answer, this is where you can help us make our database be the best it can be by letting us know that we need to add a solution or make a modification to an existing FAQ. We feel strongly that the knowledge base will be the cornerstone of our service and as such we will focus resources there in partnership with you, the customer. Of course there will be cases where you will need to contact a Customer Service Representative, but we are confident that the majority of your answers can be resolved through our knowledge base. Currently, you will find our knowledge base at our website and inside Star Wars Galaxies through the Holocron interface. Our plan is to implement access to our knowledge base inside the game client for all of our online products. By doing this, we are confident that the majority of your questions will be answered immediately rather than waiting for a CSR to respond. &#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Secondly, we have expanded our support into other areas in the world. The United Kingdom has been providing support for all of games for the past few months as well as outsource partners in India. This has helped us immensely during the off-peak hours, holidays and during regular business hours. With their support, we are able to provide a much more robust service around the clock utilizing a "follow the sun" support model. &#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Finally, we are actively improving our current tools to respond to our customers quickly and effectively. We understand that it could take some time to receive a response to your petition, so we are enhancing our petitioning tool to make it easier to respond to our customers quickly. As we integrate better tools to help our customers, the response rate to your questions should significantly decrease.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;These are just a few of the high level enhancements we are making to our In-game Customer Service to make your experience a better one. Thank you for your patience now and in the future as we work hard to offer better and improved service. &#xD;
&lt;P&gt;D. Scott Mattson&lt;BR&gt;Executive Director of Customer Service&lt;BR&gt;Sony Online Entertainment&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Greetings all! &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Over the years we have seen several “scam” attempts perpetrated on our customers. There are some unscrupulous people out there that may try to get control of your EverQuest account. There are a few simple rules you can follow to keep your account secure. &#xD;
&lt;P&gt;1) &lt;B&gt;Never give out your password&lt;/B&gt;. This is the single most important thing you can do to keep your account secure. We will never ask for your password via email or in game. &#xD;
&lt;P&gt;2) &lt;B&gt;Be careful with your Station name&lt;/B&gt;. Your Station name is one of the two things needed to access your account. Don’t use it as a character name and don’t post on message boards using your Station name. There’s no reason to tell anyone your Station name, though we may indeed need that information in your conversations with us regarding your account. &#xD;
&lt;P&gt;3) &lt;B&gt;Be careful what you download&lt;/B&gt;. This is a good precaution for anything you do on the Internet. Files can contain viruses and other dangerous programs. Be certain that any files you download come from a source you trust, and scan them for viruses before opening them. Keep your virus scanning software up to date. &#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Follow these guidelines and your account should be very secure. &#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Here are some examples of scam emails sent to our customers. We’re reproducing them here as examples of things to be aware of. &#xD;
&lt;P&gt;---- &#xD;
&lt;P&gt;These are the scams that have been brought to our attention. There are several methods that people will try to trick another individual out of his/her account information. Below are some examples of what to look out for. Some of them have italicized text that indicates either false information or incorrect spelling. &#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;Example 1:&lt;/B&gt; &#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;FONT face="Verdana, Arial" size=1&gt;quote:&lt;/FONT&gt; &#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;FONT face="Verdana, Arial" size=2&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Subject: Shadows Of Luclin Beta Test&lt;BR&gt;Date: Mon, 30 Apr 2001 20:44:00 -0500&lt;BR&gt;From: BetaTesting@deleted.com&lt;BR&gt;To: unsuspecting_recipient@somedomain.com&lt;BR&gt;Dear Sony Station Customer, &#xD;
&lt;P&gt;As you may know, a new Everquest expansion is coming out soon called, Shadows of Luclin. Until we can finallize this expansion and ship millions of copies on to the market, we must make sure that everything works. So therefore, we at Sony and Verant are looking for a few beta testers. We are looking for people that have been dedicated Everquest players for while, and that have not borken any rules. In order for you to have a chance in participating please click here, to go to our Shadows Of Luclin Beta Testing sign up page. &#xD;
&lt;P&gt;After you submit the information please allow 5-6 business days for us to review your account. After that period we will send you an email letting you know if you have been qualified or not along with further instructions on how to start you beta testing. &#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Thanks for Participating,SonyStation.comVerant Interactive &#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The link will send you to a web page where it asks you to volunteer your STATION NAME and PASSWORD. &#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Example 2:&lt;/B&gt; &#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;FONT face="Verdana, Arial" size=2&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Subj: Everquest Patch for Test Server &lt;BR&gt;Date: Tue, 1 May 2001 12:36:08 AM Eastern Daylight Time &lt;BR&gt;From: anon@anon.com &lt;BR&gt;To: anon@anon.com &#xD;
&lt;P&gt;EQtest103.exe (56065 bytes) &#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Here you go, my e-mail is xxxxxxxx@aol.com, give me an e-mail with any problems, questions, or comments, thanks and have fun!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The object of the email is to try to trick the recipient into believing that it contains a “Shadows of Luclin Expansion Beta Testing file”. The name of the file that is attached with the email is eqtest103.exe, but this can easily change. Upon running the attached Trojan file, your computer is infected with a backdoor program that will record your keystrokes and email them to the creator of the file. Any thing you type, the email recipient will receive. &#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Backdoor.SubSeven22 is a Trojan horse. It is generally UPX packed; however, unpacked versions and versions packed with different executable packing software do exist. When packed with UPX, the Trojan horse's size is usually between 370 KB and 390 KB. Larger variations have been encountered, however, with file sizes ranging from 470 KB to 550 KB. &#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Backdoor.SubSeven is a Trojan horse, similar to Netbus or Back Orifice. It enables unauthorized people to access your computer over the Internet without your knowledge. When the server portion of the program is running on a computer, it is possible for the person who is accessing the computer remotely to do the following: &#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Set it up as an FTP server &lt;BR&gt;- Browse files on that system &lt;BR&gt;- Take screen shots &lt;BR&gt;- Capture real-time screen information &lt;BR&gt;- Open and close programs &lt;BR&gt;- Edit information in currently running programs &lt;BR&gt;- Show pop-up messages and dialog boxes &lt;BR&gt;- Hang up a dial-up connection &lt;BR&gt;- Restart a computer remotely &lt;BR&gt;- Open the CD-ROM &lt;BR&gt;- Edit registry information &#xD;
&lt;P&gt;When it is run, BackDoor.Subseven makes the following changes to the system: &#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Drops (adds) a copy of itself and a randomly named executable file, such as Eutccec.exe, to the \Windows or \Windows\System folder. &lt;BR&gt;- Adds the dropped file to the load= and run= lines of the Win.ini file. &lt;BR&gt;- Adds the dropped file name to the shell=explorer.exe line of the System.ini file. &lt;BR&gt;- Creates the WinLoader value and sets it equal to the dropped file name in the following registry keys. &lt;BR&gt;- Modifies the (Default) value from "%1" %* to, for example, eutccec.exe "%1" %* in the following registry keys: &#xD;
&lt;P&gt;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Classes\&lt;BR&gt;exefile\shell\open\command &#xD;
&lt;P&gt;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\&lt;BR&gt;Windows\CurrentVersion\Run &#xD;
&lt;P&gt;To remove this, you will want to get an up to date anti virus program. &#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;Example 3:&lt;/B&gt; &#xD;

&lt;P&gt;Hail Fellow &lt;I&gt;Norratian&lt;/I&gt;!&lt;BR&gt;We at Verant are planning new and exciting things for you this year. As you already know the new "SHADOWS OF LUCLIN" expansion is due out this fall! Now, in order for you to be able to play this expansion, a few things must be done to your account. That is why, by the 10th of May, we will need your regards, saying that it is ok for us to change a few configurations when you log on to EVERQUEST! This meaning a few things. Along with your "OK" to do this, we will need you to send your station name and &lt;I&gt;password&lt;/I&gt;. Please do this in a secure way, and never send these things to anyone but verant or sony! Verant and Sony Interactive are in no way responsible for unsecure servers... These changes will be picked up by your computer via patch time! &#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Thank you for you time. Verant appreciates having you as an EVERQUEST player! &#xD;

&lt;P&gt;Dear Customer,&lt;BR&gt;This is &lt;I&gt;Seth Davis&lt;/I&gt; from Verant Interactive. This morning your station name has attempted to be accessed 2,000 times. &lt;BR&gt;Now this means one of two things, you don't remember your password (not likely) or someone is trying to break into your &lt;BR&gt;account (the issue). We have good news however. When someone tries to access our logon server, its like called ID, we &lt;BR&gt;can trace it to the house where they tried to logon. Its called an IP Address (Internet Provider Address ). If you would like, &lt;BR&gt;we can put a block on the other house's IP address so he can never logon to our servers again. If this is the issue for you &lt;BR&gt;please answer the following questions, and "reply" this message. Thank you for your time. Have a great day. Remember &lt;BR&gt;"Shadows of Luclin" will be in stores November 18th. -Seth Davis&lt;BR&gt;-answer all questions and reply-&lt;BR&gt;1) First Name&lt;BR&gt;2) Last name&lt;BR&gt;3) Address&lt;BR&gt;4) City&lt;BR&gt;5) Zip&lt;BR&gt;6) State&lt;BR&gt;7) Phone&lt;BR&gt;8) Billing First Name&lt;BR&gt;9) Billing Last Name&lt;BR&gt;10) Last 6 digits of used credit card&lt;BR&gt;11) Station Name &#xD;

&lt;FONT face="Verdana, Arial" size=2&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Greetings, &lt;BR&gt;The Verant team has been given a chance to search the database of ebay's past transactions. Starting July 1st we will now completely take all action in stopping the process of account selling/trading etc. We have located over 25 account trading and account selling auctions with in the past week. Generally we know the owners of these accounts were notified that account trading/selling /stealing is totally illegal with in our covenant rules. &lt;BR&gt;To give you a basic overview what we do in this situation is permanently delete the account and the IP host of its current user from our login access screen. Once this is done we have organized vote from all the representatives and rank members of verant in which we should even precede more in depth in this matter. &#xD;
&lt;P&gt;If chosen, depending on the matter we could choose to simply have you account &lt;I&gt;band&lt;/I&gt; or depending on the vote have you &lt;I&gt;trialed&lt;/I&gt; for Misusage of our accounting. &#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Here at the &lt;I&gt;Station, Sony Verant&lt;/I&gt; we hate &lt;I&gt;banding&lt;/I&gt; citizens of our community or doing anything to &lt;I&gt;there&lt;/I&gt; accounts unless it's a positive change. Importantly we want our game Everquest to be fun and exciting as an everyday experience. &#xD;
&lt;P&gt;If you have any questions please refer to the guide that Verant has chosen for you. &#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Hello &lt;I&gt;Ryan Fuller&lt;/I&gt; here, &#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I have been given the auction site &lt;A href="http://[edited/" target=_blank&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffcc33&gt;.]http://[EDITED].&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt; I am supposed to ask you if you have any questions about what is going to happen to your account. I personally viewed your ebay queue and to be honest with you &lt;I&gt;I my self does not&lt;/I&gt; believe your account should be terminated. I believe you should get a warning or just a temporary suspension. I know people like to sell their account to make money either for college or for some other usage of that profit. As a &lt;I&gt;Verant Ceo represenitive&lt;/I&gt; I have the ability to change the status of what might happen to your account with in the next four to five days. What I am going to do is attach a Personal Identification applicant. Basically it just asks you question so we can notify this account you were trying to sell is actually yours. From there once filled out save that to file and send it back to my personal email. My personal email is [EDITED]. If you reply to the address you are reading !&lt;BR&gt;this message from it will only get forwarded and at least take a month to get read. &#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;I&gt;Ryan Fuller &lt;BR&gt;Verant Sony Interactive&lt;/I&gt; &#xD;

&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Example 7:&lt;/B&gt; &#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Hello all!&lt;BR&gt;Here is another scam to add to the list. This one happens to show a url of &lt;A href="http://www.everquestmail.com/" target=_blank&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffcc33&gt;http://www.everquestmail.com&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt; which we do not use here.
