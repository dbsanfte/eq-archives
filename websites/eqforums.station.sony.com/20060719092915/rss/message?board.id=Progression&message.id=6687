      <description>I don't want to start a huge thread about the issue itself... but rather just trying to figure out if the developers have said what they'll be doing about this, if anything at all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, any official word?  What should we expect once the server is opened?&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>the official word was that they were not going to revamp spells to their previous states for this server.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;no word has been said about newbie quests being kept as is to give melees an opportunity to be trivial with the 2005 upgraded spells.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Pardon my ignorance, but I wasn't around during the time spells were upgraded, or even when newbie armor  quests were put in... so how does keeping the armor quests as is make melees trivial?  And would this be solved if all armor quests were completely taken out, or only if caster armor quests were taken out?&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>I wont get too far into opinion, alot of people share the same opinion as me on the previous caster vs melee posts, but some don't.  I'll just stick to the facts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 2005, druid, wizard, magician, cleric, shaman, necromancer, wizard, and enchanter spells were upgraded to more damage, and/or be more mana efficient. Spells 1-50 did less damage and costed more mana before 2005. They did this to make casters as par with the expansions released up to dragons of norrath.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The thought, and truth behind this was that ever since kunark, melee weapons 1-50 have been upgraded various times, however caster spells always stayed the same. They always did the same damage, and costed the same mana. In 2005, as I stated before, they upgraded spells to do considerably more amounts of damage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This was a great update, everyone I knew including myself loved it. It made alot of sense, probably one of the few great things SoE did for free, however since the topic of a progression server comes up, the spells that were upgraded in 2005, to balence and trivialize casters with melees, are now global across all servers, which holds true in the fact that they'll be held on the new progression server.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What's the problem with this? It's that melees are going to be using old world weapons, and casters are going to be using new world upgraded spells that were meant to put casters at par with the 2005 state of everquest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's like putting modern engine parts in an old car frame. Casters are going to be on overdrive for a long time with their upgraded spells, untill expansions are released to put melee's back at part with casters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

I think keeping the current newbie quest rewards in is a mistake though.  Anything which increases the damage a party or raid can do over what was available against content in the old world is a negative in my opinion, and should be altered if reasonably possible.  That is, I think some line has to be drawn on what work is reasonable to invest on such issues... and then anything which doesn't cross that line should be worked on.  With spells being a global phenomena (and the initial DEV response) it sounds as though reverting them surpasses that line.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Much of the current newbie quest gear (not the original newbie quest gear, mind you - the current, upgraded stuff) is better than anything you'll see in the old world for the first 40 levels or so.   Including it obsoletes 80% (4/5, a ball-park figure) of that content available to players.  Further, it creates camping issues on the part of higher level players in newbie zones for newbie quest completion.  Assuming quest rewards aren't global (and from DEV responses, it sounds as if they're not) it would be wise to change or disable these).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Any increase in gear power to equalize melees and casters would be unwise.  It will directly result in people levelling faster than they should, mobs falling faster than they should, and expansions being unlocked faster than they should.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Contrary to what has been advertised, the revised spells will not obsolete melees.  Warriors, Paladins and Shadowknights will still be needed to hold aggro (and, indeed, with cloth casters falling as fast as ever, increased spell damage will make aggro management even more key to a successful group), monks will still be needed to flop on pulls, rangers will also benefit DPS-wise from revised spells...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;...the only class that will really be hit significantly by this is the rogue class, and if the decision comes down to having a gimpy rogue class until kunark is unlocked or introducing gear for all classes which trivializes such a large percentage of old world content by L12... well, I'd feel sorry for the rogues.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Thanks for the explanation, Burncrew.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And yeah Teak, I figured melees would still be necessary, since tanks are always needed at some point or another.  I was just trying to figure out the current state of the situation, and how much lower melee DPS would be in comparison to caster DPS.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Im not debating there is a problem Burn, but its a short lived problem.  the spell changes were form 1-50, so once we get past old world (which wont be that long0 it becomes irrelevant.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Very few people will make their decision based on this fact.  And the ones that put any thought into it will realize that in the end the melees will be back to tops on the damage charts anyway.  Its not worth the devs afforts to make a short term change like this (unless its simple to put a %spell modifier on).  They should be worried about long term effects so the server is healthy two years form now, like Berserkers and Beastlords being at a disadvantage due to late release (which you dont care about because you think they suck). &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;'Once the people realise that spell casters are extremely over powered with the upgraded spells, they will make their class descision based on this fact.'&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The point is most people dont care if they are overpowered.  they want to a play a caster or a pet class or a melee or whatever because thats what they want to play.  if they want groups then they will want a tank, slower, or cleric regardless. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Like I said Im in favor of perhaps putting a %damage modifier on the server for a while, but I think there are other more important issues.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've seen outrageous ideas presented in other threads, so now it's my turn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why not revert lvl 1 to 50 spells ON ALL SERVERS back to what they were prior to the 2005 upgrade.  The lvl 1 to 50 crowd is extremely small on each server and I imagine a lot of them will move to this server when it opens.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;'Your thinking really aligns sony's with the concept that they don't need to balence anything if people are still paying for their game'&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;They just dont have unlimited resources for this.  Their resources are far more better spent providing an interesting expansion unlocking system.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;After that their biggest need is to reset some zones that would be impractical int heir current states (Paw, Hate, etc)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Then they ened ot look at some of the issues that will have long term repurcussions (Berserkers and Beastlords most notably)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Then if they still have time for this, by all means go nuts, but there are more pressing concerns to be dealt with.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I'm not overly concerned about the caster spells staying the same at this point.  Picking a class at the start just because it's the best at the beginning is foolish, especially when you know other classes will either catch up or surpass you in power later down the road.  I believe most people will pick the class they like or find interesting.  I'm sure some will pick whatever class is good for early powergaming, but most people that do that eventually quit or start over when they think another class does better than what they're currently playing.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I'd consider the balance of the class at the end of the game, rather than the beginning as over time that's how it will end up.</description>
