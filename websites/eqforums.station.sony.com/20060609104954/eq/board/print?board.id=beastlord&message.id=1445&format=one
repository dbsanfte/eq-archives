				<DIV>I made it to 65 ya me got a few AA's. For a long time, my warder was able to tank, dish out damage better than me. I always assumed this would be the case. Now as Ive gotten more AAs and defensive abilitys my warder has become just some DOT that follows me. I guess this isnt so much of a complaint but more of a realization that well the game changes for beasts as you get up there. I always figured our pets would be able to out tank us and dps. Still I love the beast class cant wait to see whats in store for it. </DIV>
