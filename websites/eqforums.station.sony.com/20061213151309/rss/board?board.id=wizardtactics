      <title>Must do Quests</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=wizardtactics&amp;message.id=614#M614</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I am a new Drakkin wizard. I have been having a blast doing all the quests in Cresent Reach and Blightfire Moors.&amp;nbsp; I was wondering, besides the wizard epics, what quests should a wizard plan to do?&amp;nbsp; What quests did you think were the most fun for a wizard and which quests give items that a wizard should or need to have?&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>New tactics reguarding patient harvest.</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=wizardtactics&amp;message.id=597#M597</link>
      <description>Now I've been thinking, with the new harvest, we basically have a second chance during a raid fight to gain mana and attack for a second round. So which would be the best of these tactics to use. Use mana conservatively throughout the fight and not bother with the new harvest untill after the battle is finished, or do as much damage as possible to get a high DPS, then harvest midfight and continue with high DPS. If you're able to burn with efficiancy with instant nukes and able to keep from getting aggro, then would it be okay to harvest in the middle of the fight, which would cause your DPS to stop for a good 18 seconds, and then go back to laying down high DPS? Or would it be just the same effect if you used your mana conservatively and do consistantly high DPS? I mean using a harvest a fight is an extra 5k mana to use to nuke with so would it be okay for DPS to suffer?&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What do you guys think?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Greetings.</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=wizardtactics&amp;message.id=582#M582</link>
      <description>Greetings, I am Vestarion, an apprentice wizard on the Firiona Vie&#xD;
server. I have recently attained my 10th rank of apprenticeship through&#xD;
my Master in Felwithe, and wanted to share a few of the lessons I've&#xD;
learned so far.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
1). I have just finished crafting my set of Art Keeper armor. The&#xD;
warrior hornets were hard to find, but you can find them in the "Orc&#xD;
Hill" area which is near Kelethin. Make sure to keep your skin and silk&#xD;
drops that are above and beyond what you need, because they will come&#xD;
in handy in building your tradeskills, or in selling them to others.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
2). Note that when your 10th rank is attained, a new armor quest opens&#xD;
up in PoK. Each level earned above 10 will grant access to a different&#xD;
piece of armor. The 10th quest, for example, was fun and not too long.&#xD;
However, please note that the reward armor is currently THE SAME armor&#xD;
that can be crafted (in my case, Art Keepers). So if you have already&#xD;
crafted a set, it may/may not be worth your time. As I haven't attained&#xD;
the higher ranks yet, I cannot report if this holds true along the way,&#xD;
but it held true at 10. (note though that I also recieved additional&#xD;
benefits...)&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
3). You simply do not need to buy every spell that becomes available to&#xD;
you. Do not waste your limited finances on un-needed spells. At these&#xD;
levels, you can be quite happy without ever have casted an aoe spell,&#xD;
or a rain spell, though these are certainly available to you. Choose&#xD;
spells that fit your needs. If, of course, you are of unlimited&#xD;
finances...shop away.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
4). Max out your spell-skill level (alteration, evocation, divination,&#xD;
conjuration, and abjuration) each level. (max level is your level*5 +&#xD;
5, so at level 2 they max out at 15...and at level 3 they max at 20,&#xD;
etc). Do this every level to avoid the tedium of training up 40 points&#xD;
in each skill in a sitting. You improve these skills by casting spells&#xD;
repeatedly. It takes MANY CASTS to do this, so take a bit of time each&#xD;
level instead of 6 hours at level 10.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
5). The spell vendors in Felwithe (I can't speak for other home-towns&#xD;
out there) seem to be divided up with mixed-level spells on them, don't&#xD;
forget to check them all. Also, don't forget to shop at the "General&#xD;
Spells" vendor. Also, the Great Library in PoK has vendors in it that&#xD;
sell just about anything that can be sold, so if all else fails, pay&#xD;
them a visit by touching the spellbook found outside of Felwithe.&#xD;
(there is another outside of Kelethin, so I can perhaps assume all&#xD;
home-towns have one outside somewhere).&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
So far, I've explored the Greater Faydark, and also journeyed into&#xD;
Crushbone to roast a few orcs. Felwithe simply did not offer me many&#xD;
quests, but it has allowed me to focus on completing my armor. I have&#xD;
been sent on another task to kill the Orcish Thermaturgist in&#xD;
Crushbone, but I have yet to undertake this mission. Beware of the orcs&#xD;
at the very entrance to Crushbone from GFay, (outside), because they&#xD;
are far larger than the orcs on Orc Hill. Also beware of wandering&#xD;
orcish shaman and oracles, as they will buff orcs to be much more&#xD;
powerful than their con-level suggests....and also they will heal them.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
I have yet to die, and I feel quite fortunate. I am a patient, and methodical wizard, and I hope to never meet this fate!!&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
I have little to report of interest yet, as I have only attained my&#xD;
10th rank of apprenticeship. If I learn anything of value along my&#xD;
travels, I will post it here in the event that it may help you in some&#xD;
way. I am looking forward to the challenges ahead on my way toward my&#xD;
20th rank, as well as starting to learn my tradeskills. Being a high&#xD;
elven person, I have a long life ahead of me to dwell upon these&#xD;
endevors in a patient and methodical manner.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
regards,&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
Vestarion of Felwithe, Apprentice of the 10th.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

      <title>Rain Based Spells</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=wizardtactics&amp;message.id=578#M578</link>
      <description>Greetings everyone. I was trolling Graffe boards a few weeks back and I&#xD;
found a post reguarding aggro parses. In the post it said that rain&#xD;
based spells were 30% or so less aggro then normal spells because,&#xD;
according to the post, the initial wave hits for 100% aggro, and each&#xD;
wave afterwards creates only 50% aggro. Currently I can't find the post&#xD;
to reconfirm it, so if anyone could let me know if this is true or not&#xD;
that would be fantastic. Thanks.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Fire, Ice, or Magic</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=wizardtactics&amp;message.id=563#M563</link>
      <description>I'm looking to reduce my resists on raid mobs a bit and I'm wondering which spell line would be best all around and more specifically in the Citadel of Anguish.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While pre-PoTime I used Magic then I switched to Ice and noticed less resists but still got moderate resists though GoD. Then I switched to Fire around Ovic/Inktu'ta/Tvexu and noticed less resists. However in Tacvi, DoN, Shyra and MPG trials I was getting a lot of resists with Fire even when using sparks. So I switched back to Ice and noticed a little less. If anyone has some advice for trying to maximize my DPS on raid mobs through the use of different spell lines it would be most helpful, thanks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Kind Find a Group!!!</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=wizardtactics&amp;message.id=551#M551</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;Ok I am a level 70 wizard.  Took the class originally to make money from ports and HIGH DPS.  I know this isn't a new complaint but this is getting riduculous.   I can't find a group.  I look every day and after about 8 hours of looking yesterday I had to mention something on the boards here.  Its silly.  I don't do any damage in spell missions, don't do any damage in RSS, I do a tiny bit in MPG, but I am out damaged by just about every class everywhere I go.  Mages way outclass me.  Pets do a ton of damage, plus nukes do a comparable amount.  I want to know how this is balanced?  Mages Level 66 Nuke does 2889, Wizard's 65 Nuke does 3288.  400 Damage over a mage? What is the deal with that.  Does the pet make up for 400 damage, way more than that.  That is only 1 nuke granted, but over the course of a fight the mage will outdamage us far and away. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;When I throw up LFG I get nothing, Ranger enters zone... has a group just about instantly, mage, right away, chanter, of course right away.  The wizard class in its current state, is not needed in the game at all.  One of two things needs to happen.  Get rid of the wizard class, cause right now it is completely useless, or FIX IT.  We need to do more damage.  Devs ask yourself this, why would you want a wizard in your group?  We have the odd super high damage crit, but without that what purpose is there to have a wizzy.  Just about every melee class can outdamage us.  Chanter's have mez and mana regen. Mages by far out damage us with pets, plus nukes are comparable, Necro's crush us for DPS - plus they have a pet. Cleric's don't outdamage us, but well CH is kinda big.  Druids have dots, and won't steal aggro nearly as much as wizzy's. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I am a wizard and I can't honestly give a good reason that I would want me in a group... ahh except maybe to port 5 others up to Hate or Sky? Oh wait they can just go to PoT to avoid us for that too.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>AA Familiar's</title>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I am working through &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;and trying to work up a spreadsheet that will help me decide in what order to spend AAs&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.  (Wish I could find a good resource for this...)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Anyway, I have noticed there are 108 AAs &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;worth of &amp;quot;familiar&amp;quot; related abilities.  I have not yet dropped any points on Familiars.  It would seem to be redundant to pump up all of those, can anyone tell me a good strategy for getting the best result for my points?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Should I just pick one end result and only buy the necessary prereq's for that one, or is it useful to have several Familiar options?  Sooooo many AAs...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>I need help getting Crushed Diamond Dust.</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=wizardtactics&amp;message.id=531#M531</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;As stated I need help getting Crushed Diamond Dust. I am a level 61 wizard on Stromm. Somewhere on Graffe's I read that wizards could solo in Icewall Keep, which I have heard is a good place to get CDD. So I went and tried to kill some mobs there but they just hit to hard and had alot of HPs. Also, Siren's Grotto has been pointed out as a good place to get CDD. While I have been able to kill a mob there solo, it drains my mana to quick. I'm at work or I'd post my FT#, I have Casting Fury at 3 and the next level (forgot name) at the first tier. My mana is 4.5k with kei and have Swift Journey2. I just need some pointers on stratigy on how to solo either SG or Icewall Keep at my level, or recommendations on what level to be or AA's to get to make this a reality.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;My need for CDD is not to get rich quick, but to equip myself with Master's Augs to upgrade myself. I have tailoring at 224 and smithing at 239 and have already made my Chest Master's Aug with a bazaar bought CDD. However, on Stromm the CDD runs for 8k and up each. That's alot of plat. I would prefer to get them to drop myself and get some xp in the process.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Any help is greatly appreciated. :smileyhappy:&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I have spent the last year away &amp;nbsp;in EQ2 and recently started to drift back to EQ1. I still like EQ2 but don't plan on it being exclusively in just EQ2 only anymore. I have started playing my alts and have decided its about time to get active again with my main toon, a 66 Wizard.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So my question is two fold. First where would be some suggestions on where to solo at 66? I have all the expansions.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Second where would be the best place to hang out to get a group.&amp;nbsp; I have been flagged in PoP up to Sol Ro tower. ( Yes I know this is old now) I never got around to Omens flagging at all, if my memory serves right.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;With my alts I have tried a&amp;nbsp; couple of shroud missions, figured out what a bandoleer and a potion belt is. lol What else am I ignorant on?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Thanks&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>Help, can't spawn Elie Sun Revanent</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=wizardtactics&amp;message.id=512#M512</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;After much study, time, effort and cajoling to get a raid force together to tackle my ESR fight, I decide to go and make sure I can spawn the mob; I cannot.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I have read you have to be inside the cauldron and no matter how hard I try,no matter from what rock, building or rock cloumn around the plateau I cannot lev into it.&amp;nbsp; I sink too darn fast.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If anyone can provide any insights or suggestions I would greatly appreciate it.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Thank you.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
