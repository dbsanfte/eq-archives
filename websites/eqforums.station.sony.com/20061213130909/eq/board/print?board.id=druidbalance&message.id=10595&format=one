Barkspur is also suspectible to other factors, like oor, running mobs, change in targets etc etc. Whats the harm in upping it to 15minutes to ensure full damage occurs. Leave the recast at 12s and the functionality remains the same.<br><br>Would like to see the community thoughts on it, as well if possible to add to our top 10, brought up to the dev's in fan fair etc etc.<br>

<p>This would allow you to pre-buff an entire raid&nbsp;with Barkspur before engaging.&nbsp; An AE rampage mob could take over 90 thousand unresistable damage from Barkspur&nbsp;within seconds.&nbsp; Sorry, but this isn't going to happen.</p><br><hr></blockquote>Since you do read the board, is there any update on other druid problem, such as spending twice more AA than shaman to get the same (or inferior) skill, epic degrading, uselessness of Winter flame, shaman overtaking us as the 4th nuking class, no real DOT (one that people use in group, not just soloing) upgrade, lack of new harmony, skin to vine stacking issue, no define role (that leads to very low desire in group)..................?<br></div>
