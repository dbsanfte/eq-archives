				<DIV>It sounds like you have the solid answers you are looking for in your search.&nbsp; No more than a "racial correspondent" would be able to provide.&nbsp; As this corr. would ask Kyr or whomever, they would give the same answer as said before (it is intentional, or that they are going for a temporary allowance when they feel like it) and that would be that.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>And the reason we don't have racial correspondants is because we don't need them.&nbsp; Having a single problem does not a correspondant make (West bug correspondant?)&nbsp; The races just do not evolve like the classes do over time. They get introduced, perhaps tweaked once or twice, then done.</DIV>
