    <description>&lt;div&gt;The situation was just an example.  What do I do about bards trying to kite low blues that can summon but shouldn't?  The bard should try and kite them one way and have them run the other until they've gathered up 30 of their friends.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;You know, a lot of Knights are always commenting on how Knight top 10 lists shouldn't try to eclipse or cover what other classes are already bringing up... but would anyone else be interested in seeing a TANK top 10 list to include things that affect all three tank classes the most?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I can already see Taunt and summoning to be huge on those lists, and the more support we can gather for these items would be a nice break from tearing each others Top 10s apart all the time.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Heimdall's right, If I can run up and do enough damage in one hit to get the shroom to summon, his little shroom brain should be sounding the alarm bells and he should be headed for the zone. That's like me summoning Cazle at level 20 with 600 hps after he smacked me for a 220. Game mechanic my ass, pure stupidity is what that is.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;To put it another way, a player going up against a yellow or red con mob has to deal with the possiblity that spells will be resisted or mobs will be flat immune to them, similar to fear, and stun.&amp;nbsp; If I'm a red con or yellow con to the mob then it is only logical that I have a chance to resist his lower level summon, or even be immune to it.&amp;nbsp; Now that means the blue, white and up mobs can still summon me all day long as they do now, but a green mob, or even light blue should have a chance to resist it.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;A green or light blue shouldn't even cast it.  We should have to deal with it taking off running, and watch it pick up add after add until its got 40 of its buddies to turn around and come back eventually.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;So lets see&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;1 Fix summoning.  Don't summon a toon already in melee, and don't summon them to a location they can't melee from.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;2)  Fix itemization.  Implement future itemization in the same manner as things like PoP and GoD armor.. a rare drop mold, a few common drops like metal bards, leather wrapping, etc to allow for not only much more diminished waste from rotting class items, but MORE individuality allowing the same weapon to show up as an axe, a mace, a hammer, a sword, and a dagger.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;3 Fix hitboxes in general... why can I stand in the next zipcode and whack Vishi, but I have to be close enough to give a ToB nightmare a hernia exam.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I forgot the rest, and I'm actually started to get busy here... Dark, we should find that last list I came up with, clean it up and PM it to Kythera... have her post a copy of it locked at the top of all three tank boards with a clickable link to the actual discussion message on here.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Oh yeah.. expanding the gap between non-tanks and tanks so that various DPS classes aren't tanking anymore.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can't fear kite mobs that would be worth the xp Frodlin, summoning or otherwise, they are immune. Even the new fear spells are worthless more often than not. I'm not going to waste my time mucking around trying to kite mobs that resist fear constantly or summon all the time, I will just get a group in Rss or something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It isn't about intitlement it's about commen sense, gimp mobs should never summon, named mobs that are light blue or green should not summon someone who cons red. I should be able to resist summon from mobs anyway because it's a spell effect and I should be able to resist it. Being unresistable is the real abuse here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Not really, its about what you said, you will just get a group in RSS and grind.  That is the whole point of everquest.  You can still solo non summoners, but you wont be doing it on the best possible mobs for exp.  And besides, you can solo anywhere I can, and I can solo in a ton of places without relying on fear.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;So we were in Sebilis the other night trying to do a Zerker 1.5 fight.  While we were waiting, we pulled some shrooms.  And you couldn't pull them.  A swing and they were summoning... plus your DS got the adds summoning.  I had a dozen shrooms and we moved back to camp at about 4 feet per minute.  It was pathetic.  They were barely touching me, I finally had to stop and kill them there.  That's what I have a problem with.  Right now the +DS, and/or a single melee swing make mobs that, if they actually had a decent AI, would run like hell at the first swing summon you over and over.  Its not fun, it doesn't serve any balance purpose.  Its just annoying.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;That's not a 'problem' with summoning, though.&amp;nbsp; There's an easy and understandable way to handle that situation.... don't pull them... fight them where they stand.&amp;nbsp; Just cause you're 70 doesn't mean the zone should bend its rules and bow down to how you want to most efficiently clear an area.... &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;"Problems" including summoning are 'summoning while in melee range' and 'summoning to where you can't melee'...&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;You don't think summoning after one riposte when they were tuned to only summon after some prolonged melee is a problem?  Because I'm 70, and have a DS of 80 or more, and riposte them for 5% or more to get them summoning, I should have to fight them in place while people LOWER level can pull them?</description>

A mob also can't hit you if you stay out of melee range, which is ideal for pulling anyways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other then making it so mobs don't summon to their center, there should be no changes. Perhaps a chance to resist being summoned is in order for low level mobs, but it should not be removed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Chances are if I run up to a clump of 3-4 shrooms and they all agro, I'm going to riposte at least one of them.. and that riposte + 2 or more DS hits is going to make it summon.  Then the rest of his buddies are going to hit me in the back for 15-20 each and take a few DS hits.  Then they're all summoning, and it'll take me 20 minutes to run 150 feet, especially if some are casters that don't chase me, and more wander in and add.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Then use a pulling class or one of your non-damage aggro abilities, and you're good to go.&amp;nbsp; While your problem is valid... what do you do about High level bards that can outrun the mob and damage them in safe little intervals?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Summoning means you can't do a large chunk of damage and then run away... if you're too powerful... take off your swords and give them a good punch in the nose... and stop worrying about the worst possible situations that can easily be overcome/ignored with sheer force.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;You could always pull with arrows.... and its not as if your group is in any danger.&amp;nbsp; Basically, if you can do that kind of damage to the mob, they don't want you running from the fight.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;You can't riposte or have them receive the damage shield unless you're already in melee range.&amp;nbsp; And fixing it so that if you're IN melee range, you can't get summoned would fix that problem.&amp;nbsp; Basically, fix the PROBLEMS with summoning, and the tactical annoyances will be drastically reduced.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;You're still avoiding the point I was getting at.  Why should a level 60 warrior be able to run up, smack this guy, and pull three shrooms to a camp 150 feet away, but a 70 warrior can't?  Summoning at all in this case is broken, if the mobs had a decent AI, they wouldn't and actually shouldn't follow me or summon me at all, they should run like hell.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides kiteing is what many classes are built for. Fear kiteing was a sk mainstay and now we can't use it worth beans, despite the fact it's what the class was known for. Summoning prevents soloing to any dagree period. Weather for good or ill that's it's base purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
