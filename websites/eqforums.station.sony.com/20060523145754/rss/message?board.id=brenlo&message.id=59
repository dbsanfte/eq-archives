&lt;DIV&gt;Ashlanne is cranky.&amp;nbsp; Hard to believe isn't it?&amp;nbsp; A cranky halfling is almost like a bad pie and as we all know, there is no bad pie.&amp;nbsp; Send her a PM Hug if you get the chance.&amp;nbsp; Send Kytherea a hug too. They need it.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Believe it or not, some of the folks on this forum can be a bit testy at times and those two poor halflings take the brunt of it.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; They are good people who care about this game and you fine folks.&amp;nbsp; They deserve any appreciation you can give them.&amp;nbsp; Unless your name is Sissl the Necromancer.&amp;nbsp; Then you had probably best avoid them, to contact them would be taking your life into your own hands.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Busy, busy, busy has been my power chant lately.&amp;nbsp; I went out to Austin last week to meet our SWG community team.&amp;nbsp; A fine bunch of folks out there.&amp;nbsp; They will be a delight to work with.&amp;nbsp; This week I am here in not so sunny lately, San Diego waiting to move offices.&amp;nbsp; Ashlanne and Kytherea are excited that they will finally be free from my oppression.&amp;nbsp; I will be free from the giggling.&amp;nbsp; Sometimes I think that this is less of an office and more of a slumber party without the pillow fights.&amp;nbsp; They throw Koosh Balls at me instead.&amp;nbsp; I am not sure which I would prefer.&amp;nbsp; Koosh balls have less kinetic energy behind them generally, but a pillow you know is coming.&amp;nbsp; At least it's not my coffee mug.&amp;nbsp; While I am often accused of having a thick head, that would hurt even my stone-like skull.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;My new office will be downstairs near some of the artists.&amp;nbsp; Why do artists shun natural light?&amp;nbsp; The place is lit like a tomb.&amp;nbsp; I keep expecting Buffy or Angel to bust in and start driving stakes through the artists hearts.&amp;nbsp; Maybe Willow will come by too and hang out and have coffee with me.&amp;nbsp; Then perhaps I could open the blinds and allow some real light in!&amp;nbsp; Perhaps I can just invest in some cheap, dark sunglasses for the lot of them and open the blinds anyway.&amp;nbsp; =)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I have to run for now, I have a Reckoning to attend.&amp;nbsp; Should be fun as I just polished my 6 shooters.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
