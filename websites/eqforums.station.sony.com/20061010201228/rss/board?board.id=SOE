      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;He was asking the same question we all ask. Why is there no longer active GMs on the PvP server? &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Your response, that there is an e-mail for complaints......Uh? Hello? you reading the post before you answering? Is english your second or third....nvm &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I have been on PvP server for almost 5 years. I have seen the Good GMs get moved off and the new ones never came. I dont need an e-mail to complain to. I would love to hear a good answer tho. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I understand that a lot of people are pissed off with SOE ... but I have seen a repeted pattern of ignoring their collective complaints. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I report the same hackers for the same having alll the time. I get a pre-bottled answer that thanks me for my time but they can do nothing about it...maybe next time I should petition....Then I petition and I get tthe same BS but it says I should have /reported.....HUH?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;My favorite one is when you get trained for hours in Qvic and 6 hours latter a Guide gets back to you to say "Thats too bad, but we must wittness the event..." ...ok, so where in god's name were you for the past 6 hours when we were asking for your help? &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The bottom line is CS has collapsed since the CS.Live.Starbucks change was made.&amp;nbsp; The only remaining use of report, petitions and GMs in general is to get items replaced when you delete them by mistake...and im sure that will get messed up soon or we will be asked to pay for it.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;(btw I expressed my distaste for it all the only way I can, I cancelled my account and when this month runs out, I will walk away from this whole cluster **** and go find something else to play)&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The error message that pops up when you try to log on during a patch either has a typo in it or is using some new variant of English. The message says&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;hr size="2" width="100%"&gt;The login server is currently&#xD;
not allowing connections. This is most likely due to a server patch&#xD;
that currently in progress. Please try again later.&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr size="2" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;I first reported this on July 18 (see &lt;a href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=TNZ&amp;amp;message.id=249598#M249598" target="_blank"&gt;http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=TNZ&amp;amp;message.id=249598#M249598&lt;/a&gt;) which aparantly got some attention from SOE because that thread was summarily locked after the first response (despite none of the message board rules being violated).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I mentioned it again on Sept 6 (see &lt;a href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=TNZ&amp;amp;message.id=254729#M254729" target="_blank"&gt;http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=TNZ&amp;amp;message.id=254729#M254729&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yet when attempting to log in today, I am again greeted by the same malformed sentence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is SOE attempting to create New English?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>new services, fees, ideas, economic approach to old expansions</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=SOE&amp;message.id=4902#M4902</link>
      <description>Well we have a lot of threads about ingame dynamics, balance and such. And that's good. But for a while i've been pondering another aspect of the game. The economical background. Ideas which were partly sparked by the eqplayers extra a month $$ costs one can select for specific services.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some of the ideas pushed forward here, are related to such thinking. Some are not but fall also in the economic ideas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some things that could be pushed forward, for a fee a person could select when they do the payment could be some of the following.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Extra character slot 1 (example 1$ a month)&lt;br&gt;Extra character slot 2 (example 1$ a month)&lt;br&gt;Probably more add on services could be offered although i cant think of em right now, the character slots were brought up coz of the recent new race and people want to start new chars. And if they stop paying the fee the character slot would get disabled but people if they would still want to play the extra character could then chose to delete an existing one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another idea is about the unlocking old expansions. For example one could after a said time make the oldest expansions add to the original. Making in fact anyone who just had basic eq, after a number of years see the zones they can go to add up. This wouldnt have to be an economic loss for SoE, as the income of the old expansions are probably just 0$.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For this part i'll push forward an analysis of the cost of expansions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;basic eq does not seem to be sold anymore or is free, cant find it (guess ya might have to buy a compilation)&lt;br&gt;compilations are 19.99 dollar&lt;br&gt;expansion 1 to 8 are at 9.99 dollar each&lt;br&gt;expansion 9 and 10 are at 19.99 dollar each&lt;br&gt;Expansion 11 and 12 are at 29.99 dollar each&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;would it not make common sense then that as an expansion becomes older that it gets automatically added to an account at a certain point. For a possible boost to older zones. Or even as a bonus for someone to return after years absence to discover it as a teaser. I'll try to explain more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Basic eq, and expansions 1 to 6 could in that way get unlocked. and sold at a cummulative price of 9.99&lt;br&gt;7 to 8 could still be marketted at 9.99&lt;br&gt;9 to 10 at 19.99&lt;br&gt;11 to 12 at 29.99&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;this would still make the normal compilations more intresting. Plus as each time an expansion would come out. the next oldest in row could be opened to existing accounts not having it. And could get added to the economic deal. Call it budget Everquest. Like some zones in the type of Pop, and guildlobby get opened to all. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;7.3 years and 1000's of hours, And &amp;nbsp;this sony accounting BS has done me in (Wish I had not bought the last exp. Or that both accounts renewed in the last&amp;nbsp; few Months for a year).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 2 Accounts 1- gets billed $99.00 the other at a new rate of 143. and change?&amp;nbsp; Should both be $99.00 a year.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;EQ cs accounts =were sorry but that offer was a limited time deal and you signed up a few days to late!JUNE 6&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;My main account is billed in April second account In September,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Second account was upgraded and&amp;nbsp;billed May 2 2005&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;In 2006 My main account was billed in May (A month late&amp;nbsp; "due to soe billing issues" according to soe&amp;nbsp;)&amp;nbsp; But second account that saw A pirce increase was billed on time ?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; MY CC statement says billed in May 2005&amp;nbsp; $209.98= 2 accounts @ $99.00 +tax&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; DOES 1+1=2 not if someone needs more money.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I'm known on these boards for being hard on soe but time and time again you folks prove that the Shoe fits.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Thanks for making Everquest the game it was never meant to be a PS2 game.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;and yes I'll get the rest of my Year in on both accounts .&amp;nbsp; But by soe accounting mabey 1 month maybe 7 who knows.....&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I would like to purchase it for another account ,but the only way is to buy it on a real packet, and the shipping cost are like 40$ to Spain (that what PoR cost me) so it become like 3x the normal price.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Thank you in advance.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;/sigh&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;After 4 1/2 years and 4 accounts I am about done with EQ.&amp;nbsp; I dont see alot of improvements...just alot of expansions.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;In fact, it is worse than ever.&amp;nbsp; You will have to excuse my rant but I just have to say something.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;It takes 5-6 tries to just log into EQ sometimes, an hour or two just to get a group started, then suddenly EQ crash.&amp;nbsp; I cant even keep one of my accounts online half the time, let alone the other three! The last year or more it has been difficult to find the right classes to get a decent group together because of all the people that have left despite the server merges.&amp;nbsp; Now there are less people and more zones...and Sony is worsening the problem by adding the expansions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Here are the wost of the problems: &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;1) Fix the log in and log out problems!&amp;nbsp; Goodness...this is the main thing your customers see/do!&amp;nbsp; Cant you put some effort into making sure the players have a smooth login.&amp;nbsp; The other night I tried for an hour to log in..I would get past the char screen and it would kick me back to the server screen.&amp;nbsp; The GM in chat told me I just have to restart again until it lets me in!!&amp;nbsp; Then, I go to switch to an Alt and EQ crashes...I have to go through the whole thing again....over 2 hours later I finally get to play.&amp;nbsp; Yesterday...same problem.&amp;nbsp; Tonight, same problem!!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;2) Fix your UI problems!&amp;nbsp; Some UI problems have been around for 3 expansions...like seeing your group members in the same zone as you even though they are not.&amp;nbsp; Or your group member that died still shows to be alive so you cannot rez them unless you zone out to clear the bug!!&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;3) Too many zones, not enough people to play in them!&amp;nbsp; It has become so difficult to find a group...and my main is a Cleric!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;4) zones take too long to get to.&amp;nbsp; It takes 20+ minutes to run to zones like MPG/RSS!&amp;nbsp; It use to be fun to have a FEW of these types of zones..now it seems that all the popular zones take forever to get to...add this to the difficulty on setting a group up too....&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;5) Takes too long to set a group up!&amp;nbsp; First you have to find enough people on....then get the right classes...then a 30 minute wait for everyone to get to the camp...it has been over an hour and you havent even killed anything yet!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If Sony stopped all expansions right now, it would still take me&amp;nbsp;5 years to finish all the flags, keys&amp;nbsp;, quests, etc that I would want to do.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If there is a better place to post this please feel free to instruct me but since I have been trying to login and group for the last 3 hours with no luck, I am too tired to find the proper place if this is not it.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Though I have nearly done so several times in the last 2 years, this is the first time I have posted on the subject.&amp;nbsp; PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE listen to your customers!&amp;nbsp; I know I am not the only person that feels the same.&amp;nbsp; I have had many friends leave the game&amp;nbsp; because of these issues.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>Greetings!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Recently I had a couple unfortunate incidents; an accidentally deleted character with a bunch of gear on it, and an augment bug that poofed my breastplate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I petitioned both of these incidents.&amp;nbsp; My deleted character and missing breastplate (and aug!) were replaced within 24 hours.&amp;nbsp; I am very happy with SOE right now, considering these incidents and my very positive experiences with The Serpent's Spine zones and gameplay, even if there were some glitches at release.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since replying to the petitions would mean keeping the petitions open, and I'd rather let the GMs do their job, I thought I'd come here and post my thoughts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thank you, GMs, Developers, and everyone else at SOE that goes into making EQ fun for us.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kal&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;On link &lt;A href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/" target=_blank&gt;http://everquest.station.sony.com/&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;it still says Pre-Order now.&amp;nbsp; Please remove that since it's already too late to "Pre-Order" the expansion.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Graphics are good, just needs the Pre-Order removed.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>A Suggestion for SOE</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=SOE&amp;message.id=4864#M4864</link>
      <description>I'm sure everyone knows that TSS is only available for DD. And that saddens many players including myself who do not have credit cards. But I have an option that will gave players without a credit card a opportunity to buy the expansion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am sure a lot of you are familiar with paybycash.com. For those who aren't, paybycash.com is a website where you can buy various game subscriptions (including EverQuest) with real cash (not money orders, even though that is an option). What you do is that you print off your order number and the barcode and send it to the paybycash company with money included. What they do is when they send you a SOE game card code through e-mail&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When registering retail expansions&amp;nbsp; you go to your account registration and&amp;nbsp; enter in a code right? What is so different from a game card code and an expansion code? You could send the money and they will send you a SS code! And there are no packaging or shipping costs for SOE.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I really hope you consider this, because I don't want to get behind in EQ and this seems like an excellent expansion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Peace,&lt;br&gt;Ben&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
