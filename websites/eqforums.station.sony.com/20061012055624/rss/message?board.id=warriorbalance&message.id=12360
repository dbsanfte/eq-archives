&lt;DIV&gt;Taunt is broken. That much is now official. &amp;nbsp;It was broken back in Kunark when an artificial cap was jerry-rigged onto success rate versus above-con mobs, due to the fact that people didn't fight overcon mobs in those days. This bug has been located and identified within the code. 14 months of 'evaluation' to one of the core abilities of our class, and noone noticed this cap, but now finally it's been admitted that&amp;nbsp;5 years of parses and complaints about an innordinately abysmal success rate on yellow/red mobs wasn't all in our imagination. Huzzah. Better late than never. Better a&amp;nbsp;few weeks&amp;nbsp;late than 5 years late, but hey - can't have everything, and at least they're working on it now!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So I checked the class issue lists hoping to see something along the lines of:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;A longstanding bug has been found in the taunt code, and a fix is being worked on which should solve this&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Instead we get the same recorded 'Please hold. Your call is important to us' message. Seriously, if these lists don't get updated when new information comes to light, then what is the point of a monthly update? This isn't even a case of propogating information from the devs to the players - this is knowledge already in the public domain. Devs know it, players know it, the only place it doesn't seem known is in the supposed information transfer nexus of the class issues list.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I fail to see the point of 'updating' these lists with comments that bear no relevence to the state of things. If the&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66cc00 size=2&gt;proposed first pass with class re-envisioning posted on EQLive on 3/14/2005 &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;hasn't even happened more than 6 months later, what is the relevence of updating the list? Paladins got their spells changed without any sort of 'first pass', and endurance cost changes are no different from changing mana cost on a spell. More than that, rather than the problem being fixed, we just get more drains on our already impoverished endurance pool.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Change the lists to being a one way information process so that at least it's not so blatently obvious warriors are being totally ignored.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Rangers are better with a bow than you are Zuk, and I'm listed as a master in the weapon skills I have. How many spells are you a master at casting? Everytime they add spells to knight classes, and aa to knight classes they increase knightly power. Levels increase knightly power even more cause it grants them access to several spells.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Warriors get what, few more hps and maybe 1 dicsapline? The bigger knights get through levels the more powrful they will become because they are both caster and melee, sooner or later it won't matter how much beter with a bow you are because you will never match my spell output. Any dual ability type class wether they be called &amp;quot;hybrid&amp;quot; or not will become more powerful as the levels and abilities increase as a consaquence of haveing two sets of abilities.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Nod Rangers are better with a bow - when they use their disciplines. But they don't have significantly better bows. Rogues are better with a dagger - when they use thier disciplines, but they don't have significantly better daggers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Exactly right Sharbreena regarding hybrids drifting towards being Dual Classes. And that's why it's necessary to preserve not chip away at the intended pure class specialization advantages.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I must be better with weapons and passive avoidance/mitigation abilites like Shield Block - I'm not going to ever buff, heal, etc. like a Paladin nor pull and have a pet like an SK. &lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Battleblade-Xegony on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;02-08-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;03:49 PM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Actually rangers have AM/EQ that gives them an inherently better output with a bow than we have but that's OK.  Bows are supposed to be their thing, and I'll even go so far as to say they probably need a bump to archery in the current content, as more and more rangers drift back to melee.  I'm willing to concede rangers are supposed to be better with a bow than warriors.  I also think rangers are getting the shaft on pulling ability, especially in DoD etc. where mobs are rapidly becoming the yellows of our youth.  It was fine when Harm worked to split yellows, but with the massive handicapping of the Lull lines out there, rangers have fallen out of the top 3 pullers to closer to 6th or so.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;What I'd really like to see is an honest parse from an SK, Warrior, and Paladin taking dual weilding warrior vs sword and board knight, and spells, etc and see what those numbers work out to DPS wise. &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I agree with BB on some of the premise that melee wise skills make the melee dps difference. If we had the same ratioed weapons then he would out dps me melee wise, because his skills allow him triple attacks and more consistant hits. My spells would compensate for the difference, wich I have always advocated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have been pretty consistant in stateing that because of my double nature, what ever weakness one half has the other half covers for and vice versa. Warriors have no casting ability and that's thier weakness, pure casters have no melee ability and that's thier weakness. I combine both, each covering the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm able to tank as well as a warrior in most content because my caster side compensates my weaker durability via lifetaps, ac taps and the like. I'm able to stand toe to toe with mobs a caster couldn't because my warrior half gives me the durability  and hps a caster doesn't have. It's like a warrior has a D20 and I have 2 D10's, we both have the ability to reach 20, while it's easier for him to get 20 naturally against me needing two 10's, he can also roll a 1 wich I will never do.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You missed the point, I don't have a 'parent class&amp;quot; anymore, I am a parent class. I don't have &amp;quot;subpar abilities&amp;quot; I'm  listed as master in all of them, both fighting and casting. Combine my casting and fighting skills and I outmatch you dps  wise, and minus your defensive, tank as well as you do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The knights have been slowing becomeing that duel class that BB has always been concerned with. No a warrior won't outmatch a full fledged dual class, nobody can, that's why BB has been voiceing his concern for so long, he has seen this evalution progress the last 4 years, so have I.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are not at that point yet. But trying to balance knights is becomeing increaseingly more difficult with each new expansion, because of the increased power output of added aa's combined with spells.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Yeah, kinda thought so.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Knights don't need balance anymore, they need to be dropped down a notch via improving warriors now. &lt;b&gt;The fun factor&lt;/b&gt; that SoE has been given you doesn't equate well with &lt;b&gt;any challenges for next expansion&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;if they can't increase AC caps, skills or any meelee superduper disc for warriors now (and they haven't btw, 40hps and like 20AC increase on a FULL expansion is dumb and at the same time proves the point), the only feasible solution for them is to give them skillsets for close combat and the full gamut of weaponry configurations that we should be able to use just by class definition. Then we can talk about the fun factor Warriors gain with it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meantime, you are still subpar and your parent still hate you for turning into a rotten kid anyways &lt;span&gt;:smileytongue:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

Sharb! Let me just point out that from what you are saying, right now, I'm an &lt;b&gt;incomplete&lt;/b&gt; full fighter, and not the king of pure melee, which encompasses combat skill, DPS, tanking AND aggro altogether!.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once we correct that little omission, then what you state should be something like this:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With spells and melee I out DPS Warrior, but my &lt;b&gt;combat skills are crap&lt;/b&gt; and most likely I can't sustain consistent DPS since my mana bar drops considerably, or I die (why I use FD). I'm not a half caster, I'm a full caster but an &lt;u&gt;INEFFICIENT&lt;/u&gt; one at that, and a full fighter, also &lt;u&gt;INNEFICIENT&lt;/u&gt; ( that means you tank badly, btw).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warrior can out DPS you in melee, but at the moment my combat skills, which should be superior to your in every way are being neglected by devs. My toolset doesn't include close combat abilities that for some reason would have come out of the special opening testing long ago done for warriors, yet mostly ended up being a test for a new dead end class called the berserker.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If the Warrior class was given all the toolset it truely requires and followed to the letter his class description, your statement will still acknowledge that you are in fact a totally &lt;b&gt;subpar&lt;/b&gt; full caster &amp;amp; melee, to which the conclusion would be clear ... you are not SUPERIOR to any of you parent classes. Devs need EQ Definition of Classes 101 it seems&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'll take &amp;quot;Shadow Knights in Dreamland&amp;quot; for 1000, Alex &lt;span&gt;:smileyvery-happy:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Yah, its the AE version, but its the same level, and the almost triple mana cost was in the SK's favor so I didn't think they'd mind.  I thought pointing out SK's get 30 hate per fuel point instead of the 3.7 we get over 30 seconds.. You know.. that almost 10:1 ratio would have been a touch over the top.  I wanted to make sure the discussion kept the hate addition from the spell in game, and not on the boards ;)&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Hmm. I am a Warrior and I`m reading Warrior threads hoping i will see some info about wth Sony does about some legitimate concerns that Warriors have atm.&lt;br&gt;And THEN i see shiatload of posts from knights turning every freaking Warrior thread in Kinights vs Warrior thing.&lt;br&gt;And it makes me angry , so I will respond some.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First lets see the top  concerns Warriors have.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1  Taunt&lt;br&gt;It is broken. It doesnt work as intended , Devs admited it , All warriors know it , everyone  that uses it know this.&lt;br&gt;There is no Vule , Zi or whatever the hell mob. IT IS broken. It is a FACT.&lt;br&gt;And lets hope that SoE will do something about this soon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. Weapon upgrade&lt;br&gt;Now this is where Knights started talking about things that they clearly dont understand.&lt;br&gt;I dont expect from a knight to fully understand why we are asking for BBoB upgrade and why we need a weapon upgrade but I also dont expect from Kinights to coment on Warrior forums how we DONT need it and everything is fair to all Tanking classes in EQ weaponwise when it is clearly not.&lt;br&gt;We are not talking about dps upgrades. I could care less about my dps when I`m tanking.&lt;br&gt;Our only concern when we tank is the aggro.&lt;br&gt;And wileding 3 expansions old main hander is not cuting it anymore.&lt;br&gt;PoP - DBoW , an Aggro King&lt;br&gt;GoD - BBoB was natural upgrade from DBoW to match the aggro that Tacvi dps class weps were producing.&lt;br&gt;OOW - Here  we have the Rog , Ranger and Berserker 2.0 producing even more aggro and I`m not even mentioning the nukes and other aggro spells , thats diferent topic alltogether.&lt;br&gt;What Warrior got here is our cool Epic to match that , which is lil odd also , becouse we have to offhand our Epic weapon becouse it was not an  Aggro upgrade of  BBoB.&lt;br&gt;Notched Blade is not  an aggro upgrade of  BBoB , and to make it even worse , they put a stun proc on a crazy ratio/swing aggro weapon and put Rog/Rng on it and make it even more dificult for Warriors to maintain aggro.&lt;br&gt; DoN - launches more dps crazy weps that produce even more aggro with no BBoB upgrade in sight.&lt;br&gt; DoD  - does exactly the same , and  upgrades the same type of weapon as Notched , that 30/19 Carver.&lt;br&gt;The stupid Carver is not an aggro upgrade to BBoB.&lt;br&gt;So... do you guys understand what Frodin was  talking about before you all started atacking him how losing defence vs dps is natural thing to do ? We are not talking dps..we are talking Warrior main hand weapon and aggro.&lt;br&gt;So let me repet it again :&lt;br&gt;- Warrior Epic 2.0 is NOT a BBoB upgrade.&lt;br&gt;- Notched Blade of Bloodleting is NOT a BBoB upgrade.&lt;br&gt;- Swiftcleave , the Flesh Carver  ( Notched 2.0 ) is NOT a BBoB upgrade&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the top and most legitimate complaint that Warriors have.&lt;br&gt;We need an upgrade main hand weapon and we havent seen it in 3 expansions for god knows what reason.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Lost in all of this is the situation with 2 Handers.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;One can be an apologist for SoE and say fixing taunt and adressing Warrior sword and board issues are toooo haaard...&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;One can be a godmode Knight and try to claim shields, Shield Block, and adventageously ratioed Knight one-handers are Knight "class" defining.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;But neither can claim that 2Hdrs have been made sufficiently attractive to Warriors.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;There are not enough high DPS 2H aggro weapons capable of being used to MT in raids between BoW and the present time. The loss of aggro procs compared to DWing is too great. And the DPS improvement too little.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Adjusting procratemod, increasing Warriro 2H DPS, and giving Warriors 2H Bash would address these issues. One can't make either the claim that such adjustments would be tooooo haaaard or would violatate some imagined monopoly on tanking with a 2Hndr that Knights have.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;It's NOT that it shouldn't be done or can't be done. SoE apparently won't interrupt it's 100 Improvements for Paladins meetings to do it.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Battleblade-Xegony on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;02-02-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;05:09 AM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

The loss of aggro procs compared to DWing is too great. And the DPS improvement too little.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the point is what?  This is the first time in 3 years I have ever heard of a warrior wanting to tank raid mobs with a 2hander.  I can understand wanting to use sword and board but a 2 hander?  Just ask for the moon it makes as much sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adjusting procratemod, increasing Warriro 2H DPS, and giving Warriors 2H Bash would address these issues. One can't make either the claim that such adjustments would be tooooo haaaard or would violatate some imagined monopoly on tanking with a 2Hndr that Knights have&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No adjusting 2handed DPS coupled with your ideas for a shield mate would give warriors too high a DPS...but then you only like to complain about &amp;quot;godmode&amp;quot; knights, and ignore your own godmode attempts for warriors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It's NOT that it shouldn't be done or can't be done. SoE apparently won't interrupt it's 100 Improvements for Paladins meetings to do it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yeah more classic BB rhetoric we went 30 whole seconds without it.  That 100 improvements to knights thing is pretty funny.  You act as if warriors are the redheaded step child of EQ.  You act as if they are the only class of 16 that have &amp;quot;currently being evaluated&amp;quot; items on there top 10 list.  News flash bub, go look at all the list and notice ALL 16 classes have items like this that have been largely ignored for the entire existance of top 10 lists in EQ.  You are not unique in this slight, you are not alone in it, so stop acting like only warriors are ignored.  All classes are ignored to a certain degree.  Your constent blathering about what paladins have recieved really shows you to be nothing more than an envious player, I'd recommend you dye your armor green, as it fits your attitude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Battleblade-Xegony on &lt;span class="date_text"&gt;02-02-2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;05:09 AM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

But I digress because, as said repeatedly, the trade off is too great and Warriors need improvements to their Sword and Board. However there is difference between what you need and what your asking for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But all you need is to have your melee DPS with Sword and Board increased to be in range of acceptable Warrior melee damage, which I think roughly 80% is propper. Such an increase in melee will also increase your resulting aggro, combined with fixes to Taunt and your Incite line this will prove to be more then adequate for dealing with Warrior shields.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
