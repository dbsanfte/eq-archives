&lt;P&gt;Do you still plan to fix Co9 (and the other listed encounters) this year? Sorry to sound grumpy (i know you are trying atleast), but this nonsense holds up a lot of flagging guilds.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;No need for long testing or QA&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;we didn't had those for the last change either obviously :smileysad:.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;Rashere posted:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;"&lt;STRONG&gt;For AE rampage, it was specifically built to hit everyone that is able to hit the NPC&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&amp;nbsp; I know there are certain NPCs where you can stand out on the perimeter, hit the NPC, and not be hit by AE rampage, but that's not something that was intended to happen.&amp;nbsp; I'm not really sure why it happens and haven't looked into it to figure it out, but its certainly nothing&amp;nbsp;we set.&amp;nbsp; AE rampage should just hit everyone who can hit the NPC."&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The bolded portion just makes no sense to me, especially when mobs hit for full damage. Do you Dev types even play the game anymore? Are you oblivious to the waining population of healers? The days of 10+ clerics are long gone. Most guilds are using bare minimum of healers and even then we have to be super&amp;nbsp;slick on how to squeeze the needed healing power out of our small healer force.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;AE Rampage should NEVER hit for full damage UNLESS it's avoidable by paying attention and staying out of its range, otherwise you are giving a big FU to pure melee because most guilds cannot afford the healing resources to allow them to get in and melee. Not to mention its a huge risk anyways if a mob can one round them. Guilds will go to ranged strats and&amp;nbsp;pure melee&amp;nbsp;will have to sit back and throw stuff for 10pts a pop. Gogo l33t dps.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I can't believe you even intended this in the first place. This is inherently bad for EQ in general.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;U&gt;AE rampage should be a mechanism to either:&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;A) Add a SMALL amount of extra healing to an encounter by having AE rampage that hits for low amounts.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;(This would be that unavoidable type)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;OR&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;B) Be avoidable&amp;nbsp;by meleeing at max range. Reward for paying attention, punishment for not.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;BOTH scenarios allow melee to participate in the fight. Which is obviously good for EQ as a whole. I&amp;nbsp;guess I can't wrap my head around the thinking process of designers of a game that is based upon grouping and class balance creating events that exclude people on a large scale.&amp;nbsp;Full damage, unavoidable AE Rampage does just that and its very very wrong.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Dev's, please look at the game from a players perspective. We are not asking for encounters to be made easier. We are asking that you do not include mechanics that make certain classes useless in raids. If AE rampage is going to remain full damage and unavoidable I can see alot of pissed off pure melee. I personally would like to know if this trend will continue, if so I will be recruiting more ranged classes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;You need to realize that when I say how AE rampage works, I'm just telling you how it was built to work many, many years ago, not how I would make it work if I were making it today.&amp;nbsp; I happen to agree with many of your points, but that's not how it was built.&amp;nbsp; AE rampage was built to do a mobs full hit to everyone who can hit the NPC.&amp;nbsp; There's&amp;nbsp;an error somewhere in there that makes it not work that way on certain NPCs.&amp;nbsp; Since I have no intention of changing that, I've never bothered to go figure out what the error is.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Later, the ability to scale rampage damage was added, which also lowers AE ramage damage.&amp;nbsp; Unfortunately, since they were&amp;nbsp;tied together, we&amp;nbsp;can't tune down one without lowering the other.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;We've just added a seperate tuning mechanism for AE rampage that lets us&amp;nbsp;set that damage seperately from rampage so we can tone down AE rampage damage without affecting rampage damage...something I hope to do on older NPCs in the near future.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Thank you for the response Rashere.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;With this new scaling system will you guys take the time to go through and properly tune each mob that needs it? You effectively can tune rampage like I mentioned, just from the unaviodable stance. Please keep it reasonable :) Unless you guys can adjust ranges too? Then you could make it smaller than the hit range and add in a RvR melee opporunity as I mentioned, bigger hit but avoidable through positioning. Too close get hit, on edge your fine. Possible?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I was specifically told (a week ago or so) that the actual max melee&#xD;
range to avoid ae rampage was the result of rounding errors, not&#xD;
intentional mechanics - so I'm guessing its not settable atm.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Would be nice if it could be though.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;the worry that many of us have is not so much that AE ramp is there. that In most cases can effectively be dealt with given that it follows the AE ramp rules of befor, IE limited in range to hitbox or near hotbox raidus&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Now what i would like to know is the following&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Scripts that you Added Ae Ramp to, or left in place, Did you retune the difficulty of the encounter to reflect the increased use of healing resources, interupts cuased, loss of DPS ect.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Scripts that Now have both AE ramp and Single target ramp, did you again add in a Tune for the resouces used, did you look at the actual Ramp damage comeing out? Vish is reported to be both Single and AE ramping, great we can adjust, my question would be do i need a double ch Chain to handle Vish single ramp due to the amount of damage? looky there an increase of resources on a fight that is not trivial for most guilds even guilds that have it down pat heh. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Agian adding ramps of differnt types have now possibly affected the difficuly of the script in various ways, and My concern here is that after 6 months to 3 years Mobs are all of sudden more difficult and take more resources to handle the added damage inc to the raid, and in some cases require a new tactic? &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;i am glad you are makeing the effort to Fix things, its a great thing to know, but in fixing things is this makeing it tougher on guilds that are progressing behind other guilds, and thus increaseing the gap? a large fear of many guilds that are not cutting edge leaders on their servers is the loss of folks up the food chain, this can and has caused great guilds to fold as a result, and when you make things tougher after certian number of guilds have progressed useing the workign strats of the time, You now make it harder for the guilds comeing in behind?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;seems like we had this discussion on that massive AMV 'Fix" that made him extreemly hard for guilds that had bearly gotten to CoA, and the changeing of difficuly of the encounter unblanced things server wide for guilds that were ahead and guilds that were comeing in.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;my main concern is that these "Fixes" maintain the same difficulty of the encounter and that when the difficulty is looked at, that resources (IE clerics wich are most definately not a dime a dozen) are looked at with the scripts "Fixes" that have gone in.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;sorry for the spam, jsut trully concerned with difficult encounters suddenly becomeing major road blocks to many guilds that previously were able to deal with them with reasonable resources, and yes a change in how much DPS you can do to a mob is a major consideration for resources on any fight, and AE ramp that is hitting for Top end most of the time, as well as single ramp hitting for top end most of the time is scary on the resource and DPS level on any raid. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Change the encounters all you like, we can adjust, just please make sure that the difficutly of that encounter is on par with what more progressed guilds had to deal with that is all most of us are prob really asking here&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Rashere or Prathun, can you guys confirm what you mean by fixed, please? Do you mean those zones and scripts were returned to their state prior to the mob abilities fix? In particular it seems like a lot of encounters that had only one type of rampage, either single or AE, ended up with both. In addition it seems like the actual damage amount on one or both of those was also affected, most notable when it increased significantly. Will these encounters that have been noted as being fixed behave as they did prior to the abilities fix, or do they just have one of the rampages disabled? I'm just trying to get a solid handle on what we can trust to be similar to what we know, and what we should be prepared to go into full force, expecting the worst. &lt;span&gt;:smileyhappy:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;Rashere or Prathun, can you guys confirm what you mean by fixed, please? Do you mean those zones and scripts were returned to their state prior to the mob abilities fix? In particular it seems like a lot of encounters that had only one type of rampage, either single or AE, ended up with both. In addition it seems like the actual damage amount on one or both of those was also affected, most notable when it increased significantly. Will these encounters that have been noted as being fixed behave as they did prior to the abilities fix, or do they just have one of the rampages disabled? I'm just trying to get a solid handle on what we can trust to be similar to what we know, and what we should be prepared to go into full force, expecting the worst. &lt;SPAN&gt;:smileyhappy:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;It varies depending on the needs of the event.&amp;nbsp; For most events, we tried to return it to what was happening before the patch, which generally meant removing AE rampage entirely.&amp;nbsp; Sendaii and the Anguish events are a good example.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In others, like Co9, the chance to AE rampage was greatly reduced, but not removed entirely&amp;nbsp;(in this particular case, it was lowered from 30% to 1% chance).&amp;nbsp; In others, they still AE ramage, but for much less damage than before (Txevu and Tacvi mobs are good examples).&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The safest bet is to be careful with events we've changed and feel them out again on your next attempt before you just engage with your old patterns.&amp;nbsp; While most of them should be back to their old behavior, some will react a bit differently and may require slightly different tactics.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This was the third time we did her, and the first time i noticed my pets took ramp from her. It's not a biggie for this fight since for most of the fight only the tanks&amp;nbsp;are in range of ramp, but there are other fights in PoP where this could turn out nasty, so i just wanted to give a heads up.</description>

      <description>So like they gonna fix tris wallow's III ae ramp?  Because even if it was designed to be this way to begin with.  She was already redone to give her more hps as is.  So first they revamp her to fix her 3 times and now again?  Here's to hoping for a fix.  I could understand if they didn't already change her 3 times.  But you can't tell me that this is the way it was to be intended since the original intention of the mob has been changed 3 times before.  Please take off this ae ramp, don't know if we can even do it anymore.</description>
