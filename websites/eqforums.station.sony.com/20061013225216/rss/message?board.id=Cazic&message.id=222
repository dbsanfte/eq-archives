    <description>&lt;DIV&gt;If anyone has heard from or knows of a Woodelf-rogue named asassin would you PM me his email address or the best way to contact him please.He was from the original Cazic thule server. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Last I heard from him was not long after Kunark came out. I quit playing, he moved away, and after that I lost track of him. I doubt he still plays but I thought this was worth a shot since I dont realy know how else to try to find him.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
