<P>I think that Hate 2.0 is a lot more group oriented than raid.&nbsp; Characters that can fight there for xp can do so very successfully in groups.&nbsp; A counter example would be Anguish or most of the GoD raid zones where a single group attempting to earn xp there would find it extremely difficult unless they were overgeared for the zone.&nbsp; In Hate's original incarnation it was near impossible without a full raid, much like Fear.&nbsp; However, the newer version (which I like much much better....bravo for that revamp) is group oriented with only a few raid targets.&nbsp; In that regard, how is the revamped Hate different from WoS, MPG, Arcstone, Rellic or Sunderock?&nbsp; They all have raid targets but are mostly used by groups hunting for xp, quests&nbsp;and drops.</P>
<P>Considering the loot drops, named PH camps (completely unsuited to a theoretical raid plow) and the mob difficulty against a group of characters at the appropriate level, I think that Hate mobs should have the 30 second cool down timer&nbsp;except for&nbsp;the few raid targets.</P>

<P>The argument here seems to be to reduce the trash mobs in Hate/Fear/whatever down to the 30 second timer and only leave the actual raid level mobs be the 5 minute timer.&nbsp; I can certainly understand and appreciate the desire to have that happen, but on the other hand you are using having been able to solo or group in these same zones easily 2 years ago as your argument.</P>
<P>This is 2 years ago when you did not have Out of Combat regen available to you.&nbsp; Granted it would be nice and much easier if you had the 30 second version, but you are already confirming to us that you didn't need it in the first place to solo there.&nbsp; Why do you need it now?</P><p>Message Edited by Edimas on <span class=date_text>11-01-2006</span> <span class=time_text>12:23 PM</span>

<DIV>Were chardok&nbsp;library originally intended to be one grouped?&nbsp; Was PoFire trash originally intended to be solod?&nbsp; Does it have a raid timer?&nbsp; When I go to kael areana will I find a raid timer on trash[dont know actually]?&nbsp; Is juggs and beyond to track on a raid timer?&nbsp; The only point I am making is this standard of "original intent" isnt exactly applied with the true original intent of every zone in mind.&nbsp; There is a little "whats it to us now" out there...</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>But back to hates "original intent".&nbsp;In the revamp of hate with the progressive range quest here:</DIV>
<DIV><A href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2457" target=_blank>http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2457</A></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>And youll note that progressive quest came into existance with a whole bunch of new named here:</DIV>
<DIV><A href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?zone=68" target=_blank>http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?zone=68</A></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>And all of them were being done at the time of there ~creation~ by one groups.&nbsp; Because tahts what those areas were designed for...</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Here is people in 2003 doing the quest without a raid:</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Here are people talking about where to group in the NEW plane of hate in 2003:</DIV>
<DIV><A href="http://www.thesafehouse.org/forums/showthread.php?t=4202&amp;highlight=hate+revamp" target=_blank>http://www.thesafehouse.org/forums/showthread.php?t=4202&amp;highlight=hate+revamp</A></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>My point there is you have invoked original release date for the content and plane of hate was reenvisioned in 2003 with new none raid content!&nbsp; Sending that argument into a subjective abyss of unconvincingness....&nbsp; And the point of mentioning the quest is it was revamped with 1 group content!&nbsp; You guys ADDED one group named in the new hate.&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The old 2001 hate died.&nbsp; YOU GUYS KILLED IT!&nbsp; You replaced it with a group friendly one with group friendly content.&nbsp; Dead.&nbsp; Now your a necromancer of a developer.&nbsp; Resurrecting the existance of 2001 hate for purposes nobody understands. Well I dont. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>You revamped it in 2003 and you added 2003 raid mobs but you didnt sorround them with 2003 trash.&nbsp; This is as much a raid zone from its real "era" of 2003 as WoS is to OoW.&nbsp; Logically the mobs that were added in the revamp for level 65 players in 2003 but arnt intended for raid content should be given a 30 second timer.</DIV>

<P>Whether or not an NPC is a raid NPC is based on the original intent of the content.&nbsp; The planes were raid zones originally and therefore the NPCs in there are considered raid NPCs for the purposes of regen.&nbsp; That you can solo there now is irrelevant.&nbsp; That's due to the&nbsp;progress and advancement of your character in relation to the content.&nbsp; At worst, the&nbsp;5 minute timer just ensures that raid content remains at least slightly more difficult than equivalent non-raid content even as time marches on.</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>Then increase the xp! It's original eq, there is no justifiable reason, after 12 expansions and 25 levels increased,&nbsp;to still consider this a raid zone, as it hasn't been such past the first few expansions which made it obsolete, with the exception of a few epic raids. Prior to the con/xp change, the trash mobs gave MORE xp than equivalent non-raid mobs, than they do now and with no penalty, puting in the penalty while&nbsp;lessoning their xp, yet still considering them raid content,&nbsp;is just obtuse.<BR>
<HR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>You're missing the point even thought you include the reason right there in your post.&nbsp; "It's original eq".&nbsp; That's not quite true, but the point remains the same.&nbsp; The reason its easy now is because you're taking characters that are far more advanced than the zone was built for...but that doesn't mean its a non-raid zone anymore than Anguish will be a non-raid zone&nbsp;when people&nbsp;can single group all the bosses there.</P>
<P>Also, XP in the zone hasn't changed one whit.&nbsp; It's the same as its ever been.&nbsp; Of course, as you level up, the XP they give is going to be less because the NPCs levels aren't going up while yours are...same as everywhere else.</P>
<P>Rashere</P><BR>

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>You're correct, "It's original eq" isn't quite true, the zone was revamped so it's not original. And I wrote that totally wrong, it doesn't convey the point I was trying to make. That no longer matters though, another poster addressed the revamp quite well. The intent of that zone was changed long ago with the revamp, so the original intent of the content no longer applies in the first place.<BR></P>
<P>As to the xp, the con change did indeed change the xp in this zone. You can compare the current xp off light blue/green at 75 to any equivalent non-raid mobs in other zones and find them equal. In the past, any time raid level mobs became groupable/soloable due to increase in level etc, the xp those fewer people then got was significantly more than any equivalent non-raid flagged mob, which should be the case here yet isn't. I hope this now conveys my point better.</P>

<DIV>And all of them were being done at the time of there ~creation~ by one groups.&nbsp; Because tahts what those areas were designed for...</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>My point there is you have invoked original release date for the content and plane of hate was reenvisioned in 2003 with new none raid content!&nbsp; Sending that argument into a subjective abyss of unconvincingness....&nbsp; And the point of mentioning the quest is it was revamped with 1 group content!&nbsp; You guys ADDED one group named in the new hate.&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The old 2001 hate died.&nbsp; YOU GUYS KILLED IT!&nbsp; You replaced it with a group friendly one with group friendly content.&nbsp; Dead.&nbsp; Now your a necromancer of a developer.&nbsp; Resurrecting the existance of 2001 hate for purposes nobody understands. Well I dont. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>You revamped it in 2003 and you added 2003 raid mobs but you didnt sorround them with 2003 trash.&nbsp; This is as much a raid zone from its real "era" of 2003 as WoS is to OoW.&nbsp; Logically the mobs that were added in the revamp for level 65 players in 2003 but arnt intended for raid content should be given a 30 second timer.</DIV>

				Thank you for responding to this thread Rashere.<br><br>You have yet to respond to any of the posts, including my own, that point out that when the zone was revamped it was changed to be an exp grind zone.&nbsp; You can not tell me that the revamped Hate was meant to be entirely as a raid zone?&nbsp; It has two raid mobs yes, but the entire rest of the zone is an exp zone.&nbsp; 98% of all the mobs there can be single pulled by any class.&nbsp; The Marsinger Quests, (for the time, best risk vs. reward quest ever), was designed to let a person one group the entire quest.<br><br>To sum up, yes.&nbsp; Plane of Fear?&nbsp; Yes, raid zone.&nbsp; Plane of Air?&nbsp; Yes, raid zone.&nbsp; Plane of Hate?&nbsp; No, the "new" hate is a wonderful exp zone that was "designed" for that.&nbsp; Go back to the original designer please, go back to the patch notes when it launched, go play in the zone, you will see that it has dozens of camps and can support several groups all over the zone.<br><br>Thank you for your time.<br><div></div>

				I think making the trash mobs in Plane of Hate on the 30 second timer and the harder named on the 5 minute timer would be reasonable.&nbsp; The old Plane of Hate was a raid zone, but when it was revamped,&nbsp; and access was made easier, I thought it was intended to be a regular experience zone with some raid encounters. <br><br>

<p>Whether or not an NPC is a raid NPC is based on the original intent of the content.&nbsp; The planes were raid zones originally and therefore the NPCs in there are considered raid NPCs for the purposes of regen.&nbsp; That you can solo there now is irrelevant.&nbsp; That's due to the&nbsp;progress and advancement of your character in relation to the content.&nbsp; At worst, the&nbsp;5 minute timer just ensures that raid content remains at least slightly more difficult than equivalent non-raid content even as time marches on.</p>
