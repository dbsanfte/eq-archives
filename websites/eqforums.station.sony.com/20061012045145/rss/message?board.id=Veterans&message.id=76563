    <title>Thoughts of a... resting... EQ player</title>
    <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Veterans&amp;message.id=76563</link>
    <description>So I found myself playing another MMO a few weeks ago. I had a good time with it. It's not EQ, and doesn't have the depth or grandeur of EQ, but it was a welcome break. I've also been spreading out and playing some other games on various platforms, including consoles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Last night, I logged back into EQ to check with my friends and see how everything was going. What I found was that EQ seemed almost painfully slow and un-fun compared to all the other stuff I'd been doing. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What this tells me is not that I will be quitting EQ forever yadda deleting all my characters yadda no you can't have my stuff yadda yadda. This DOES tell me that my break isn't quite over for the time being. I have no doubt that EQ will continue to be my MMO of choice. For the time being, however, I'm having more fun exploring other venues. I need to give EQ a little time to become strange, exciting, and challenging again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That said, my brief stint away has given me some time to crystalize some thoughts on EQ that people who are currently closer to the game may be too polarized to think about objectively. Hopefully, my thoughts may give others ideas on what they want to ask for when the 're-envisioning' hand comes around to adjust their particular slice of the game world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- EQ's consider system is not being used for its intended purpose. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everquest's con system, the familiar green, light blue, blue, yellow, and red is not being used to indicate relative difficulty of monsters. It's being used almost solely as an indicator of experience modifier from  the very lowest levels to the very highest levels.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This indicates that enemies have levels that are wildly inconsistent with their abilities, hit points, and damage capacity. As EQ has grown as a game, this disparity between 'con' and actual difficulty has grown more apparent. You can even try to peg part of this disparity on trying to adjust the con system for group mechanics, but even then, the disparity is still more indicative of the experience you can expect to receive than the difficulty of the fight.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Depending on where you are in the game and the makeup of your group, a single 'blue' con mob may be a brisk, refreshing fight  or an almost impossible pitched battle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- The 'Death Penalty' in EQ is extremely harsh.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The experience loss penalty in EQ is really quite severe compared to just about every other game on the market. 'Ressurections' are nominally intended as a mechanic to encourage players to form groups, but even then are still quite severe. Players without ressurection abilities on taps are hurt  the worst, in terms of hours of 'lost' experience. Even with ressurection abilities available, the amount of downtime and 'lost' time incurred due to player death is quite punitive when compared to other games. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Reinforcement is very punitive in EQ.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everquest's bread and butter is reinforcing game play. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Players are rewarded, usually with smaller stimuli such as the increase of a statistic or status bar. Occasionally, they are rewarded for completing a story-line quest with character dialogue. The most major rewards in EQ are new items, new abilities, and the ability to travel to new areas, which occur must less frequently.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Players are also punished quite sternly, both with the 'time loss' death penalty mentioned above, but also with down-time, in which one or more players are 'resting' due to over exertion of one kind or another, or loss of items or money earned. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The best reward to punishment ratio comes from following well-established curves, pre-existing steps, and favorable conditions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It does not pay, for example, to explore a dangerous new area, because there is significantly more punishment than reward involved when compared to playing a repetitive 'grinding' game in a well-explored older area. Attempting an encounter, a quest, or recipe without having read a walkthrough beforehand is an almost certain recipe for disaster.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Punishment comes fast and furiously compared to many other games, while rewards are often so slow and tedious to be nonexistent.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Punishment also comes from outside the game world to strike in a more personal matter. Innovation often means breaking established rules. Innovation in a game world, where rules are enforced, often draws the attention of the owners of said game world. 'Nerf' is the single most dreaded word in MMOG players vocabulary. 'Banned' seems equivalent to a death penalty.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To put it in perspective, lets revisit my (in)famous jolly rancher lab monkeys. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The inquisitive monkey learns that by pressing the three new levers in his cage in sequential order-- 1, 2, 3,-- he is rewarded with a jolly rancher. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He also learns that by pressing the buttons out of order, he receives a painful shock!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sometimes, however, when pressing the buttons out of order, you avoid the shock. Not always, but just every once in a while, he gets a handful of jolly ranchers. It's a big risk to take, but gives a larger reward than the set order.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Monkey see... monkey do. Most monkeys... even the inquisitive monkey, will usually stick with the  ordered 1, 2, 3 button pushing. It's steady and slow. They don't get many jolly ranchers, but they do get a steady stream of them and aren't shocked.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The 'hard-core' monkey who none of the other monkeys play with any more because he's aggressive, smells bad, and doesn't have any teeth left, does some late-night tinkering with the buttons at the expensive of several painful shocks. He realizes that if he wiggles button 1 just so, and then twists the handle off of button 3, the hopper jams open and instantly dispenses ALL the jolly ranchers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The lab interns, realizing that monkey see, monkey do, beat the hard-core monkey within an inch of his life with rubber tubing in front of all the other monkeys in order to try to keep them from repeating his actions. Then they take him out of the cage and he is never seen again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THEN they fix the broken hopper so that it doesn't dispense jolly ranchers any more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then they surgically remove several of the inquisitive monkey's fingers, just in case. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- EQ is Deep, but not Broad&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's been said before that players leave EQ for the graphics of another game and then come back for the content. I think that is very true. Compared to other games, Everquest has a wealth of content that is difficult, if not downright impossible, to compete against. It's got six years and nine plus expansions worth of zones, monsters, quests, recipes, and whatnot.  There are literally hundreds of raid events in the game now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That said, all of EQ's massive amount of content is tied to the same stake. There are only a very few ways to enjoy EQ. Even if you question players, there less than a handful of ways you can 'properly' play EQ. Accordingly, a great deal of EQ's content goes unused because it lacks open-ness of purpose and mutability of form.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In EQ, you fight enemies and accumulate rewards. There are relatively very few rewards for exploration, crafting, or lore research. The rewards that do exist outside of the former are still tied into the main activity. To do well in any activity in EQ, you first have to excel at that first concept, fighting monsters and taking their stuff.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This encourages some abuses. To be able to be a master craftsman, for example, one must first be willing to travel to the reaches of the game world over real-life weeks and months and engage in deadly combat there. Since people instinctively seek shortcuts, power-levelling and e-baying become seen as viable alternatives to real game-play.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- EQ offers rewards based on content age rather than difficulty or resource usage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The areas in EQ that reward players with the most experience and best items are not necessarily the most difficult. They are, however, almost universally, the newest content... or the content that developers, designers, and marketing staff want players to experience. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The latest zones usually have the latest and greatest in terms of experience rewards and item rewards. This causes the EQ population to gradually shift towards newer content released in expansions while older content is neglected. This means that the bulk of the population in the huge in-game world is focused on very specific areas while the rest of the world seems empty by comparison.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Content neglected is resources that go unused, so not only is this something that affects EQ players, it also effects SOE's bottom line. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- EQ concentrates on 'high end' content at the expense of replay value.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The overwhelming theme in Everquest is that players who spend the most time adventuring in the game world achieve the best rewards. This seems intuitive and simple. Most MMOG players would agree and endorse this notion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Everquest, however, exploration is also considered a reward. Accordingly, one of the rewards for levelling to 46 is the ability to explore higher level zones. There are many rationalizations for this mechanism, including important concepts like preventing grief play and discouraging power-levelling. The over-riding reality is that access to new areas is often doled out just like new abilities or items. It's a reward rather than a game mechanism.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is very little content in the game that works the other way around. There are a total of two raid encounters in the entire game that are level restricted for younger players in any way.  There is only one zone... the tutorial zone... that you cannot enter if you are over a certain level.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A great deal of this is driven by the player base itself rather than the designers or developers. Players adhere to the 'time == rewards' mechanism if anything, more firmly than the game developers. The most vocal players are more likely to adhere to it more than less vocal players. Accordingly, the game developers are made to understand that there is more demand for high level content than low- or mid-level content. They meet the demand with new content and reinforce this concept in a cyclical manner.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Again, this encourages some abuses, such as power-levelling and ebaying since there is very little reason to 'remain young' or replay the game with lower level characters for the sake of experiencing content.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It also actively discourages new players from starting EQ since the investments to see substantial rewards are very well known and broadly advertised.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- EQ is a very old game&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Six years is unheard of in the world of game design. Think of other games that are six years old. Most PC games released in 1999 were not 3d games, let alone multiplayer games. The only other 'massive' online game, Ultima Online, was 2D. The double handful of 3D games that did exist were only starting to rely on 3D graphics rendering technology.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Being so old, EQ has a lot of built-up crud, including old, difficult to maintain software, old, difficult to maintain hardware, and an old, difficult to please user base. Everquest is incredibly 'crufty' as it were. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This has some bonuses and some negatives. The Everquest client is a surprisingly mature and robust piece of software with a modular architecture. It contains a wealth of features and relatively little bloat. Better than 99% of the EQ game client's disk-space requirements are used by data files-- the graphics, sounds, and models that make up the game world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The older client software gets, however, the more difficult it is to maintain in the face of changing technology. EQ's major graphics engine has had to have major overhauls not once, but twice during its history, each overhaul bringing a tribulation of grief and suffering along for the ride.  EQ does not perform nearly as well as it could be expected to, simply because there is so much legacy code still in place.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;New games are often designed to target the cutting edge of PC technology in terms of requirements. EQ has always targeted this edge. This means that a 6 year old game often still runs with some painful caveats... such as amazingly poor performance when a 'busy' area is displayed. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Lag" used to refer to data loss due to poor network transmission. Now, to the majority of EQ players, it means a poor graphical frame-rate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is not just a problem on the client side. EQ's game rules have changed dramatically over the years. Rather than a new set of rules for a new era, EQ players are still subject to modifications of rules that were crafted in 1999. Each sweeping rule change in response to a new technology or market demand has the potential to make EQ unplayable. Many redundant rule-sets and game mechanisms exist, often causing player confusion or strife. There are even multiple sound, model, and graphics formats used to store the game world, all of which must be maintained as if they were brand new.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- EQ has unprecedented inertia&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since EQ is such an old game and its rules are so old, a vocal portion of it's population has strong negative reactions to change that have been reinforced over six years. Any rule change, positive or negative, is met with hysteria and argument.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Game developers are in the unenviable position of having to vet their every action before players who may view it differently or violently oppose it. Players may object to attempts to lessen the learning curve associated with the game or view any changes to the difficulty as one part of the game as an attack against them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let's look at a completely hypothetical situation to understand this argument. Let's say, and this is completely for the sake of discussion and not a statement of suggestion, that SOE decided to make EQ an entirely raid-oriented game. All characters start the game able to raid and most of the game mechanics are altered so that the game's primary mechanic is large, multi-group raids.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most reading can imagine the initial outcry over such a decision.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although many people play EQ for raiding purposes alone, such a move would be violently protested. Even if it were to prove wildly successful, howls of disgust and anguish would rise. Messageboards would be engulfed in flames, brimstone, and sulfur. The sun was as black as satcloth and the moon was as red as blood. Yea verily.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now let's take it the opposite direction. Let's assume that SOE decided t o make EQ an entirely single-group oriented game. All game mechanics are altered so that the game's primary mechanic is play with six or less people. Any attempt to engage a an encounter with more than 6 people is not rewarded.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The same apocalypse, trials, and tribulations, and end times would STILL result. There would still be rioting and war in the streets. Lions would still lie with lambs. Dogs and cats, living together. Total chaos.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This inertia makes changes to the game EXTREMELY difficult, both for game developers, the management of SOE, and for inertial mass of players as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These statements are not meant to try to provoke instantaneous, sweeping change in the game. They're meant to be a perspective that will help others, hopefully the game developers as well, understand problems with the game and think of ways to alleviate them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My own break from EQ will probably not be too long. Maybe when I come back, some of these  problems will have evaporated.</description>

Players may object to attempts to lessen the learning curve associated with the game or view any changes to the difficulty as one part of the game as an attack against them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let's look at a completely hypothetical situation to understand this argument. Let's say, and this is completely for the sake of discussion and not a statement of suggestion, that SOE decided to make EQ an entirely raid-oriented game. All characters start the game able to raid and most of the game mechanics are altered so that the game's primary mechanic is large, multi-group raids.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most reading can imagine the initial outcry over such a decision.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although many people play EQ for raiding purposes alone, such a move would be violently protested. Even if it were to prove wildly successful, howls of disgust and anguish would rise. Messageboards would be engulfed in flames, brimstone, and sulfur. The sun was as black as satcloth and the moon was as red as blood. Yea verily.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now let's take it the opposite direction. Let's assume that SOE decided t o make EQ an entirely single-group oriented game. All game mechanics are altered so that the game's primary mechanic is play with six or less people. Any attempt to engage a an encounter with more than 6 people is not rewarded.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The same apocalypse, trials, and tribulations, and end times would STILL result. There would still be rioting and war in the streets. Lions would still lie with lambs. Dogs and cats, living together. Total chaos.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This inertia makes changes to the game EXTREMELY difficult, both for game developers, the management of SOE, and for inertial mass of players as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These statements are not meant to try to provoke instantaneous, sweeping change in the game. They're meant to be a perspective that will help others, hopefully the game developers as well, understand problems with the game and think of ways to alleviate them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My own break from EQ will probably not be too long. Maybe when I come back, some of these  problems will have evaporated.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;One of the few turn-offs of EQ1 at the moment is the extremely long downtime you are subjected to after recovering from a wipe (group or raid situation).&amp;nbsp; After doing the corpse run, your group/raid ends up having to rebuff and then med up to full.&amp;nbsp; All of this can take anywhere from 30 minutes up to an hour, depending on the encounter.&amp;nbsp; On a particularly nasty encounter, it takes a hardcore devoted player to sit through several wipes and long recovery times each time.&amp;nbsp; This is one of the big sources of burnout associated with EQ1.&amp;nbsp; The problem gets worse the higher into content you get (when casters get &amp;gt;10k mana pools, etc.).&amp;nbsp; It would be nice if there was higher out-of-combat-only regeneration that lowered these recovery times.&amp;nbsp; If such regen&amp;nbsp;suspended in combat situations, it wouldn't trivialize much.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The problem with that would&amp;nbsp;be somehow&amp;nbsp;easily&amp;nbsp;implementing "states" (i.e. like&amp;nbsp;encounter locking in EQ2).&amp;nbsp; That in itself would be a mammoth project programming wise.&amp;nbsp; I don't want EQ1 to be EQ2 or WoW, but there is a certain draw to being able to quickly recover from a failure and get back in the saddle again.&amp;nbsp; I don't think examining such possibilities in EQ1 would "dumb down" the game too much if handled gracefully.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I think for myself, the biggest problem in EQ is the&amp;nbsp;TIME that it takes to do everything. I have recently found out that a lot of people I know cheat, with hacking programs, to get things like skills, trade skills, AA points, and all the things that I spend flipping weeks to get 1 of. They set it up and go to sleep IRL. This bothers me sooooo freaking much. Mostly, because I have spent the last 5 years feeling inferior, getting depressed about it, and feeling generally bad when I play this game. I don't know how many times I have thought to myself, "Jeez, I can't even play this game right."&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Mind you, I want to point out, that these same people are the ones that made me feel inferior in the first place. With their little comments, "Oh, you are STILL level X, jeez. Don't you ever level?" That type of thing. Well, sorry, I don't want to hack my skills up, and I have to spend weeks doing it myself. I don't even know how I feel at this point about EQ. I certainly know that if there are that dang many people using hacking programs, or wanting to ebay, or having to power-level because they can't even find people their level to group with, then something is WRONG with this game. Seriously wrong. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;One person mentioned that they were using this program. I told a bunch of people that I knew someone that was using it, and they all admitted to using it. I didn't find one person that didn't admit to using this garbage. So here I am now, thinking that these people are jacked up. It is one thing to make people feel bad. That is bad enough, but to actually do it while you are cheating is just down right rediculous. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Unfortunately, these are the same exact people that cause the design mess ups in this game. They hack their little ways to the top, play a few months, then cry for&amp;nbsp; more and more and more. Then EQ has to come up with expansions and what not, as well as ways to slow the rest of us down. So, basically, all normal people, with actual lives outside of here get to suffer for it, and feel inferior about it, and enjoy this game, umm 0%. So they make the mobs harder, they make the quests more time consuming, they add in AA points that take forever to get, and of course they give us like 900+ of those to get.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;No one can have my stuff, as I will be selling it all on EQ-Ebay when it comes to EQ 1. I might as well get Paid for being made to feel inferior to CHEATERS for 5 years. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>Maybe, but I understand her frustration. Totally. That feeling of inferiority also eats at me, and when I hear most people cheat to level so fast... well it makes me wonder why I continue playing too. Lashing out at her and making threats to her will just make her want to quit even more.</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I have seen you assume lots of things, Mchaos. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I meant if the exchange comes to EQ1. And no, my charactors would not be for sale, they would rot. My gear or whatever would be for sale. If EQ were to bring the exchange to EQ1, then I would sell the junk I have. That is what I was saying. And no, it would not violate anything. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;And again, yes it stands NOW as a violation, but I did say IF IT COMES TO EQ1, In other words, I would not do it unless it was NOT a violation. You and your assumptions, bleh. I am getting tired of them very quickly.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Jesebelle on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;05-03-2005&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;06:43 PM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I agree with the OP entirely.&amp;nbsp; Very well written :smileywink:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I feel that death penalty is a little too much also.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;One way I think this could be helped a bit, without changing things drastically, would be to allow all PRIEST classes (yes druids/shamans) a resurrection spell (Not AA), that will be available from newbie on up.&amp;nbsp; Now, I feel the cleric res should always be the best and the only one to give back experience, but having a druid and/or shaman there to&amp;nbsp;provide a res (I'm talking lower levels)&amp;nbsp;would be a great improvement IMO.&amp;nbsp; Possibly the AA could be changed to allow druids/shamans to also give slight experience rezzes and with more AA points, a higher percentage exp res rewarded.&amp;nbsp; Clerics will still be best at this and still be the best at healing, but it won't make having a cleric or paladin quite so essential (most groups I've been in will not do instances, etc., without at least one of the two).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;EQs death penalty is fine.&amp;nbsp; You lose time mostly and the bottom line is death should have some cost.&amp;nbsp; At present with corse summons in the guild lobby where you can bind the days of 2 hour long CRs keeping you up well past your bed time are long gone.&amp;nbsp; With instant ports available in PoK no zone is further then a 5 minute run from bind.&amp;nbsp; If you dont want to risk death running to your corpse then summon and ask one of the clerics running around the guild lobby to click you&amp;nbsp;then run back fully geared.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;The death penalty is why clerics are in high demand as well, but to me a lower penalty wouldn't do much harm. Perhaps cost a few of the lower clerics a group over the higher level druids and shamans. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;As for Complete Heal, this is probably why I've been advocating for a strong change to this spell or some sort of new spell line to pop up and replace it. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Good post.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;The problem with Ch is that it is too intergrated into todays game play. Changing it in anyway would make such an uproar. Anything more powerful would be insane really and anything lesser is almost unacceptable by most of the healing classes. You see some raids designed around it, by limiting the use of it on aggro purposes...but not many are set like this.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;For me the major penalty in dying is not the Xp loss, it's losing my KEI when my group needs me.&amp;nbsp; If I can reasonably get back on foot I will forgo a rez in order to come back with KEI, even if I suspect there will not be a rez available later.&amp;nbsp; Of course, you can tell how much XP means to me by the fact that dinging 60 was so much fun that I have dinged 60 five times this week.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Not in a hurry to get to 61 til I get at least a few of my 58-60 spells... I want an Inspect Pockets spell so I can kill the RIGHT guardian wurms.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Here is my suggestion for death penalty.&amp;nbsp; Reduce exp penalty by 75%.&amp;nbsp; Change the 96% Cleric rez to a Cleric 84% rez.&amp;nbsp; This will have the exact same effect as a 96% rez with current death penalty.&amp;nbsp; All other rez spells should be adjusted to provide some bonus over the default 75%, but less than the best cleric rez.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The result of this system is that for groups that have a cleric, there is no change.&amp;nbsp; For groups with a weaker or no-rezzer, they will see significant less exp loss from the new system.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;One other thing to consider.&amp;nbsp; Death penalty sub 40 really isn't that severe even if you don't get a rez.&amp;nbsp; It is post 40 where the amount of time that you lose in a death really starts to scale.&amp;nbsp; The ideal rez system is one that would penalize early levels more and higher levels less since it takes the higher level more time to pay off the lost experience.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;KEI and Virtue are two "must have" buffs for higher level content.&amp;nbsp; I think the current pok supply isn't too bad (although it is harder to find KEI casters these days), however it would be an option to reduce mana bonus effects, and increase innate mana regen, so that the absence of a particular buff would not be that punishing to a player.&amp;nbsp; Same thing could be done with virtue, but that would have other balance issues to consider since silk classes get a significant portion of their hp from the buff, more so than a tank class.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;KEI and Virtue are two "must have" buffs for higher level content.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;No they're not.&amp;nbsp; They may be required for the high&lt;EM&gt;est&lt;/EM&gt; level content (just as a certain caliber of tank or cleric might be required for that content), but there are plenty of level-appropriate places for the 60+ crowd to hunt that don't require anything more than careful mana management and the hp buffs available in group.&amp;nbsp; Paladins, shamans, druids, all have hp buffs that are perfectly acceptable in many situations.&amp;nbsp; Yes, I am an enchanter, but I know the kei-less-ness is doable because I play with my buff window closed and often re-open it later on in my hunt to find that my mana regen has been dispelled/worn off etc. and I've been playing blissfully with no more than a casual thought of "hrm, I need to sit down a little more rather than nuke."&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I have inspected Jetta (if you ever get a chance, you will have to remember to look DOWN), and can attest to what she said.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;But it is also true that "higher level content" (not "highest") does not &lt;U&gt;require&lt;/U&gt;&lt;EM&gt; &lt;/EM&gt;Virtue and/or KEI.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;In fact, I'd make the statement that, in *any* content, pure melees have no use for KEi (DUH) and in *most* content, casters don't require Virtue.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
