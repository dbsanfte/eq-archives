    <title>POP Alternative Access Quests</title>

    <description>I'm curious if any thought has been given to the Alternative Access quests for zones like SolRo.  Since these quests serve to give people access to the zones since POP progression doesn't happen as often these days, will the be removed until a later time?  I know I'm thinking a bit far out, but it is something to concider.  Also, is it expected that the alternative level requirement to enter such places as PoV, BoT, HOH, etc., will be removed to force people to do progression?  How about Elemental / Time flagging?  Will keys drop?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I do expect that there will be a lot of work going toward progression when we finally get to that point, even if alternative access methods to some zones are avaiilable.  However, I think it would be best to force people to go through the real progression.  Since I left the game for years and recently came back, I've found it difficult to &amp;quot;enjoy&amp;quot; the progression since no one does that content much.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
