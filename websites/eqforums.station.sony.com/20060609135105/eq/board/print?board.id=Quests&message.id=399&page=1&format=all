				I have been finding that the two miners are often rejecting the handins.  I have found that on several characters with the pack of picks hand in, with the fiery ores hand in, and with the Status Receipt hand in.  All of them, so far, have eventually accepted the hand in and given out the reward.  No problems, so far, with the depth gauge.

				I have seen the theory proposed that it is a timer for the task (in a thread in TNZ).  I have also seen it proposed that they hand out one set of rewards max per yellow text - when they were in the wrong spots, the two miners and the picks respawned everything the text was sent out.  As you don't see the yellow messages after completing the first reward for each miner, this is impossible to keep track of (if true).

				I'd like to see these quests fully solved.<br><br>So far, all steps apart from the final hand in for both miners seem to work consistently - although I have once seen the pack of picks refused, so this may not be entirely consistent.  The two final handins have almost always failed first time.  I have seen posts saying that a petition returns a confirmation that the quests are "definitely working as intended"; so presumably there is some final trick that we are missing.<br><br>Timers don't seem to be the answer - I have had the ring handed out on first hand in, and not for a long, long time.  This is almost always with an empty zone apart from me, btw.<br><br>The dialog from the miner might be some sort of clue - he always hands back a ring, and three fiery ores, with some comment about one for you, three for me.  On a failed hand in, he some times returns three ores, and sometimes four.  I have tried repeating hand ins multiple times, with no luck.

				<DIV>I got the ring last night.&nbsp; After turning in the picks for the belt, I headed to Sol Ro and killed goblins until I got 4 fiery ores (maybe 15-20 minutes).&nbsp; Welnik would not accept my ores.&nbsp; So I&nbsp;camped right there, and came back about an hour later.&nbsp; I handed him the ores and he gave 3 of them back.&nbsp; SO, I killed fire drakes until I got another ore.&nbsp; Welnik&nbsp;still wouldn't take my ores but at least he gave them all back.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>At that point I gave up and went to Abysmal to work on baking.&nbsp; When I ran out of eggs, I figured I'd kill 2 birds with 1 stone; farm basilisk eggs and try to get the ring again.&nbsp; So I returned to Lavastorm (about 2 hours had passed since my last turn in attempt).&nbsp; This time, before handing him the ores, I said, "something extra" and he gave me the quest dialog again.&nbsp; I turned in the ores, and he gave me the ring and 3 of the ores back.&nbsp; No idea what time it was in the game.. I do know it was way past my bedtime IRL though.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Good luck to those attempting the quest.&nbsp; The ring is worth it.&nbsp; If Welnik won't accept the ores at first,&nbsp;do something else for a few hours then go back and try again.</DIV>

				<DIV>I have tried various things.&nbsp; I believe there is a timer and there is a bug.&nbsp; The timer is about an hour, the timer is for both sets of quests.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I have tried zoning.&nbsp; I've tried getting the text.&nbsp; I've tried being logged in waiting more than an hour game time, I've tried being logged out and waiting consecutive days.&nbsp;&nbsp;I've tried alternating the quests.&nbsp; I've tried doing tasks in between them.&nbsp; I've had the same problems on multiple characters AND on separate accounts (in case it was account related).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I haven't had any problems with the first tasks, IF it has been an hour between whatever turn in was before it.&nbsp; I have tried for hours and hours and hours and days to get the Ring especially.&nbsp; Don't seem to have as many problems with cloak.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I have no idea whether it helped or not, but this go through with the ring, I had tried numerous things.&nbsp; Finally, I got rid of the ore that had been given back to me (sold to vendor) and got four new pieces of ore.&nbsp; Bingo.&nbsp; The ring was in my packs.&nbsp; Now, I have no idea if it was because the bug/timer had cleared, if it was&nbsp;the new ore, or if it was because I was killing fire drakes in the zone.&nbsp; (The drakes have a pretty good rate of ore drop, especially if you are a higher level character you can get 4 rather quickly, takes longer if you are lower level.)</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Just another thing to try.. fresh ore and drake killing.</DIV>
