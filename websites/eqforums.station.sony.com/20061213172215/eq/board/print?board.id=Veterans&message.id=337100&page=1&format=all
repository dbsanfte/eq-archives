<P>"How can one "make sure" that every pet class on one's raid has pet hold?&nbsp; The only way I can think other than believing what the person tells you is to either require all pet classes to have premium magelos or else pay for premium EQ Players oneself.&nbsp;"</P>
<P>You're a raidleader and you don't check up on the AAs and gear of problem players (having trouble doing their part well on a raid)?&nbsp; </P>
<P>You&nbsp; choose to lead raids without using premium eqplayers info?&nbsp; I love this tool to help figure out what is going wrong when something is going wrong.&nbsp; To evaluate apps who are new or may need some training, etc.</P>
<P>I got a heads up that one necro didn't know what he was doing when I checked on him on eqplayers, as he wasn't doing too well on raids, and was unable to solo (a necro...), and I found he'd spent many of his less-than-100 AAs on random stats, including strength, and wisdom (wisdom???), while not working his critting AAs, etc.&nbsp; He didn't know what he was doing as a necro at all.&nbsp; Obviously.</P>
<P>We tried to teach him and give some input since he didn't know what he was doing (we work with people if possible), and although in some cases training helps people and they take off and become good, in his case, he was unwilling to learn--too proud--so he's gone, our content is too hard for a necro who spends his AAs on wisdom first and won't take input, lol.</P>
<P>You have to figure out the exact reason for problems to solve them, that's reality.&nbsp; Especially raiding.&nbsp; Not using any info you have to do that seems odd.</P>
<P>Premium is cheap.</P>

<P>"The true issue on this thread, is that you dont want to garner any aggro at all so that your pet can tank multiple mobs while you or someone else heals it."</P>
<P>You're right,&nbsp;pets having different rules than players is so unfair.&nbsp; Just as healing pets should get aggro for the healer on the&nbsp;socially-aggroed adds,&nbsp;pets should get all the player tools to deal&nbsp;with thereafter holding the heal aggro (higher than social aggro) on said adds,&nbsp; or regaining it once aggro is lost.&nbsp; AE taunt, weapon affinity AAs for&nbsp;aggro proccing, etc.,&nbsp;so the adds don't go kill the mage and healer if you respond to the heal aggro appropriately with the pet!&nbsp; Excellent plan.&nbsp; &nbsp; And&nbsp;also, from now on, pets&nbsp;can have a setting to take aggro over players with less aggro in melee range, I think that is so far, good call.</P>
<P>Why didn't we think of this before?</P>

<P>"As for pet push.. I can sit on one side and&nbsp; bear on other and it will not move at all.&nbsp;"</P>
<P>Do you have all the pet flurrying AAs?&nbsp; Near as I can tell those are the ones generating the push.&nbsp; How about those swarm pets, such cute PUSHY little buggers, lol--I USE them to push some places because they're so good at it.&nbsp; But of course I have also finished all pet AAs,&nbsp;I didn't used to notice it as much, must be something in there then that makes push go over the top.&nbsp;</P>
<P>I know mage and bst pets push like crazy, anyone who doesn't have their pet AAs all finished probably can't speak to this as well as those who have finished them can--pet push is extreme.&nbsp; Bst can control theirs because they're right there on the mob--mages need to stand still far away, not doable for them-pet off is what you have to control push basically.&nbsp; Not talking about cornering or walling, I'm talking about when you have a mob you're killing for a while in the open that needs to stay where he is.&nbsp; Pets are bad in such cases, period.</P>

<P>Bolded parts are my changes to your quote. The ONLY thing in your quote that is relevant is the last part about the cleric who is outside of the group not getting aggro.

<P>You can't have it both ways.

<p>Do you have all the pet flurrying AAs?&nbsp; Near as I can tell those are the ones generating the push.&nbsp; How about those swarm pets, such cute PUSHY little buggers, lol--I USE them to push some places because they're so good at it.&nbsp; But of course I have also finished all pet AAs,&nbsp;I didn't used to notice it as much, must be something in there then that makes push go over the top.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>I know mage and bst pets push like crazy</b>, anyone who doesn't have their pet AAs all finished probably can't speak to this as well as those who have finished them can--pet push is extreme.&nbsp; Bst can control theirs because they're right there on the mob--mages need to stand still far away, not doable for them-pet off is what you have to control push basically.&nbsp; Not talking about cornering or walling, I'm talking about when you have a mob you're killing for a while in the open that needs to stay where he is.&nbsp; Pets are bad in such cases, period.</p><br><hr></blockquote>Thats mostly the stuns/kicks/bashes. So, yes, as far as push goes magician warrior pets (air/earth) and beastlord warders have the most, even though it still isn't as much as your average melee, or even your average meleeing druid. And the magician water pet probably pushes less than the magician's nukes, since it doesn't kick/stun/bash.<br></div>

<P>Also, losing a pet isn't the same thing as having your tank wipe.&nbsp; So yes I am saying losing a pet is no big loss.&nbsp; If it was a huge loss to the mage or bsty or necro then people wouldn't run and leave them to their valliant deaths.<BR></P>
<P>EDIT:&nbsp; How much HP does it take before the casual cleric goes...it's just plain easier to heal X with no risk to myself than try and heal a tank with less than (let's say 16K hp).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus leaving the non uber tank in the cold?&nbsp; 30K?&nbsp; 40?&nbsp; I have a feeling we will soon see the answer.&nbsp; Probably an expansion or so away, of course those high enders will never see it, they're looking at their raid groups going..wingz is crazy.&nbsp; I don't see this happening in my raid geared&nbsp;guild&nbsp;groups in (whatever the next expansion end zone will be)!</P>
<P>Pulling an Eze here:&nbsp; If by "inferior" you mean "more hp than almost any player in the game."&nbsp; Then yes.</P>

<p>Also, losing a pet isn't the same thing as having your tank wipe.&nbsp; So yes I am saying losing a pet is no big loss.&nbsp; If it was a huge loss to the mage or bsty or necro then people wouldn't run and leave them to their valliant deaths.<br></p>
<p>EDIT:&nbsp; How much HP does it take before the casual cleric goes...it's just plain easier to heal X with no risk to myself than try and heal a tank with less than (let's say 16K hp).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus leaving the non uber tank in the cold?&nbsp; 30K?&nbsp; 40?&nbsp; I have a feeling we will soon see the answer.&nbsp; Probably an expansion or so away, of course those high enders will never see it, they're looking at their raid groups going..wingz is crazy.&nbsp; I don't see this happening in my raid geared&nbsp;guild&nbsp;groups in (whatever the next expansion end zone will be)!</p>
<p>Pulling an Eze here:&nbsp; If by "inferior" you mean "more hp than almost any player in the game."&nbsp; Then yes.</p>

				<DIV>Just a note on pet as a tank.&nbsp; Soloing it works well, or duo with a healer.&nbsp; And full pet groups can do some incredible damage.&nbsp; That said, a pet cannot compete with a real tank at most levels.&nbsp; I am a mid end raider (Anguish/DP guild) and have an Anguish level pet focus.&nbsp; As such my Air pet well buffed/equipped probably is around 16-17k hp (and earth if I used it could probably get above 20k).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>When I group however, its usually with non raiders.&nbsp; And who do we use as a tank?&nbsp; My ranger friend with about 9.3k hp unbuffed (around 12.7k raid buffed I think).&nbsp; Even as just a chain class, he mitigates so much better than my pet its rediculous.&nbsp; And generates far more aggro.&nbsp; And is able to back off from the mob if a heal is running late to give it time (smarter tank).&nbsp; Should he go down my pet can usually hold its own ok for a bit, but the amount of heals required to keep it up compared to the ranger makes this a very mana consuming process.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>So I don't picture Pets taking the place of real tanks anytime soon.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>And ty Rashere for working on this for us, glad it is to be fixed soon <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0></DIV>

<P>As a recruiter, or until very recently, magelos (including AA) was required for application. AA and the like can be hidden on EQPlayers as well, and frequently are, when they are updated.</P>
<P>Yes the applicants could lie, however if pets start flying everywhere on AE's and the like it would very soon become apparent that the applicant did not use/have the AA, and so would be penalised for not having&nbsp;it. Naturally if found to be lying their application would have been in jeopardy, but that has never happened to me.</P>
<P>But a classic sign of non-compliance with pet control is pet flying off at an AE. Have this occur and you can tell your slacker to not summon his pet, with the half life of a pet these days going down faster than a High Elf not partaking of good loving for 2 centuries control isn't a big issue as the pets would likely be dead and the pet classes not bothering to summon another after the first few.</P>
<P>But lest we remind that this is a game after all not the Geheime Staatspolizei, if any pet class doesn't know how to control their pet you simply tell them not to summon. If they ignore that directive you kick them from the raid and instance. End of Story.</P>

<P><STRONG>Healer out of the group is on the hate table.&nbsp; Yup.&nbsp; Risk...some risk..even small is still risk.</STRONG></P>
<P>99% of us don't play with out of group healers.&nbsp; Your EQ experience seems vastly different from everyone else's here.</P>
<P><STRONG>VS.&nbsp; Healing a pet there is none, zero, zip, nada, walk away go home and play even if it dies.&nbsp; This is my problem with it.&nbsp; There is 0 risk besides losing a pet.&nbsp; None!</STRONG></P>
<P>This is patently false; the mage and any other dps/debuffer will have aggro as will the healer under most circumstances.&nbsp; I'm giving you the benefit of the doubt in assuming the hate list bug can still come into play for healers if they are actively trying to exploit it.</P>
<P><STRONG>As for the scenario being "retarted"&nbsp; it's a good way to PL clerics."</STRONG></P>
<P>No, it isn't.&nbsp; I guarantee any kite class grouped w/ the cleric can own that PL.&nbsp; Its really crappy xp that requires 3 toons to accomplish.</P>
<P><STRONG>Also, I would like to thank 2 posters.&nbsp; One saying that they pet tank was an "aggro machine."&nbsp; The other one for responding like this:</STRONG></P>
<P>Out of 9 pages of posts explaining why all your assumptions are invalid you have managed to find a couple quotes to take out of context to support your case.&nbsp;&nbsp;Your cookie is in the mail.</P>
<P>And those statements don't really address a pet's ability to tank in a meaningful way.&nbsp; "Aggro machine" relative to what?&nbsp; A Knight, SK, or Warr will totally destroy any pet's aggro.&nbsp; A pet has nothing comparable to the tools those classes use.&nbsp; Not to mention the fact that they can hold zero aggro against melee dps.</P>
<P>And who cares if CoA-focused pets can hit 20k hp?&nbsp; If&nbsp;they are getting quadded for max most rounds and only getting fully healed on crits&nbsp;they are going to die in the decent xp zones and bleed healer mana even in the lesser ones.</P>
<P><STRONG>So far two of my "idiotic and dumb" accusations have been acknowledged and backed up after being beaten down by lots of the mages here.&nbsp; I thank you.</STRONG></P>
<P>Where did anyone claim that mage pets didn't have nice hp?&nbsp; HP is only one part of the tanking equation.&nbsp; The other parts are snap aggro, absolute aggro, avoidance, and mitigation.&nbsp; Would you trade all your aggro discs/spells, 1k AC ( random estimate obviously), and the ability to hold aggro in the melee range of any other PC for a few k HP?&nbsp; Could you imagine yourself being an effective tank under those conditions?&nbsp;</P>

<DIV>Kinda silly, no way is a mage pet ever going to outtank even a casual tank. Mage pets don't have 23k hp it's closer to 11-12k unbuffed. They don't have mitigation/avoidace aa or shielding on gear (both obtainable without much effort even as a casual 75). A 75 knight even in weak gear, at 2200-2500ac buffed with shield block/defensives is gonna be getting ~40% accuracy and 6ADI on the high end, and have mitigation aa/shielding to lower DB. Willing to bet the pet is going to tank significantly worse then that and not have enough HP above a casual tank who buffed to 12-13k at 75 to make any realistic difference. It would essentially be a really mana sponge tank that could only tank in a pure caster group.</DIV>
