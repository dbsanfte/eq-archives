&lt;DIV&gt;Two comments:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;1) Perhaps an explanation of what kind of log files you want, and how you plan to use them... I assume this will be your primary source for price updates.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;2) I know you need to pay for your time, talent&amp;nbsp;and bandwidth somehow, but aren't there any sponsors you could find who are not plat sellers?&amp;nbsp; Advertising these parasites, especially to a targeted market who is "looking for more plat" by definition, only encourages cheating.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;1. Not sure whether you mean you want the log file explanation in this thread or on the site ... there is some explanation on this on the Upload page (http://www.eqprofits.com/upload.aspx) but I guess it's not prominent enough and maybe doesn't explain enough .... I'll look at this asap. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Just to clarify here,&amp;nbsp;both types of log file (standard eqlog_ files and Bazaar/bzrlog_ files) can be uploaded and are used by the site in different ways. Bazaar prices can come from either, although they are treated differently so that actual sales are given a higher rating than just prices seen while browsing the Bazaar. The standard log files also feed in any new loot items, forageables, fish as well as NPC and zone info.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The site is&amp;nbsp;dynamic so prices and items etc will change in the lists depending on the latest info. The more log files you send in, the more information you'll get back.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;2. I hear what people are saying here about the plat sellers.&amp;nbsp; I'd like to make it clear that they are NOT our sponsors. The ad you see is a Google ad which automatically crawls the site and picks the most 'appropriate' advertisers based on words it finds in my site. Unfortunately in EQProfits it picks up things like 'Everquest', 'plat', 'prices'&amp;nbsp;and 'profit' and hence comes up with those ads. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Given the feedback here I will look at changing this ad to something less controversial!&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Thanks again for the feedback guys! It's really helpful! &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Keep it coming ... and keep those log files coming in too :smileyhappy:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I've had a few queries about why and how to upload &lt;STRONG&gt;log files&lt;/STRONG&gt;, so just to clarify ....&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;EQProfits uses log files to update the prices and also other information about items, such as where they can be looted, foraged etc.&amp;nbsp; Both types of log file (standard/eqlog_ and Bazaar/bzr_log files) are used and can be uploaded from the site. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;When you upload a log file, it is queued for processing and when this is complete you will be able to see the latest prices etc in all the tables. Processing usually occurs within a few hours and you will be notified by email when it is complete so that you can check out the latest prices on&amp;nbsp; the site.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;If you are a registered user, you will also see details of all your sales and purchases, and how much profit (or not!) you've made from the different types of transaction.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;There's more information at http://www.eqprofits.com/upload.aspx&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;I'm a suspicious old **SMURF**, no doubt that will get SMURFED but in Asutralia bast ard is usually a term of endearment.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I looked at this last night and had a look in the bazaar. It's obvious that the IGE mules, yantis etc etc , had caught up with this because amazingly all the items were for sale at a price &amp;gt; NPC buy / sell&amp;nbsp;cost . It is apparent from my attempts to arbitrage server moves that the vendors had pretty much homogenised the market for high price / volume items. This just helps them homogenise it further.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I think you idea is great but could you give us an URL of who Brighter working are.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;LOL! Yeah the smurf got smurfed!&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;On your concerns ... I'm not sure&amp;nbsp;how I&amp;nbsp;can ever convince a hardened cynic, but I'll give it a go:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I hereby swear (on anything you care to name) that I, EQProfits, and/or Brighter Working:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;are not in any way connected, affiliated or related in any way to SoE, IGE, mySuperSales or anyother Everquest related enterprise&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;have never bought, sold or exchanged any Everquest plat or items or information with any of the above (or anyone except the official SoE games and subscriptions)&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;have never engaged in any botting, farming or any other automated or macro-ing software or any other form of cheating&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I think you'll find that IGE/mySuperSales etc have just about EVERY Everquest item listed in their database ... you search for virtually any Everquest item on the net and their names will come up .... whether or not they actually have any of these items for sale! I certainly haven't provided them with any information, and I think it highly unlikely that they would be bothered to pinch stuff from EQProfits. Nonetheless, I'll keep a lookout for them 'cos I'd love to prosecute 'em for stealing my info!&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Brighter Working is a UK company comprised of myself and one other (who happens to be my RL partner!). You can look us up in Companies House at this link&amp;nbsp;(&amp;nbsp;http://wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk/90f4a028969c24d612983b4b2bea204a//compdetails&amp;nbsp;). We have both been playing EQ for about 5 years and I have been developing EQProfits for the past year (whilst also using it as a vehicle to learn ASP.NET). EQProfits has so far cost us (personally as well as Brighter Working commercially)&amp;nbsp;a fair bit of cash in software tools, web/database hosting etc. We've not had a bean, dime, or penny from anyone else and we've not been paid for development. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Money out: £100s&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Money in: zilch&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;EQProfits has been a labour of love ... its something I wanted to do to help me trade more effectively ... I found there are just soooo many items in the game that it was hard to tell what was good and what was rubbish; what sold quickly and what took ages. I wanted to know things like .... &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Will I make more money selling 100s of velium pieces or should I go for that one uber item ?&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Is this item worth the bag space to sell in the Bazaar or should I just dump it on the nearest NPC ?&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;What's the cheapest way to skill-up in a tradeskill ?&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;What the most profitable item I can craft ?&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;How much plat per hour am I making in the Bazaar ?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;None of the existing sites gave me that sort of information, so I started collecting my own and it grew from there.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Have I convinced you yet ? Or shall I bore you&amp;nbsp;some more :smileytongue:&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;Interesting site, Mchaos .... it gives good info on specific items, but the trouble is that you have to know what item you are looking for before you search for it. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;What I wanted was something which identified which items were worth looking up in the first place. EQProfits advises you which items are good for which types of trade so its does the hard work for you.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Grats, dude...&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Now to my response: I have been using EQProfits as one of my primary research sources for weeks already.&amp;nbsp; I must have latched on to it early and I like it a lot.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Great resource, and in fact it is the only site I have found where I can do a reverse lookup to see what recipe a given item is good for under the heading of "Tradeskill recipes which use this item".&amp;nbsp; Not to slam Allah, which is a great site, but this is a premium service on Allah that I can't get to.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Feature Desired: I have been manually selecting search results for your "Top #" lists, pasting them into Word to do some replace operations, then pasting into Notepad to remove table formatting and graphic content, then performing a manual import into Excel, then massaging the data to get it to appear one item per line, etc.&amp;nbsp; Of course&amp;nbsp;I have to copy one page at a time this way.&amp;nbsp; It would be very helpful if you could make the data available either in a simple printer-friendly text format that puts the whole thing on one page for an easy one-item-per-line copy-paste, or even better have a "download in CSV format" button.&amp;nbsp; (Zone info should just tack on to the end of the line, one per comma.)&amp;nbsp; Of course, the main purpose for this is so I can sort by each field within Excel.&amp;nbsp; An on-line sort function would help, but I like to add my own formulas to work with the data.&amp;nbsp; This would also be a partial and easy to implement solution to those want to sort columns on-line, which you said was more difficult.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Bug:&amp;nbsp; On the search window, if I edit my search term and press enter, it repeats my old search.&amp;nbsp; The only way to do a new search is to use the mouse to click on the &amp;lt;Search&amp;gt; button.&amp;nbsp; Very minor irritant, but I thought many items were simply missing from your database until I realized my search terms were simply not being updated.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Personal Preference: Would like for item links to open in a new window instead of in the current window.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Constructive Criticism: I am not a statistician, but what I recall of the topic from school "Computer-Aided Statistics class" is that there are many statistical functions available in most CS development environments that would help you to root out anomalistic data.&amp;nbsp; As a minimum I would go ahead and keep all the data, but truncate the top 10% and the bottom 10% (minimum one data element each unless that would leave you with less than 4 or 5 to process) while performing your analysis functions.&amp;nbsp; In most cases, the out-of-whack transactions will fall in that 20% of the data and will skew the averages if used.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Overall Impression:&amp;nbsp; Frankly, your service is the very thing Allah lacks (other than low user participation in their forums, which is why I come here to the official site).&amp;nbsp; I would probably take the plunge and pay for Allah if your data were integrated into theirs.&amp;nbsp; Obviously, the greater the participation, the greater the accuracy.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;Glad you like it Pebble, thanks for such positive feedback :smileyhappy: Re your specific comments:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;printer-friendly lists&lt;/STRONG&gt; - this one is on my list of enhancements&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;search bug&lt;/STRONG&gt; - many thanks for finding this one! Will fix it asap&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;item links in new window&lt;/STRONG&gt; - the easy way round this is to do right click on the link and select 'Open in new window' from the pop-up menu&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;stats&lt;/STRONG&gt; - you're quite right in that there are a whole load of stats you can use to analyse the data. I did quite a bit of research on this while developing the site and looked at all sorts, from standard deviation to supply/demand curves! In the end I came back to keeping it simple for 2 reasons:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;firstly it is more easily digested by users of the site (standard deviation may give a more 'accurate' score but it doesn't mean much to the average visitor - myself included!&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;secondly, the greater the analysis, the greater the demands of database size and performance. I simply can't afford to spend more on these at the moment. However, I do keep all the details from all the log files, so that if I ever get sufficient demand to do more statistical analysis&amp;nbsp;I have the raw data to do it with.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Thanks again for your input :smileyhappy:&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I know that some of you were keen to have a discussion board included in EQProfits.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I've looked at a number of the options for doing this, but I'm sorry to say, that I don't think it's going to be possible at the moment :smileysad: Although there are several free options out there, they all require quite a bit of work to integrate with the existing site. More to the point, they will take a fair bit of database space, which of course costs money ... which I don't have much of! I'm not saying it will never be, but for now I'm afraid its scratched from the list of enhancements.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Meanwhile, you can always&amp;nbsp;use&amp;nbsp;http://www.eqprofits.com/contact.aspx&amp;nbsp;or this forum to feedback any comments, suggestions, queries or even bugs (:smileysurprised:) &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;I have noticed the increase in Roots (currently 2pp) and Vegetables (5g) again on Prexus...Two nights in a row all my Veggies and Roots have gone. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;You're still managing to get 5pp for veggies when they are a 78 copper combine? Well done :)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;A lovely website like a stock market of costs on the servers bazaars would be a nice idea.&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Like &lt;A href="http://www.eqecon.com/" target=_blank&gt;EQEcon&lt;/A&gt;, say?&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;A href="http://www.eqprofits.com/" target=_blank&gt;EQProfits&lt;/A&gt; is another good web site for checking out server prices.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
