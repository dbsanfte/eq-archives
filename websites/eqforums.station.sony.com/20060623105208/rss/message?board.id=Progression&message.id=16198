    <title>A couple "combine" questions</title>
    <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Progression&amp;message.id=16198</link>
    <description>&lt;DIV&gt;1. Can anyone tell me where an evil character can buy "&lt;EM&gt;combine&lt;/EM&gt;" weapons? I've tried Gypsie's in both Ro and Karana and they won't sell to me. (an ogre warrior). So if anyone knows where an evil race can purchase combine weps please let us know.&amp;nbsp; (I felt this was server specific and appropriate to be on this forum, because, no one else on other servers cares about buying combine weps).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;2. I was wondering when the official "&lt;EM&gt;Combined&lt;/EM&gt;" server forum will go live? I was kinda hoping that it would have been set up by now. I know that this forum serves well for the new server, but I think that now we know for sure that the server is going live and when, it's about time to set it up in the "server" forum listing don't you think?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;div&gt;Ogre Warrior on the Combined&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;Are you KOS to them or just dubious?&amp;nbsp; If only dubious then you could try turning in greater lightstones to improve faction (at least I think there is a faction bonus when you do that).&amp;nbsp; I don't remember how it used to be, mostly because I really didn't get into playing evils until Iksar and Kunark came out. :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
