Now the problem is you can't cast 1 dot over and over again. So what you have to do is stack lots of dots on in order to cause any kind of dps. So when we lose half our dots on a mob thats a huge effect for us. Just because we can stil llay on 4 more dots really doesn't matter it's not like having 4 different dd spells to use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finnally disease dots are useless for dps I can't even remember the last time I memed the spell.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Last time i checked, necro's could just about pull anything they wanted using the green pet agro trick in combination with FD&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Clearly this is overpowering and game unbalancing, considering that on most raidtargets they out dps all classes and they are by far the best solo class around.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;Originally I let this thread go on because people were have constructive discussions.&amp;nbsp; However it is slolwy turning into attacks and now "nerf XYZ class" threads are coming up.&amp;nbsp; We will not be using these forums to call for nerfs to the classes.&amp;nbsp; If you have a valid complaint about something a specific class does, please PM one of the Devs with your feedback.&amp;nbsp;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last I checked any pet classes could pet pull. I do it using :- shaman, necro, beast, mage, ench&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lets just nerf them all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh wait! I forgot Druids, if anyone gets nerfed please make sure the Druids take a sharp blade in the back as well, and while we're at it lets also nerf every other class.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I agree. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;In fact think nerfs should be on a monthly rotation for all classes. Each month some random class gets nerfed.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Everyone is too uber now, so all classes should be elegible for nerfing.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Prathun, or whoever reads this. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Since members of other communities are pretty united in their ill-placed contempt and incorrect perceptions of necromancers, specificly reguarding all the *wonderfull* raid utility we apparently have.  I was wondering, could we actually have some?  I mean a nice resist mod on some atk slows, a good non-dmg darkness that lasts 15mins and lands a lot..a reliable and usefull debuff that won't be over-written by shaman, maybe pets that can survive an encounter..AoTD that does more dmg. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;They're upset at us, over itemization as well, so I'd like detrimental spell haste via DoDH/DoB+ to be more common, along with all all the preservations and focii that all us necs love to be on literally every piece of gear (since this is the situation that was described in the other 480 post thread).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Ohh and I like 2-3 more dots in excess of 700+ dmg per tick with under 1k mana cost, having significant resist checks..which would make us the undisputed kings of dps, in almost every setting.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Then the next time a thread like this pops up..we can say, &amp;quot;ya..you're all correct, and like..you have a right to be mad, but we're still not accepting a nerf, or anything less then linear growth in the next expansions&amp;quot;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;5 whole paragraphs and I didn't say **smurf** once!&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Pet pulling is *very* situational.  First you have to suspend the pet you have.  Then you have to load and cast the low level pet, rune it, feed it comands, then get to pulling.  On anything worth mentioning its common he dies on the first try.  So load that low level pet again, buff it, and feed it commands.  By the time you get whatever you want in camp, so much time has elapsed that the inefficiency of the pull outweighs any potential gain.  In 99.9% of pulls, I just use typical pull mechanics, because even if I don't get the creature on the first try, its still faster and a lot funner...  Best case pet pulling is reliable, worst case its costly by the amount of bone chips and time invested.  This just isn't a move that is made in group or raid situations, and rarely if ever soloing.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Further I wouldn't ask to nerf this ability, ever.  Necromancers are fortunate enough to have FD and other tricks to get something to camp.  Other pet classes aren't so lucky.  I don't want to see a niche taken away from these classes that have been neglected in their pulling abilities.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;There are lots of raid fights out there where necromancers are terrible dps.  This is the way SOE balances fights now- just bump up resists so casters can't land anything.  There are a some fights where necromancers can compete with the top dps'ers out there, but generally we are limited by mobs being completely immune to several lines of our spells, being heavilly resistant, or best case, needing debuffs to consistantly land things.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Gone are the days when necromancers could stack all their dots before debuffs and consistantly compete in the top teir of dps.  Sorry, but the author of this thread must be playing a different game then I am, or have no idea what a necromancer is.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I would fiercely argue that caster classes in general *need* to see improvement as the last few expansions have severely limited our raiding ability by willful neglect.  PoR spells are beyond criminal, considering that is the majority of the upgrade we will see until the next expansion, 6 months + from PoR release.  This resist problem could be fixed by some sort of resist fix mechanism, upping counters on current spells, or lower each individual problematic monster.  And instead of the author's hateful agenda of attacking other classes to make him feel better, I'd like to see no classes nerfed ever again, because that really just takes all the fun out of the game.  When one class is a little above the others, and I can guarentee you its not necromancers ATM in any situation, just bump up the other classes in power to compensate.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Necromancers soloing ability has been stiffled for a while now.  If it summons, its a problem.  Sure high HPS/mods help here, and many of us do manage to get around summoning on some of the older stuff.  But summon kiting is never good xp, and rarely worthwhile for anything other then bragging rights.  Classes like clerics have grown in power, and rightly so, that they can toe to toe the things we can barely summon kite.  Usually you'll notice that players on the bleeding edge so to speak among multiple classes in EQ manage the same solo feats, its not just the necromancers that can solo anymore.  It makes me happy to see other classes catching up because honestly I feel every class should be able to experience the occasional &amp;quot;solo&amp;quot; game.  But to say that necromancers are leagues and bounds better soloers generally is disingenuous.  Like other classes out there, there are some things we solo better then other classes, and most necromancers usually form groups in these scenarios so its rarely pure &amp;quot;solo&amp;quot; because this is a multiplayer game.  I dare you to ask your local necro to solo any named in the past few expansions, or solo in most available zones.  You'll find if something hits for 2k+ a hit and summons, nobody is killing it solo atm anyways.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;How exactly is a mage or wizard affected by resists compared to a necro......necro dps is based on all his dots stacking. Mage and wiz dps is based on nuke after nuke after nuke. Dots that cant land dont add to dps, nuke that dont land just dont get casted, they still can dps with the other line. Say you are fighting Mobby McFireResisty. Mages and wiz can still do their max dps with ice and magic (I don't know which line is better with those classes). Necros do their DPS - fire dots = about 60%.  Poison and magic aren't quite as bad but still hurt. Disease...well that never lands on anything anyways. &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;For some reason, necros get lure dots without paying extra mana for them, while wizards have to pay in efficiency and decreased damage when we get lure nukes.&amp;nbsp; I've never been able to figure out why, especially when necromancers can debuff the resists as well (the argument given for why shaman dots don't have resist modifiers on them historically).</description>
