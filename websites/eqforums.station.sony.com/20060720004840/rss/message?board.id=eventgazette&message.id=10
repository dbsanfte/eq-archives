Write what would be an excerpt from Denny’s memoirs if he were to survive the adventure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;RESPONDANT SAID:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I wiped the feline blood from my dagger and applied more of the poison crafted from the spiders beneath Lavastorm. The Registrar had to die, I gave him every opportunity to provide me with the papers. Alas I needed no witnesses alerting my presence to the many guards nearby. This mission is what I had trained for. I slowly moved down the corridor blending with my environment sneaking ever so closely to my destination. Yet another guard stood between me and my destiny, slowly drawing my dagger creeping up to him I was certain he would show no challenge to my ability to end him. I drew back my curved blade taking careful aim and thrust.... I missed.... The feline was completely surprised but too young and scared to immediately counter attack. I had to quickly act to keep others from being aware of my invasion. With my long sword I slashed and you could see the poison flowing in his veins dropping him to the floor with a terrified look in his eyes. I sheathed my sword and drug him into an empty room. I could hear the growl of the Beast Masters warder. I was close but so far away. The Lord of beasts would surely put up more of a fight that even I am not ready for. So I go back to the basics of what I was taught. Concentrating on my body making it once again blend into the environment I cautiously eased into the Beastlords lair. I could see my target the silly catman displayed it as if it were a wondrous treasure. The Master of beasts had no idea of my attendance in his quarters but his warder acted uneasy as if it could smell the blood that I had spilled. I dared not to attack now because his animal alone would prove such a fight to me that I was unworthy to be in. I just had to wait for the right moment and keep concentrating on keeping my body hidden. And then the moment came, a young feline entered the room asking his master for some much needed training. This was just the distraction I needed. I grabbed the citizenship papers and leapt out the window. I had to be careful going out of the city I was so impressed by my accomplishments that I wasn’t watching my speed and lost my stealth. The guards were on me so I had to quickly summon my stallion and make my leave.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

I just had to wait for the right moment and keep concentrating on keeping my body hidden. And then the moment came, a young feline entered the room asking his master for some much needed training. This was just the distraction I needed. I grabbed the citizenship papers and leapt out the window. I had to be careful going out of the city I was so impressed by my accomplishments that I wasn’t watching my speed and lost my stealth. The guards were on me so I had to quickly summon my stallion and make my leave.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff size=2&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Zaerix and Borjoyze wanted to share an event write up that they took part in on April 11th&amp;nbsp;on the Bertoxxulos server. If anyone took screen shots please feel free to share them.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff size=4&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

With teary eyes the Halfling introduced himself as Robbo Deeppurse. As the Halfling realized the size of the crowd, little cogs began to turn in his head as he began to see a way to solve his dilemma, for his violet-eyed love Lilia T`Shiv had been captured and dragged off into the bowels of Unrest for unfathomable evil purposes. As the crowd listened to his plight they grew sympathetic and rallied their forces to reclaim his love, Lilia.&lt;xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" &gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none"&gt;&lt;SPAN **SMURF**"FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;The forces arrived in Unrest with swords and spears at the ready. Agonizing screams of help echoed from the heart of the manor as the Ritualist waved a rusty jagged knife over her heart. She screamed and pleaded piteously for anyone to rescue her, and as the tip of the knife drew first blood from her ebony skin, Robbo burst in along with his forces shouting "Lilia, I am here my love!"&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none"&gt;&lt;SPAN **SMURF**"FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none"&gt;&lt;SPAN **SMURF**"FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;With bloodlust in their eyes, the assembled heroes burst into the room and began to swarm the Ritualist. Powerful skeletons, taken straight from Bertoxxulous' own menagerie, rose to defend the Ritualist and to see that the gruesome procedure went on its way. The sound of blades clashing and magical explosions reverberated throughout the estate. The room was rampant with chaos and discord, yet through the chaos emerged a leader of the heroes who rallied the adventures onto the Ritualist. While the heroes were busy vanquishing the tainted spawns, Robbo snuck over to Lilia and un-gagged her. At the sight of Robbo, Lilia began to belittle the impotent Halfling, but caught her tongue. He could still be of use, let the fool think what he wishes thought Lilia as she calculated how she could use the situation to her advantage.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none"&gt;&lt;SPAN **SMURF**"FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none"&gt;&lt;SPAN **SMURF**"FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;After the last burst of magical energy faded from the room and all blades sheathed, the crowd's eyes fell upon the odd couple. Robbo was perched at Lilia's feet like a dog awaiting his master, fawning over her and attempting to embrace her with all his might. Lilia let the little Halfling have his fun. Why resist when he could provide a means for her escape?, she thought.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none"&gt;&lt;SPAN **SMURF**"FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none"&gt;&lt;SPAN **SMURF**"FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;As the heroes escorted the couple out of Dagnor's Cauldron, a few noticed Lilia's utter lack of compassion towards the Halfling. When they were finally able to get the Halfling alone, which was a feat in and of itself as he practically entwined himself with Lilia, they confronted him about Lilia's love (or lack thereof) towards him. Robbo refused to accept that as a possibility and insisted she was simply guarded about her emotions. Tired of the nay saying, Robbo came up with a way to prove to the heroes that she truly loved him. He would ask for a kiss. If she gave the kiss then she must love him.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none"&gt;&lt;SPAN **SMURF**"FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none"&gt;&lt;SPAN **SMURF**"FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;A crowd trailed behind Robbo as he came upon Lilia."Lilia my love, grant me a kiss so that I may have enough strength to see us completely out here." Robbo spoke as he looked into the dark elf's violet eyes. There was a pause, and time seemed to stand still. Everyone watched anxiously as they stared at the two, waiting for a reply. The only sound that could be heard was the pounding of Robbo's heart as he waited. But if you listened even more closely, you could hear a faint drip as the ice began to melt of Lilia's heart. She discovered, nested under the bitterness and hate, that she truly cared for the little Halfling who would risk himself, for her. This sudden, piercing realization changed her forever. Lilia leaned in to kiss Robbo, the one she knew she loved.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none"&gt;&lt;SPAN **SMURF**"FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none"&gt;&lt;SPAN **SMURF**"FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;Suddenly a darkly regal Dark elf entered the crowd, holding himself with a air of nobility. He looked down in disgust upon the scene between Lilia and Robbo." How dare my daughter insult the T'Shiv family by consorting with a foul Halfling! I will not stand to have this dishonor upon our family name. You are nothing to me! Are you ready to die, you useless wretch?" The Dark elf spat. With a violent twist of his wrist and a quick word, Lilia screamed once and then fell over dead and silent. Robbo fell to his knees and clutched her slowly cooling hand. He looked upon the Dark elf with infernal fire in his eyes, but to no avail. With a smirk and another violent gesture, the Dark elf magically crushed the pitiful Halfling's heart. Robbo slumped over dead, still clutching Lila's hand.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none"&gt;&lt;SPAN **SMURF**"FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none"&gt;&lt;SPAN **SMURF**"FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;The crowd, previously stunned, arose into a frenzy to avenge the honorable and deceased Robbo. Grabbing their weapons they set upon the Dark elf with untold fury. The Dark elf's smirk turned to confusion and agony as his lithe ebony body was mauled by the weapons of the heroes. Once the Dark elf was dead, they looked back upon the two lovers, saddened by thoughts of what could have been, yet smiled faint smiles at the two murdered lovers, embracing each other with a passion that continued onto death.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
