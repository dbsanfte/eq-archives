&lt;DIV&gt;Sometimes things just don't go as you plan.&amp;nbsp; Today for example, I had hoped to post two big things.&amp;nbsp; Well it's just about the end of the day and unfortunately I won't be getting them out the door today.&amp;nbsp; One is delayed as it goes through the approval process, which depending on the schedules of folks here can sometimes take longer than expected.&amp;nbsp; It can be even longer on a week where members of the company are traveling, like this week with folks at GDC (Game Developers Conference).&amp;nbsp; The other is delayed because of last minute changes (positive changes, but changes that are not so final at this moment that I can post them).&amp;nbsp; So the class changes will wait until Monday, but they will be up Monday.&amp;nbsp; There is some good stuff in there.&amp;nbsp; Some changes we want to make (wait until Monday before you ask Loral) and some for you to discuss with us.&amp;nbsp; Monday should be a pretty exciting day for all of us, provided I can actually drag myself our of bed after a rip roaring weekend of yardwork and gaming.&amp;nbsp; I finally picked up GTA San Andreas and plan to play that a little this weekend (maybe a lot if I can get the kids to do the yardwork).&amp;nbsp; I have to wait and play that one after kiddies go to bed though (or while they are mowing).&amp;nbsp; Darn rated M games.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Next&amp;nbsp;week EQ turns 6 years old.&amp;nbsp; Wow.&amp;nbsp; It is hard to believe that this game has been a part of my life for so long.&amp;nbsp; This game and you ornery curs (just kidding you are not all ornery) Hehe.&amp;nbsp; 6 years that I would not trade except for maybe 2 millions dollars and someone to do my yardwork this weekend.&amp;nbsp; I also have to paint the bathroom. Can I do that with MS Paint?&amp;nbsp; Anyhow, I think that while many of you feel anger and frustration, I think it is safe to say that it has not kept you around for 6 years.&amp;nbsp; So take a look back and reflect on what has.&amp;nbsp; This game, this hobby, this phenomenon has been a part of our lives for a while now, and that's pretty special.&amp;nbsp; While I have other games that I have not finished after 6 years ( I will beat you yet Mario Bros!) none has entertained us in the way that this one has.&amp;nbsp; That's what it all boils down to in the end, entertainment.&amp;nbsp; Yes, our friends and our characters play a part in it, but friends are around to share the entertainment with (movies are always better shared with friends unless they talk the whole time or give away the end, like someone who shall remain nameless that said to me as "&lt;EM&gt;A movie which shall remain nameless so as not to spoil it for others" &lt;/EM&gt;started, "You know, I bet he is dead") and characters are the vehicle for that entertainment.&amp;nbsp; The strong lead character that we get attached to.&amp;nbsp; Like one of my favorites, Han Solo, you have to love that guy, although some of you might be more attached to Obi Wan, or Luke and that's okay.&amp;nbsp; Just like our classes there is something for everyone.&amp;nbsp; While we may get a little ticked when someone messes with the characters&amp;nbsp;we love so much (Han Solo should shoot first Darn It!) it does not change the fact that it is still entertaining and even that change, liked or disliked, keeps us talking and enjoying the movie, tv show or game.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Something to think about over the weekend while you flame me for not having the post up today, and some of you will.&amp;nbsp; But sometimes, things are out of my control.&amp;nbsp; Although the stop at Starbucks on the way home is well within my control, well maybe not.&amp;nbsp; I am carpooling with Ashlanne.&amp;nbsp; Hey Ash, Can we stop at Starbucks?&amp;nbsp; What?&amp;nbsp; No I don't have a Mercedes!&amp;nbsp; Why?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
