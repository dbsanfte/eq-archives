    <description>If this server is strictly classic; why isn't it opened already? Also, why are zones being reverted, quests taken out, boats put in, and a plethora of other things that caters to the classic crowd being added? I mean, the tutorial was considered being taken out for a while, even though developers stated the server was for new people... It seems they are attempting to attract the classic crowd, yet keeping the programming easy and catering to the power raiders.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am one of the classic crowd, but when I see people saying it is strictly progression I begin to wonder. If it really is strictly progression I say lets get the show on the road and open the server already, the heck with changes....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stop trying to make it classic if it is strictly progression</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Yeah, the ride is usually the most fun, or should be. Alot of games lack that. And I do agree SoE is still doing a great job of keeping the new EQ alive with all the demands they must meet for new MMO players. I think once the MMO industry settles down upon trying to render the best graphics, we can see alot more games that hold the difficulty and experience that original EQ did, or at least we can hope. But for now since that may be years away, we plead with SoE to give us a capped server.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Never the less, all you classic players...&lt;U&gt;Don't ever&lt;/U&gt; give up trying to find that game, it will be out if I have to make it myself and that idea production has already long begun...&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;3 Reasons.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;1) Epics during Kunark&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;2) 10th Ring War&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;3) Contested Content, specially racing for trak'anon to key up my guild, then racing for ST key droppers to key up again, and then fighting over general camps to key up yet again!&amp;nbsp; I love racing.&amp;nbsp; Lodizal I'm looking at you.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I just want to clear a few things up here. When I mention EQlive I mean Post luclin, and when I say EQ I mean traditional old eq before luclin.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Now when the classic players talk about a classic server, they are talking about the old times that were a struggle for them and nothing was handed for free. I'll take the newbie quest armor for example. Yeah these quests are great, they give you pretty nice armor at lower levels, let you learn the area, travel a little and such but this is just what I consider candy in the bag. In EQ you had to work for things, playing was difficult and that difficulty was fun. Finding your first rusty sword&amp;nbsp;or dagger, geting a full suit of&amp;nbsp;plain leather armor and showing it off. This is when getting experience used to be called hunting. Actually using what you found on the corpse because more often than not, youd find an upgrade eventually. But if it's newbie quest armor you want handed to you, go play any new MMO out there right now.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I hate to sound conceded for these players but, the classic EQ players that brought the MMO community to the rise knew what made the game fun. It&amp;nbsp;was challenge and rewarding, nothing handed to you.&amp;nbsp;Arguably,&amp;nbsp;EQ was the first game of its kind and the truth is Verant didn't know what they were doing. They didn't know about balancing, they didn't know about making the game easier, they just made the game and set it out as a jumble of&amp;nbsp;ideas about an online&amp;nbsp;world. They had a story in mind and they crafted a world around that story instead of creating the world first. In alot of cases, balancing is what can ruin a game. What is a paladin? well it's a warrior with healing powers, NO!&amp;nbsp;A paladin is a paladin, a warrior is a warrior.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Even chat channels ruin some of the community in EQlive. Granted they are very helpful in raids and such (dont have to use shout anymore ;P) but these chat channels ruined the communities in Gfay and EC in EQ (Along with the introduction of the Bazaar). We all know that games are 10 times as fun when you know people and are playing with others and when you take out that interaction, you take out some of the fun. These channels, all though they were made for the betterment of gameplay, ruined alot of community interaction.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Many of these little things add up to what I now call EQlive or the compilation of what newbie players want:: easy of travel (no more asking a druid or wizy for a port and paying him, no more running through scary zones, dodging mobs, not knowing if you will live or not), ease of communication and LFG lists, finding armor quick and finding quests to do. Even quests are so overused now, they seemed rare in EQ and they&amp;nbsp;usually were&amp;nbsp;very rewarding.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;To be honest, the classic EQ players are looking for somewhere to go. All these new games are not bringing back the challenge that we had, the struggles and the friends that went through the same struggles. The learning experiences and interactions. If the new players would truly sit down and play the classic EQ, if possible, you would be surprised in how different the game is, how much more fun it is when nothing is handed to you. The game feels like a real world, it doesn't feel like just some fantasy computer and code controlled means of entertainment.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If you want balance go play one of the many MMO's on the market, if you want newbie armor and free candy go do the same. But if you want a challenging game that's fun, inviting, difficult but rewarding and an experience you won't forget, bring back the classic EQ and play it. I do hope that enough classic players will choose to keep from unlocking all expansions on this server, apparently they are giving us control and if we find out what needs to be done to unlock Luclin+, we might not do it. This server is not a rush to see who can get to the top the fastest, who can unlock or "beat" the game the quickest, it's about having fun and experiencing the content that in EQlive, is pretty much now overlooked or nonexsistent. Nuff said...&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Yeah I agree. And it is sad to note that these players most likely don't understand where we are comming from.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I hate to say it, but it seems once SoE took over Verant, the game went kablooe! At least thats when&amp;nbsp;I saw a downfall.&amp;nbsp;But it's hard to say what exactly happened when I don't know the specifics of development. I just saw the change in marketing.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I don't think that SoE blew it with their game.&amp;nbsp; They did take the game different direction, and lets face it, it is still a succesful game.&amp;nbsp; It is just a different game than some&amp;nbsp;of us would like it to be.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I don't believe that the SoE gang understand those of us who would like a capped "Classic as much as possible" server.&amp;nbsp; I think Absor made that very clear in his early posting on the "Classic" thread, and I think it was also reflected by Rashere's early post regarding the Progression server.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I do think that there is a viable and virtually free product that could be offered to statisfy a decent sized market segment - I just don't think they understand us, and therefore discount us. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>Its not so much the newbie armor quests are overpowered, as when you limit the world to the whining of the classics, the original drops are so crappy.&amp;nbsp; This server is doomed as long as they are unable to address balance issues.&amp;nbsp; But ya'll do what you will, I dont plan on wasting much, if any time with this fiasco.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;If the devs are smart, they will keep close track of the feedback in these forums because this server gives them the perfect opportunity to track at exactly what point the game ceases being fun and starts to become more like work for many of us. At the point where it ceases to be fun, I think you will see many people quit the server and voicing their opinions here as to why it isn't working for them anymore. &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;They should already have the numbers in the form of account numbers.&amp;nbsp; This will show that EQ was at it's peak duringthe PoP/LoY era, started to run down during LDoN, bug drop during OoW, and started trending back up during DoN/DoD era.&amp;nbsp; Needless to say, those are not the results you probably want, but they are more likely to be accurate than watching the population of a special ruleset server, with players that, for the most part, are not the 'normal' EQ player.</description>

&lt;P&gt;Redhenna,&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The number of accounts or players active at any time isn't always an accurate indicator. With so many people boxing from 2-6 characters at once, those figures can be way off. If I start new tomorrow with 6 accounts, it will skew those figures into looking like the game is more popular than it is. If I later quit all 6 of my accounts, it makes it look less popular. They have to take into account how many actual living, breathing people are behind the toons and not just the number of the toons themselves.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;The number of people who box is not a hugely significant portion of the population, and people have boxed since very early in EQ's life. The guild leader of the first guild I was in, back during velious, 6 boxed, as did his brother, and a couple of his friends. Secondly, feeback on a forum is not nearly indicitive of overall player opinion, just of the vocal part that posts on this message board.&amp;nbsp; Lastly, the key information for SoE is the number of paying accounts. More paying accounts = more money in, which is, after all, the goal of any for profit company.&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Redhenna on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;06-13-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;03:43 AM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;Even if the number of people who box is a "significant" number, do you think that matters? If they can keep one guy happy boxing 300,000 accounts do you think they care if it's not 300,000 people with one account each, instead?</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Honestly i dont see why anyone who already has an accomplished character on another server would want to reroll here if they dont only want the classic game.&amp;nbsp; This server has renewed interest in MANY old players of everquest that really enjoyed the game early on.&amp;nbsp; People who want to just experience an early game they never had a chance to because they started to late, ok experience away but dont complain when people dont want the setrver to be taken to the state other servers are now.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I personaly am looking forward to that old feel of eq where you had to camp zones like guk for some of the best items in the game with small groups as opposed to only being able to get the big upgrades with raids.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;It will be fun to play untill the game gets too out of hand like modern eq is or another rpg comes out that is well made and doesnt make you lose interest as fast as wow =X&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

The good bit is playing on a new server - the rule set is secondary.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;What he said! Personally, I'd have probably considered coming back for another go even if they had announced just a regular new server. EQ2 has gotten a bit stale for me, and WoW...&amp;nbsp; :smileytongue:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The chance to start out fresh with a full player base in low level zones is something you don't get on an established server, unless you BYOG. And the progression aspect makes it irresistable. The server has the potential to be a very cool experience.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;A classic server would definitely be fun for a while. But&amp;nbsp;I think&amp;nbsp;it would wind up being just like playing WoW within a year or two - endlessly pharming the same&amp;nbsp;content over and over again. Of course, EQ's gameplay inherantly fosters a much greater sense of community&amp;nbsp; imo, so there would still be &lt;EM&gt;that &lt;/EM&gt;aspect to continue playing. But you gotta have a shot in the arm of new content every now and again.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;I am looking for to progression... i figure the server is going to start slow with really overcrowded camps etc. It going to be much better after velius comes out. I planing on grinding as hard as possible and helping whoever is pushing the hardest ot unlock crap. I just want to see how fast we can *rebeat* the game with today's knowledge.</description>

Also, why are zones being reverted, quests taken out, boats put in, and a plethora of other things that caters to the classic crowd being added? I mean, the tutorial was considered being taken out for a while, even though developers stated the server was for new people... It seems they are attempting to attract the classic crowd, yet keeping the programming easy and catering to the power raiders.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am one of the classic crowd, but when I see people saying it is strictly progression I begin to wonder. If it really is strictly progression I say lets get the show on the road and open the server already, the heck with changes....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stop trying to make it classic if it is strictly progression&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;because the classic freak's are the most vocal in the beta. &lt;br&gt;sucks to because are ruining what could have been a fun server. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Zxsin, the following changes hardly ruin the new server.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;1.&amp;nbsp; No tutorial&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;2.&amp;nbsp; No noobie armor&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;3.&amp;nbsp; CR at lvl 5&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Am I missing any other changes?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
