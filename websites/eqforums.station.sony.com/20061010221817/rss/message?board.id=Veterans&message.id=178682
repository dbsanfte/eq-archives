&lt;P&gt;The -999 resist was something I was considering early on, but opted to just leave it at no save in the end.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Quote: &lt;strong&gt;The way that the wizard AA Mana Burn works has been modified.  The new version will use a maximum of 3000 mana instead of draining your whole pool and will do 4 damage for every point of mana spent.  This is a raw channeling of magical energy that cannot be focused, and will not crit.  The ability is unresistable by normal creatures, but certain extremely powerful creatures may be immune to the effects.  Like the original version, once a Mana Burn ability has affected a target, no other mana burn abilities will be able to affect that target for the next minute.  Upgraded versions of the ability, Mana Blast and Mana Blaze, are available at level 65 and level 70 and use a maximum of 6000 and 9000 mana respectively.  The original Mana Burn ability has been refunded and can be repurchased by Wizards interested in the new version.  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;That was supposed to happen on December 20, 2005 but it never did, anyone know why the mana burn has not been upgraded?&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Saying that you wish LB wouldn't take hp is not the same as having 9K mana used. There are heal spells, there are no spells that will dump 9K mana back to a Wizzy who has just used their MB. Also, saying that HT can have its time reduced through AAs does not take into account that the Disc used (Unholy Aura) does not refresh any faster, and so you do not get the &amp;quot;Big&amp;quot; Bang (and believe me, I use the term Big VERY lightly... 8K dmg is NOWHERE near Big) but more like a 5K nuke. I am not a Wizzy and even I think that the current way they are implementing MB is going to be next to useless. It will be used when the mob resists anything that can be resisted and that's about it. Not something that really brings pride or satisfaction in an ability.  As stated a few times, in most situations it will actually cripple a Wizzy... which makes zero sense. Now - if GoM somehow worked with MB then it would be a different story, but I don't think it does (correct me if I am wrong here.) I wish I could understand the logic used when these decisions were made. Do the devs really think that a Wizzy will be happy to cripple themselves, or that the rare use on highly resistant mobs will qualify this as a good call? Mind boggling, to say the least...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>In the new expanison...&lt;br&gt;Well I hapen to be a level 70 wizard who just picked up Mana Blast.  I can't say that I can complain.   It has a lower recast time just slightly more than an hour.  I find that the 6k cost vs my 8k mana pool is managable and I probably will wait until i am over 10k mana for the next upgrade.  What I like so far is when I am  fighting healing type mobs and I just want to kill it one mana blast and it is gone.  Now think if you were soloing and trying to bring down that healing drake in nest.  How much mana can it cost to bring it down.  Sure it is only once per hour and leaves ya medding but healing mobs leave you medding anyhow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a group if you have claw of vox you can easily keep your dps way above average and hardly use any mana.  So the problem of being completely out of mana is solved.  In any zone where your grouping pulling the usual trash then the named spawns you can toss this out there when it is at half health and the fight is over.  Wizards are still in the top of the classes for making fights end and we now have a very usefull tool to continue that trend. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don't think mana burn/blast/blaze are perfect.  I would like the recast time be able to be lowered through some AA.  However many people seem to miss the point that if mana burn could do 10 to 1 damage your going to do that in a very tiny amount of time 6 seconds? Sure my whole mana bar cast one spell after another can do 150k dmg but that takes about what 10 minutes?  Anyhow I do recommend Mana Blast for the situations I just talked about. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am sure there are mobs out there that are not kunark dragons that will be trivialized by mana baze but it doesn't look like wizards will ever solo dragons at the same gear level as most (all?) other classes which I think is somehow wrong...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alyenbomb&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Claw of Vox, Etherflame, etc They're situational spells. They're not useable in every zone. When DoN came out I was forced to use lure's to do very minimal damage in comparison to say a similar dps class in melee, because every expantion they kick the resists on mobs up another few notches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try using etherflame against a mob like Tirranun. Or use claw of vox against something thats likely to have over 500+ cold resist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I understand the point of having all lure, draught, spark etc lines being the same. But for a while I've been amused that there are just plain some spells you cant use anywhere because all mobs are magic resistant in OoW, or Fire resistant in mpg etc. Try being a mage.. And chanters and clerics recently got chromatic nukes because they're spells are all (with exception of those 2 chromatic nukes) are magic resist checks and easily resistable. Granted Neither of those classes are supposed to be &amp;quot;DPS&amp;quot; classes, but im sure its incredibly frustrating if your fighting mobs like (ok maybe these are old examples) emperor of ssra, or Lord seru, and mobs immune to your damage type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manaburn was supposed to have on its own a 'woa' effect to those who observed. It was a class defining ability.. /shrug. Maybe im just rambling in agria cause devs tossed in the new manaburn as is and dont even bother to acknowledge or comment on ideas and suggestions regardless of how much thought someone puts into trying to make the game fun yet still balanced. Eitherway, I guess ill go start another thread on the other stuff thats broken since Dev's appear to ignore anythead with manaburn ever mentioned =)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Yep there are tons more issues with the game than a single nuke.  It is not possible to solve.  The developers were too shortsighted when they made kunark dragons so important to so many classes.  Now that dragons are like fleas all players who are less than 3yrs in game have no idea how much harder things were back when.  Never the less they have to make it seem like these mobs are hard to kill by not allowing certain things. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When my group of a 70sk 70bard 70wizard 66 boxed chanter 65 cleric killed velekator with room to spare It is obvious that the issue is completely with developers thinking that old content is somehow valuable.  When the fight was over and we looked at the loot it was not worth the effort except for the fact that we did something that it used to take huge raids to kill.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now I know that is a trash mob and all but my point is classes have progression and if you follow their lines of progression you will notice that at some point those lines make content trivial.  Give enchanters a mez or a stun or charm spell that works?  Forget about it.  Where do you think all the enchanters have gone?  They were replaced by shaman who not only CC but can semi-tank and heal and slow and buff and REZ.  Who let shaman have a skill that knocks a mob back and roots it?  Who let shaman rez? Who let shaman be so tough?  Why not give some of that to some other class?  Why didnt chanters get rez and knockback root? Were shaman not valueable enough with buffs healing and slows?   When I think about shaman it really just freaks me out and people are worried about a wizard nuking a dragon to death.   At least my class wasn't entirely eliminated by another class.  I know that is stretching it but not by much.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyhow eq is totally broken and the only thing that will fix it is to start over eq2 anyone(never).  But my bazillion AA toon is too valuable to give up on yet so I will go on and keep playing enjoying the many exploits that still exist and will exist in the future when I have 2 bazillion AA.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Where is my convert pet to mana bar AA  and how come my pet can't attack and why are my nukes more expensive than complete heal? Why should I have lower dps than tanks on tough mobs and how come I can be killed in one quad attack arn't I a weezard can't I be almost ethereal!  Point for point clerics have to use way less mana in the same peroid of time shouldnt I have about double the mana of any other caster class?  Ugg Think i will get back to playing and not thinking about what is broken.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I crack me up...&lt;br&gt;</description>

      <description>How about mana burn like this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Set ammount of damage per skill level like they have it on test.&lt;br&gt;Lockout for 1 minute from someone else using mana burn on the same target, like it is now no test.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Change it to use no mana, and instead lock the wizard out of spell casting for 1 minute. That way it adds dps, rather then taking it away by being horribly inefficient. While still allowing it  be big, but doesnt allow it to cause a huge instant surge in dps without any penalty afterwards. Over 1 minute the 36k is 600 dps. Considering you would use no mana at the time, that would be significant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The short version, trade the mana useage for a silence period.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Having Lifeburn taking hps is a trivial issue.  You can tap your hps back.  Compare that to the wizards having no choice but to not dps for a good amount of time.  I'd be happy if Manaburn would have a mana regen recourse that would regen the mana cost of the AA rank they used over say, 2 minutes, so they still have some downtime for a little bit but not as bad as it is right now.  The lifeburn recourse regens only 2500ish (I forget if it's 9 ticks or 10 at 250 hps/tick and I couldn't be bothered to look right now) but who cares, it doesn't affect our dps.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lifeburn, and Manaburn, and Harm Touch are all bound by similar rules not allowing them to hit said mob too quickly or too many times in a short duration of time. Now many necros utilized an exploit allowing necros to chain cast lifeburn, and the refresh timer would reset because the recourse was blocked. Ok, so the exploit was -fixed- and necros no longer do it. But it was never nerfed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The point of Manaburn originally, was to be an ability that litterally gave a worthwhile and impressive return on damage for the mana you put into it. Now it just cripples your dps. Crippling dps is not what Lifeburn does to Necromancers. It is also something that harmtouch does not do for SKs, cripple thier dps and they (the shadowknights) did do, and had similar potential to do, the same things wizards did that got manaburn nerfed. Harm touch Never saw any nerfs until PoP they started finding caps on the damage they did. Lifeburn has had an exploit fixed but is still to all knowledge never nerfed, it even recourses the used HPs back to the necromancer. Both classes are still able to continue to use thier mana, and have no lasting effects on thier dps. Where a wizard of any relative decent gear would spend 7+ minutes (WITH buffs) regenerating thier mana that they could have done 150k+ damage with.. (ok thats a pretty long fight)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any realistic intention of making manaburn useable for wizards as a class, would have other classes whining that its overpowered. Or developers would determine that it makes encounters with soloable mobs trivial. Ok the mob was a trivial fight to begin with.. but ok.. I'm not going to argue that. To be honest the everquest game evolved before and after the introduction of manaburn where the mere concept of manaburn makes many many many encounters trivial. I say quit trying to be honest it was designed in a manner that It would have eventually been nerfed or had a stealth cap added to it anyways. The concept of a manaburn in roleplay is a very large singular blast from a wizard and SoE didnt have the foresight to see that this could cause problems when the current expansions largest nuke did 1100 damage. Current design for Manaburn is a single shot nuke that leaves the wizard out for rest of the fight. Your done your gone might as well start playing /gems Necromancer with 9k hps or maybe even as much as 15k hps is getting a free nuke with thier concept spell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now I'm not saying that Manaburn needs to be more powerful, Because Manaburn in its current design (consume mana in exchange for a very large nuke) will never be able to be powerful enough to live up to the role play concept, let alone useable in random situations.. while still being weak enough to avoid unbalancing the game. Thats my input as a wizard, that has the current manaburn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want my idea to make manaburn useable as far as the game without being overpowerful? make it a manaless incarnation of the Lifeburn, it takes your current # of mana turns it into damge. Then have it consume no mana at all because a recourse concept could be used at low mana to return the wizard to full. You've thereby limited how much damage it does without crippling the wizard dps or making it overpowerful, the only way to make it more powerful is to gain more mana. With the current highest in EQ would be something under 14k. The spell would be limited by the itemization you place into the system so that manaburn would be allowed to grow with each expansion by very small amounts, and force wizards to actually improve upon thier gear to get anything out of it. The suggested idea limits its damage potential via the itemization in the game, without really overpowering it as a singular utility. And it would not remain the least used AA as far as wizards go.. it would actually be used, people would like it, etc.. People might stop complaining .. ok.. except for the people who request rediculously powerful incarnations of manaburn..&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&amp;quot; But it was never nerfed.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aye Lifeburn was implemented with Manaburns Nerfs already built in. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Very good post Aruruen-Myrs&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I agree 100%.. consider a end DoN wizard.. with 50% focuses.. Ancient Core Fire will be just above 10dmg per mana on average, assuming 21% crits and max crit AA. Can get it over 11dmg per mana with bard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compare it to Manaburn which is 4damage per mana used. And you see how &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; it is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now advance to DoD.. and the Wizard has Etherflame.. on average with same assumptions he will have 9dmg per mana. And the ability to have each single nuke crit for 25k dmg with right circumstances (druid epic, or good Mana Weave proc)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compare it to Manaburn and you have a nuke that is almost as good as best manaburn(36kdmg) and it takes on average around 1000mana vs best manaburns 9000mana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manaburn looses imo even there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IF Manaburn would have a recourse effect like lifeburn.. and only done 1dmg per mana... it would be the best thing every. It would have been &amp;quot;free&amp;quot; dps. Rashere also gave us another idea and that was a 2min reuse 3k nuke for free.... that would be TONS better than old or current MB. For the single reason that it ADDED dps instead of loosing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And as a sidenote: Look at Frenzied Devastation AA a wizzy has (60% crits for 200%mana) so that is more crits for double mana. Which unless you crit every single nuke will cost you more than if you didnt use it... only on a fight so short that you cannot possible get oom is it even worth thinking about.&lt;br&gt;Thats typical for the wizzies... even disclike abilites dont give us dps ... but remove it from us. Comes with great cost.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sorry, Id meant to be more clear on that, and not give manaburn any sort of recourse similar to Lifeburn, because then it could be used to return mana to you that you may not have had before the cast (manaburning at 20mana to get a 3tick regen giving mana back like lifeburn does for hp would just equal free mana We already get that out of harvest spell and AA). My intention to convey the idea across was have it consume no mana, and use your current mana as a damage base. Avoiding making it more powerful, and also avoiding making it useless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would honestly not press for any crit ability for manaburn, (although the crit just brings attention to it, which would be added in to the 'wow' or 'cool' factors) or make the ability focused, in my opinion that would be asking for too much, and my idea is intended to be reasonable for both sides the player and the designer, cant be overpowered nor underpowered. It wouldnt need to be focused It just needs to be fun, and to be fun it has to have a practicle use or you'll never see it used, and no one will get any entertainment out of it. Even non wizards used to gasp in awe at manaburns they were something cool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I personally have Ether Flame. Its resistable and has a similar ratio to that of the manaburn on test. Though focusable, mana preservation, etc applies Its among my lowest in dmg per mana efficiency. But its fun. And thats all you really need to explain it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Hrm, I forgot to mention you can use Ether Flame in conjunction with Gift of mana. (and focuses and crits) to actually make it worthwhile moreso than dps crippling.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the next incarnation of MB the fact it cannot crit and cannot be focused is balanced by the fact that it comes with an aggro of 1 and is completely unresistable by a mob unless it is 1 of the VERY limited list of mobs that are flagged immune.  The other part is it is a Guaranteed damage of 4:1.  I can accept that give and take.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2:24 (144 min) reuse on it compared to 72 min HT and Lifeburn (than can be reduced even more with AAs) and the 1 minute stacking timer is the problem I have.  If the recouse at least did something then I would feel it would be a better trade off.  All it does, that I know of, is prevent other MBs from landing on the same mob during that time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I kind of like the ideas of basing it on current mana but not using any.  That is not really &amp;quot;Mana Burn&amp;quot; though.  There are ways to correct it and all we can hope for is that it won't be left in the dust shortly after it hits Live.  I am hoping that Rashere is already looking at where he can tweak it to bring it more in line and starting to consider AA paths that will enhance it the same way other classes can with their class specific abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would like to get past this and start looking into more pressing matters of our Spell Casting Subtlety AA affecting our Concussion, Ancient Greater Concussion, and possibly our new Epic 1.5 and 2.0 effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Edimas on &lt;span class="date_text"&gt;02-03-2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;03:04 PM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
