<DIV><FONT color=#ff00ff>Quests - Top 10 Issues List - Created 2/22/04 - Found </FONT><A href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Quests&amp;message.id=522" target=_blank><FONT color=#ff00ff>here</FONT></A></DIV>
<DIV>I will try to get a Development team update when the top 10 lists are update.&nbsp; The next scheduled update is April 1st.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><STRONG>1.&nbsp; Add a tag "This item may be used in a Quest" onto items</STRONG></DIV>
<P></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr>
<P>This was done for tradeskills, so it should be possible to do the same for quests. I know some items might not be used in a quest at the moment, but will be in the future, but this is no different to adding new tradeskill recipees.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>2.&nbsp; Increase the group level range for&nbsp;LDoN&nbsp;adventures, to say 10 levels.</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr>
<P>It is increasingly difficult to get LDoN groups. Increasing the level range would help.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>3.&nbsp; Make LDoN&nbsp;Rescue and Assassin missions more desirable.</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr>
<P>Everybody only does Collect or Slaughter LDoN adventures. People need encouragement to request Rescue and Assassin types. Possible suggestions are more points for these types, or better loot - the assassinated mob currently doesn't drop anything, it should drop something to make people want to kill him.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>4.&nbsp; Update the new task window.</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr>
<P>Please update the Quest History tag so that it is sortable by Quest Title or Completion. Add totals for number of quests completed, and number of different quests completed. This will then give potential in the future for new titles when a number of different quests have been completed, quests that are only available if you've done a previous one, a quests leaderboard similar to LDoN adventures. Also put all quests on the task window if possible, with just name of quest and what the various NPC's have told you, so it is not a spoiler, but reminds you what quests you are doing, what the last NPC told you, and will eventually&nbsp;be moved to the completed page. &nbsp;If all this is done, there probably wouldn't be any need to keep the journal?</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>5.&nbsp; Add more keys to the keyring.</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr>
<P>All no drop keys should be on the keyring. This will encourage more people to get keyed and visit these zones. Keys we know need adding are Paineel key, Hole key, All Sky keys, key to Aerin 'Dar's Lair (A Crystalline Globe). I'm sure there are many others.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>6.&nbsp; Increase bank space</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr>
<P>There is no longer enough space to keep everything, especially with the new tradeskill quests. The guild bank has 200 slots, perhaps the individual character's bank could be similar. If we had 200 slots, which could also hold containers with items in - but the container couldn't be opened until taken out of the bank, then we would no longer&nbsp;have to worry about space. Also, having this much space would allow us to organise our bank better, by for example only putting into a quest container items for that quest.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>7.&nbsp; Plane of Mischief Questing:</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr>
<DIV>1. Add Plane of Mischief cards to other named loot tables with a realistic drop rate. To be specific, making the drop rates about 75% of the time to drop "common" cards with a 50/50 chance to drop a "rare" card. One A White Stallion that spawns once every three days is a bit tedious for us questers since farmers will just farm this mob for the profit and sell the cards. Which detracts from the total fun of the original zone.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>2. Put back in the Knight cards please.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>3. Add in a card trader quest, where you can exchange:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4 common-&gt;1 uncommon</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4 uncommon=rare</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;Or have new quests that grant cards as rewards.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>4. Reinstate all original rewards with all the old cards.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#cccccc>www.planeofmischief.com/items.htm</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#cccccc></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>6.&nbsp; Add in a new armor set that is on par for the level of the zone with unique foci and crazy clickies. Perhaps even adding new color cards and new combinations to signify the rewards system&nbsp;increase &nbsp;that has occured since these quests were first implement.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>7. Make a use for Jester cards.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<P>This would create a new zone of fun and bring back what made the original PoM so fun. This would also add armor quests for groups in their mid 50's-early 60's on top of giving high levels unique clickies and other fun toys that they can enjoy.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>8.&nbsp; Fix broken tasks</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr>
<P>The following tasks are believed broken. Please see the seperate Broken Tasks forum for details. (Some might be fixed now, but it doesn't say so!)</P>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Lost in Petrification </STRONG>- Kill 10 sathirian protectors in DL.&nbsp; No such mob exists.</LI>
<LI><STRONG>Whirling Dervish</STRONG>, a short task.&nbsp;- Explore the iksar tower on the north-east island of Timorous Deep. Task does not update.</LI>
<LI><STRONG>Wooly Adventures </STRONG>- There is no blue compass line directing you to Droganoth Hrothgar in Everfrost Peaks.</LI>
<LI><STRONG>Scary Caves&nbsp;</STRONG>from Dreadlands - It says to explore the courtyard on the left just inside the castle. But it doesn't trigger unless you go to the courtyard on the right just inside the castle.&nbsp;</LI>
<LI><STRONG>Keeping Order </STRONG>- Exploring the entrance of the cave in Firiona Vie that leads to the dreadlands doesn't update the task.</LI>
<LI><STRONG>Keeping The Goblins Out </STRONG>from Lavastorm - The task does not update when you loot&nbsp;Cinder Goblin Toes.</LI>
<LI><STRONG>Drolvargs and Drachnids </STRONG>- Exploring the ruins in the center of the forest of the firiona vie zone doesn't update the task.</LI></UL></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr>
<P>Please see the forum about <A href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Quests&amp;message.id=345" target=_blank>broken or unfinished quests</A>, and respond.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;Factions Button</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr>
<P>Add a button to the inventory screen to list factions, ideally indicating how close you are to the next level.&nbsp;As there are so many factions, perhaps only list those that are not indiff, or perhaps have a factions window with a tab for each of the nine faction stages, from 'Ready to Attack' to 'Ally'.</P></BLOCKQUOTE></DIV></DIV>

<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr>
<P>There is no longer enough space to keep everything, especially with the new tradeskill quests. The guild bank has 200 slots, perhaps the individual character's bank could be similar. If we had 200 slots, which could also hold containers with items in - but the container couldn't be opened until taken out of the bank, then we would no longer&nbsp;have to worry about space. Also, having this much space would allow us to organise our bank better, by for example only putting into a quest container items for that quest.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>7.&nbsp; Plane of Mischief Questing:</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr>
<DIV>1. Add Plane of Mischief cards to other named loot tables with a realistic drop rate. To be specific, making the drop rates about 75% of the time to drop "common" cards with a 50/50 chance to drop a "rare" card. One A White Stallion that spawns once every three days is a bit tedious for us questers since farmers will just farm this mob for the profit and sell the cards. Which detracts from the total fun of the original zone.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>2. Put back in the Knight cards please.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>3. Add in a card trader quest, where you can exchange:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4 common-&gt;1 uncommon</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4 uncommon=rare</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;Or have new quests that grant cards as rewards.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>4. Reinstate all original rewards with all the old cards.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#cccccc>www.planeofmischief.com/items.htm</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#cccccc></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>6.&nbsp; Add in a new armor set that is on par for the level of the zone with unique foci and crazy clickies. Perhaps even adding new color cards and new combinations to signify the rewards system&nbsp;increase &nbsp;that has occured since these quests were first implement.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>7. Make a use for Jester cards.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<P>This would create a new zone of fun and bring back what made the original PoM so fun. This would also add armor quests for groups in their mid 50's-early 60's on top of giving high levels unique clickies and other fun toys that they can enjoy.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<DIV><FONT color=#ff0000>We currently do not have any development team feedback on this list - If you discover issues that have been solved in past updates please send me a PM.&nbsp; Thanks</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><STRONG>1.&nbsp; Add a tag "This item may be used in a Quest" onto items</STRONG></DIV>
<P></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr>
<P>This was done for tradeskills, so it should be possible to do the same for quests. I know some items might not be used in a quest at the moment, but will be in the future, but this is no different to adding new tradeskill recipees.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>2.&nbsp; Increase the group level range for&nbsp;LDoN&nbsp;adventures, to say 10 levels. <FONT color=#ff0000>DONE in the 4/12/05 update</FONT></STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr>
<P>It is increasingly difficult to get LDoN groups. Increasing the level range would help.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>3.&nbsp; Make LDoN&nbsp;Rescue and Assassin missions more desirable.</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr>
<P>Everybody only does Collect or Slaughter LDoN adventures. People need encouragement to request Rescue and Assassin types. Possible suggestions are more points for these types, or better loot - the assassinated mob currently doesn't drop anything, it should drop something to make people want to kill him.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>4.&nbsp; Update the new task window.</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr>
<P>Please update the Quest History tag so that it is sortable by Quest Title or Completion. Add totals for number of quests completed, and number of different quests completed. This will then give potential in the future for new titles when a number of different quests have been completed, quests that are only available if you've done a previous one, a quests leaderboard similar to LDoN adventures. Also put all quests on the task window if possible, with just name of quest and what the various NPC's have told you, so it is not a spoiler, but reminds you what quests you are doing, what the last NPC told you, and will eventually&nbsp;be moved to the completed page. &nbsp;If all this is done, there probably wouldn't be any need to keep the journal?</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
