<P>Doh... Forgot about the Melee Focus Effects like Cleave and such... guess they need to be more promenant since I forgot they even existed refer to Wycca's post as he is got it down... mainly made this post so that you had a Lower End Monk example too... not everyone finds it easy to max all stats as a monk without getting penalties for weight.</P>
<P>And you missed that in your list of things to look at</P>
<P><FONT color=#ff0099 size=7>WEIGHT </FONT>is crucial to a monk, so on all those items you have labeled "Beast, Druid, Monk" make them light as that Beasts and Druids don't care how much they way... but I got to maintain my girlish figure.</P>
