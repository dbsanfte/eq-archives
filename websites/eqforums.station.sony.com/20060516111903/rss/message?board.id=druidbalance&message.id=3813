    <title>Exodus fix request</title>
    <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=druidbalance&amp;message.id=3813</link>
    <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I consider Exodus to be one of the class defining druid AAs. Lately, every time I cast exodus I get a message that says it went off successfully and then I go link dead. When I get back into the game I'm dead, but my exodus is used. Are other people having this problem? &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Several occassions i have used exodus and it has saved my group but left me behind with the angry mobs.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Two other times i used exodus to escape a bad pull i then landed at my bind point dead then exodus went off and took me to succor point.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I assume this is related to the bug as well?&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;There was always a "random" chance for someone, including you, to be left behind but this was always very very small. It's happened to me less than 1 in 100 times. Recently this has gone up to maybe 1 in 10 give or take.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;What you describe is the bug. One night I hit exodus and everyone but me made it.... I was dead at bind. Since exodus was no longer up I loaded succor and 30 mins later guess what? Yep.... all made it but me dead at bind and I was not even agg and was at full health both times.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So it's not just exodus but also succor and some have suggested all evacs but I have not tried the others.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Some have suggested if you were low health or whatnot may have something to do with it but both times I was not even engaged with the mobs and was at full health. I may have had agg due to healing before the evac.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Both times I was tossed to desktop without even a crash warning. So whatever this bug is I bet it's a crash bug during the port and the game things I went LD so the others port while the mobs beat on me due to the LD and you die.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I have 0 LD issues and have a very stable DSL connection so that's not it. Something in the communication code triggers a crash of some sort.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Aside from that one night it's happened on others also - same circumstances.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;I can't figure out if you're trying to say there is no bug, or what.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I think we can all agree, that:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;If you hit the exodus button&amp;nbsp;+ you have some HP left + you get that zoning transition screen +&amp;nbsp;somehow during that "zoning"&amp;nbsp;you get dropped to the server selection screen +&amp;nbsp;log in only to find yourself dead = some sort of stupid Sony bug.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;If you click Exodus, and everyone else but you zones, you get no zoning transition screen, you're just still there in a bunch of mobs...&amp;nbsp; Ok THAT is working as intended, although I should point out that the description for Exodus does not include any text indicating there MAY be even the SLIGHTEST possibility of a failure.&amp;nbsp; It's not described as a super fast succor, it's describes as "click this, you go to the safe spot instantly", nothing else really, so "working as intended" I'm not so sure about.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>I don't make any claims that this is a solution as it feels more like luck than anything else. Just to be wierd, when we are going somewhere dangerous, we stand at the succor point before we head out and then cast our evac spell (the spellbook one, not the AA). We all reload and head out to the fight. The two times we have done this, our subsequent casts of Evac have gone off without a hitch, and noone has crashed out. The times we don't pre-Succor, someone always crashes. Again, I want to restate that this is probably not any bit of science, but rather superstition, so we are going to keep doing this until the bug is fixed. :)</description>

      <description>It's an interesting point. I'm so sick of dying instead of evaccing that I may try doing this also. I died last night in RSS with 100% health on me when I cast it. No mobs beating on me at all !! :(</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ffff&gt;Omg this has to be THE most annoying bug lately. I've had this happen to me many times over the past week or two. Each time I cast exodus it says I'm loading the zone I was in when I cast exodus (so i should be at succor point) but instead I end up dead at bind point. I've even done it .. come thru at the bind point only to see exodus casting still and I succor in guild lobby (my bind spot) Ive had it occur also that it says im loading current zone and then it crashes to server select.. come back after waiting for active char to drop and I'm dead. When it happens when I'm in a group.. the members are spared and dropped at succor point while for me .. says I'm loading the succored zone but I end up dead on the zone thru. I've had other members of my guild have the same probs.. both dru and wizzy exodus. UGH please Sony look into this bc exodus is serving no purpose in saving our behinds.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;Actually the problem is a result of some sort of bizarre bug with server/PC synchronization.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;My wife and I play together and I watched what happened when I got "succor f***ed":&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I&amp;nbsp;exodus at 80%&amp;nbsp;while&amp;nbsp;in Stillmoon temple, mobs are on me, but the succor DOES go off, my screen brings up the transitional zoning screen we all know and love, and I turn around to look at my wife's screen, she was out of group and a rogue, she does the rogue escape so no mobs on her but I notice I'm still standing there, getting beat on and die.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I turn around and wait...&amp;nbsp; and wait...&amp;nbsp; and wait...&amp;nbsp; Finally about 5 or 10 minutes later, I drop to server select and have to wait about 2 or 3 more minutes for the server to get synchronized and yep, I'm at my bind point.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I know it has to do specifically with zoning lag, and NOT a problem specific to exodus becuase, in the very same zone, almost same situation, a few hours later, I RUN to the zone, click, and get the zoning screen.&amp;nbsp; The wife clicks escape and watches, and sure enough, the mobs beat me down and I die.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Truly, what I suspect is that some **SMURF** programmer(s) at Sony didn't want to put forth effort into fixing user-to-server issues like this and they just, instead, cause people to go through this process where you're "LD'd" and dropped to server select.&amp;nbsp; They did this thinking that we'll just assume we were lagged, and "Oh well" forget about it.&amp;nbsp; Truthfully, until I was able to witness in game what happened to my character, I'd always thought it was a result of a burst of lag (even though my internet connection is 99% solid, I have megabits of upstream and downstream bandwidth) or some other network issue.&amp;nbsp; Rather than actually fix an issue they thought they'd hide behind lag.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by --MadHaxor-- on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;05-02-2005&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;04:26 PM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

I was 6boxing in Lavaspinner's lair (leveling an alt).  I'm biffing a mob, it was almost dead.  I see a train coming down the tunnel. I time a big nuke from my mage and a Succor Lavastorm from my druid to kill the mob for exp before Succor lands.  The mobs had just reached me when succor hits.  All 6 screens go into that neat freeze/jitter/ultra-slow-framerate Sony special indicating I'm zoning.  Thinking all was cool, I go grab a drink while EQ finishes loading Lavastorm.  Well 5 toons were at the Lavastorm portal.  My cleric is standing naked in PoK (bind point).  I was thinking "**SMURF**, was I NOT paying attention and the cleric got biffed into oblivion before succor landed?".  So I look at all the logs.  There were ZERO attack messages from the train.  There were ALL the "soandso steps into a portal" on all the screens.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is BS.  If my dru computer can tell the server to get me the hell out of there (succor) then what in God's green earth is the friggin server doing?  Hello!!!  If all my movement, etc is generated server side (client only extrapolates) then how the HELL did the cleric die to a million mini-bites during a succor?  Five toons (!!!!) made it out without a scratch.  And the cleric (furthest from the train actually) got squished with no messages, not even "you have died" or "you were slain by mob_00".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I /bugged it but I expect nothing to come of it given how long the problem has existed.</description>

      <description>There are posts all over the veteran boards about this. It's a real pain in the ass and SoE need to stand up and be counted here. Either sort it or say they can't, instead of ignoring literaly hundreds of posts by hundreds of people complaining about it!</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I had this problem just last night.&amp;nbsp; did /who all Ferrocy the whole time&amp;nbsp; on another pc and I was in the original zone that I his exodus in&amp;nbsp; until I was no longer online.&amp;nbsp; I then crashed to server select and when I went to character select screen I was in tranquility (bind point).&amp;nbsp; This makes me think that exodus went off before mob killed me, and that it was the exodus that killed me instead (like when you exodus in pvp).&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;per serveral threads over on the Vets board and on the Live board... this appears to be an ongoing problem that is also affecting succor, quick evac, gate and in some cases even clicking on port stones with 80% health getting the loading x zone screen and then ending up dead...&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;if i recall right there was a dev response that this was a known issue and was being looked into...&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
