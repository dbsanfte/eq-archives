    <description>&lt;div&gt;I went out and bought the new expansion today solely for the new tradeskill trophy.  I'm currently at 295 in smithing with Mastery 3 and already have a grandmaster smith hammer.  So I run around all over the place to complete the quest for the new smithing trophy.  Never mind that I had to redo a lot of the Luclin smithing quest because I had previously destroyed the luclinite mallet and anvil because they were no longer any use to me and taking up bank space; fortunately, I saved the bloodlink chainmail.  So I turn everything in and get the beginners trophy and the certificate.  I combine the certificate in a forge and what do I get?   A freaking expert's trophy with crappier stats than my old GM hammer, and it only summons 75% weight reduction bags versus the 100% bags my old GM hammer summoned.  Oh!  But I got a 3% increase in my smithing ability.  Big whoop!  I appreciate the effort to give us new and better trophies, but it would probably be a good idea to make sure the new trophy that is awarded at a much higher level actually is better than the old one.  Right now I'm pretty disappointed I let you guys sucker me again.  I can't wait for Vanguard.  &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So why the hell should we be rewarded a worse item than we turned in?   My god!  A lack of common sense must be a pre-requisite for employment with SOE?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Pay attention, please...&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;True, the Expert level trophy's bag (Expert Artisan Satchel) may be worse in that it only has 75% weight reduction instead of your old trophy's 100% wt reduction bags...BUT...this is TEMPORARY...&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The trophy will evolve to Master level, at which point you get the 100% wt reduction bags again, and the stats will match the old trophy's stats again.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Furthermore, once teh trophy evolves to the final GM level, the stats will be better and teh skill mod will be 15%.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Well, no $%&amp;amp;*, Maevenn.   How silly of me to expect that when I turn in a very expensive and useful item to complete a quest that is supposed to reward me with an upgrade, that I actually get an upgrade.   Someone here said that SOE couldn't allow a player to receive two permanet 100% weight reduction bags from the guy in the bazaar.  I say, why the hell not?  Hasn't the player done all the work and turned in items worth more than a second lousy permanent 100% w/r bag?  Never mind that at the exp level required to complete this quest, a player is more than likely to already have nothing but 100% wr bags or enough plat to easily go out and purchase them with pocket change.  Hell, I could care less about a second permanent 100% bag.  What jerks my chain is the loss of the no-rent 100% bags.  And I can definitely see no reason why the new trophy can't, just as the old trophy, summon 100% no-rent bags even if the permanent one  is only 75%.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But that still doesn't explain why the stats are lower on the new trophy other than SOE, once again, doing whatever they can to screw the player whenever they can.  And never mind that with my mastery 3, the new trophy gives me a whopping one and a half percent improvement to my skill level -- er, well, actually it gives me no improvement, does it, because SOE capped all the stuff worth making at a 60% success rate and didn't bother to tell us.  Hell, with mastery 3 and no skill whatsoever, we have a 50% chance of success, so why even bother trying to get to 300. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Perhaps It's not me that hasn't been paying attention.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Sometimes reading these threads makes me concerned over the future of the human race...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Get over it.  The new trophies are a great idea and something we've been asking to have done for years.  If you really, really desperately need another 100% WR temp bag instead of 75%, give a mage 10pp and he can summon you one.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;There is just no pleasing some people. Expert &amp;lt; Master level, thus teh newexpert trophy's stats are slightly inferior. Just deal with it.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Don't do the trophy task until you get to 300 and keep your old trophy, if this matters so much to you.&amp;nbsp; At 300, do the task and hand in teh old trophy, and you won't "lose" anything in the exchange.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>Or re-make the old GM-smith trophy, I mean it's like 2.2k in Velium Bars and maybe 2k in gems (counting 4 rubies for the purified mana)?  Heck you probably spend that much just getting a skillup at 262+ smithing.  Or if you farm a lot for skill ups just sell an hour's worth of farmed drops, same deal.  4k should *not* be hard to come across for a 295 smith.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;i do agree that the Item that you have to turn in to get your trophy is better then what you get heh&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;luckily i did not actually loose out on my 100% bags because i had other trohies in other skills, so i made sure that i dinged the one i made befor i started another trophie upgrade(downgrade) so that i would still have the no rent 100% bags, wich any TS person thanks god for every single day they play heh&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;i can see how someone who only worked one path would find this extreemly disapointing as they would indeed &amp;quot;loose&amp;quot; what they have earned and be forced to &amp;quot;earn&amp;quot; it  a second time heh&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;i understand the why , casue you get a perma 100% bag that is not lore to the other TS Bag that you get from an orig trophie, but still, maybe there can be a path figgured out that will allow peeps to keep their stats and 100% bags, and not have them gaining the perma bag till an apropriate skill level, even a minor quest of something instead of a simple Turn in, or even if you get an essence, you have to combine it with your current trophy to gain the perma bag that you are actually eligable for?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;a lot of us made our Trophies back when teh cap was 252 with a mod, and lord knows some of us ahd some terrible luck the point it took us quite a bit of farming and or pp to finaly get our Trophy, at least to me there was a sence of pride in accomplishment when i made my first one and even when i made my last one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;just something to  think about why peeps are upset with this particular feature&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;i love the mod ups, i will never have to see blob1 again !!!!!! (100kills, lost roll all 4 times i saw the drop&amp;gt;&amp;lt;)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trophy is an evolving item.  It will get better as you skill up more.  At 295, it should have something like 90% of the XP into the next level.  At level 6, it will have better stats, a 12% mod and summon 100% bags.  Fully evolved, it has even better stats, and a 15% mod. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description>
