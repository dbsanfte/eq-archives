<P><FONT face="Tahoma, Helvetica, Verdana, Arial, sans-serif" size=2>This is an excerpt from a work in progress.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Tahoma, Helvetica, Verdana, Arial, sans-serif" size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
<P><FONT face="Tahoma, Helvetica, Verdana, Arial, sans-serif" size=2>NERIAK..... <BR><BR>Her scream broke the silence in the dark room that she slept in. She quickly sat up. Her breaths came in gasps as she hugged herself in an attempt to calm down. Her nightmares came every night and no matter what she did she could not rid herself of them. She was a young Tier' Dal, barely into adult hood but the suffering that reflected in her silver white eyes mirrored that of a Dark Elf twice her age. <BR>She let the sheets fall from her naked body and reached her arm behind her back. There she felt the scars from years of lashings. The scars left from a slave masters whip. Tears began to stream down her face as she reached for a bottle on the ground. Alcohol was the only thing she found that would comfort her. It was the only thing that helped to blur the memories of her troubled past. She drained what was left in the bottle and then got out of the cot. The torchlight from the hallway filtered into her room and softly bathed her body in a dim glow. The stone floor was cold to her feet and she shivered slightly. Her long raven black hair hung down to the small of her back as she reached for her clothes draped over a chair in the corner of her room. She quickly dressed herself and then lifted her Brigand's chestplate over her head. The black chain glistened in the light and her pale blue skin could be seen from between its links. She then fastened her daggers and coin purse to her belt, buckled the last clasp of her leggings and slipped on her boots. This had been a nightly occurrence ever since she arrived in Neriak a few years ago. <BR>She walked alone in the shadows through the tunnels of the Dark Elf city careful not to be caught in the light of the torches that scattered the walls. She cast no shadows and often glanced about ever weary of her surroundings. Her destination was the Blind Fish, her favorite place to spend these lonely hours of the night. <BR>The bar tender briefly looked up as the door to his establishment opened and the raven-haired Tier' Dal walked in. He did not say a word; he simply turned, grabbed a mug and filled it with a short ale. She sat down at the farthest end of the bar and quietly laid two gold pieces on the counter-top. He placed the ale in front of her, took the gold pieces and walked away leaving her to her poison. She sat quietly, drinking her ale and staring through the plane glass window into the underground river beyond. She was drinking her third mug when the door opened again. <BR><BR>"Couldn't sleep again?" Natari asked. <BR>"No." she replied. <BR>"Neither could I. We are a sad pair you and I." he said. <BR>"I will continue to have restless nights as long as the one responsible for them still breathes!" she stated coldly. <BR>"This again? Jatara my dear, we do not even know her name. This blind hatred will be your ruin." Natari warned. <BR>"Perhaps, but so be it." Jatara mumbled. <BR><BR>He let her sit there for a while. He was dressed in a nightshirt and leather leggings. His white hair hung in a tail behind his head. His hands were calloused and worn. He was about her age and like her years of distress could be seen in his eyes. Finally he reached out and brushed the hair from her brow with his hand. She stopped drinking momentarily as he touched her. Natari was the only man that she would ever allow to touch her. They were not related by blood, but she considered him a brother and the only thing close to family that she had left. <BR>"This is not good for you. What happened to the little girl that I once knew who laughed and sang while playing in the fields around the crumbling walls of the Outpost?" he asked. <BR>"She died in the Frontier Mountains along side our parents. The goblins of Nurga saw to it that she had no song left to sing." She replied. <BR><BR>A few more moments passed. <BR><BR>"I remember the glint of her armor in the afternoon sun. I can remember the violet cloak with the silver star and crescent blade showing like the moon in a darkened sky across her back and I remember her auburn hair flowing in the wind sweeping through the valley. I will one day find her and then and only then will my nightmares end. One way or the other." she said as she drained the last of her ale from her mug and then slammed it onto the counter. The bar tender glanced up but quickly looked away when Natari glared at him. <BR><BR>"You exhibit the hate of a stout follower of Innoruk himself." Natari said as he turned back towards her. <BR><BR>She looked at him and held his gaze. He could see the hate and pain burning in her silvery eyes. It scared him that one so young could hate this much but he understood. She said nothing as she looked upon him. After a few moments the flame in her eyes subsided and Natari for a moment saw a glimpse of the little girl that he had once known. She smiled and gently brought her hand to his face. <BR><BR>"You should take a wife Natari and spawn children. Lots of them!" she laughed. <BR>Natari grimaced, "I don't think so." <BR><BR>She smiled again as she gave him a playful slap on the cheek. <BR><BR>"How go the shipyards?" she asked. <BR>"With the plans that you brought back from Ak' Anon the ships should soon be completed. You do realize that your ability to bring Neriak those plans has not gone unnoticed by those that rule here. You are already famous and your name is being mentioned in all the pubs." <BR>She chuckled, "Gnomes are such ridiculous creatures. They do little to safeguard their most prized possessions." <BR>"Still an amazing feat if you ask me," Natari said, "but it is a feat that will not escape the attention of our enemies for long. There are rumors that your name is also on the lists of bounty hunters and mercenaries the like." <BR>"BAH!" she grunted. <BR>Natari laughed. <BR><BR>They had been friends all of their lives but the years spent in the mines of Nurga had drove them together in ways that neither of them could explain. They had endured constant torture and abuse while laboring as slaves. It had seemed an eternity. They never once were allowed to venture outside the mines. Most of their time was spent in total darkeness. There were other slaves around them but they tried their best to keep to themselves. Talking amongst the slaves was not permitted and carried a heavy punishment if they were caught. Once Natari had blurted out Jatara's name and was beaten nearly to death by the goblin that drove them. He, like Jatara bore the mark of the master's whip. They had learned to communicate with each other without speaking. They could often tell what the other was thinking and feeling with just a look. Neither of them thought that they would ever be free again. Then one day a group of explorers entered the mine in search of its riches. The goblins fled after a number of them died trying to turn the explorers away. Natari remembered being brought to the surface after the strangers set them free. He had to hide his face from the sun. Ever since that day he spent every moment he could basking in its warmth. Once he arrived in Neriak he swore an alligence to Innoruk and followed the ways of his father. The ways of the Shadow Knight. Natari had learned hate, but unlike Jatara he had also been taught how to harness it. Jatara, on the other hand still preferred to live and move in the shadows. She had joined the rogue guild. Her skills and abilities learned in the mines were sharpened and perfected in a very short time. The rogue guild masters had been very impressed with her and now she was already a master thief. He smiled as he thought of her accomplishments even when compared to his own. But with all she had done she was still troubled. The rage of their parent's death and the horrors that they had seen while they were in bondage was all that dominated her thoughts. He knew that one day it would be her undoing. <BR><BR>He looked at her again, "Why don't you come to the shipyards with me today and see for yourself the fruits of your work?" he asked. <BR>Jatara dropped a fresh mug of ale from her lips, licked the edges of her mouth and then placed the mug back onto the counter. She thought for a moment, "Maybe I shall. Besides, I should see what the gossip in Freeport is about. I am certain that the business of the Empire within the deserts of Ro has caught someones eye."</FONT></P></DIV>

<DIV align=center>The Story of Brotherly Love</DIV>
<DIV align=center>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV align=center>-Chapter One-</DIV>
<DIV align=center>"Origins"</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The air was cool...</DIV>
<DIV>The leaves were burnt with orange and red, as the sun peeked through the forest and began to melt the first frost of autom...</DIV>
<DIV>Resting on a fallen log outside of the city of Felwith, a paladin was meditating. He could hear the wind breathing through the trees, the flickering wings of bats and the patter of the eight-legged creatures that roam the woods of Greater Faydark. This paladin was a mighty warrior whose deed were not known! No, not because they were imaginary, but because of his great compassion and kindness to his fellow Norrathians this paladin used his skills to heal the hurt of any who came his way...and done such actions in secret!</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>In the secluded section of the woods, the paladin's ears began to block out the surroundings until a pierecing scream, rustling leaves, and the clangy sound of metal meeting metal...the Paladin sprang off of the log like a cat and saw a group of crushbone orcs circling a mound laying on the ground. The pile did not seem to be moving though he could tell it had life once. As the paladin raced to the orcs with sword and shield in hand he began to fight. Brandishing his sword with the skill of 10 warriors he struck down the orcs with little resistence. He stood over the prize the orcs had claimed. His breath was sending a heavy white cloud after the fight. And through the haze of battle the mound moved just enough to reveal a face. The face of an angel...</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The paladin quickly began to mend her wounds, he lifted his hands to cast a healing spell which revived the maiden he had found. She sat up and snizzed! The paladin laughed at her greenhand reaction to his healing spell, but the young woman sat there starring deep into the eyes of her rescuer.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>"Hmmm, a human out in the woods of Felwith accompanied by an Orc welcoming committee? To what do I owe this pleasure?" asked the paladin.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Uh...to whom do you owe this pleasure would be a better question."</DIV>
<DIV>"OK, to whom do I owe this pleasure?" the paladin laughed.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My name is Angelicia, my father is a bard gu...in uh another town."</DIV>
<DIV>"I see! Nice to Meet you Angelicia daughter of the Bard named 'Gu' from the town named another..."</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are very kind Stranger son of None from the city on the Log, and I thank you for not asking question of which you need not to know the answer too!"</DIV>
<DIV>"Forgive me," the paladin said "My name is Sir Epus son of Dwirlstas from the city of Felwith."</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>What a strange way for a human and a high elf to meet. But what was stranger is that not of their meeting, but of their gaining, a gaining in love. As their stories became clearer to one anther, Epus was to marry a Wood elf so that his father could gain some prominice in Kelthin, and Angelicia was only to marry a human bard. So, one night the two found each other under a moon and had a secret wedding. When Epus' father found out about the wedding, he was furious. So, he went to his sons house only to find his new daughter-in-law. She was now pregnant, and Epus' father&nbsp; was not about to allow his plans for his son be ruined. So, he bound up Angelicia and sold her to some Troll slave master. When Edpus came home and saw his home completely devestated, he was crushed. He saw blood steins in his wife's room with a symbol of Clancrushbone.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Epus now reluctantly married the wood elf his father wished, but he was driven made with revenge, his madness became worse and worse until everyday he would raid Emperor Crush's kingdom. One day he left and never came back. Epus' father became more and more corrupt as the poison of his deceit spread through his body. With the memories of his son's sadness and the corruption he brought in all his doings, he was eventually run out of Greater Faydark because he had crossed from a Holy Paladin to an Unholy Shadow Knight.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Epus was left with his Elf Son Named Niloiv which by fate became a bard and grew up in Kelthin. And unknown to Niloiv, he had a brother, a half-elf brother Named Edepus. Edepus became a paladin because of the stories that his mother told him while they grew up in a slave camp, until Edepus grew in strength and escaped after his mother died in the claws of the cruel slave master.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>One day in the forest of Felwith a wood elf bard and a half elf paladin meet and then ...</DIV>

<P>Rain poured down on the mountains as lightning flashed in the sky. Black clouds filled the sky and made the scene look more gloomy. Stomp trudged through the rain returning home to Kaladim after a recent venture to the Butcherblock coast to exterminate a goblin problem. "I hate the weather." He said with a mixture of gloom and anger to nobody other than possibly the weather itself. The entrance to Kaladim was just over the next hill. Stomp summited the hill and looked out at the grand city of Dwarves. "Finally, I'm home. I jus' hope the ol' boys are waitin' for me at the tavern." a smile spread across his face as he remembered the times he had been through with his friends. "Aye, 'twill be good to see 'em again." Stomp ran down the hill almost as if infused with the energy of his childhood. The caverns of Kaladim were exactly as they were when he left. Stomp took in a deep breath of the sweet smelling air. It smelled of mining, no better smell in the world for a Dwarf. The lantern outside the tavern was lit just as it always was. Stomp pushed open the door and saw what he never expected to see. Sitting at the bar with an ale in hand was a Dwarf in brown leather. Miners usually wore this kind of leather clothing. His face was blackened from mining all day. Stomp's childhood friend Gordolaf. "Gordolaf, ye Ogre, I 'aven't seen ye in too long!" Gordolaf turned to look at Stomp. A smile slowly crept across his face "Well I'll be the son o' an Orc, nice ter see ye Stomp!" Stomp took the stool next to Gordolaf. "Barkeep! I could use an ale over 'ere!" Stomp told the barkeep. The barkeep filled a mug full to the brim of dwarven ale. Stomp pulled out a gold piece and set it on the bar. Stomp turned to Gordolaf "What 'ave ye been doin'?" Stomp asked curiously. Gordolaf took a swig of ale before answering. "I 'ave been minin' ter put food on the table. I love minin' but then I guess every Dwarf does." Gordolaf and Stomp chuckled. <I>Its nice to talk to Gordolaf again </I>Stomp thought to himself. Stomp drank a gulp of ale. Stomp let out a sigh that seemed as though it had been inside him forever. It had been a long time since he had a good ale. "So where 'ave ye been Stomp? I 'aven't seen ye in Kaladim." Gordolaf asked casually. "I been out huntin Aqua Goblins nearby the Butcherblock docks. Special assignment from the Storm Guard. Its been horrible chasin' after every rumor o' Goblin activity. Finally we caught them Goblin bandits and just when we catch 'em, a new group pops up." Stomp shook his head. Gordolaf gave a hearty laugh. "Sounds more exciting that what I've been doin' " Stomp looked around, the memories of the many good times spent in this very bar with Gordolaf flooded his thoughts. "Gordolaf, ye wanna go on my guard rounds with me?" Stomp asked getting up from the bar. Gordolaf nodded and the left the tunnels of Kaladim. "Don' be tellin' many folks that I said this, but, I missed ye Gordolaf." Gordolaf smiled and slugged Stomp in the shoulder. "I missed ye too friend." The two dwarves looked out as the rain began to let up and the sun broke through the clouds once more. Gordolaf and Stomp walked out into the mountains. Two friends, reunited at long last.</P></FONT></DIV>

<P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt" align=left><SPAN class=postbody1><SPAN **SMURF**"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"><FONT color=#ffffff>The danger was there!! but few people in Norrath truly realised the imminent extinction of numerous species of colourful fauna and flora due to the over hunting and killing by the various races. In their quest for riches and experience, adventurers had gone to the four corners of the world to seek out weird and wonderful creations only to first stand in awe at their diversity and in the next instant whip out their huge axe or sword and proceed to chop it into tiny pieces. Now and again an over confident warrior or mage would attempt a kill and succumb to it's ferocity only to find themselves standing back in POK hiding their nakedness to the masses, but the races' quest for advancement was unrelenting and the animals slowly disappeared. </FONT></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN **SMURF**"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"><BR><BR><FONT color=#ffffff><SPAN class=postbody1>A few brave souls in Norrath realised that the worlds animals were at risk and so various action groups were formed. The most notable and extremists being the Droods In action Conserving Kreatures Survivability who carried out several terrorist attacks against the Shaman Potion Labs Inc resulting in high profile court cases and executions. However some groups decided education was the key, and so took it upon themselves to take out parties of school children to visit these endangered species to appreciate them and teach about their rarerity. </SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN class=postbody1>G and X Tours were one of these groups who specialised in taking young school children to dangerous environments and showing the animals in their real habitat. Rut's our hero knew nothing of these groups until his children brought home an information leaflet from Surefall Juniors declaring a school trip being organised and requesting parental help with crowd control and trash clearing. Well Rut's wasn't too keen at first hoping to be able to go down to the pool hall on the day it was arranged but after much berating from the wife, he finally gave in and agreed to go and help. </SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN class=postbody1>The day dawned and with sandwiches packed in Rut's Grandmaster Haversack for the kiddies they trooped to POK to meet up at the collection point. At the Overthere Stone with 45 screaming children running around, annoying the local guards, as well as attempting to pickpocket the resident Cliff Golem, Rut's felt something was wrong as he looked about and noticed he was the only parent present. Feeling a bit gullible he waited until the trip organisers appeared. The tour guide was a cleric called Gwynnie with her able partner Xazel who clearly was the trash disposer. Rut's suddenly was overcome with a sense of deja-vu feeling that he somehow knew these people from somewhere before?? Xazel came over to Rut's and looked him quickly up and down..... </SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN class=postbody1>"Ahh so your the help today hmmmm, a Ranger - be back in a minute, two ticks" </SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN class=postbody1>Rut's saw him quickly rush back to Gwynnie and whisper in her ear causing her to grimace and then discreetly reach into her backpack and pull out her Rez spell book. Xaz came back over to Rut's and they started to compare battle scars. </SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN class=postbody1>With a quick introduction the party moved to it's first stop of the day to go see the Bloated Drogan Spider, located deep in the Temple of Droga. With Xaz efficiently clearing the troublesome gobbos and Rut's desperately not trying to embarrass his children by shooting an arrow into his backside, they fought their way down into the mountain. Finally they reached the creature and Gwynnie launched into a fine prose of its natural habitat and how it lived. Upon looking at the manky fur bitten creature Rut's wondered what all the fuss was about, as it appeared to be quite a dejected specimen. The talk finished and all filed out before the re-popping Gobbos appeared and Rut's wandered over to take a closer look. Still not suitably impressed with a snort of derision Rut's turned to follow the others.... </SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN class=postbody1>" Hmmmphhh, what do you mean hmmmphh!! Do you bleeding know that I am famous being the last of my kind, I deserve more respect than that. Sheesh, your just a common Ranger!! If anybody was really in danger of extinction it'd be you, you darn speed bump!!" </SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN class=postbody1>Well that just didn't go down well with our hero, furious as having wasted his day traipsing after screaming kids he lost it. Checking the last kid had turned the corner Rut's located an old Droga Lasso hanging up.<SPAN **SMURF**"mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Grabbing it he then decided to show the overgrown arachnid the true meaning of extinction. With it's eight eyes popping out of its head Rut's finally strangled the life out of it. Guiltily looking around, Rut's pocketed the lasso and caught up with the others. </SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN class=postbody1>The next exhibit was a Leprous Chokidai found in Chardok B. Now getting here was a major pain in the butt with not only having to clear a variety of trash but also having to track down numerous school children that kept running off down the maze of corridors. Finally arriving at the site Rut's looked into an artificial pen housing several domesticated Chok's, however at the back was one that appeared different in some way. Peering through the gloom Rut's looked closer and realised how its got its name as it was a hideous thing with its limbs rotting off and sporting numerous deformities due to it's leprosy. After the talk by Gwynnie the party began to march out and Rut's approached the creature. Strangely it began to mewl in a loving kind of way sensing it was to be pet or fed, but Rut's looking at the poor thing decided oblivion was it's best bet. Whipping out the lasso he again, as with the spider, choked it to death. Just before it drifted away, the Chokidai looked up into Rut's eyes and made a final heart rendering mewl that almost sounded to Rut like "thank you". </SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN class=postbody1>Next stop, Cazic Thule and some green lizard bashing. Ensuring all the children had donned their fully protective clothing and wellies, the group moved deep into the sewers until finally a sickly Mosquito was found. Now Rut's looking at this creature realised was well ill, with it constantly coughing and spluttering and doubling up in pain. Again after the talk Rut's approached the pale mozzie. </SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN class=postbody1>"Yo dude, you ok? You don't look to good!!" </SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN class=postbody1>The mozzie looked up, "Eh me? Yeh couldn't be better mate, fit as a fiddle me. You think I'm really ill, no way dude but this con got me prestigious standing mate as well as a 10% kick back on all royalties from promotions" </SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN class=postbody1>A veil of red drifted down over Rut's. Seeing a discarded heavy set net drifting in the filth below, Rut's picked it up and unglamorously beat the mosquito to death. As the creatures body crumpled to the floor Rut's whispered to it, "How do you feel now mate!!" and quickly hurried off to find the others. </SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN class=postbody1>It was lunchtime and the whole group stopped to eat their soggy sandwiches and lukewarm lemonade. It was announced that the second half of their tour was going to involve highly dangerous and KOS creatures in more extreme environments. For this reason Gwynnies and Xaz's partner appeared Minwenu (a druid surprisingly). </SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN class=postbody1>Well the afternoon to Rut's was a blur of visits to Western Wastes, Veksar, and The Deep. Keeping in with tradition of the morning, Norrath mourned the loss of 3 more extinct species these being the Neurological Huntress, Asteatotic Highborn and an Ancient Thought Horror. All dispatched with the usual efficiency of a cold killing machine that can only be shown by a Ranger!! </SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN class=postbody1>At the end of the day, the mass of tired but still obnoxious school children had wound our hero up so much they had been deposited not in the designated pick-up spot for their parents, but dropped off at the entrance of an old tunnel in Paineel, and told to keep walking past the skeleton guards and heading straight over an old and mystical invisible bridge that crossed a wide chasm known as The Hole.</SPAN></FONT></SPAN></P>

			<DIV>Deep in the&nbsp;Plane of Hate&nbsp;stood a large scaled figure surrounded by the corpses of an entire raid force of Dark Elves.&nbsp; The Dwarf from a few feet away was&nbsp;spying through the next room. He looked up at the figure. "Bah, you stupid Iksar why didn't ye leave me some&nbsp;Dark Elves&nbsp;to sink me&nbsp;daggers in." The Iksar with gleaming red and blue blades stared down. "You ugly Dwarf we havent the time for your nonsence." The Dwarf looked at him with and odd faceand changed the subject. "The blades of Sithius the Scale and Kron the Killer what an odd pair we are ye must admit." The Iksar smiled. "We are not odd just merely unique" The Dwarf laughed and they trudged on through the&nbsp;darkness. The pair had met long ago in their youth in the Paludal Caverns. The Dwarf rogue had been ambushed by an entire camp of Recondites. The Iksar warrior came to his aid. His eyes gleamed red as he had forgotten to even draw his blade. He sunk his claws into every last one of them tearing the flesh from their bodies. The Dwarf saw the moment to strike and stabbed as many as his arms and daggers would let him. They arose from the battle looking at what had just happened. From then on they traveled together as an odd pair indeed. Now they had ended up deep in the Plane of Hate fighting for riches. The Dwarf looked in through the last room. "Aye he's their Innoruuk is standing in front of his throne." The Iksar made an insane smile, but didn't speak. He drew forth his bow and an arrow. He fired the arrow into Innoruuk's gut and charged him with his blades. The Dwarf slid behind the god of hate prepared to paralyze him. Sithius and Innoruuk traded swings thousands of times both of them relentlessly attacking. The Dwarf was about to stab into him, but was thrown back by the god's spells. The Iksat took a blade across the midsection tearing through his top layer of scales. He traded back by making a gaping hole in his enemies gut. The Dwarf laid unconcious. The god was a force to be reckoned with swinging with such hate. Sithius disarmed Innoruuk of his blade and lost one of his own in the process. Innoruuk seeing his end picked up the Dwarf. "If you come one step closer I will kill this little creature." The Iksar stopped. "Put him down your fighting me, or are you scared of a mortal?" The god rolled his eyes, but his fear still showed through. "Put down your blade." The Iksar did as he said. Just as this happened the Dwarf awoke.&nbsp;He reached to his belt and grabbed out a blade. He sunk it into Innoruuk's wrist causing him to be dropped. The Iksar quickly grabbed his blades and advanced on his weakened foe. Innoruuk would not die without atleast killing one of them. He summoned all of his life force into one spell and aimed toward the Dwarf that slit his wrist. Just as he fired Sithius pushed him out of the way and was hit by the blast. Upon the floor laid a dead god and a dead warrior. The dwarf quickly stood up. "Why did ye do it? Your truly a confusing individual." The Iksar stood up with broken bones. "Haha, because I knew I could live through it." The Dwarf shed a few tears of joy. "You're hurt I should get you out of here quickly." The Iksar with only one able leg and arm looked at the Dwarf puzzled. "Well..... I guess I will have to walk on one of my blades." The Dwarf laughed. "Aye, because I'm not carrying your oversized body" They both laughed and walked to where they came in. A Wizard awaited them. "Did you succeed?" The Dwarf looked at him rolling his eyes. "Would we be alive if we didn't?" The Wizard laughed and teleported them back to Norrath</DIV>

<P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><FONT color=#ffffff size=2>&nbsp; Xariah looked up at me and asked, “Can you get me to them? If you can get me there, I can get us all out safely.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT color=#ffffff size=2>Our friends had sent out an emergency distress call.&nbsp; We didn't know what was wrong, or what had happened, but we were certainly going to try to help them.&nbsp;</FONT><FONT color=#ffffff size=2>I smiled at Xariah, trying to display a confidence I didn’t feel. “Sounds like a plan.”&nbsp;</FONT><FONT color=#ffffff size=2>We sat on a flat rock and quickly discussed a few different scenario’s and strategies. Finally, we both pull out our notebooks and refreshed our memories on a couple of spells that would probably be needed.<SPAN **SMURF**"mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Once that was done, we moved towards the entrance to Lord Mistmoore’s Realm.&nbsp;</FONT><FONT color=#ffffff size=2>“Ready?” I whispered to Xariah.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT color=#ffffff size=2>She nodded nervously.<SPAN **SMURF**"mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I concentrated and cast two spells, the first to refresh our Spirit of the Wolf, and the second, a spell that would enhance our vision and allow us to see one another once we where invisible.<SPAN **SMURF**"mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Once that was done, Xariah began her spell and we vanished.</FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><FONT color=#ffffff size=2>&nbsp; The plan was actually very simple, and if successful, we’d all be in PoK in about 5 minutes. We both took a deep breath and began to sprint towards the depths of the valley.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT color=#ffffff size=2>I heard Xariah gasp as we turned the first corner and spotted about 9 or 10 Trueborn guarding the lake area.<SPAN **SMURF**"mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>To her credit, she never faltered and continued running at full speed right beside me.<SPAN **SMURF**"mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We were trying to reach what I called the Hallway, which was actually a gorge through the cliff towards a graveyard area.<SPAN **SMURF**"mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>If my memory was correct, there was a relatively safe spot about halfway between the front lake area and the graveyard where I wanted to stop and reconnoiter.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT color=#ffffff size=2>We reached the alcove I remembered, we squeezed in to the tight space together. While I quickly reached out with my tracking sense, Xariah panted, trying to catch her breath.&nbsp;Even though we where surrounded on all sides by very powerful Trueborn, I could still sense Drogma’s party. They didn’t seem to have moved.&nbsp;</FONT><FONT color=#ffffff size=2>I looked down at Xariah and she nodded. Our next hurtle would be the gate at the graveyard. We needed to get through the gate and behind the tomb.<SPAN **SMURF**"mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>There was a secret passage there that would bring us the back way to the castle and right to the jail area where I sensed our friends were being held.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT color=#ffffff size=2>Coming out of the gorge was a harrowing experience. There were 4 Trueborn there.<SPAN **SMURF**"mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Two guarded the graveyard gate and the other two guarded the tunnel to the Ancille’s valley which led to the front of the castle.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT color=#ffffff size=2>We slowed to a walk to both control our breathing and quiet our footsteps. We silently approached the gate.<SPAN **SMURF**"mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The two guards at the gate were involved in idle chit chat with each other. I very slowly and silently opened the gate and we slipped through.<SPAN **SMURF**"mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I left it unlatched to avoid the tell-tale sound it would make when being re-latched.<SPAN **SMURF**"mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>There were four more Trueborn in the graveyard. We immediately moved to the left and were working our way towards the tomb, when I heard the squeak of the gate.<SPAN **SMURF**"mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I glanced back to see that one of the guards was now standing on the graveyard side of the gate.<SPAN **SMURF**"mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>To make matters worse, he was staring right at me, having obviously seen through my camouflage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT color=#ffffff size=2>As he opened his mouth to shout a warning, I sprang into action. My arrow took flight the same instant the cry left his lips.<SPAN **SMURF**"mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The arrow took him in the throat, killing him instantly and pinning him against the gate. His cry alerted not only his fellow guards, but the Trueborn in the graveyard as well.&nbsp;</FONT><FONT color=#ffffff size=2>The guards outside the gate immediately began trying to rush into the graveyard, but were struggling to free the gate.<SPAN **SMURF**"mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>My arrow, having been fired with the skill of my Trueshot Discipline, had bitten deeply into the soft metal of the gate and the dead guard was effectively a latch, keeping the gate from swinging open. Still, we had only seconds to act.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT color=#ffffff size=2>The Trueborn in the graveyard were already running for us. “GFlux!!” I screamed as I began casting one of the spells I’d prepared for just such an emergency.<SPAN **SMURF**"mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Lightning erupted all around us.<SPAN **SMURF**"mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The damage it did to the Trueborn was negligible, but it succeeded in getting their attention. All four turned on me at once, leaving Xariah to begin casting her spell.&nbsp;</FONT><FONT color=#ffffff size=2>I drew my swords. Earthcaller was in my left hand and Swiftwind in my right. I parried the blow from the first Trueborn to reach me, pivoted and slashed the second one across the face while kicking the third square in the chest.<SPAN **SMURF**"mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I felt magic tearing at me, trying to destroy me.<SPAN **SMURF**"mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>My blood felt as though it were boiling in my veins.<SPAN **SMURF**"mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I felt a flash of pain as a dagger slashed deeply into my side. I brought Earthcaller around and fire erupted from it as it made contact with the blade of the Trueborn, engulfing him in flame.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT color=#ffffff size=2>Suddenly a tremendous force erupted from Xariah and the Trueborn were thrown high into the air and away from us.&nbsp;</FONT><FONT color=#ffffff><FONT size=2>I pushed Xariah ahead of me and we sprinted for the tomb. Once behind the small building she stopped, looking confused. <SPAN **SMURF**"mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</SPAN>She didn’t know where the secret entrance was located I realized.<SPAN **SMURF**"mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I grabbed her hand and ran right into the wall and through the rock, an illusion that was the entrance.<SPAN **SMURF**"mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Once inside I didn’t hesitate, but ran right through another illusion that led from the back of the small room and darted up the stairs that led up through the cliff to the castle.<SPAN **SMURF**"mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></FONT></FONT><FONT color=#ffffff size=2>I could hear noise behind us. The Trueborn were coming up the stairs. We stopped at the top of the stairs, just outside of the jail.<SPAN **SMURF**"mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Xariah began casting a protective spell on me, Ward of Calrena. I looked down the stairs to see a huge Imp followed closely by the Trueborn. I waited until the Imp was at the narrowest portion of the stairwell and rooted him in place.<SPAN **SMURF**"mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>He howled in frustration and began tearing at the roots and vines that held him in place.<SPAN **SMURF**"mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>One of the Trueborn reached down to help free the Imp, only to have his head removed by the enraged Imp.<SPAN **SMURF**"mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Xariah cast a Supernova spell at the Imp and the entire stairwell was filled with fire.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT color=#ffffff size=2>While the Trueborn were blocked from coming up the stairs, Xariah and I burst into the jail. Three guards leapt to their feet as we entered the room.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT color=#ffffff size=2>As I came through the door, I yanked a lever that I knew would open all the cell doors, and then engaged the guards. Xariah ran to the cell holding our friends.<SPAN **SMURF**"mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The ward was doing it’s job absorbing much of the damage I was taking from the guards, but it was beginning to fade. I moved and positioned myself just outside the door of the cell containing my friends. My blades flashed as I parried and struck at the guards. There was little I could do other than try to stay alive until Xariah activated the port.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT color=#ffffff size=2>I could hear Xariah’s incantation and wondered how long it would take her to finish the spell. I hoped I could hold them long enough. </FONT></P>

The second guard landed a thunderous blow to my head with his mace, ripping my helmet from my head and stunning me. I could feel the warmth as blood flowed down the side of my face. Dizzy and unable to see clearly through the blood, I instinctively assumed a defensive posture. I saw&nbsp;the blur of the first guard to my left and parried with Earthcaller.<SPAN **SMURF**"mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The blow was so heavy Earthcaller was ripped from my hand, sailing across the room and clattering to the floor.<SPAN **SMURF**"mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I brought Swiftwind to bear, thrusting viciously at the third guard, and passing my remaining weapon through my enemy’s heart.<SPAN **SMURF**"mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>At nearly the same instant, the heavy mace of the second guard caught me in the side spinning me around.<SPAN **SMURF**"mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I heard the sickening crunch of my ribs shattering and my breath left me as I dropped to my knees in a pool of my own blood. Numbly, fighting for breath, I grabbed the cell door and struggled to my feet. I could vaguely see that Drogma had regained consciousness and was looking at me groggily.&nbsp;</FONT><FONT color=#ffffff size=2>Pain tore through me and everything turned red. I looked down and saw the bloody point of the rapier protruding from my chest. The whole world went silent and seemed to move in slow motion. I looked up at Xariah.&nbsp;I wanted to apologize for not being good enough, for not protecting her. I saw the Trueborn lunging for my friends, but I could only fall to the floor as everything went black.</FONT></P>

I looked over and saw Xariah standing next to me, smiling radiantly.&nbsp;</FONT><FONT color=#ffffff size=2>The cleric grunted. “I’m not too fond of Dark Elves being in me hospital, but she wouldn’t leave yer side lad.<SPAN **SMURF**"mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>She been here fer three days.<SPAN **SMURF**"mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Soon as ye can talk, tell her to go get somethin’ to eat, before I have meself yet another patient.” And with that, he stalked out of the room muttering something about needing an ale.&nbsp;</FONT><FONT color=#ffffff size=2>I felt another wave of healing relief wash over me and found I could speak again.&nbsp;</FONT><FONT color=#ffffff size=2>“Xari” I<SPAN **SMURF**"mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>said weakly, “I’m so very glad to see you. Wha.. What happened?&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT color=#ffffff size=2>“We did it,” she said, “it was close, but we managed to get them out.”&nbsp;</FONT><FONT color=#ffffff size=2>I sighed. “I’m not complaining mind you, but why am I alive?”&nbsp;</FONT><FONT color=#ffffff size=2>“Drogma.” Xariah said simply.<SPAN **SMURF**"mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>“She woke up as I was working up our port.<SPAN **SMURF**"mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>She saw what was going on and had just enough time to cast a Death Pact on you.<SPAN **SMURF**"mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>It bought you just enough time so that when we arrived in PoK, we could get you some help.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT color=#ffffff size=2>I started to speak, but she squeezed my hand and continued speaking. “You don’t really know how badly you were injured.<SPAN **SMURF**"mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>It took three clerics to save you.<SPAN **SMURF**"mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>You nearly lost your head, your spleen was ruptured, the entire left side of your ribcage was crushed and you had a sword run right through you.” </FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><FONT color=#ffffff size=2>By the time she finished speaking; she was visibly trembling and had tears running down her face.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT color=#ffffff size=2>“I thought you were going to die.” She whispered.<SPAN **SMURF**"mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>“I’ve never been so scared in my life.”</FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><FONT color=#ffffff size=2>I squeezed her small hand. “Xari, I…”, I started to say.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT size=2><FONT color=#ffffff>Before I could finish my sentence, the door was flung open and a dozen of my guildmates flooded into the room.<SPAN **SMURF**"mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Xariah quickly let go of my hand and rose to </FONT><FONT color=#ffffff>leave as everyone gathered around my bed and fired questions at me.

<P class=MsoNormal 0pt? 0in **SMURF**?MARGIN:>Pouring down from the sky, feeling like tiny daggers piercing his skin, the snow struck the young half-elf, Obsqura, as he slowly crept his way to find any source of life in the Dreadlands. After making his way past the frozen tunnel, he couldn’t bear any more, and passed out, in the snow.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal 0pt? 0in **SMURF**?MARGIN:>&nbsp;<namespace prefix = o ns = "http://www.lithium.com/unique/URI"></P>
<P class=MsoNormal 0pt? 0in **SMURF**?MARGIN:>A few moments after that, a family of iksar, who were traveling from Cabilis to the Bazaar, to sell some new goods that they acquired from a band of drogmors they slaughtered in Karnor’s Castle when they noticed Gorenaire about to attack the defenseless Obsqura. The family of iksar quickly came to Obsquras aid and after a short time, mauled Gorenaire, like a Large Kodiak versus an Orc Pawn.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal 0pt? 0in **SMURF**?MARGIN:>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal 0pt? 0in **SMURF**?MARGIN:>After Gorenaire was dead, the family of iksar searched for a while to find Obsqura’s parents, but they did not prevail, so the mother, Achziz decided to take Obsqura in, and raise him as his own. “Obsqura is so young, that he probably didn’t remember that much about his real parents,” exclaimed Achziz. “He was most likely abandoned, since most of the elves and the humans didn’t accept his half-elvin traits,” Klarx, the oldest male, stated. The family decided to split up, and the males headed towards the Bazaar, while the females headed back towards Cabilis. When Obsqura and the two female iksars, Achziz and Fongi reached Cabilis, they had to sneak Obsqura in, buy stuffing him tightly into a 10-slot bag.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal 0pt? 0in **SMURF**?MARGIN:>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal 0pt? 0in **SMURF**?MARGIN:>It took a little while for the iksar family to treat Obsqura as a normal iksar, since he was a smoothskin, and they were not. Unfortunately, there were some things that Obsqura couldn’t do, as in, get near the shaman, beastlord, and necromancer guilds, because they despised him, but Obsqura got used to his limitations and began liking the customary food, such as Froglok Legs. Obsqura could not go to any celebrations of Cazic-Thule, or festivals, unless he had iksar illusion on. Iksar illusion potions were very hard to find when Obsqura was young, but now and then, he would find the components in the bazaar, and his iksar father, Klarx would combine the potions for Obsqura.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal 0pt? 0in **SMURF**?MARGIN:>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal 0pt? 0in **SMURF**?MARGIN:>When Obsqura could finally think on his own, and make his own decisions, he decided to follow the art of a druid, while his two brothers, Scarzz and Slikernz chose the shaman, and his sister, Fongi chose a monk. Since the iksar race never followed the art of a druid, Obsqura had to wander off on his own to pursue it. Although Obsqura and his iksar family weren’t together for very long, they departed again. Before they departed, his iksar parents, Klarx and Achziz said that they would always be there for him, no matter what he does or what trouble he gets himself into. Obsqura smiled, then he was off on his adventure, to pursue the druidic art, and also to see if he could find his real parents.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal 0pt? 0in **SMURF**?MARGIN:>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal 0pt? 0in **SMURF**?MARGIN:>Quickly, after leaving Cabilis, he decided immediately, he would enter the Plane of Knowledge, as that is the most crowded and where he could find the most information out. He found out that almost every place that he traveled to had some form of danger. Obsqura was very slow at making friends, as he really didn’t make any. After listening to the gossip around the Plane of Knowledge, he heard that there was a druid guild in Rivervale. The only problem was, that Obsqura didn’t know how to get there. Obsqura was still young, and heard rumors of the teleportation spells, but he only knew a few, that his iksar parents taught him. After asking around, and getting rude answers all around, this high level druid, named Dalax, noticed Obsqura out of the corner of his eye, while drinking in the local tavern, decided to help Obsqura out. Dalax showed Obsqura how to memorize a whole variety of spells, taught him how to “kite”, how to get around Norrath, and more, in only one weeks time. Before Dalax and Obsqura parted ways, Dalax tossed Obsqura 100 platinum pieces to help him out. Obsqura thanked Dalax for all his time and efforts in helping him, and then left for Rivervale, to pursue more training.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal 0pt? 0in **SMURF**?MARGIN:>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal 0pt? 0in **SMURF**?MARGIN:>Obsqura wasn’t old enough to use the teleportation spells, but he was close. When he arrived in the city of Rivervale, Obsqura was stunned; he had never seen so many short people in his entire life. Obsqura began training vigorously to obtain higher levels and getting better spells. He mostly used the new skill of kiting, so he of course never made any friends, and never really met anyone. One strange thing that people thought of when they saw Obsqura, was that he worshiped Cazic-Thule and Karana, when everyone else only worshiped one god, while he worshiped two.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal 0pt? 0in **SMURF**?MARGIN:>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal 0pt? 0in **SMURF**?MARGIN:>Obsqura trained so hard, until he woke up, to when he fell asleep. Sometimes, Obsqura worked so hard, that he couldn’t even stand on his feet anymore, so he just crawled up to the entrance to Old Sebilis or passed out on the cobblestones of Karnor’s Castle. When he was training so hard, he never remembered about finding his real parents, so he pretty much gave up, as they abandoned him, so he shouldn’t even look for them, unless to slay them for leaving him defenseless in the cold, so long ago. Whenever Obsqura was in real danger and outnumbered, he would use his hatred towards his real parents to conjure up the strength to finish entire groups of creatures that he would normally be too young to slay.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal 0pt? 0in **SMURF**?MARGIN:>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal 0pt? 0in **SMURF**?MARGIN:>Obsqura kept in touch, by writing to his iksar parents in Cabilis, explaining everything that he did for that week, and how hard he is training. Klarx and Achziz were so proud of Obsqura, since he was advancing in his ranks so quickly. Klarx and Achziz also wrote back to Obsqura, explaining how life was in Cabilis. They explained how their two sons and daughter left Cabilis too, in search to train harder in the class that they chose. After a while of training, Obsqura was missing his family back in Cabilis, so the next celebration of Cazic-Thule, he said that he would come back down to Cabilis, and take a break from training. The other three siblings agreed to come back too.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal 0pt? 0in **SMURF**?MARGIN:>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal 0pt? 0in **SMURF**?MARGIN:>Obsqura needed to prepare for the festival, so he first got more iksar illusion potions, so he would be all stocked up for the long festival. With Obsqura’s teleportation spells, it was easy for him to quickly acquire the items he needed for the festival. Obsqura tried to figure out a place where he could bring back Froglok Legs, but luckily, he remembered Gukta, the city where the frogloks lived, after they kicked out the trolls. Obsqura thought of a cunning plan on how to get the most as quick as possible. First, he gathered as many frogloks as he could by starting to tell a tale of Mithaniel Marr, but as he gathered as much as he thought he needed, he quickly casted an Area Effect spell that decimated and cooked most of the frogs around him. Obsqura cleared several parts of Gukta, laughing as he slaughtered lots of them, as the city of Cabilis would love all the froglok legs. After about 60 froglok legs, Obsqura teleported to the Dreadlands, leaving Gukta, right before the froglok reinforcements entered the area, to attempt to slay him.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal 0pt? 0in **SMURF**?MARGIN:>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal 0pt? 0in **SMURF**?MARGIN:>When Obsqura entered the Dreadlands, the snow felt like tiny daggers piercing his skin, just like when he was wandering the Dreadlands before. Obsqura had a flashback from when he was abandoned to die. Obsqura saw the same spot where he had passed out from the cold, so long ago. Then, he noticed a dragon-like figure, similar to Gorenaire that attacked him when he was at that spot, was running after something. Obsqura could barely make the figure out, but it was a small iksar, about the same age as Obsqura was, when he was found by his iksar family. Obsqura quickly got on his mount, ran after Gorenaire, entered in a fierce battle that almost killed him, but Obsqura, by himself, slayed Gorenaire and saved the small iksar. Obsqura, panting, asked the small iksar, in Lizardman, “Are you all right?” The young iksar female replied tiredly, “Yes, thanks,” right as she passed out in Obsquras arms due to cold and hunger.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal 0pt? 0in **SMURF**?MARGIN:>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal 0pt? 0in **SMURF**?MARGIN:>Obsqura quickly ran back to Cabilis, where he bought the young, female iksar back to his parents home. When the young iksar woke up, she didn’t seem afraid of Obsqura, as she didn’t see him as a smoothskin, but she saw him as an iksar, on the inside. She exclaimed, “Everyone in my family was killed by the Gorenaire lookalike, except for me, but I would have, if it wasn’t for you saving me.” “What is your name?” Obsqura stated. The young iksar replied, “Zranz.” The young iksar got her strength returned, so both Obsqura and Zranz decided to go to the festival together. Zranz grew very fond of Obsqura, as he raised her.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal 0pt? 0in **SMURF**?MARGIN:>&nbsp;</P><SPAN FONT-FAMILY: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: AR-SA? mso-bidi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: mso-ansi-language: Roman?; New ?Times mso-fareast-font-family: 12pt;>When Zranz grew to be able to make her own decisions, the class she chose to be, was a druid, just like Obsqura. Obsqura was speechless when he found out that Zranz wanted to be just like him, but Obsqura trained her real hard, and she grew up to be a great druid. Zranz can be seen from time to time at festivals of Cazic-Thule and Karana, and Obsqura can be seen tearing up the raiding content and retiring to his home in Cabilis, near the monk guild.

<P>The sun was setting and dusk began to fall in the forest of Lesser Faydark. The dim remaining light from the falling sun filtered through the trees and shone off of my silvery armor. I was sitting far back from the camp of Dark Elves as to not be seen. I had been waiting in this spot for days waiting for the Troll named Xicotl. I knew he would soon come to the camp as he had business with the Dark Elves. I was not sure how I was going to do what had to be done. I did not know how I was going to kill Xicotl. Please allow me to explain my situation. I am Roann, Paladin of Erollisi Marr. Human is my race. After much searching I was sent to gather several things for Brother Hayle. I had already obtained Sir Lucan D`Lere's testimony and had given it to Valeron Dunshire. I was here to obtain the hilt of SoulFire from the body of Xicotl. Yet I still was not sure of how I would accomplish this as Xicotl was much stronger than me. Just as I was thinking of what to do I heard a noise behind me. Knowing that the forest was full of danger I spun around fast. Towering there in blood-stained armor was an Ogre with a polished, steel sword in his heavily armored hands. His face was scarred from many battles past. His eyes were black as the night sky. On his face was what seemed to be a look of perpetual struggle. I was scared for my life as I had heard many stories about what Ogres have done to Paladins like myself. He looked down at me with eyes of blackness. He pulled back his lips to form what could have been an Ogre smile. "Hello dere yoo little human!" He whispered to me as much as an Ogre could whisper. "I heared of yoos quest and decided to help yoos!" He continued. my shoulders relaxed as I let out a sigh of relief. I couldn't see myself but I knew I must have been white as a ghost. I began to worry less now that I knew he was here to help rather than rip my arms from their sockets. His eyes grew wide "Look out behind yoos!" He shouted and then everything went black....... I felt as though I was spinning. Spinning in an unexplained blackness. I heard sounds of blades clashing and roars of pain and victory. I woke up, head spinning, to see the Ogre standing over me smiling that big Ogre smile. "Good yoos is awake! Troll come and hit yoo wit barshing stick but Sakone kill him with sword!" He said cheerfully raising his sword as if I didn't know what it was. I sat up and looked around. Sure enough the body of Xicotl was laying behind me. I walked over to his corpse and found the glowing hilt in a pouch on his waist. I turned to Sakone and smiled "Thank you kind Ogre for helping me... I am in your debt." I bowed before him in thanks but he just looked at me like I was insane. "Sakone no need 'Tank yoos' from Roann, I help becoz I want to... Sakone not done helping Roann anyway." I looked at him quizically. "What do you mean 'Not done helping me'?" "Sakone help with other tings in Roann's quest." I smiled. I was glad that I would have a companion to help me in obtaining my testimony. I was not sure I could do it alone. Sakone and I started toward Greater Faydark so as to travel to Freeport via Plane of Knowledge. We found a decently peacful part of the woods and set up camp for the night not far from the border of Lesser Faydark and Greater Faydark. I lay there looking up at the stars and thanked Erollisi Marr for granting me a friend to help with this most difficult of quests. I also prayed that she would help guide me everyday. After my evening prayer I finally slipped into the land of dreams. I could not have been asleep very long when I was awoken by Sakone shaking me. "Wake up Roann. Orcs attacking us!" I instantly sprung up from the ground, grabbed my sword and ran after Sakone. I caught up to him trying to fight off five Orcs. Each swing of his sword he let out a battle roar. The orcs swung and Sakone parried their blows. I swung my sword at an Orc that was about to hit Sakone from behind and it fell to the ground lifeless. Sakone had taken out two of the orcs so now only two remained. I gave a great swing of my sword and slew one of the remaining Orcs. Sakone simply hit the other in the chest with his forearm and watched the orc go flying into the night. Sakone sat down heavily on the ground. Breaths were coming heavily from him. He was hurt bad and was bleeding from several deep wounds. "Hold still." I told him as I reached my hands toward the wounds. I concentrated and a blue glow began to form around my hands. The wounds began to close up and heal themselves. Sakone and I stood up. He gave me a look from deep within his eyes. I knew that look, it was the look you give a friend when they have done you a great favor "I think we should continue our journey now before we get attacked again." I said to him and with that we began to walk into the Greater Faydark. Our boots were noisy as they hit the forest floor. Greater Faydark was so quiet at night while the Wood Elves slept in their beds. I remembered my home in Qeynos. I missed the days of my childhood. I would go back to Qeynos after I finished this quest. "What was your home like, Sakone?" I asked. He turned to me, a look of unhappiness in his eyes. "Place where Sakone live not gud for any but Ogre. Much war and kill. No friend or love." I could not imagine a place like that. It was morning when we finally reached the book shaped portal to Plane of Knowledge. We touched the stone and appeared in the grand plane. There were many people always roaming around the plane going to one destination or another. It wasn't a far walk from where we were to the portal that would take us to Freeport. Many others looked at us. After all, its not everyday that you see a Paladin and an Ogre walking together. We reached the Freeport stone. Sakone and I touched the stone and found ourselves in a tunnel of stone and dirt. After my eyes adjusted to the darkness we walked from the book to a stone wall next to a woman in a robe. I walked past and went through the wall. Several seconds later Sakone walked through the wall after me. It was only about an hours journey before we found ourselves in East Commonlands. I needed to find Altunic, a merchant who lived close to where we stood. We walked down the dirt path until we met up with Altunic. I hailed him and dug in my bag to find the note from <FONT face=Arial>Merko Quetalis. He smiled at me "You are the one they have sent? A squire?!! I hope you can help me. I gather items strewn upon the grounds of the Commonlands. I sell them at good prices. Lately, I have been terrorized by a human rogue named Narl. He will no doubt appear at my house soon. Bring his head to me." "Where is your house?" I asked him "Follow me!" He said excitedly. When we arrived at his house there was a man standing outside his door. I went to talk to him but when I got too close he began to attack me! Sakone ran to him and buried his blade deep into the Man's torso. He fell to the ground with a thud. I went into the house of Altunic. He turned to me and smiled "Did you kill him?" I nodded my head "Yes, I have killed him." Altunic patted me on the shoulder. "Thank you kindly friend. Now take this token to Merko along with this." He handed me a spider venom sac. "Yes, I will take these items to Merko." I said to him and bowed before leaving his house. Sakone and I set off toward Freeport once more. I turned to him "You know Sakone, when you first found me in Lesser Faydark I thought you were going to be... Well, Ogre-like." He looked back at me "Ya, I special Ogre. Not like other Ogres. Ma always say to Sakone 'yoos weird. Get food' I make many human friend. Sakone like Roann better ten Oguump back home." I was touched. What Sakone had just said was a kind sentiment. "Thanks Sakone," I said with a smile. Before I knew it we were standing at the gates of Freeport once more. I drew a potion from my belt "Here, drink this Sakone." Sakone took a sip of the potion and vanished. "Ahhhh!" Sakone yelled with a mixture of surprise and fear. "Don't worry Sakone. Its just an invisibility potion." Sakone seemed to calm down after I said that. I took a sip from the potion and could no longer see myself. "Ok, Sakone follow me." I called back to him as I started through the Freeport gates. It was a short distance from the gates to get to the Hall of Truth so we were there about the time the invisibility wore off. I ran to the back of the hall of truth to find Merko where he liked to stand and watch for un-wanted guests coming through the aquaducts. "Hail, Merko Quetalis. I have brought this to you from Altunic." I handed him the venom sac. "Thank you kindly Roann. Are you prepared to take your final test?" He asked me. I looked back to Sakone and he smiled at me. "Yes, Merko, I am ready to take the test." I handed him the token I had gotten from Altunic "Very well. I need you to find Willia. She is a Freeport Militia guard and a particularly horrible one." He said her name with great hatred. "You must find her and kill her no matter what she tells you. Only then will you pass the test of truth. She is in the aquaducts. Go now!" I turned to the water flowing into the aquaducts and sure enough, there was a woman in Freeport Militia armor. As I started toward her she began to plead with me "Please, do not kill me. I did not realize the militia was so terrible." I glared at her disbelievingly. I knew what I had to do. I do not wish to go into detail of what I had to do to Willia that day. I returned to Merko he spoke in a soft whisper "She killed my wife, Roann, you did what had to be done. This is your testimony. You have passed the test of truth." I had all the things that Hayle had wanted. It was time to return to Southern Karana and give him the items. As I walked to the Knowledge book I could not stop thinking of all the things I have had to do in my life. Mithaniel Marr was testing me to see if I was truly a loyal Paladin. When Sakone and I arrived in Plane of Knowledge we started for the Nexus portal. We touched the stone as we had done many times before and landed in the Nexus. Ther Antonica scion was across the platform. I was afraid it would take long for the spires to become active but they teleported us almost as soon as we got there. The smell of the Karanas fill my nose. It was the smell of freshly fallen rain. "So, Sakone," I said smiling "Are you ready for one final grand adventure?" He smiled back and we started to walk toward the bridge into Southern Karana. It was a long walk to get to Hayle and by the time we arrived it was already night. "Ah, you have returned Roann." Hayle said to me smiling. "I trust you have the items I have requested of you?" I nodded and handed him the four things he had asked for. "Excellent! You are truly deserving to hold SoulFire!" He took the mighty sword from its scabbard and handed it to me "Be careful however Roann, mant Shadow Knights and Necromancer's souls are trapped in the blade and those followers of the ways of evil wish to free the souls." I looked at the blade and held it high. Raging flames formed around the blade. The flames of a true Paladin's heart. I turned to Sakone. "I have done it Sakone. I could not have done it without your help though." Sakone smiled that Ogre smile again. He looked me in the eye and spoke "Me will see Roann again one day." That feeling of warmth filled me again much as it did when I thought of my home. The beginning nor the end mattered as Sakone and I stood there in the dying light of the sun. The days and nights had proved it. A loyalty like no other. I knew that I had found a friendship with Sakone and that was worth more then anything else in the world...</P></FONT><B><FONT face="Arial Black">

<P>"A perfect 20!", Vai, a red-headed human cheered as the crowd "Oooh"ed in sympathy.</P>
<P>"Hmph. You must have loaded him down with coppers." Maryl grumbled, looking at the bloodstain that was Journeytoluclin. The erstwhile halfling had missed his mark and&nbsp;plummeted headfirst onto the rocks from Rivervale's own Bixie Bluff, spilling copper coins everywhere. She looked at Vai, who whistled innocently. The beautiful blonde high elf reached into her Misty Thicket picnic basket and handed over two royal mints. One for Vai and one for the pot. Maryl had already won a lotus pie, an ice cream cake, and a bottle of demi-sec champagne by betting that Boingyboingy, Superfly, and Iwillsurvive would bluffdive successfully. If any halfling made it past the hungry jaws of the piranha and climbed out before 10 halflings made that familiar Crunch sound, she would win the pot. Otherwise, Vai would. So far, Maryl had won 3 to 2. "Jumjum-spiced beer?"</P>
<P>"Sure. Thank you kindly," Vai said, as she clinked her bottle against Maryl's.</P>
<P>A barbarian woman in light chainmail trudged up to their spot a third of the way up the bluff. She used the spear in her right hand as a walking stick, and held out her left against the rocks to steady herself. "What do?" she said, taking a perch close to them, watching the competition with curiosity. She took out a flask from her haversack&nbsp;and knocked it back, finishing with a satisfied sigh. "Uis. Want?" She proffered another flask. "Good is uis."</P>
<P>"Sure! Thank you kindly," Vai said. "I'm Vai and this is Mayrl. Here, have a beer. It's the local specialty." Vai smiled, handing the barbarian a bottle.</P>
<P>"Thank. Lynasy is I." She took a deep draught and turned pink before coughing.</P>
<P>"Jumjum Spiced Beer has quite a kick," Vai said grinning at her before downing the uis and coughing herself. "Whiskey! Smooth!" she said between coughs.</P>
<P>Lynasy chuckled at Vai. "Yes! Uisge! Make I!"</P>
<P>"Pardon me, but I must freshen up. It is a pleasure to meet you, Lynasy." Mayrl said, sidling past her down the rocks.</P>
<P>"Uis?" Lynasy held up a flask.</P>
<P>"After I apply my makeup. It wouldn't do for me to be seen in public without makeup.&nbsp;It would be a pleasure and honor to imbibe your lovingly-crafted alcoholic beverage. Would you save my place please?" Mayrl said, to which Lynasy grunted in affirmation and doffed her coif to mark Maryl's seat.</P>
<P>The barbarian's long black hair tied in a warbraid and her intricate blue woad made her look fiercer than she behaved. "What do?" Lynasy asked again, pointing curiously to the diving competition.</P>
<P>"Every year, the halflings have this competition. A test of skill, they call it. I always thought of it as a clever way to cull the weak-willed and gullible. See, Rivervale has a small garden and sometimes they can't grow enough to feed everyone. And halflings being the frisky folk they are, there is the occasional population explosion. So someone clever, or someone who hates halflings, devised this contest to solve both problems. As a side benefit, scavengers make a tidy profit from the sale of halfling toes, and the Deeppockets take a large cut of the profits."</P>
<P>She grunted an affirmation. Then winced an, "Oooh," with the crowd as Piranhafodder went Crunch.</P>
<P>"No sit. Maryl for is sit." Lynasy said to the pretty half elf woman in short-cropped green hair making her way to their spot.</P>
<P>"It's okay. It's me. How are you doing today?" Mayrl asked Lynasy, who stared at her in amazement.</P>
<P>Lynasy pointed to Piranhafodder's remains. "See halfling. No understand. Sick head? Uis." She handed Mayrl a flask as she pointed to the big red splotch. The half elf sipped gingerly and offered a marmalade sandwich to the barbarian who sniffed it and nibbled it just as gingerly, wary of spiced jumjum.</P>
<P>"My theory is that overcrowding triggers an inborn response in the young, much like lemmings. Only the halflings currently experiencing the phenomenon could tell you what it feels like. But yes, it could be seen as a seasonal&nbsp;affective disorder." Mayrl sighed, tossing a large Ohabah Truffle into the pot and one at Vai, who caught it and took an eager bite into the dark chocolate creme-covered confection. She handed a large truffle to the barbarian, who swallowed it whole.</P>
<P>"Thank. Good is." she said to Mayrl, who stared at her in amazement.</P>
<P>------</P>
<P>"And that is how Grandmama and Auntie Maryl met Auntie Lynasy. And that is why Grandmama, Auntie Lynasy, and Auntie Maryl greet each other with "Uis!" And that is why we always attend the Rivervale Bixie Bluff diving contest."</P>
<P>"Who won the pot, Grandmama?"</P>
<P>"Your grandmama won. It was a bad year for halflings. Now go to sleep and tomorrow on our way to the contest I'll tell you the true story of how an iksar,&nbsp;with only&nbsp;a Glowing Black Sword, saved his god from a band of vicious killers. Good night. And may your dreams be as sweet as Jumjum Cake."</P></FONT></DIV>

			<P>She reached up and touched her lip, which was now split at the base and burned like a wildfire to the touch.&nbsp; Running her tongue over it confirmed that it had begun to spring a bit of blood, and she found herself resisting the urge to begin some kind of incantation which would simply immolate the foolish little beast in front of her in one fell swoop.&nbsp; Though tiny and porbably easily defeated, a quick glance around the room confirmed the foolishness of that idea.&nbsp; It was always the same with goblins, their numbers far outweighed their individual weakness, and thus destroying one was like claiming victory for removing a single grain of sand from an hour glass.</FONT></P>
<P>Therefore, Idlian was forced to&nbsp;simply accept the strike of this diminutive green figure.&nbsp; In her time here, she'd learned that the small goblin was known as Arrowfetch, a nickname given to him for his scouting duties, which no doubt put him in the line of fire, or so he claimed.&nbsp; Idlian suspected that it had something to do with the number of scars across his legs and back that showed hints of shamanistic healing.&nbsp; He had routinely visited her over the past few days, usually wailing away over how "the Runnyeye clan would soon crush those tubby men outside their home" and how "her friends were in immediate peril".&nbsp; When he hadn't gotten into one of his drunken tirades, he began the slow and tedious job of trying to interrogate the High Elf prisoner.</P>
<P>Arrowfetch looked down and rubbed the back of his hand, which was no doubt sore after striking her boney cheek.&nbsp; He tried quickly to regain his composure and pretend as though he'd never suffered the indignity of yelping out in surprise at the slight pain, which was clearly nothing compared to having a rough, clawed hand scraping across one's lip and cheek, and then puffed up his chest proudly.&nbsp; Idlian reached up and felt her now red face, feeling nothing but scorn and contempt for the goblin that stood before her.&nbsp; He was no doubt a mere three, maybe four feet tall, with a filthy orange tunic and pants whose bottoms had been torn and withered by eithher age or, as Idlian liked to constantly remind him, the arrows he'd so routinely "fetched".</P>
<P>That had of course resulted in the loss of "privildeges" as he called them, not that the prisons of the Runnyeye Citadel had many luxuaries, much less for one accustomed to the high life of the Felwithe magical academies.&nbsp; The room she had usually been kept in was rank with the smells of rust, decay, and the overbearing stench of mold and fungus from the ill-maintained, soaking walls.&nbsp; Arrowfetch had been particular about never wanting to interrogate <EM>inside</EM> the cell for some reason, perhaps, she reasoned, he had found it as reprehensible as she did, but she severely doubted that.</P>
<P>Instead, she suspected, he saw his interrogation sessions with her as a chance to enjoy a break from his typical scouting duties.&nbsp; Therefore, he had usually brought her to his favorite places, the pits where goblins would duel for money, the tavern (usually the tavern), and the banquet hall.&nbsp; Two days prior, she recalled, he had actually tried to intoxicate her to try to get her to speak, which only resulted in his own jibbering idiocy after one too many goblin ales.&nbsp; This of course surprised Idlian, as the beverages he tried to serve here tasted more like water with a drop of malt spilled in them than any true form of drink.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Nevertheless, the guards had to drag Arrowfetch back to his room, while she was thrown into her cell for the night.&nbsp; He had brought her back to the tavern this night, where this time he sat over simply a mug of what he called milk, but looked more like some kind of sour pudding.&nbsp; She sat before him, with her back to the roaring fire that kept the room noticeably warm.&nbsp; The tavern was packed with goblins of every shape and size, laughing in their own cruel tongue about this kill or that, or how they had ducked away from an Evil Eye here, or how they'd speared a halfling there.</P>
<P>Most of the stories, Idlian knew, were complete farces, exaggerated tall tales told only to increase their fame and glory in the eyes of others.&nbsp; She herself had only been captured four days prior when she had wandered away from her main group, foolishly trying to study an ancient marking she suspected as a monolith of Veeshan.&nbsp; The goblins had swarmed her, and though she managed to take down her own fair share, they had in the end surrounded her, and became too much for the young wizard.</P>
<P>And now, here she was, forced to endure the poor jokes and bad breath of the goblin Arrowfetch while he went over what he called "Expert Goblin Interrogation Techniques", which usually involved asking the same question over and over again and then hitting the prisoner if they didn't speak up.&nbsp; Most of his previous questions had been about Rivervale, about its defenses, about the strength of the wall of Serilis, about how many Halflings routinely patrolled its walls.&nbsp; In truth, Idlian didn't know, so she had remained silent for the first day, figuring she would just wait it out until her friends had come to save her, but Arrowfetch persisted, occasionally striking her and yielding what information she could conjure up.</P>
<P>She realized then that it hardly mattered.&nbsp; Goblins were notoriously disorganized, and it would take weeks for him to verify the information she gave, which, in turn, as false as the claims of glory as the goblins who populated this tavern.&nbsp; She figured all she needed to do was give him "something" to shut him up, but not enough to be finished with her, while she waited for the arrival of her friends and allies.&nbsp; There were four of them, venturing through the Gorge of King Xxorb to the south.&nbsp; Idlian knew they would never abandon her, but the question of their own safety trying to enter the Citadel had caused her to bite her now split lip several times.</P>
<P>What if they died on the way down, or worse, became prisoners like her?&nbsp; It would be her fault, her own curiousity that led to her capture, which would have, in turn, set forward a series of events that would take the lives of each of her friends.&nbsp; It was not a thought she wanted to consider.&nbsp; Though, on the other hand, she felt a need to be rid of this place.&nbsp; Be it her pompous, High Elven upbringing, or simply her set of standards that were being violated, she did not know, but she knew staying in Runnyeye was not an option.</P>
<P>She would give them two more days before planning her escape, and when that happened, Tunare be with her.</P>
<P>"So..." Arrowfetch started again as he ran a clawed finger across the base of his table, "your companions up above, how&nbsp;many are there?&nbsp; My scouts suspect five, but I think you be a good girl and tell Arrowfetch."</P>
<P>Idlian remained firmly silent, feeling more of a repulsion for the goblin than a desire to tell him anything after having just been slapped.&nbsp; Arrowfetch sighed noticeably and began to tap his fingers one by one across the table top.&nbsp; "Arrowfetch know your plight, me be captured once too," he started, an angle which caught Idlian completely off guard.&nbsp; Not that she really cared about the bond he was trying to form between her, but rather at both the sheer idiocy of that notion, and the fact that he had finally given up on brute force.&nbsp; Somehow, she didn't think Goblins to be capable of feigning empathy.&nbsp; "It hard, thinking 'hey me ever going home?&nbsp; Will me see my people again?&nbsp; Who knows?!'&nbsp; Arrowfetch assure you be dropped off outside the main gates if you tell me about your friends."</P>
<P>By this time, Arrowfetch had completely gotten into his act, showing a sullen, and somewhat saddened face, extending his lower lip just a tad to try to accenuate the lie.&nbsp; Idlian herself found it impossible to suppress a laugh, which seemed to send the small, green goblin into a rage.&nbsp; Knocking aside his mug of "milk", he leapt up onto the table, pointed a finger directly at her, and snarled ferociously.</P>
<P>"You tell Arrowfetch now or I rip your heart out and feed it to the funguses....fungus....fun....to those moldy men down below!" he howled angrily, which completely silenced the tavern then.&nbsp; All eyes were on him and Idlian, and that seemed to bolden the goblin interrogator.&nbsp; He now had the admiration of each of his kin, and he was not going to let it go to waste.&nbsp; "Arrowfetch live many years, know many way to cause pain, you tell me, or I show you!" </P>
<P>At this point, Idlian knew she had begun to outstay her welcome.&nbsp; Unlike with Rivervale, a well armed city fully capable of driving back the goblins no matter the force, she was hesitant to share even the most proposterous lie about her friends.&nbsp; What if they overestimated them, assuming there to be an army, and in turn, sent out their own goblin army to crush them?&nbsp; Her four companions would be completely overrun, there would be no capture for them in that case.&nbsp;</P>
<P>This was it, she decided.&nbsp; If she had to choose between her own life, and the lives of her friends, which had done nothing to suffer this same punishment, she would choose death.</P>
<P>"I won't tell you anything, Arrowcatcher," she spat at him angrily, using the nickname she had given him in the past few days that had no doubt stung him a certain way by the way his face would twist and contort.&nbsp; He reached down and grabbed his small - even by goblin standards - dagger, and held it to her.</P>
<P>"You tell Arrowfetch or die!" he screamed, his body now trembling with rage.</P>
<P>Idlian took in a deep breath and bit her lower lip.&nbsp; Closing her eyes, she readied herself for the burning sensation that would no doubt follow.&nbsp; At least, she figured, she would get to soon meet Tunare.&nbsp; For a long moment, nothing happened, and she wondered if it had happened, perhaps the powers that be had insured she would feel no pain.&nbsp; Perhaps she would open her eyes and there would stand Tunare, in all of her divine beauty.</P>
<P>Therefore she was greatly disappointed when she opened her eyes and there, still, was ugly Arrowfetch, but he seemed distracted.&nbsp; He was no longer looking at her, in fact, his back was to her.&nbsp; She did not know whether to hope or be afraid, had the goblin king, Lord Pickclaw, entered to&nbsp;personally see the execution of this prisoner?&nbsp; Had some of Arrowfetch's superiors decided to feed her to the crocodiles instead?&nbsp; She gulped at the thought of it.</P>
<P>Arrowfetch cried out something in his own tongue, which Idlian was incapable of picking up.&nbsp; The entire room was now in a torrent of motion, she could hear the upturning of chairs, the dropping of glasses, the cries of anguish, and suddenly, with a sharp "<EM>Ayiieee"</EM> from Arrowfetch, he disappeared, or so it seemed.</P>
<P>Instead he was now replaced by a man of enormous stature, his body covered with muscle, blue paint, and chained armor, with a great, white bear's head mounted on his helm.&nbsp; Idlian, blinking in disbelief, turned to see the now disheaveled and broken Arrowfetch thrown against a nearby wall, a single clean stroke from the barbarian's axe had done him through.&nbsp; She looked back up at the man, her eyes brightening immediately as she recognized the warrior.</P>
<P>"Dreak!" she cried, jumping to her feet.&nbsp; The sounds of battle began to set in around them, but she could not resist throwing her arms around the big man in an embrace that screamed "thank you".&nbsp; </P>
<P>He nodded, but pushed her off immediately, bringing the heavy axe back into position.&nbsp; "Not now girl," he warned, spinning on his heels, bringing his axe around, and catching a goblin mid-leap, throwing him, too across the room.&nbsp; Bringing the weapon down to bare, he threw himself into the throes of the melee, leaving Idlian where she stood as she watched, jaw on the floor.</P>
<P>All her friends were here now, Dreak in the thickest of the fighting, swinging his axe, and tossing Goblins about like leaves caught in the autumn wind.&nbsp; Althien lifted his bow, aimed, and let fly, pinning one of the goblins to a wall, while the diminutive dwarf, Galpin, tried frantically to evade blow after blow, sometimes forced to suffer a hit on his armor, but never going without returning the strike with his mace.&nbsp;All the while the curses and howls of the goblins were drowned out by the invigorating musical tune of Yaris, who seemed similarly enthralled with her flute.</P>
<P>In no time at all, the goblin's numbers had been reduced to at least half, at the now free wizard could not resist the urge to finally get in and show them what scorn can be withheld in a Koada'dal wizard.&nbsp; Spotting a goblin making a dash for Althien, she began to chant, and her hands took on a fierce glow.&nbsp; Throwing her right hand forward as though swinging a punch, a pulse of red, magical energy caught the goblin directly in the chest, lifting him in the air and smashing him against the wall.&nbsp; Althien turned to her, smiled, saluted, and reached for another arrow.</P>
<P>Galpin had since gotten into a bare fisted brawl with the goblin barkeep, and Idlien giggled at the doom that awaited the frail, green figure.&nbsp; As a priest of Brell Serilis, Galpin had seen - and caused - his own fair share of bar room brawls, what hope a goblin, much less one unaccustomed to combat, had against him, she did not know.&nbsp; The dwarf easily overpowered his foe, lifted him cleanly off the ground, and heaved him into the rack of beverages, resulting in a loud crash.</P>
<P>In turn, all the rancorous and foul liquids poured down onto the dwarf, illiciting a loud "bah!", soaking him in what he'd always called "demi-beer".</P>
<P>As Goblins continued to fall to the floor, Idlien noticed more and more continued to enter, and she did her best to keep up, casting magical spells, immolating groups of the goblins at a time, or unleashing bursts of fire that would leave one down for the count.&nbsp; But too many were coming.</P>
<P>As Dreak heaved away, one goblin leapt onto a table behind him and lifted its own axe, hoping to fell the enormous barbarian.&nbsp; Althien immediately lifted his bow, pulled back, and let fly.&nbsp; The arrow caught the foe square in the chest, resulting in a brief yelp, before it too crumbled to the floor.&nbsp; </P>
<P>"They're comin' out of the bloody walls!" Dreak proclaimed as he backed away from another fresh kill.&nbsp; Indeed, Idlian noted, it would seem that way.&nbsp; They were now knee-deep in slain goblin, but more and more kept pouring through the doors as though someone had broken a dam, releasing a river of these little menaces.&nbsp; </P>
<P>"Get close!" Idlien cried, running to the safety of her friends.&nbsp; Dreak took one more swing, earning him a weak grunt, before he retreated near Idlien.&nbsp; Yaris ceased her song, and drew one of her fine blades, scoring her own goblin kills as she backed into the main group.&nbsp; </P>
<P>When all were present, she closed her eyes, looked down, and began chanting once more.&nbsp; <EM>Curse whoever scribed this spell</EM> she thought as she proceeded with the necessary incantations, <EM>if I needed ten minutes to give a speech, I wouldn't be casting this spell now would I?</EM></P>
<P>Idlien's palms began to sweat as she felt the motions of her friends around her, holding off the ever growing number of goblins, and hoping desperately that she would get the spell off in time.&nbsp; With a final word she looked up, held her hands, and in a flash of light they stood, strangely enough, between the great spires of the Karanas, looking down at a confused halfling who was there moments before them.</P>
<P>When each of them looked around and got an idea for their surroundings, and the realization that they had escaped finally set in, they burst out into great laughter.</P>
