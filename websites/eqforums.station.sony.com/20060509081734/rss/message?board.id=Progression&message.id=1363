    <description>&lt;div&gt;The problem with making it guild based or flagged based is that those who are not in guilds would never get to the &amp;quot;new&amp;quot; content and in some cases guilds would do whatever they could to block others from progressing.  It is much more fair to have it be all or nothing and have each expansion open when the lock is broken.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I see the point here and its a valid one, but what happens to the progression? I guess Im getting confused on what progression means. Is it player progression which enables the player to access expansions, or is it a trigger which allows the server access to expansions? If the later is the case then once all the expansions are unlocked then what makes this different from anyother server? There would be no progression left after about a year. Now if the system is designed so that Major enounters unlock expansions for those who are on the encounter then your right, guilds might block others from advancing. The only way I can now see this working is granting access due to a players level. Maybe even having an AA requirment. This gives the casual player an even chance to gain access to other expansions. I guess Im just saying is that there is no player progression in a server wide unlock.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Is there some reason that some posters feel their posts are so important that they need to be double the size and in bold?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway: I hope that there are a myriad of conditions involved in unlocked each expansion, ones that will be both difficult and time consuming. If it is as simple as just defeating X mob and Y encounter, then we have been cheated. I would expect that in addition to killing certain mobs, other things would have to be mastered as well such as X amount of tradeskills, Y amound of languages, or Z amount of quests (for example, the Rogue Epic 1.0 is pure EQ Classic content...).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please make it a CHORE to unlock the next expansion.</description>

      <description>I still think a good progression unlocking mechanism is to require a number of events (kills &amp; tradeskill) to be completed by a specified number of accounts. That way, more than a single guild is required to open content. For example require a total of 10 Vox deaths and 200 accounts getting flaaged for a Vox kill. That would give a good sense of serverwide progression.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;Thanks for starting the Thread Kyth, however to have a progression server you would need to be able to run the original EQ - WITH BOATS - Hmmmm but you can't get the boats running can you - interesting problem - Lets face it SOE will probably never get this Progression Server off the ground and its just a bit of propaganda to stop us all drolling over the thought of Vanguard SOH :)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

But the way i've seen the dev's talk about it, its going to be as close to launch as they can get it without putting in the bugs and sucky parts.  There will be some things that will stay but can be overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UI can be modified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The music can be played on WMP and turning the EQ volume down. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The map and LFG features are not required, you'll still be able to walk into LGUK, shout &amp;quot;LVL 44 war LFG&amp;quot; and get ignored just like the old days and aside from a few outliers, the layouts of the zones is still the same so you can navigate them by memory instead of playing &amp;quot;EQ 2D top down dungeon crawl&amp;quot; as I like to call it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently added quests and drops are being investigated and will be dealt with if they are felt by dev's to be unbalancing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No tutorial (praise allah)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That gnome wizard who is 3 lvls higher than you will still KS your orc in Gfay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In summary.  Don't make your decision to stay or leave for VG based on what anyone here says. There are a lot of folks who like to think that they know how its going to be but in all reality they have no idea better than you or me.  This server is going to rock, its going to be what you're looking for. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;May I ask that you please open more than one server of this play style?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People thought the number of newbies on Stromm was bad.... this is going to bring players back to EQ who haven't played in years most likely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;10,000 people online on one server at once will be fun to see, but at the same time.... well.... you know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh, and look at the classic server Idea.  Only the Trilogy, once you hit cap, if you get bored and want to progress, offer a free transfer to another server (but you must be at level cap to get it for free).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'll see you all on Combine, along with some friends who have been waiting for a classic server (it appears that this is as close as we will get).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I agree, you can see by the sheer interest here and the fact that most people dont post here that it´s going to be absolutely freakin so packed in there. Back in the old days there was like 2-3k people on a server and that was packed....can you imagine 10k (or more from what it looks as if is going to happen will happen).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I´d like to join the 2nd server, because I have no dought they will need one. The main thing I would like to know is if it would be a server split or whether they´d just open another server....ie do I need to hold off on joining this one or not? lol&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Each zone has its own server so being worried about 10k people is no concern. Actually if I remember correctly, there used to be numbers of just how many people were on any given server at server select/login and it was much higher than 10k.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Evilgrim you are ok in my book.  Aye I think most of the interested folks want to play EQ as it was in the old days before the cheesy-easy stuff was put in.  Just my opinion, folks. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Nova, where did you see 1k players in one zone?  You must be thinking of the bazaar?  Prior to PoK and the bazaar, I've never seen more than 150 people in one zone; and it was hella laggy.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I think a zone would crash if it had 1k people in it; but hey what do I know.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;AND **FROGLOK** Sony is involved in Vanguard !!??!!??  Pretty exciting news, actually.  Smartly done!&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Ok, on another post, I suggested a special progression of a certain percentage of the accounts that have characaters on a server having completed the flagging event.  I still think that is best if we are going to have a progressive server.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, I think there might be another way to go here!  Have one server per setup.  So Combine is old world only.  Then there is a Kunark server (for instance, but I am sure they could come up with a better name) that you automatically transfered to when you beat the game.  You could request a transfer to Kunark once it was open even if you didn't beat the old world, but only if you choose to.  This would allow people to start the other race/class combos once the progression lock was broken.  Same for each of the progressive servers unless there was a point where it didn't matter to continue.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;People who like the trilogy could play there to their heart's content.  As people progressed, new people could start wherever they wanted!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just a thought...  If not this then I hope that 40% of the accounts on the server have to kill ALL of the boss mobs to get the server to progress.  Then, it will happen to everyone, but no one guild could do it alone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;hate to shoot down your suggesstion...but there´ll be like 20 people on the new server and no one to group with...sposed to be a community not a chance to leave your server behind.&lt;/div&gt;</description>
