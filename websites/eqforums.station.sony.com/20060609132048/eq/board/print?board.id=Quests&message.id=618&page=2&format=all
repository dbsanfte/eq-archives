				Some of the level 10ish tasks from Qeynos send you to Everfrost to kill giant woolly spiders.  But all the giant woolly spiders get stuck under the world along the edges of the river.  So it's very unlikely that the average newb could ever find any to kill.

				The "Nok, Nok Who's Powder" task (obtained at level 32 from one of the Iksar task masters in the Swamp of No Hope) contains this same direction as its next-to-last step. The directions say, "explore the ENTRANCE . . .," but I've been through every inch of that tunnel complex--and all three of its "entrances" (FV, PoK, and DL) many times over, with no luck. As there's only one cave in Firiona Vie that "leads to the Dreadlands," it's probably a safe bet that this one's broken.<br><br>NOTE: The directions in my task included a reference (hint?) about learning much from "the faces of the wild." So, I turned my attention to the two statues at the FV entrance . . . clicked them, tried climbing them, cursed at them, etc. Nothing. And thinking that maybe the task writers were playing fast and loose with the word "entrance," I backed up and investigated the many stones in that area (some of which seem to have runes or designs on them), hoping to find a friendly(?) face. Still nothing. Except multiple butt-kickings, courtesy of the local drachnids.<br><br>Merely FYI,<br>Ras

<P>I saw Ashlanne's recent <A href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Quests&amp;message.id=652" target=_blank>Quest issue list </A>post and noticed the list of broken tasks.&nbsp; I realized I hadn't addressed or updated everyone on all of the fixes and findings regarding these, so here goes.</P>
<P>
<HR>

<P></P>
<P>The following tasks are believed broken. Please see the seperate Broken Tasks forum for details. (Some might be fixed now, but it doesn't say so!)</P>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Lost in Petrification </STRONG>- Kill 10 sathirian protectors in DL.&nbsp; No such mob exists. </LI></UL>
<P>
<HR>

<P>This may have been fixed before I had a chance to look at it.&nbsp; When I checked on this task the only kill requirements I found were killing 10 petrifier cockatrices and killing 10 stonegazer cockatrices.&nbsp; If anyone runs into this issue again or if they currently have a task with this issue, please let us know.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>

<LI><STRONG>Whirling Dervish</STRONG>, a short task.&nbsp;- Explore the iksar tower on the north-east island of Timorous Deep. Task does not update.&nbsp; 
<HR>
</LI>
<P>I just attempted this task on a live server today and it updated correctly for me.&nbsp; Is this still an issue?&nbsp; If so, can you give me the /loc that you are at when you are expecting the task to update?</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>

<LI><STRONG>Wooly Adventures </STRONG>- There is no blue compass line directing you to Droganoth Hrothgar in Everfrost Peaks. 
<HR>
</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This was another task I ran through on a live server and the blue line appeared on my compass after I had completed the first two sections of the task.&nbsp; Is anyone still having this problem?</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>

<LI><STRONG>Scary Caves&nbsp;from Dreadlands </STRONG>- It says to explore the courtyard on the left just inside the castle. But it doesn't trigger unless you go to the courtyard on the right just inside the castle.&nbsp; 
<HR>
</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr **SMURF**"MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P>This has been corrected on Test and now reads, "explore the courtyard on the right just inside the castle."&nbsp; This should be fixed on live servers with the next update.<BR></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>

<LI><STRONG>Keeping Order </STRONG>- Exploring the entrance of the cave in Firiona Vie that leads to the dreadlands doesn't update the task. 
<HR>
</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr **SMURF**"MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P>This task and all others involving exploring sections of Firiona Vie should be working correctly.&nbsp; The fix I mentioned earlier about those tasks not updating was included in the previous update.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr **SMURF**"MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">

<P>As with the Keeping Order task this task should be working correctly now as well.</P>
<P>Since it didn't get included in Ashlanne's post I also wanted to mention that the Nok, Nok Who's Powder task was also fixed.&nbsp; </P>
<P>If any of these tasks are still having trouble or if there are new issues you come across, please continue to let us know.</P>

				This is a minor detail on an iksar task that I got at about level 7 from a task master in East Cabilis.  The first step of the task had me wander to some columns in the Field of Bone.  The next part was to kill giant marsh leeches and loot 4 items from the leeches.  From the description of the task, it seems as though the first part should send you to Swamp of No Hope instead of FoB as all the flavor text seems to imply you're doing a mission in a swamp.  I would guess the first line should send you south of the city to an area of ruined columns where the leeches spawn.  The task is completable, but confusing.

<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>You are told to explore the "Camp of Outsiders". When I got to some tents, the task updated. There were no creatures there. You then report back to Whisperdell, who says "Bandits you say - go and kill 5 of them".</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Well there are still no Bandits at the camp where the task updated. I've looked all round there on a few occasions, but there is never a bandit in sight.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I do believe there used to be Bandits there, as it is marked on EQATLAS. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Perhaps the Bandits ran away when the war started? If so, will they return, so that this task can be completed?</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>

</BLOCKQUOTE>I remember there was an earlier bug with this task -- something like&nbsp;you had to loot the stones from particular aqua goblins - the ones near the under water tower, near cleric and druid spawns. That seemed a bit hard at level 12, so I think the dev (Rainbird maybe?) mentioned tweaking it a little.

<DIV>Which changes are preventing you from getting the quest again? <STRONG>I now understand this.

<DIV><STRONG>It would be nice if it only flagged you for doing the task you actually did, as you could then do V'Lynn Renloe's task for your first bracer, and then do Barrenzin's task for your second bracer.</STRONG></DIV>

Now granted, my group was mainly doing them for the lore, but it seems odd that after 3 tasks with normal and hard options, these final 2 tasks do not have a (hard) option.<br><br>Secondly, the melee reward aug (wurine sense stone, with improved dodge 3), while much more appealing than the caster aug, was a bit of a disappointment, mostly because it only had a slot 7 option, rather than say, a slot 7/8. Again, it's not anything I particularly need, but I know it's a desireable/hard-to-get mod2 for a lot of people, and the tradeskill ones are rather expensive. Since there is no equivalent "hard" task, it seemed like making this slot 8 might be fair.<br><br>I'm probably barking up the wrong tree to complain about itemization here, but I was mostly curious whether the lack of hard missions was a disrepancy or intentional. I'd heard about it from friends a couple weeks back, but hadn't tested it myself till today.<br><br>(Also very curious if those library doors in Dreadspire are intended to be perma-locked in spite of doing Melion's task/being able to lockpick them, or not...but that's a grumble for another day.)

Again, it's not anything I particularly need, but I know it's a desireable/hard-to-get mod2 for a lot of people, and the tradeskill ones are rather expensive. Since there is no equivalent "hard" task, it seemed like making this slot 8 might be fair.<BR><BR>I'm probably barking up the wrong tree to complain about itemization here, but I was mostly curious whether the lack of hard missions was a disrepancy or intentional.

<P>I can't really help with the itemization aspect of it the missions, but I'll pass the slot concerns along.&nbsp; In regards to the difficulty levels for the missions, after checking into this it appears the absence of the hard versions of those two missions is not intentional.&nbsp; The hard versions exist and I've corrected things so they are showing up on test now.&nbsp; Assuming no other issues are found on these missions they should be available after next week's update.</P>
