    <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;For clerics only.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; And only if you are posting positive ideas to improve our dps to 80% of a druids.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;This is a post on what clerics need to improve thier dps to 80% of a druids.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Also on what utility we need to make us viable.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; If you dont have any positive inputs please dont post.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This is in response to the druids telling us to come post on our own boards.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; They are pushing to heal anywhere a cleric can with no noticeable downtime and madhaxor has asked us to post our ideas for how we want to dps 80% of a druid on our own board so here we go.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Please only post ideas that help us get within 80% of thier dps.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Or ideas which could increase out utility to more equal them&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;1.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; nukes---theyu have dawnstrike which is 2125 pts of damage.&amp;nbsp; Simple solution here is to give us an 1800 pt nuke---and give it to us in two different forms (ie magic and fire to equal thier fire and ice)&amp;nbsp; then give us debuffs to make it land.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; and with the same negative 200 resist that Eci and glacier now have.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; and since medtime can not be a factor--make it for same mana cost&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;2.&amp;nbsp; Dots---give us dots equal to 80% of thier best ones.&amp;nbsp; So wasp swarm is a dot for 290 a tick for 9 ticks with neg 100 resist.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; so make ours 230 a tick for 9 ticks with neg 100 resist---opens up a lot for me.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;3.&amp;nbsp; quad nukes=give us nukes that hit 3 mobs---easy.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;4.&amp;nbsp; lion strength to add 5% to melee---give us a spell that adds 5% to all magic damage cast&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;5.&amp;nbsp; make our pet persistent---both our pets bite--just makes it so I dont have to recast mine and waste a spell gem&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;6.&amp;nbsp; make our RDS unresistable and make it do 44 pts of damage a hit---80% of nettleshield.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; We would still have to cast it every mob but massive improvement&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;7.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;7 minute snare(80% of a 9 minute one)---everyone tells me that everyone has it already---just give it to me already cause I have not seen this in my spell list&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;8.&amp;nbsp; fixed invis for 12 minutes&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;9..&amp;nbsp; hmm the exp from our rez balances out evac, ports, SOE, see invis, Eb and lev--so no change there&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;10.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; leave them charm and DC--they are about as useful as group HOT.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Please post any other ideas.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;DONT POST ANY NEGATIVE COMMENTS.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; MADHAXOR himself has told us clerics should have a post here where ONLY clerics can post positive things to bring us up to where we do 80% of a druids dps (note there can be no noticeable difference in our dps though so it may take more then 80%)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;btw, no other class should need any improvements to thier healing to offset this cause we are obviously too weak in dps compared to them.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>The summoned hammer has a modified proc rate..somewhere over 500..the Sporalie hammer is somewhere over 600..pretty sure those are real numbers I read somewhere. Most, if not all, augs are at a 0 modifier. Assuming the 500 and 600 are used between a 0 and 1000 ( this is an assumption ) they will proc at (assumption again) 50-60% more often than a 0 modifier.&lt;br&gt;The additional proc is minimal dps, even with maxxed Dex. Though, in a Cleric's cas..any additional DPS is welcome.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thume</description>

Proc augs generally have base weapon proc rates (aka nothing displayed on lucy), which is ~2.2 procs per minute.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffff00&gt;What I'd like to see improvements in are the following:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffff00&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffff00&gt;1.&amp;nbsp; AC has been improved but is this something that is a done deal or is there still a chance that we'll get improved mitigation?&amp;nbsp; Personally, I'd like to see better mitigation.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffff00&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffff00&gt;2.&amp;nbsp; Block or Parry skill.&amp;nbsp; Whatever would work best with a shield.&amp;nbsp; I don't know how the developers could resolve this because 'Block' is done by using the body and 'Parry' is done by using the weapon.&amp;nbsp; Anyway, it makes no sense whatsoever to have a shield and not be able to block with it.&amp;nbsp; What makes this even idea even more in line with the whole 'defensive' emphasis is the fact that our epic is a shield.&amp;nbsp; I'm not asking for a 'Defensive' mode like Warriors.&amp;nbsp; But, I want to be able to hide behind my shield when it gets real rough.&amp;nbsp; An epic shield should provide some good protection don't you think?&amp;nbsp; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffff00&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffff00&gt;3.&amp;nbsp; Group Heal over Time.&amp;nbsp; We need an improved version.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffff00&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffff00&gt;4.&amp;nbsp; Improved Panoply of Vie.&amp;nbsp; I'd even like to see a group version.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffff00&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffff00&gt;5.&amp;nbsp; Improved resists buff.&amp;nbsp; Perhaps a Seasons-lite version.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffff00&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffff00&gt;6.&amp;nbsp; Improved Avatar.&amp;nbsp; I know it's been updated but it is still sorely lacking.&amp;nbsp; Especially considering the recast time.&amp;nbsp; How about instead of a self-only HoT we have a group version with a group DS component also?&amp;nbsp; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffff00&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffff00&gt;7.&amp;nbsp; In my opinion, the procs on all our summoned pets and hammers should have a group heal component to them.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffff00&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffff00&gt;8.&amp;nbsp; DD spells are pathetic.&amp;nbsp; I will cast on occassion but the&amp;nbsp;Undead line is in dire need of upgrading.&amp;nbsp; We definitely aren't masters and we don't strike fear into the hearts of the undead.&amp;nbsp; The DoTs would be a great place to start.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffff00&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffff00&gt;That should be good enough for now.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffff00&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffff00&gt;SS&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffff00&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Just tried to solo the Stillmoon portion of first part of DON progression---you know the kill 11 stillmoon laborers one.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;well buff up and put my new proccing damage shield on.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; summon hammer of reproach and head in to battle.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;mob hits me 93 times---proc goes off 6&amp;nbsp;times &amp;nbsp;after I had to cast it twice for fight duration.&amp;nbsp; **HALFLING**??&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I cast reproach 6 times---resisted 4 and only hit for 400 once.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; other hit for 1600 (murams)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;get mob to 10% life--it runs.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; resists both stuns and the root.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 4 mobs come back--I run and zone&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;lets try this again--huh&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;2nd time around &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;mob hits me 61 times&amp;nbsp; get 7 procs---well better (but still mob is hitting me for 200+&amp;nbsp; times 60 is 12000 pts of damage so i can do 3150 back??&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; and it is interupting my casting the whole time?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;6 tries at reproach--3 resists.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 1 for 140 , 1 for 800, and 1 for 1400.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;mob gets down to 12%.&amp;nbsp; runs--resists two stuns and a root---3 mobs come back--I run and zone&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;wow lets make sure i succeed third time.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Log in wifes druid--join group--park cleric in corner.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;druid roots two laborers--dots both--sits down--gets up after a couple of minutes-reroots and redots both---snares both.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; both die.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; druid runs off and gets last laborer---roots and dots for a few minutes, snares it&amp;nbsp;then finishes it off with 3 back to back glitterfrost all scoreing above 3K.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;nice to see that the solo parts of the DON progression is so "bleeping" soloable for all classes.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;That part is eminently soloable for clerics ( I soloed 100 % of the solo stages of DoN in such wonderful gear as mail of judgement ) though the stillmoon goblins are by far the hardest of the lot. General way&amp;nbsp;to do it is &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Pull with annul - make sure you pull two. &amp;nbsp;Make sure you are always fighting two, even if you don't expect to kill the second. This removes runners from the equation. Zone line fighting makes fleeing trivial. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Ignore nuking - it wastes mana - load up with kyva's skin of flame potion, double reverse damage shield and the self-proc-damage-shield. Load at least two stuns since there are an irritating number of cleric mobs in the zone. Have graphics on so you can see when they are casting long heals ( ie CH ) by the blue particle effect. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Ater this it is a battle of attition which 80 % of the time I could win, with my most recent gear being a year old.&amp;nbsp; As my mana preservation item is now my main hand weapon - and has no attack value -&amp;nbsp;I don't &amp;nbsp;even bother&amp;nbsp;meleeing in more recent soloing. Anyone who feels happy with a summoned hammer will do better DPS than I did. Besides, it confises passers by to see me soling just by standing around doing nothing, waggling a small stick in the air while creatures try to nibble my nose.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;On topic once more, I can solo 80 % of what druids can - I don't feel I need more.&amp;nbsp; I have accidentally killed several blue con nameds, the sort who are not capitalised and thus hard to spot.&amp;nbsp; If I went in all guns blazing and tried to nuke these to death I'd be dead meat.&amp;nbsp; Using the porcupine method makes them trivial.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;Ummm, have you ever seen a good druid in action?&amp;nbsp; Don't get me wrong, as stated before, I don't really need anything else to be effective in game.&amp;nbsp; But the only way I see that you can think you can solo 80% of what a druid can is if you really have never seen what a good druid can do.&amp;nbsp; They can solo mobs that will 2 round them, and in one case I saw an excellant druid solo a mob that could one round him - &amp;nbsp;It actually did one round him the first time he tried it.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Fine, as I said, if you are dead set against shamans being a healer if they are also a slower, then you should be proposing another class as a viable top tier healer.&amp;nbsp; The other obvious candidate would be paladin, but of course they are&amp;nbsp;a top-3&amp;nbsp;tank, so they'd be equally overpowered if they were also a top-3 healer.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Unless you're going to&amp;nbsp; insist that your role only have 2 classes able to fill it, then it seems like your only option is to be pushing for a brand new healing class or picking a class that already has a role to fill it as the #3 choice.&amp;nbsp; Personally, I think having one class able to be "top 3" in two roles isn't as unbalancing as having only two classes able to fill a critical group slot, but that's just my probably biased personal opinion.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;BUT, if&amp;nbsp;SoE goes with what they seem to be planning, even after reinvisioning is done clerics will still be the clear #1 choice for main healer based on this "80%" target they've explicitly stated.&amp;nbsp; Being a clear 2nd or&amp;nbsp;3rd choice for a slot and a "top 3" or "top 9" (in the case of dps) choice for a second slot isn't quite as unbalancing as being "top 3" in two slots.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Anyhow, the only solution which you'd find acceptable given your obvious position regarding shamans would probably be that SoE introduce a brand new healing class with the next expansion or as you say, that they finish nerfing slow out of existence or strip it outright from shamans.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Since the shaman thing&amp;nbsp;clearly isn't going to happen, since 90% of the shamans in the game would quit if they did it, then you're left with pushing for a new healing class or simply accepting the idea that either the game will be short of healers, screwing over all the non-healers trying to form groups, or the existing healing classes will be overrepresented by design.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If you're cool with the existing healing classes being overrepresented by design, I don't see why you're so dead set against shamans being able to heal and thus potentially becoming somewhat overrepresented.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;In any case, I have no idea how this thread degenerated into the same old crap about class balance.&amp;nbsp; I'll try to rerail it.&amp;nbsp; Things that should happen which would help clerics:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;#1 - reduce the requirement (or perception) that you need a zillion clerics on raids so "real" clerics don't have to compete with people who only made clerics because their guild needed them, not because that's what they wanted to play&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;#2 - boost baseline melee dps for all classes to the point where it actually matters and they can add some measurable dps no matter what role they are filling (adding stackablity).&amp;nbsp; This would represent the largest benefit for classes with the lowest spell-based dps and thus be helpful for clerics but just "amusing" for classes whose spell-based dps would suffer significantly by screwing with melee.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;#3 - give clerics a couple more defensive "utility" spells or perhaps a 30-40% haste spell so they can fill the slower slot when no slower is available.&amp;nbsp; Essentially, make them a viable last resort to fill the slower slot&amp;nbsp;(adding stackablity).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Of course, as the game is currently balanced, none of these things are really needed.&amp;nbsp; But these are things that I'd think would be good to push for if non-cleric healing improvements start to erode the current cleric advantage.&amp;nbsp; #1 and #3 would help to address potential problems caused by non-cleric healing improvements.&amp;nbsp; #2 we should push for just because it's fun.&amp;nbsp; That it probably helps clerics more than any other non-melee class is just an added bonus.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Glowing , bad idea , lets reduce healing disparity by giving clerics more defensive utility thereby increasing healing gap.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Also 6 slots in a group , 16 classes.&amp;nbsp; So say 3 healers , 3 slowers , 3 tanks , 3 pullers and 9 DPs thats 21 classes.&amp;nbsp; Even ignoring pulling thats 18 more than current number of classes. And the last thing this game needs is more classes.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;But then making shaman healers and having slow makes them far to powerful, it will go back to luclin roles where shaman and monk was the ultimate combo.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;By using your solution to a problem , will actually cause far more harm to the game. make druids and shaman nearly as good as clerics but allow them to heal all content , will just drive clerics from the game, by effectively nerfing clerics to be unwanted, as the other priest heal the content but have far greater use for the group. Which means clerics will leave the game because sitting in PoK buffing ppl and ressing them in the lobby is not really that much fun. And then you would have to power up clerics but would the clerics then come back ?&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Glowing I actually play a necro now , cleric is just an alt that gets logged on to res ppl and buff. Which is all clerics will become.&amp;nbsp; Think to what shaman were saying before the OOW overcap buffs arrived. Now tell me you would want to do that to clerics.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;What exactly is it that you think is "my solution"?&amp;nbsp; My main point on this thread is that I think all classes should be able to do "ok" damage with melee weapons, rather than the current state of "laughable" damage.&amp;nbsp; I think this would help clerics more than most other non-melee classes while still being something most classes would rally behind because it would be fun even if it didn't represent a significant&amp;nbsp;power boost for them, rather than argue endlessly about.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;In response to a random derail of the thread, I also suggested that there needs to be at least three classes able&amp;nbsp;to competently fill each group slot, NOT 2 as suggested.&amp;nbsp; Fewer than&amp;nbsp;three would cause the classes who can fill the slot to be grossly overdesired in groups, as clerics currently are.&amp;nbsp; I think druids and shamans are the logical choice for "primary healers" #2 and #3.&amp;nbsp; Brum (and you it seems) seem to feel that this would unbalance things in favor of shamans more so than they are currently unbalanced right now.&amp;nbsp; In reponse to that, I suggested that you pick another class as healer.&amp;nbsp; Since there's no way you can do that without overpowering someone (by your own definitions), you have two choices:&amp;nbsp; live with some amount of imbalance or create a new class.&amp;nbsp; The only way to meet ALL of the stated requirements and avoid overpowering (by your own definitions) existing classes would be to add a new one.&amp;nbsp; I personally think that's a stupid idea.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The best way to look at this entire situation is probably to think of it somewhat similar to the multiple slots for "dps".&amp;nbsp; If we consider typical groups to be comprised of 3 offense + 3 defense, where the 3 offense are usually "dps" and the 3 defense are "tanks", "slowers", and "healers", then we get to an interesting way of doing balance.&amp;nbsp; We can factor out the "tank" defensive slot and not worry about it, since most people feel it's reasonably well balanced as it currently is.&amp;nbsp; That leaves 2 defense slots shared by "healers" and "slowers".&amp;nbsp; For those two slots, we've got the following classes:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;cleric, druid, shaman, enchanter, beastlord, bard.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Looked at at that granularity, from an overall game point of view, things are actually sort of in balance.&amp;nbsp; You need to choose 2 of 6&amp;nbsp;classes to fill 2 of 6 group roles.&amp;nbsp; It's only when you look a bit deeper and distinguish between dealing with damage by preventing it versus by healing it back (as most groups do when forming) that you&amp;nbsp;see a disparity.&amp;nbsp; If you could just grab 2 of the 6 defensive classes like you can grab 3 of the 9 dps classes for the 3 dps slots, things might work quite a bit better.&amp;nbsp; A few things get in the way of this.&amp;nbsp; First of all, slows don't stack at all, which means you simply cannot add two slowers and no healer and expect your group to function.&amp;nbsp; Secondly, healers don't have haste spells, so taking two healers and no slowers is kind of a pain in the butt also, since your melees would have to bring a large supply of haste potions to do proper dps.&amp;nbsp; You can't&amp;nbsp; work around not having a healer with healing potions and though it would be cumbersome to work around the lack of haste you could do it, but most groups don't ever consider doing so.&amp;nbsp; Therefore we end up with a situation where most people feel that they must have 1 healer + 1 slower.&amp;nbsp; But if the groups form up at random, you end up with many combinations which simply don't work.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;All of the combinations involving clerics work quite well, which is one reason why groups tend to grab them, as it gives them maximum flexibility to fill out that last slot.&amp;nbsp; Also, rez is totally covered.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;cleric + (shaman or enchanter or beastlord or bard) works quite well&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;cleric + druid works ok if you're willing to bring a bunch of haste potions for your melees.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;As things currently stand, the best combination with druid is almost certainly shaman, since the shaman brings a solid amount of extra healing power to make up for the healing gap between druids and clerics.&amp;nbsp; Beastlords are probably the next best choice for a druid, then enchanters.&amp;nbsp; Bard + druid is probably doable, but you're starting to push it when you have less than ideal healing and less than ideal slowing at the same time.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Shaman plus any of the other slowers is pretty much a total waste, with huge amounts of overlap.&amp;nbsp; Shaman healing is quite dramatically worse than clerics because they have slows, but in this case someone else is probably doing the slowing.&amp;nbsp; It might work if the shaman is really good and a bit overgeared, but otherwise the overlap makes all these combo pretty lame.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;All of the other combos simply don't work due to slows not stacking.&amp;nbsp; Thus 2 healers + 4 slowers to fill the 2 defensive slots doesn't work in many of its combinations.&amp;nbsp; I was trying to make a couple of the combinations work better while giving clerics a boost by suggesting that they get like a 40% haste spell.&amp;nbsp; It seems logical to me that this would be somewhat helpful and help multiple clerics stack in grouping situations.&amp;nbsp; Not sure why you dismissed it out of hand.&amp;nbsp; Seems like a good idea.&amp;nbsp; As a "haste class", I wouldn't have a problem with clerics getting a haste spell.&amp;nbsp; If shamans get a significant healing boost, this would be&amp;nbsp;a decent&amp;nbsp;way to help clerics out a bit, infringing on defensive group slots, rather than other group slots.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Then if they did something about making slows from the different classes stack a bit better, you could just grab 2 of the 6 defense classes for the 2 defense slots and get moving.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If they don't do any of that, then they simply need to add a viable third healer and perhaps boost beastlord defensive capabilities a bit more so shamans would end up getting healing slots more often but at the same time get slowing slots less often.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;With a few tweaks (or with stances), druids would actually be ok if there weren't so many excess clerics floating around and filling up all the healer slots&amp;nbsp;caused by raid imbalances.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;But if you prefer to focus on crazy changes which infringe on tons of other classes and have no hope of actually happening, go for it.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by GlowingRune on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;11-29-2005&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;05:53 PM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;nice try &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;but haste is not the only boost clerics would need.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; they would need a boost in dps up to at least shammy level also.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; and dps in a form they could contribute while healing.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; see that second defensive slot is expected to do other things also.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;witha&amp;nbsp; cleric and shammy you get healing + slow + haste + great dps from shammy pet with spirit of leopard, spirit of leopard on another group member and shammy two dots (top two shammy dots will do 850 pts of damage a tick themselves--which is almost 150 dps just for the two dots)--now add in pet and group member both proccing spirit of leopard constantly.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; see shammy adds much more then haste and slow in that spot&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;a cleric in second "defensive" slot would be adding only healing.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; many times his healing is going to be wasted (landing at same time as primary healers---dont have that problem with slow)&amp;nbsp;but he cant stop casting to do anything else unlike the slower that once mob is slowed can do other things.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; even adding haste--does not make up for around 200-250 dps a shaman adds after slowing.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;Which part of "boost all classes melee dps to be reasonable" wasn't clear?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; That's your "boost in dps".&amp;nbsp; That second defensive slot is NOT expected to do&amp;nbsp;huge dps, otherwise enchanters would never be able to get that slot, which they clearly do get.&amp;nbsp; When I am in the slower role, most of the time the group doesn't notice nor care whether I do DPS or not.&amp;nbsp; I have never been asked if I have any nuke or dot damage foci/AA, and in fact I do not have most of them.&amp;nbsp; Yet groups are perfectly happy to have me be slower in any zone in the game because I know how to do my job well, get the mobs slowed asap without screwing up the agro excessively, and do my secondary role of throwing in patch heals and helping the primary healer out when needed.&amp;nbsp; DPS is a DISTANT third priority.&amp;nbsp; If you think it's a huge issue when you choose your defensive classes, then you are seriously in need of a rethink of the way you form groups.&amp;nbsp; It's when the defensive classes focus too much on offense that groups end up wiping when they shouldn't.&amp;nbsp; Offense is what defensive classes do when they've got nothing else to do, it's not in any way a requirement to acceptably fill the role.&amp;nbsp; We're not trying to make clerics the #1 choice for the slower role, just trying to make it possible for them to fill it.&amp;nbsp; And excess DPS is NOT a requirement for that; it's just something you want.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;Shamans do not have time to debuff, slow, patch heal, cast 2 dots on&amp;nbsp;every mob, cast two casts of panther on every pull, and manage their pet.&amp;nbsp; Groups do not expect this.&amp;nbsp; I never do it.&amp;nbsp; And not a single person has ever said boo about it.&amp;nbsp; If the content is so easy that I have time to do all that crap, then the mob wouldn't last enough to DoT it anyhow.&amp;nbsp; You have a very strange view of the world if you think this is the&amp;nbsp;expection groups have&amp;nbsp;of every slower.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
a cleric in second "defensive" slot would be adding only healing.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; many times his healing is going to be wasted (landing at same time as primary healers---dont have that problem with slow)&amp;nbsp;but he cant stop casting to do anything else unlike the slower that once mob is slowed can do other things.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; even adding haste--does not make up for around 200-250 dps a shaman adds after slowing.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Not trying to turn clerics into full fledged slowers.&amp;nbsp; Just trying to make them a more acceptable alternative when you happen to have multiple clerics wanting to be in the same group.&amp;nbsp; My haste suggestion is the single largest reason why clerics don't fill that role as well as they should.&amp;nbsp; Boosting melee to be significant closes the DPS gap you seem to be so worried about.&amp;nbsp; If the shaman is doing that 200 dps of spell damage he doesn't have time to be swinging his weapon, so the melee boost helps him not at all, but the cleric can certainly use the melee boost I suggested to contribute some reasonable amount of dps while keeping the mob "slowed" (via Vie + heals) and&amp;nbsp; the group hasted.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Frankly, I'm beginning to think that you aren't even thinking of the implications of my suggestions before saying they won't be enough.&amp;nbsp; You seem to be blinded by some personal vision of god-like shamans which doesn't match the reality that I've seen.&amp;nbsp; All of my suggestions would be upgrades to clerics, a class that seriously does not even need any upgrades at the moment compared to a bunch of seriously screwed over classes that can't get a group to save their lives.&amp;nbsp; Yet when I propose changes to help clerics get a seconary group role, you demand to turn them into shamans or boost them 5 other ways instead.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Seems like you want to have the best healing in the game by a mile, a near-monopoly on castable rezzes, wizard like DPS from your nukes, better tanking, better stunning, better pacify, the ability to cast snare, and about 100 other things I've seen you ask for on this and other threads before you'll be satisfied.&amp;nbsp; Well, good luck.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;But glowing cast a DoT then melee , you will still get dot damage and using your pet is 1 key press, you suggestions are how to make shaman more powerful , doesn't actually help clerics , also as certain people are fond of saying this is the cleric board. Suggestions to move all classes equally would be like improving your heals but improving cleric heals by the same percentage then making you need that extra healing.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Nothing I proposed makes shamans or any other class with significant spell-based dps&amp;nbsp;as much more powerful as classes without such stuff, since you can either spend the time casting spells and medding or you can spend it meleeing.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Casting panther a couple extra times and canni'ing back the mana will do more damage than meleeing for shamans.&amp;nbsp; Thus meleeing would be a toy for them.&amp;nbsp; I'm not talking about giving casters&amp;nbsp;hundreds of&amp;nbsp;melee dps like melee classes here, just a boost from the current 5 dps to something more like 50-75 dps with best available weapons.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;You really don't understand the way shamans work if you think this suggestion would be a larger improvement for shamans than clerics.&amp;nbsp; I know a bunch of clerics who ALREADY melee in groups.&amp;nbsp; Not many shamans do unless they're screwing around.&amp;nbsp; Meleeing reduces dps for shamans.&amp;nbsp; Even souped up melee would&amp;nbsp; almost certainly do so.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;But a Dot takes 3 seconds to cast , then what do you do then , twidle your thumbs or would you melee ?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; And uping to 75dps is still less than 1 of your dots or a cast of panther and your pet.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;your suggestion glowing , shows just how much you understand what a cleric does. I notice you cleric is 57,&amp;nbsp; is it a res bot by any chance ? Just high enough to get 96% res.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Also you suggestion for cleric to effect slow by healing, slow is cast , get it to land then do other stuff. The cleric version is a full time role.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;This is the cleric board if you hadn't noticed, stuff affecting all classes is better on the veterans forum.&amp;nbsp; If you did what you suggest to all casters, it wouldn't make a blind bit of difference as the dps tree would be exactly the same. Clerics still bottom by a long way , for clerics to get to druid level dps you almost have to quadruple cleric dps.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;When the hammer came live, they were better dps, that lasted less than 24 hours before they were reduced due to complaints , your suggestion would have exactly the same effect.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;Right, that's why instead of meleeing, I'd probably cast panther or another dot as a shaman, not melee for 75dps.&amp;nbsp; What's a cleric going to do in between casts of Vie/Elixir/Light?&amp;nbsp; Melee.&amp;nbsp; So the cleric would use the 75 dps of melee and the shaman would continue to prefer the higher dps from casting more spells, assuming there's time to do so, as you suggest.&amp;nbsp; Thus the shaman will continue to have roughly the same dps, since he's using spells, whereas the cleric will get the extra dps from meleeing, which is what he does anyhow when he wants to add dps.&amp;nbsp; At least, that's what all the clerics I ever grouped with do when they want to toss in dps.&amp;nbsp; They prefer to save their somewhat limited mana pool for healing, rather than burning it on nukes.&amp;nbsp; I can't see how this isn't obvious, so I'm not sure I'm explaining it very well.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Ah yes, the standard argument:&amp;nbsp; "you're not as high level as me, so you're clueless".&amp;nbsp; Sorry, but there's a cleric in pretty much EVERY group I'm ever in.&amp;nbsp; And I watch what they do carefully, since I'm usually their backup. &amp;nbsp;And when they want to add DPS, they melee, thus a melee boost helps them more than most casters who use spells when they want to add dps.&amp;nbsp; When I want to add some extra DPS on my shaman, I cast extra spells.&amp;nbsp; 75dps worth of added melee would not change that.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
Also you suggestion for cleric to effect slow by healing, slow is cast , get it to land then do other stuff. The cleric version is a full time role.&amp;nbsp; &#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;That's a crock.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;First of all, the shaman does more than that as a slower.&amp;nbsp; Malos + slow + HoT&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2 Canni + a damage spell as time and spell gems permit.&amp;nbsp; Where exactly am i going to fit meleeing into that picture without losing spell dps or failing to do my primary job?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Let's look at the cleric in that role now.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The cleric in the primary healing slot will be dealing with&amp;nbsp;about 65-70% of the incoming damage, leaving the second cleric to deal with 35-40%.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Assuming that the first cleric is "full time", the second cleric clearly would not be, since he only has to heal half as much.&amp;nbsp; That&amp;nbsp;leaves him time to&amp;nbsp;do something else.&amp;nbsp; The something else I'm proposing is melee, since that's what every cleric I've&amp;nbsp; grouped with seems to think is the wisest form of DPS, allowing them to preserve their mana for emergencies.&amp;nbsp; I'd think a cleric in the same role as the shaman would be Tossing Vie + Elixir + either remedy or light as needed.&amp;nbsp; You really think that a cleric would have to chain cast lights in order to keep up with 35% of an XP mob's damage?&amp;nbsp; If so, I don't see how the primary healer has any hope in hell of keeping up with the 65% of the damage he'd be dealing with if he had a slower in that role.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Of course, this entire analysis entirely ignores the fact that dps from your defensive slots is largely irrelevent and simply isn't a prereq for getting them when groups form, otherwise beastlords would probably be the #1 choice for slower.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
This is the cleric board if you hadn't noticed, stuff affecting all classes is better on the veterans forum.&amp;nbsp; If you did what you suggest to all casters, it wouldn't make a blind bit of difference as the dps tree would be exactly the same. Clerics still bottom by a long way , for clerics to get to druid level dps you almost have to quadruple cleric dps. &#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I proposed the melee thing here because I think it's something reasonable which every class could get behind or simply not care about, but which would help clerics more than most caster classes.&amp;nbsp; If you instead prefer to propose cleric specific pipe dreams that would completely screw over game balance, go for it.&amp;nbsp; Or you could propose a cleric specific flavor of it and ask for them to move you to the same melee table as bards, just as they did with your armor.&amp;nbsp; Other classes, instead of supporting you though, will ask why clerics, already the most groupable class in the game, need even more groupability.&amp;nbsp; The difference here is that I'm proposing stuff that will help,&amp;nbsp; and that has a hope of happening.&amp;nbsp; While others are proposing stuff which either isn't gonna happen in a million years, or will happen despite jealous protests from other classes.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;And this business about adding a fixed amount to each class not making any difference is clearly wrong.&amp;nbsp; Let's use something you understand well to demonstrate.&amp;nbsp; If they added say 5000 hp healed to all priest 3.75 cast time "light" heals, would that leave the effective pecking order the same among healers or would it seriously cut into the current cleric advantage?&amp;nbsp; Right, it would largely eliminate any significant difference between the healers.&amp;nbsp; Adding a fixed amount to everyone helps the people at the bottom the most.&amp;nbsp; Period.&amp;nbsp; The math to prove it is obvious:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;class A (let's call them "druid") does 300 dps.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;class B (let's call them "cleric") does 100 dps.&amp;nbsp; -- class A is 3 times better than class B.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;What happens if we add 100 dps to each?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Class A does 400 dps.&amp;nbsp; -- class A is only 2 times better than class B now.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Class B does 200 dps.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;As you can clearly see, adding a fixed amount is a boost to the class at the bottom.&amp;nbsp; Now add in the fact that the way I added it favors the lower dps class, since it matches the way they already do DPS, whereas it would reduce the dps of the higher dps class since it would take either casting time or med time away.&amp;nbsp; And what do you get?&amp;nbsp; Right!&amp;nbsp; You get even more of a relative boost for the lower class.&amp;nbsp; This seems obvious to me.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
When the hammer came live, they were better dps, that lasted less than 24 hours before they were reduced due to complaints , your suggestion would have exactly the same effect.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Why?&amp;nbsp; This is not at all obvious and just seems like the standard "but they nerfed our hammer so we're screwed" thing I've seen a zillion times before.&amp;nbsp; I suppose you still think the 10 second heal they gave shamans at that same time is a huge nerf to clerics despite the fact that shamans never use it?&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by GlowingRune on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;11-30-2005&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;04:01 PM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;Perhaps you could back this up with some logic?&amp;nbsp; Because I think you're flat out wrong, but it's pretty hard to debate the point when you back up your statements with no facts.&amp;nbsp; And I explained exactly why you're wrong in my previous post.&amp;nbsp; Slow takes care of about 30-35% of the incoming damage when it's available, leaving 65-70% of the damage for the primary healer.&amp;nbsp; If a healer is subbing in for the slower, then he's only dealing with roughly half the amount of damage as the primary healer is.&amp;nbsp; Vie +&amp;nbsp;Elixir will handle a pretty significant&amp;nbsp;portion of that damage and are both "cast on incoming" sorts of spells, much like malos + slow.&amp;nbsp; Assuming being primary healer is a full time job, how can you claim that being the second healer would also be a full time job when it's obvious that the second healer would only have to contribute roughly half as much healing.&amp;nbsp; It pretty much can't be more than a half time job.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;

&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;

&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;You cast Vie before the pull, then you cast elixir as the mob is arriving, maybe you toss in a reverse damage, then you're free to&amp;nbsp;melee while you keep an eye on the tank's health and throw&amp;nbsp;an occasional fast heal.&amp;nbsp; You won't be "chain healing".&amp;nbsp; If you claim you will be, then back it up, because if you actually think about it it pretty much cannot be true.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Bull.&amp;nbsp; This is just plain wrong.&amp;nbsp; Anyone who gives it more than half a thought knows it.&amp;nbsp; And if you have any skill at all and bother to talk to the primary healer, you can arrange it so your heals aren't wasted in any significant way.&amp;nbsp; **HALFLING**, it's like you've never been a secondary healer.&amp;nbsp; How can you say this obvously wrong stuff with a straight face?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

SO that increase across the board to melee dps will be helping the people actually having time to do dps.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I need something to let me add dps WHILE I am healing.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; druids have it with lion strength and DS.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; shaman have it with dots (3 seconds then forget, pets and spirit.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; but if a cleric wants to add dps---he has to continually donate time to it---so he could not be chain healing.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; see once slow is cast the benefit remains.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I cant cast a pious remedy and then call my secondary defensive roll done.&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;No, but you can cast Vie and Elixir, then toss in the occasional light as needed, since that's all you'd need to do.&amp;nbsp; Then you could spend the rest of the time doing dps.&amp;nbsp; You could also be incredibly helpful tossing group heals&amp;nbsp;and contributing divine arbs as needed.&amp;nbsp; I can't believe you really think any of this.&amp;nbsp; I'll just assume you're saying this crap because you'd rather win an argument than actually think about it and back up your position with some logic.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Why don't you go try it before you crap all over the idea.&amp;nbsp; You might be able to talk about it with some facts instead of blind speculation.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;In retrospect, my prior post was a bit too harsh in its tone, so I apologize for that.&amp;nbsp; I get frustrated when people say that&amp;nbsp;something won't work without giving their full reasoning, but I should have been more civil.&amp;nbsp; Sorry.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Glowing you make good arguments.&amp;nbsp; However, the primary healer can toss Vie pre-fight (I know I do) and Elixir can also be done by the primary healer (that's a style and situation thing).&amp;nbsp; And both of these things happen in a healer + slower configuration.&amp;nbsp; So, all that you've accomplished is split the mana cost between two healers.&amp;nbsp; The second healer still has to throw at least a couple of fast heals (if not three or four) to make up for the lack of slow.&amp;nbsp; Yes, if the two cleics comminucate properly healing overlap should be at a minimum.&amp;nbsp; However, the mana usage of the second cleric is FAR more than what a slower has to use to tash/malo + slow, unless a chain cheal&amp;nbsp;rotation is used in which case both neither could DPS.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Next time I am in a group with two clerics (rare so it could be a while) I will experiment.&amp;nbsp; I will ask the slower not to slow so we can test this theory.&amp;nbsp; I would suggest that other clerics do the same - Don't go looking for two clerics in a group, but if it happens ask the group if an experiement can be run.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
