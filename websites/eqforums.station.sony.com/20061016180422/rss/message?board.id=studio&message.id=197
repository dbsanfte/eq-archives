      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;What programs do you use?&amp;nbsp; I know Poser is a big one, but any where from $199-$209, I can't afford it.&amp;nbsp; Does anyone know if there are free versions of these programs anywhere that you can get, or Demos of it for trial download?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Thanks&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If you want to model existing mesh models of "people" then Poser is a good option.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If your looking to create mesh, look into Blender, Maya, Bryce, or Rhyno.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Blender is free and has both a Linux and WinTel version available.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Personally I use a combination of Bryce, Rhyno, Poser, and Shade for most projects.&amp;nbsp; I avoid Maya not because it's a bad program, but because I don't like the people that "only" use Maya.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Let me know if you need a hand with painting the mesh, etc.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>Maya has a Student version for download. It's free. Limited, but free. Have a look on the Alias Wavefront website.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for "People still use Poser" yes they do. And Poser 6 has nothing whatsoever in common with Poser 1-3, and only very little with Poser 4. It has grown up a lot.&lt;br&gt;Also on offer from the same people who do poser is Shade 7, which is a modelling app.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I know a lot of people look down their noses at anyone using Poser - as if it were an easy app to use.&lt;br&gt;It is - and it isn't.&lt;br&gt;I can stand on the shoulders of giants in any application. There is plenty of free content for any of them around. But if I want to do it *well*, then it means I have to spend a lot of time getting it right. &lt;br&gt;Anyone can produce a 3D render in Poser. This is true.&lt;br&gt;However, anyone can produce a 3D render in Maya as well.&lt;br&gt;Not everyone can produce a GOOD render in either of them. That part is where skill and practice comes in. Thats where knowing about lighting, camera angles, shaders, textures, raytracing, bounces, displacement, bumps etc etc etc come in.&lt;br&gt;Poser users may or may not be able to model. But the same goes for some Maya users.&lt;br&gt;Anyone can render. No problem. Import model, stick a light on it, render.&lt;br&gt;The difference is in the application of the tools you have at your disposal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's not which tool you use - it's what you do with it. (To mangle an old saying)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The trick is purely to find a tool you are comfortable with and which fits your requirements - then learn it from the ground up. If you want to do heavy duty modelling - then Poser is the wrong route to go. (So is Daz Studio, which is essentially like Poser.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But don't go into Poser 6 and expect spectacular results. Those come with the application of shaders, lights, reflections and such. That's what takes time to learn.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I never could get the hang of maya.. just makes no sense going from 3ds max to maya.. :P&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I think when it comes down to it.. 3ds max is good for all around modeling, &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Maya is great for rendoring models with very high poly counts.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Poser, while im only familiar with the free versions do have some great stuff in them. And is probably the easist program to use if you want to make some kind of "animated" film type thing.. Or even screen shots of a character striking a pose..&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>At one point I wanted desperately to find a copy of Poser to mess around with.  Although I like some of the stuff that can be done in Poser and other programs of the sort I have never been able to get over some of minor things that bother me;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is there some way to add in more texture to the skin so they don't come off as being so plasticky and dollish?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is there some way to minimize or screen the lighting so the shadows aren't so harsh?  Add in a second light source?  Add in a different color source?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is there a way to add in facial imperfections?  Skulls underneath have to be perfect but it's the imperfections in the face that add character.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Along those same lines, can a face model have any of the features changed?  You can make someone good or E-V-I-L by just a slight change in the angle and separation of the eyes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's been a while since I really browsed over this kind of application but I'm hoping some great advances have been made since last I looked.  I'm still gonna buy it one of these days but learning how to do Flash takes priority right about now.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Oh wow, yes all these things can be done in Poser...lots without buying extra stuff...lights can be changed to what ever your imagination can concieve...you can get some pretty neat effects too.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; As far as skin textures go check out Renderosity to see how good it can get (and how bad:))...this may require a couple of purchases if you don't have the skills to create the textures yourself, but still awesome things can be created as far as human skin goes.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; It has a lot to do with the textures you use, the lights and your render settings.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If you use the DAZ models you can pretty much make your figures look however you want, good, bad, ugly whatever suits your fancy.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So anyways hope that helps.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>Another silly question; when someone posts something and at the bottom it says 'any comments / suggestions / criticism welcomed' do they actually MEAN it?  =)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As much as I hate to use the reference, on that "American Idol" show (never actually watched it) it seems only those who follow the cookie-cutter approach to what's "popular" get in, and those who are doing their best, or moving a different direction, or attempting something DIFFERENT get rudely filtered out.  If there was a spark of creativity or even the courage to go out and try, it's quickly and summarily extinguished.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'd like to think the general public is not like this.  A good, decent person understands the value of saying positive things and when he/she can't say something positive, well, then they remain respectuflly quiet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So... when you post something is it better to get a few responses saying positive things (and keeping conveniently quiet in between) or is it better to get all the feedback, warts and all?</description>

We are usuing Photshop, Illistrator, Quark Express, and then we going to be working with Dreamweaver.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I taught myself Flash, but thats not very helpfull.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I cant do any 3D rendoring but would love to work on it, so I am woundering what programs you guys use.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I downloaded the program from Daz...talk about jumping in totally blind.&amp;nbsp; LOL...I have no idea what I am doing.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; And of course what they give you in the free download is very limited.&amp;nbsp; I am having fun trying to figure it out though.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;There is Gmax, which is the free version of 3dsmax. I personally find 3dsmax easier to use then maya or poser, (of course I've only messed with maya/poser demos, which were increably lacking)&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I use Poser ..but from what I've read DAZ/Studio works great...problem is you still have to spend money on stuff for it...but better to start free and spend money for stuff then start at $200 then spend money on stuff (as with Poser).&amp;nbsp; There's lots of freebies out there if you look hard...but ultimately to get the really cool stuff, it costs money...its kinda an expensive hobby:).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;People still use Poser....still don't understand the "look down the nose" mentality that pops up from time to time in regards to people using this or that program. Certainly a lot of people are simply hobbiests...and it's great for that...and many things beyond. It, like every other program out there, depends entirely on who is using it. I know some people that are doing amazing animations and other things with Poser.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I model my Poser content with 3ds Max...GMAX does ok for certain things, but with limited tools it's not my favorite. (not to mention it's a pain in the rump to export as obj)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;There's plenty of free content for Poser and DS. I started all this about a year ago, and besides the program, I didn't start buying content until a couple months ago....and my download archive is a little over 2 Gig worth of stuff I've collected from here and there. I'm sure as DS grows we'll see more stuff for it....but I haven't tried it yet and may not until I know for sure the free models I use on a regular basis will actually work with it, cause right now they don't.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>You can make models for Poser and import them in? I didn't know that. Very neat!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(But then, I have never worked any Poser like program.)</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Just about everything for Poser starts out in some modeling app. Poser is basically to pose a figure, do a layout of a scene and render stills or animations. You can model with the primitves within the program...but I found it easier to teach myself a modeling app than go through all that.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;And making the model is probably the easiest part of the whole thing....it's getting it rigged and Poserized that's the main headache. I have some humanoid figures I did and I've been working on the rig for almost a month now as I learn to do everything from scratch. :smileytongue:&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Gmax is after all just the free version of 3dsmax, (hence why it lacks features)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I my self use 3dsmax v5, becuase the entire reason I use it is for a game called "morrowind" anything below 3dsmax v5, I can use for it, but everything v6+ I cant..&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I doubt it matters much, theres a few other programs out there, I once downloaded the free maya educational version (from there website) I think it still works. Of course the new programs (like maya or softimage) make absoultely no sense to me, while 3ds max seems much more simple. (even tho it seems like those two programs they tried making them "easier" to use, but only left me confused.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
