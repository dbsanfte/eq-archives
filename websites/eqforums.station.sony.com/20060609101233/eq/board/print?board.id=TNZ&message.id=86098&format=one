For me to ever consider getting to GoD, I first need to get through Elementals and PoTime, then my guild can survive GoD, maybe. But to do all that, you have to be able to raid for months at 10+ hours a day.

<DIV>See, my guild raids 3-4 hours a night, 5 days a week&nbsp;and are in qvic.&nbsp; Since most guild members are adults that have full time jobs, some have families, raiding much more than that is impossible.&nbsp; We do long raids on Sundays as we can start earlier.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I realise that doesn't fit in with your distorted view of raiding guilds, but I will continue to point out and correct&nbsp;the blatant lies people post here about them.</DIV>

<P>onomatopoeia has some decent points later on (I disagree with many of them, but they are decent).&nbsp; However, here she/he is distorting the record in much the same way as she complains about.&nbsp; 3-4 raids on weekdays, longer on Sunday -&gt; 20+ hours per week.&nbsp; The quote about 20+ hours/day or 10+ hours per day is over the wall (although, we all probably know people who do spend 10+ hours/day).&nbsp; The point would have been the same if the number had been 20+ hours/week.</P>
<P>I didn't start until a couple of months before Kunark, so I didn't experience the lines in Lower Guk and Sol B.&nbsp; However, to say the difference between casual guild equipment and full raid equipment has not exploded&nbsp;since then&nbsp;is quite naieve.&nbsp; At one time, you could join a Hate raid and contribute to the raid even if you were equipped with sub-par junk.&nbsp; That is no longer true with the current high end content.</P>
<P>Now that we know GoD was designed with level 70 in mind, it is clear why only a small select group of players&nbsp;has been successful there.&nbsp; The selection criteria is, of course, equipment -- and better than a normal casual guild player can expect to see (other than a couple of nice items).</P>
