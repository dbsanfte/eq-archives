      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Where should we gather to trade?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;EC?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Freeport?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; GF?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Somewhere else?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;I'd like to know from the start....&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I played on theNameless and most serious trading happened in the EC tunnels - so that is all I know. It seemed to work fine, but the bank was a long way away.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;The concensus seems to be that there is not going to be a tutorial .. if this is so, I really don't think the new nektulos is set up to handle a massive influx of people.&amp;nbsp; I made a dark elf recently just to test it out, there is really only 2 small areas with very few mobs to level on for a character starting out.&amp;nbsp; Has anyone heard anything about this?&amp;nbsp; This is probably a zone that should be reverted as well imo.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>Seeking an old-school, group-oriented guild</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Progression&amp;message.id=18889#M18889</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I see all these "raid", "top of the server" guilds seeking new members.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Are there any guilds out there that are recruiting and that are more interested in having a fun, strong community of old-school EQ players?&amp;nbsp; A guild that is more about fun and reliving our EQ experience than power levelling up to 50 and raiding?&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Personally, I have a very busy real life job.&amp;nbsp; I spend a good chunk of my time away from work playing games, though, which means I usually play 2-5 hours/night and quite a bit on weekends (more in the winter since I golf/hike/camp a lot in the summer)..&amp;nbsp; I very rarely am at the upper level range of players and do very little raiding - most of my time is spent in groups.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So, if anybody can point me in any directions, I would greatly appreciate it.&amp;nbsp; Would be nice to have a core group of players to work with from the start.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>If it isn't classic, then why....</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Progression&amp;message.id=18832#M18832</link>
      <description>If this server is strictly classic; why isn't it opened already? Also, why are zones being reverted, quests taken out, boats put in, and a plethora of other things that caters to the classic crowd being added? I mean, the tutorial was considered being taken out for a while, even though developers stated the server was for new people... It seems they are attempting to attract the classic crowd, yet keeping the programming easy and catering to the power raiders.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am one of the classic crowd, but when I see people saying it is strictly progression I begin to wonder. If it really is strictly progression I say lets get the show on the road and open the server already, the heck with changes....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stop trying to make it classic if it is strictly progression</description>

      <title>Returning to EQ, questions from an old player</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Progression&amp;message.id=18816#M18816</link>
      <description>Currently I am playing WoW but EQ was my first and still my favorite mmorpg.&amp;nbsp; My question is the last time I played EQ was when the froglock expansion was released I had a 65 Beastlord and many other characters. Since that time I keep checking back on these forums to see how everything is going and stumbled across this progression server.&amp;nbsp; Instantly memories and flashbacks went through my mind remembering stepping foot from Kelethin with my Ranger.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So to make a long story short I'm thinking of coming back to play on this server and wonder how much have the game mechanics or game play overall has changed since the froglock expansion. Would a player with my absence have trouble coming back not just to the world of Norrath but reverting back to this game from WoW?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Though my favorite class was the beastlord and realize they won't be in till Luclin is unlocked I'm thinking of playing a SK.&amp;nbsp; I remember playing one back when with their pet, dots, and wondering if there anything of importance I should know that has changed the class from different roles to revamping?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thank you for your time and consideration and will once again step forth onto the soil of Norrath.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Progression&amp;message.id=18794#M18794</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I was wondering how important will the European community be on the Progression Server.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So i am starting a count, knowing that there is only one announced guild for the Euro time zone (Shadowed).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I propose we follow this structure :&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Name on the Progression server&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Race and Class&amp;nbsp;on the Progression server&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Country, City IRL&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Previous EQ Server and period played (char name)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;As for myself, it would be :&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Lazaar&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;DarkElf Enchanter&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;France, Paris&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Antonius Bayle 2000/2003 (Hamedore, Wizard Erudite)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <title>Old server</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Progression&amp;message.id=18778#M18778</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Ok for one, new to the forums entirely, not so new to everquest in general.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Ok this whole progression server deal sounds awsome. The new everquest is a great game, but the Old everquest has the old feel, the old items, old epics, (personally i like the old graphics, thank god those are optional.) , and i think i speak for alot of eq old timers when i say, yes! the old freeport for humans!!!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Im sure people who just started a eq career would love the game the same way I did when i started ( i think) in 2000. But the old Freeport became (sadly to say) like my own little hometown online. I got so used to the classic weird setup of Guard Jascen (I have no Idea how I remember his name) saving me countless times from the Deathfist Pawns when I had no Idea what I was doing. Anyways, getting to the point.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;For people who flat out love everquest, the original, there should be an old server, the Old graphics ONLY im talking no optionality, if thats even possible. The old Interface, and (only in my dreams) the old spell looks. And maybe theres some sort of technical issue with it but, it never progressed on, because everquest is not something that plans on going away soon. And lets face it, the progression servers will be classic stuff for bout, what, 4-5 years, ima end up quitting eq in a fewyears and come crawling back like i ussually do and it will be like it is now. which isnt horrible, but still not classic.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I beleive there should not&amp;nbsp;JUST be a progression server, but what should be called, the classic server, with NOTHING but flat out classic things, im talking exactly like it was when everquest like when it launched, with the exception of millions of bug fixes. Ok, all you people who got sick of the original, thats cool with me, by the time all these new deals started coming out, I had just made my first level 30. And even for you uber l33ts who know everything about classic EQ, how long has it been, hmmm only 6 years??? Bassicly like a flashback.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Tell me what you think.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Here's what I'd like to see as the requirements for progression.&amp;nbsp; My lists are a bit long, and include some easier conent just to make sure folks experience the whole expansion rather than only hitting the main mobs, and ignoring named mobs that don't have essential loot.&amp;nbsp; I realize some of the items are redundant since some mobs are required in order to complete other goals (ex: clearing VP requires Trak anyway).&amp;nbsp; I also think there should be a one week grace period between fulfilling all the requirements for the next expansion and the next expansion actually opening (so people can prepare for the new expansion rush).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To unlock Kunark:&lt;br&gt;Vox, Nagafen&lt;br&gt;Phinny, Estrella&lt;br&gt;CT, Inny&lt;br&gt;Soulfire quest completed&lt;br&gt;Ishva, Allizewsaur, Efreeti Lord, AoF, Frog king, Ancient Cyclops (this line is rather pointless)&lt;br&gt;100 Level 50 characters (really not sure what a reasonable number would be)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Master Yael (I don't recall if the Hole went live before or after Kunark).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To unlock Velious:&lt;br&gt;Gore, Sev, Talendor, Fay&lt;br&gt;Rak`Ashiir, Drusella Sathir&lt;br&gt;Venril Sathir&lt;br&gt;Trakanon&lt;br&gt;Chardok Queen&lt;br&gt;Sky Cleared&lt;br&gt;VP Cleared&lt;br&gt;All Epics Completed&lt;br&gt;100 Level 60 characters (really not sure what a reasonable number would be)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To unlock Luclin :&lt;br&gt;Lodizal&lt;br&gt;Velketor, Lord Bob&lt;br&gt;*Dain&lt;br&gt;*Ring War (10th ring)&lt;br&gt;Shawl quest completed&lt;br&gt;*Tormax, Vindi, AoW (kinda iffy about AoW since only one or two guilds actually killed him before Luclin was released)&lt;br&gt;Wuoshi, Kelorek&lt;br&gt;*Tunare&lt;br&gt;*Yelinak&lt;br&gt;Kland, Sont, Zland&lt;br&gt;Doze (maybe require a tear quest completed as well)&lt;br&gt;Lendi, Gozz, Telk&lt;br&gt;*NToV Cleared (Vulak)&lt;br&gt;*Bristlebane&lt;br&gt;*Sleeper awakened&lt;br&gt;200 Level 60 characters (same number comment as above)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I plan on stop playing before PoP (quick list: Seru, Ssra named, VT, RoF, Burrower/THO, Shei/IV, Greig, Rumble/Doom, ¿AA requirement?).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Any comments or input?&amp;nbsp; I've been trying to think of some additional requirements for opening Kunark, but all the Mobs I can think of will for sure will be killed before Inny/CT drop.&amp;nbsp; Possibly some more quests (Temple of Sol Ro quests, Robe of the Lost Circle, jeweled skull...etc.), maybe up to a certain isle in Sky (1-3 or 1-4 cleared).&amp;nbsp; I've also been thinking about some more obscure Velious requirements: maybe some names from dungeon crawl zones (SG mobs, named rats in DN, ToFS cleared) or lesser known quests (ex: The Spirit of Garzicor,&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Ralgyn's Promise)&amp;nbsp; What do you guys want the requirements to be?&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Which should I choose for DPS potential and group friendliness? And which will scale up and be more useful in the end game?&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>The Old Spell Graphics</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Progression&amp;message.id=18715#M18715</link>
      <description>I think I read in the FAQ that spells, at this point, probably won't be reverted. I miss the old spells so much, especially the way they got bigger and better at 24 and 39. Is there any chance they will include an option of letting us keep the old spell graphics (and icons) instead of using the new ones?&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Plane of Sky</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Progression&amp;message.id=18699#M18699</link>
      <description>I spent a lot of my early time in EQ exploring and leveling a bunch of&#xD;
classes, so I never made it up to raiding before PoP. In the spirit of&#xD;
getting ready for the progression server, I've been looking at loot&#xD;
from Fear/Hate/Sky and wondering how much that stuff is going to get&#xD;
farmed before it's just abandoned. Most noteably I was thumbing through&#xD;
the sky quests and most of that stuff is pretty rediculous, ie the&#xD;
haste belts. &lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
My question is, is it reasonable to aim for that sky quested stuff, or&#xD;
will those places just get blown through in progression so people can&#xD;
start farming kunark?&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#ffffff size=3&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Dark Devotion &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;is now recruiting...&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#ffffff size=3&gt;Who we are: We are a casual raiding guild on The Combine Server. Most of us are on Pacific Standard Time so raids will be scheduled accordingly. We are a group of mature players who have played MMOs for a long time and are finally returning to where it all began. &lt;STRONG&gt;**Important**: We are a Team Speak Only Guild!&lt;/STRONG&gt; If you don’t have a microphone or are to shy to use it don’t bother applying please. We hardly use guild or raid chat during gameplay and half of the fun for us is chatting with our on-line and real life friends and having a good time. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#ffffff size=3&gt;We will not have a DKP system. We use a modified Loot Council system that will ensure loot is distributed fairly. It has worked extremely well for us in the past and will save members a lot of grief.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#ffffff size=3&gt;What do we mean by “Casual raiding”? We will not be one of the top raiding guilds. I’m going to say that one more time so there is no confusion. We are not going to be one of the top raiding guilds. Most of us have hardcore MMO backgrounds and at some time or another were on the bleeding edge of content (World of Warcraft in my case – top guild and mage on my server for over a year blah blah blah whatever, no one cares). We’re tired of the rat race. This server gives us the unique opportunity to experience the game that started everything for us from the very beginning again. This time we are going to stop and smell the roses. Others can race through the game. We have nothing left to prove and will progress at our own pace. Sure we will do PoP, GoD and all that stuff but all in good time. We’re here for the long run.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#ffffff size=3&gt;Until Kunark we will mostly focus on getting experience groups together and help fellow guild members with quests.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#ffffff size=3&gt;As soon as Kunark opens up our main focus will be on completing epic quests for our members. We believe epics are one of the most fun and challenging events ever implemented and we will try to complete those quests for every single member.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#ffffff size=3&gt;Depending on available content you can expect about 2-3 scheduled raid days per week (usually starting 6pm PST). Of course we will go after targets of opportunity if we have the players to do so. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#ffffff size=3&gt;At this time we are looking for all races/classes. If you are interested please contact us at &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;A href="mailto:benhornig@shaw.ca" target=_blank&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#ffffff size=3&gt;benhornig@shaw.ca&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#ffffff size=3&gt; with your reserved character name, race, class, a little info about yourself and a brief description as to why you would like to join. You will be forwarded our Team Speak Information so we can get things started as soon as the server goes life.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#ffffff size=3&gt;Cheers,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#ffffff size=3&gt;Marroc Skyfire&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#ffffff size=3&gt;Lvl 1 Wizard&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#ffffff size=3&gt;Guild Master of Dark Devotion&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
