      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;you know that was one of the things in my opinion that i hated ab out eq when folks would 2 and 3 box and you would get into a group with them well there are 2 or 3 people out there without a group.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;i would much rather play game with folks who are boxing one char then 3. to me its cheating the game by playing 3 chars at once&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;hell think about it this way you are in a group with a 3 boxer and something nice drops he has 3 times more the chance to win the item &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;plus when he logs you lose 3 members of group instead of just one. oh well just my opinion but hearing folks already thinking about racing to top&amp;nbsp; id like to mention one thing &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Dont be in a hurry the only thing at the end of this server is what was waiting for you at the end of the last server for witch you left to enjoy this one.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I dont remember who was the first person to level out the first server i was on and many others prpbebly dont either.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;this server should be slow paced and a enjoyment to play learn the rpg side of the game since you have already done the level treadmill side before. (sorry got off track) :)&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I &amp;nbsp;2 Box and have done for years, because I found I was spending a VAST amount of time waiting around for other people, and I just didn't have the time to be waiting, I wanted to be playing.&amp;nbsp; The main one for those was camping epic and key mobs.&amp;nbsp; Most of the time sustaining a group for that has been impossible, especially camping green crap. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;That being said, the single biggest reason I ran a 2nd box cleric was for Raiding.&amp;nbsp; As one of the 2 main pullers, (monk) along with an SK (who also boxed a cleric),&amp;nbsp; pullng the raid became&amp;nbsp; phenomely easier/less dangerous and the guild clerics LOVED us for it.&amp;nbsp; After a while, the being assigned to the pull group was universally hated by the guild clerics as it was both boring and critical.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; That, and there were many times that the botted clerics made or broke the raid (i.e. not bots would of meant no raid) as retaining quality raid level clerics is a perpetual EQ nightmare for top guilds.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Will we need to do this as much on Combine ?&amp;nbsp; I hope not, but I know I will 2 box when I just want to camp something annoying, or log on for quick XP for 30 mins.&amp;nbsp; Mind you the 2 box then will prob be my RL wifes Shaman, which is a main anyway :)&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;U&gt;Now for Inflamatory statements.&lt;/U&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As for "need before greed" loot.&amp;nbsp; There&amp;nbsp; is no such thing.&amp;nbsp; Everyone "needs" everything that drops and deserves a fair go at it.&amp;nbsp; This is absolutley the case for pickup groups, period.&amp;nbsp; About the&amp;nbsp;only time its not is&amp;nbsp;when your camping something for someone specifically, and thats understood from the start. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As an Example, if your camping the Ghoul Lord room in LGuk, the enchanter in the group needs the Yak just as much as the warrior does.&amp;nbsp; he needs it to be able to trade it for something else for his class that he does need. Be that spell components, equipment, or ANYTHING. Otherwise, there is no incentive for him to be there, except XP, or being nice etc.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; When its a group of friends, sure there will be 'do this for me here, we go do this for you there', but when its random pickup, there isn't any.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Using the same camp.&amp;nbsp; Have a War in the goup, yak drops, he gets it (NBG), he leaves, next war joins, next yak drops, he wants it NBG as well.&amp;nbsp; Very soon people go 'what the hells the point' and you won't be able to do it at all. It HAPPENS, all the time.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;On a server such as The Combine, there is no 'Greed', its NOT greedy to want something which can benefit your class, and its not greedy to want something so you can make $ to go buy something for your class, whatever that is.&amp;nbsp; In fact its the oppositie, its absolutley required to survive.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;There are of course different strokes for different folks, but I for one will run my groups the way i've done them for 5 years, without many issues.&amp;nbsp; You just need to make it VERY clear up front what the rules are, both initially, and when you add someone to a group.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Be far about loot, be fair and open about the way it will work, and you can get some long term, repeatable and **SMURF** fun groups.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;In the end, everyone in the group contributes, so everyone should share in the reward, espcially when you go serious delving.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Regards&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Attan - Shadowknight of TheCombine.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;dont get me wrong i have 2 boxed as well&amp;nbsp; to get a char cought up to rest of friends but... i never asked for a group to do it in and if i was invited i warned all involved i was 2 boxing until we could find a replacement. and lastly i never rolled for items for the second box or the one we waitred for a replacement for. i felt it wasnt fair that folks who were single tooning it got cheated .&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;but my biggest problem with 2 boxing is it takes away from group period when trains come and folks need to be on there mark&amp;nbsp; having warrior stationary while the 2 boxer tries to heal everyone&amp;nbsp; or mez things dont usually work out well and last i checked noone had 4 hands to run both chars effeciently.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;playing a single toon is to boring... i play multi toons because i was getting way to bored playing one toon. Also if u are smart u won't let the multi boxer roll with multi toons. 1 roll per person and then they can pick who to give the item to.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I started two boxing to help my 55th Paladin (main character rofl) catch up to my lvl 62+aa Cleric (secondary).&amp;nbsp; And it was quite fun.&amp;nbsp; I then did it a lot afterwards since the scant few buddies I know who hadn't left the game were not clerics and we needed a healer.&amp;nbsp; Had a blast.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;But, I didn't register my 2nd account for Beta; and I've very much enjoyed NOT two boxing.&amp;nbsp; And I find a bit of distaste for two boxers I bump into in beta.&amp;nbsp; Primarily because they either won't group or they suk at it and also have greed-before-need loot for both their boxes.&amp;nbsp; In fact, one two-boxed shaman I grouped with insisted he roll against my wizard and another chanter for a +3 INT, +12 HP item off the scryer.&amp;nbsp; Yah he's on my list of goofs to avoid grouping with.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I've two boxed on Quellious but what drove me to do it was that as I was levelling most of the game population had moved beyond the zones I was xp'ing in since I was a late starter, so the boxing to me was a reliable way to fill at least 2 roles in my own group or in another group. I always made it clear that I was 2 boxing if I was in a group with other people. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Hopefully on this progression server there will be plenty of folks to group with in low level zones so I have no plans to multi-box. My only concern is that by the time I get started on my preferred character class, which isn't unlocked until luclin, I will again be faced with the prospect of 2 boxing. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
