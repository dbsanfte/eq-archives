      <title>New hot zone (splitpaw) is DEADLY! Be warned!</title>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Reader's Digest version: Splitpaw = Worst pathing, EVER&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So I decided to give splitpaw a try, since it's the new hotzone, and I haven't been to 'paw since the revamp. Started pretty well, stuff is super easy, usually get 2, but so what. I pop LOD and work my way in a bit farther. I start getting strange adds, I pull two, start whacking one down, then next thing I know 1-2 more add. By the time I'm about 10 minutes from the entrance, this is happening regularly, so I start trying to figure out what the hecks happening. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So my next pull, I get one, and am sitting there meleeing away, and I get melee pushed a bit back. The elemental glares at me in frustration, turns around and runs off, doing a circuit of the room and pulling 3 others before finally pathing to me. Great, now I have 4 to contend with. This might be a bit interesting. Turns out I was right, as these 4 push me again, then turn around, run willy nilly through the depths of splitpaw and bring about 7-8 (total) elementals to the party. Death ensues, quite obviously.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I have decent gear, I have decent AA's, I consider myself marginally competent, but I really don't see how this zone is usable in its current state. As it stands, if you bring&amp;nbsp;anything less than a very solid group that is horribly overgeared for the content, or an enchanter that is really on his toes, you'll wipe to a pathing train. Which is really too bad, I was kind of enjoying mucking about and visiting a zone I haven't seen in ages, now there's no way I'll bother going back.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

The adds are below the level 50 level limit for banish.&lt;br&gt;2. You want to spend a star ruby on most ever cast (with reagent conservation).&lt;br&gt;3. You want to wait for the 2 minute recast between mobs.&lt;br&gt;4. You don't want exp/loot for the mobs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anti-summoned spells aren't really very effective in any situation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I personally enjoyed the unique and defining content more than the rewards, They really didn't upgrade anything I wore at the time except for the resists. I still would have done them without the resists though, the best one was subversion of course&amp;nbsp; a purley rogue perspective. &lt;span&gt;:smileytongue:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

When I made this zone a Hot Zone I removed several behaviours (such as spin stun, everything able to see invis, some mob placments) that I thought would dramatically and negatively impact the playability of the zone. I did not, however, do a comprehensive revamp of the zone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;We updated the pathing to Paw for the patch that introduced&#xD;
the Hot Zones but the pathing wasn't updated for that zone - my mistake! It&#xD;
should be updated with the next patch and I hope that what you're describing&#xD;
here will be less common. QA noted a definite decrease in elementals taking circuitous&#xD;
routes to get to you with the new pathing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Went to 'paw with a 75 druid and monk and we had some fun owning the mobs and PL'ing an alt.  Of course, with a monk pulling and the disparity in levels, it was relatively easy to survive until I healed on a 4-pull.  I died once and had to evac a couple times.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pathing and pulling get really hard the further in you go.  Two tanks or some form of crowd control are definitely necessary, and I'm not sure how a group of the appropriate level would fare.</description>

      <description>A friend and I wnt pretty far down in, just past the bridge at the intersection.&amp;nbsp; There are loads of wanderers qith a pretty quick repsawn time.&amp;nbsp; We had a good goup too.&amp;nbsp; All 75 except wiz (level 70) with decent AA: SK, cleric, BST and wiz.&amp;nbsp; We got to a point where we couldn't keep up with the respawn adds and wanderers.&amp;nbsp; Tough zone, but decent loot drops off the changelings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>I can't guarantee that all the pathing issues will go away but I'm hoping when we patch out the new pathing file it will at least be a little bit better.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>The major issue I've seen with pathing isn't limited to Splitpaw.&amp;nbsp; It's a universal issue with mobs and walls.&amp;nbsp; For example in Greig's End mobs start flipping out when they get close to walls.&amp;nbsp; If I try to tank in a corner and pet push plows a mob into a wall either the mob or the pets suddenly run out into the middle of the room and then path back.&amp;nbsp; The walls also completely block trying to target with the mouse even when over half of the mob is sticking out.&amp;nbsp; If I pull a mob and quick retreat into a corner the mob will almost certainly run around the middle of the room before coming to me.&amp;nbsp; However if I slowly retreat keeping my target close it's less likely to happen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;Paw is always good for a laugh.&amp;nbsp; Nothing like fighting 2 mobs (I think it's the water elementals who are unmezzable) when a third adds.&amp;nbsp; Suddenly, you're down to 2 mobs again and as you search frantically for the runaway, half the zone comes to visit.&amp;nbsp; People get used to ignorning assists when not on raids, makes for interesting times..</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;I dont find splitpaw to be that good of exp. Though when u end up pulling multiple mobs cause there are more mobs cramped together its hard to single stuff out. So,maybe its me,with revamp they added more mobs in&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;a hightly tightly compact area,and these guys hit hard and fast. So, if u dont have a twinked out tank or a mezzer ur pretty much screwed. Think if they took out some of the mobs it wouldn't be too bad..</description>

&lt;P&gt;Is the Ice-glazed collar a hotzone drop? If so, it might need a little tuning. I had one drop while soloing near the zone-in, I was going to run an alt over to loot, but then realized he had better from the fairy monster mission.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Considering the difference in difficulty between the fairy MM and grinding in paw, perhaps something more in the 130-140ish hp range would make sense (considering that the WoS random zonewide was 120 hp).&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;We updated the pathing to Paw for the patch that introduced the Hot Zones but the pathing wasn't updated for that zone - my mistake! It should be updated with the next patch and I hope that what you're describing here will be less common. QA noted a definite decrease in elementals taking circuitous routes to get to you with the new pathing.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;QA as in Steve the work experience guy on his lunch break?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;But seriously, if you have anywhere near fixed the pathing in Paw, my hat (if I wore one, which I don't, although I think&amp;nbsp;I would look really good in a fedora) goes off to you =)&lt;/P&gt;</description>
