&lt;DIV&gt;*** Anniversary Events ***&lt;BR&gt;--------------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;- Double experience!&amp;nbsp; To kick off the celebration, from 12:00 PM Pacific Time on March 16th until 12:00 PM Pacific Time on March 20th all normal experience rewards will be doubled!&lt;BR&gt;- Fabled NPCs have returned!

NPCs in Thurgadin, Kael, and Skyshrine are looking for help finishing up some of their collections.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;*** Missions, Quests &amp;amp; Events ***&lt;BR&gt;--------------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;- Fixed a bug in the Gilded Scroll mission that was not updating the scrolls when they are looted.&lt;BR&gt;- Five new unusual creatures have been spotted in the Demi-Plane of Blood. &lt;BR&gt;- The mini bosses in Anguish will now drop augments again.&lt;BR&gt;- Made some aesthetic changes to the Snowtail and Ghost encounters in Razorthorne.&lt;BR&gt;- Tailfang in Shar Vahl will now drop his tail on the Firiona Vie server.&lt;BR&gt;- The mission The Key to the Past should now hand out an appropriate reward.&lt;BR&gt;- Reduced the difficulty of the Oroshar encounter in Arcstone.&amp;nbsp; Oroshar should now be in line with the other four spirits. &lt;BR&gt;- Modified the Sundersky encounter in Arcstone.&amp;nbsp; Sundersky is now more powerful, but becomes less so after his four summoned winds are destroyed. &lt;BR&gt;- Collapsed all of the missions on Spirit Hunter Elijo into one mission: Mark of the Spirits.&amp;nbsp; Any previously collected spirit marks can still be turned into Spirit Hunter Elijo for task credit.&amp;nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;- Ao the Fourth Born now gives out a spell scroll reward for completing his mission arc.&amp;nbsp; If you've previously completed all 3 Skylance Missions, then simply hail Ao for your reward.&lt;BR&gt;- For the quest, Through the Portal, a fix has been made so that crazed scyrkins will drop the needed shards.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;*** AAs , Spells, and Disciplines ***&lt;BR&gt;--------------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;- Temporarily removed the AA Abundant Healing.&amp;nbsp; This ability was causing a conflict with the ability Gift of Mana.&amp;nbsp; As Gift of Mana is generally considered the more useful of the two, Abundant Healing has been removed until we can resolve the conflict.&amp;nbsp; Any points spent in Abundant Healing will be refunded &lt;BR&gt;- Dispel spells can no longer be blocked using buff blocking.&lt;BR&gt;- Harmonic Dissonance now has a 15 minute reuse time associated with it.&lt;BR&gt;- Pets will no longer instantly die when told to attack a trap they are not allowed to attack.&amp;nbsp; The owner will receive notification about why the pet did not attack.&lt;BR&gt;- You can now remove pet buffs even if they are stacked beyond 4.&lt;BR&gt;- The buffs in the pet information window will no longer show 0 time left in their tooltip.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

Added additional failsafes to prevent the Kromzek General from failing to leave a corpse&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** Special Notes ***&lt;BR&gt;--------------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;- We have made really good progress on the reported issues of increased zoning times.&amp;nbsp; We would like to thank all those that have helped with this by providing detailed information.&amp;nbsp; We know what the issues are and we are in the process of implementing our solution.&amp;nbsp; We hope to have a fix that can be tested on our Test Server within the next week or so.&lt;BR&gt;- Just in the last couple of days we were able to find the line of sight issue that some of you have been reporting.&amp;nbsp; Given how close we were to our next live update, we felt that there was not a sufficient amount of time to properly test this change.&amp;nbsp; For this reason the line of sight fix will not be in this update, but will go to our Test Server this week so that we can have the proper amount of testing time to ensure that our fix actually fixes the problem and does not create any others.&amp;nbsp; Thank you for your understanding.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
