Now granted, my group was mainly doing them for the lore, but it seems odd that after 3 tasks with normal and hard options, these final 2 tasks do not have a (hard) option.<BR><BR>Secondly, the melee reward aug (wurine sense stone, with improved dodge 3), while much more appealing than the caster aug, was a bit of a disappointment, mostly because it only had a slot 7 option, rather than say, a slot 7/8. Again, it's not anything I particularly need, but I know it's a desireable/hard-to-get mod2 for a lot of people, and the tradeskill ones are rather expensive. Since there is no equivalent "hard" task, it seemed like making this slot 8 might be fair.<BR><BR>I'm probably barking up the wrong tree to complain about itemization here, but I was mostly curious whether the lack of hard missions was a disrepancy or intentional. I'd heard about it from friends a couple weeks back, but hadn't tested it myself till today.<BR><BR>(Also very curious if those library doors in Dreadspire are intended to be perma-locked in spite of doing Melion's task/being able to lockpick them, or not...but that's a grumble for another day.)<BR>

<P>I can't really help with the itemization aspect of it the missions, but I'll pass the slot concerns along.&nbsp; In regards to the difficulty levels for the missions, after checking into this it appears the absence of the hard versions of those two missions is not intentional.&nbsp; The hard versions exist and I've corrected things so they are showing up on test now.&nbsp; Assuming no other issues are found on these missions they should be available after next week's update.</P>

<P>I ran through the first part of this task today as well and killing the greater wisps in Nek was giving me credit.&nbsp; When did you last run into this?&nbsp; If it's still occuring, what server are you on?<BR></P>

<DIV>I have completed all steps execpt the last one. I think I have explored every ruin in the woods and cannot complete the task. I had gotten the task a long time ago on a character I never really play. I don't remember who or where I got the task from. It's a fairly low level task. The charcter is currently lvl 20 and has had the task for quite a few levels.</DIV><BR>

<P>I checked on this task on Test and was able to do the explore without any trouble.&nbsp; Did you check the Iksar ruins near the second waterfall?&nbsp; When I was there, there were a few Iksar pariahs in the ruins.&nbsp; Let me know if you've tried those ruins or they don't update the task for you.</P>
