    <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Mystical attuning is&amp;nbsp;groovy, but I wouldn't put it ahead of any HP/Avoidance/Mitigation aa's for warriors at least.&amp;nbsp; And I imagine thats why you run into a lot of folks that don't have it.&amp;nbsp; If you dont AA fast enough to get all of one expansions aa done before next come out (and I think most do not, me included) then theres always gonna be something&amp;nbsp;else that looks more important in the newest batch of aa's.&amp;nbsp; There may be a point in progression where MA is an absolute necesity for war's, but&amp;nbsp;I haven't reached it yet, and that has included Tacvi/Anguish up to AMV/DoN to YarLir&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>Two AAs I see that a lot of tanks lack and tis not a good thing.</title>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;When I play my 70 Cleric or Shaman, I notice alot ( about 80%) of the tanks I buff whether they be Paly, SK or Warrior do not have enough buff slots open. I explain to them that "Mystical Attuning " is a very good AA to have its 5 levels allowing more buffs to be cast on you up to 20 buff slots, this is especially important with a Bard in the group or a Cleric casting Panolpy of Vie&amp;nbsp; and Hots or a Shaman casting Leopard or Ferine Avatar. Most reply it is a waste of time and is low on their priority of AAs to get. I disagree.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Another AA I notice alot of Warriors lacking in is "Weapons Affinity" which is 5 levels and allows your weapons to proc more frequently, this is especially beneficial when the warrior is trying to hold agro. Some Warriors I talk to think this is another low priority AA, once again I disagree.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Odd but the truly good tanks and epecially the well geared tanks I have grouped with all agree on the benefits of Weapons Affinity and Mystical attuning. The not so good tanks are going for weapon crits and reflexive mastery. Now reflex is a very good AA for defensive but really should be balanced out with other AAs. Not having a buff slot open for Spirit of Sense (improved less hits on you by mob) and PoV that mitigates damage will be detrimental to the not so well geared tank.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Frankly my 70 Warrior has&amp;nbsp;gets more benfits from Sos and Pov than filling out his last DoD reflexive mastery AAs, (though he is working on then). I have found that a tank performs better if he has open slots for HoTs, PoV, SoS and Leopard. Just my opinion.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>This is a mixed bag in my opinion. It depends in part on your character, your gear, your playing style, and the zones you visit.&lt;br&gt;MA is useless for me. WA is an absolute must.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I for instance have no use whatsoever for MA with my warrior at this time. This however is because I have spent a lot of time in the 60-66 range raising defensive aa's getting better gear, and augments. I do not think I have ever had need for more than 5 buffs on my warrior since lvl 60. This is because all melee stats are maxed via gear/augments, and because I can't use the required lvl 70 augments that give me better abilities. As a result, all of those stat buffs are worthless to me, unless I can get one that increases my max stats, and that's still only 1 or 2 buffs, and I seldom have the opportunity to group with individuals who have those buffs regardless. Therefore, I'm frequently running around with 2-3 buffs at most, unless in a raid, and even then it's usually only 4-5 buffs. So I'm nowhere close to needing more buff slots, so why waste the aa's on them now (that's a fair chunk of time/aa's for buff slots I wouldn't use)? I get far more bang for the buck getting more defensives, and offensives. My warrior just made 66 a couple of days ago, and with his normal virtue, or if I'm lucky a conviction (usually his only buffs) I'm still over 9k hps and 1.7k AC, this is more than adequate to tank the mobs that I'm going after in WoS, lower GoD zones, and a large chunk of PoP. (Stack Vie, HoT's and I'm up to a whopping 3 buffs!! 4 if there's a haster along) True, I've got 150-odd AA's, almost exclusively in Defensives, and HP's with a couple in utility aa's such as AE taunt, and WA5. You just need to be careful with blanket statements like this though, because there are a lot of variables that impact a tank's ability to take on mobs. I admit that leveling to 70 with no aa's and not very good gear would make MA very important. My level 65 Beastlord for instance is almost always maxed out on buffs(despite having 250 aa's), and needs to get MA next very badly, but my warrior most definitely does not need it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Matt, you'd be surprised.  Start stacking Coldain Clickie, Form of Defense (Level X), Oak/Symbol/Ward or CV, Wunshi, Fort, Might/Avatar or Champion, Panther/Lingering Sloth/Pestilence Shock, HoT, Haste, Hunter/BBB/SV/Predator, Main Damage shield, GoD/Tribunal/Seasons depending on zone/mob, LoD, Infusion, SoW/SoE/DMF/JBoots/Selos, Dance of Blades, you can easily run out of buff slots in today's era.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;Don't forget the fact that **SMURF** like Chaos claws has become the trend for mobs, meaning you need to keep room up for detrimental spells, or else they start to overwrite your precious buffs.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;Personally I've held off on most of the buff slot AAs in favor of raw tanking AAs.&amp;nbsp; I just pick and choose my buffs carefully.&amp;nbsp; For the most part I am able to leave 2-3 slots open in a 16 buff window for HoTs, Procs, and that very annoying Chaos Claws.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;I haven't maxed that AA line yet, I stopped at 3/5 to do some of the DoDh AA's, but I'm close to getting annoyed enough to get 4/5 and maybe even my next Keeper's progression.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Actually, any approach is going to get you the same means to an end.&amp;nbsp; Either you grind out AAs at lower levels slightly slower and have an easier time taking on more challenging content as you level... or you grind out levels with some difficulty, and then raise your AAs at a faster rate... or you mix n' match.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Levels still give your character greater overall power than most AA skills, as it allows you to generally raise skillcaps, and change the level difference between the you and the mobs you're fighting.....&amp;nbsp;AND the ability to&amp;nbsp;train some more powerful AA abilities (ironic, isn't it?)&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Balancing AAs and Levels is like balancing your gear... at first you look at it like, do I go for AC? HP? avoidance? shielding?... should I get faction here, look for rare drops here... and it all looks like so much to do all at once.&amp;nbsp; Just take your time, plan out what you think will be the greatest benefit to you and go for it...&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Unless you throw your exp into innate &amp;lt;insert random unused stat&amp;gt;... you really can't go wrong if you know how your class works.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

I went the level route to 65 with only a few aa and I did fine over the long term but short term it was a pain trying to get into groups because I was getting eaten alive without the solid tools needed to tank the zones. The 65ish zones to day are far more brutal then what I was tanking so it's even more important even though casual gear is much better then what it was.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;I would certainly try to obtain the basic CA/CS/PE before dinging 65 because thats a really significant chunk of damage you don't have to worry about anymore, PoP defensive is a must post-65.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;My toon was created long before AA was even a twinkle in a sony exec's ATM card.  When I hit 70 I had about 250-300 AA's.  I feel incredibly sorry for anyone today who has to balance AA's with levels.  When it was just level Luclin, and 60 vs AA's it was easy to realize that levels were king.  When PoP came out, AA's started to bounce back and forth with Levels for which was more important.  I think if I tried to level up a new &amp;quot;main&amp;quot; today and have to choose between levels and AA post 60 I'd go mad thinking I was a pinball stuck between two huge bumpers.  Non tank classes can cope a little but for anyone starting a warrior or knight today, I feel for them.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

However, it's not just that people don't have mystical attuning.  At least in the case of an SK, 21 buff slots is simply not enough.  Depending on group makeup, I have about 30-35ish good buffs I have to chose from, plus 3-4 detrimentals that will frequently be on me when I'm tanking, that I have to select down to 21 buff slots.  Warriors have 5-7 less buff slots needed than an SK, pallies have several less as well.  Even if I'm keeping a close eye on my buff slots, I'll frequently fill up, even in exp groups, when I get tashed, chaos claws gets procced, and someone sneaks in a regen- chances are, that next HoT isn't going to land.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Mystical attuning is&amp;nbsp;groovy, but I wouldn't put it ahead of any HP/Avoidance/Mitigation aa's for warriors at least.&amp;nbsp; And I imagine thats why you run into a lot of folks that don't have it.&amp;nbsp; If you dont AA fast enough to get all of one expansions aa done before next come out (and I think most do not, me included) then theres always gonna be something&amp;nbsp;else that looks more important in the newest batch of aa's.&amp;nbsp; There may be a point in progression where MA is an absolute necesity for war's, but&amp;nbsp;I haven't reached it yet, and that has included Tacvi/Anguish up to AMV/DoN to YarLir&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Mystical Attuning is a godsend, yes, but it's not a be all end all on a tank's worth. There was a time before MA that warriors had to juggle their buffs. Yes, now there is more buffs that are almost a must have, but a GOOD tank knows what buffs he MUST have and which he can do without.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;When I play my 70 Cleric or Shaman, I notice alot ( about 80%) of the tanks I buff whether they be Paly, SK or Warrior do not have enough buff slots open.

&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Another AA I notice alot of Warriors lacking in is "Weapons Affinity" which is 5 levels and allows your weapons to proc more frequently, this is especially beneficial when the warrior is trying to hold agro. Some Warriors I talk to think this is another low priority AA, once again I disagree.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Odd but the truly good tanks and epecially the well geared tanks I have grouped with all agree on the benefits of Weapons Affinity and Mystical attuning. The not so good tanks are going for weapon crits and reflexive mastery. Now reflex is a very good AA for defensive but really should be balanced out with other AAs. Not having a buff slot open for Spirit of Sense (improved less hits on you by mob) and PoV that mitigates damage will be detrimental to the not so well geared tank.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I will admit I don't have Mystical Attuning. I do have most the other's that have been talked about on this thread though. The reason I don't have Mystical attuning yet, is mainly because I work on my AA's in a "Needy" matter. I found myself lacking in the defensive, cleric's having to actually ask for a second to med, etc. I improved that, then had a problem with aggro (as I was in higher content, and was against higher then even con mobs), and decided to work on aggro AA's (The one's listed by TSW). Doing the Aggro AA's greatly improved my DPS as well, so I had found a two way benefit on this. My proc'ing AA's maxed, etc. Then I decided I needed AE taunt (I know, should have got it sooner, but didn't find myself needing it till I started having to pull... ADDS, lol). &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Adding more buff slot's for the majority of time, isn't on my highest of priority list, since I don't normally have over maximum buffs on me at one time anyways. I ussually have over 3 to 5 slot's left, and if I need one, I can take one off that is less needed. To me, it's one of them Nice to have AA's, but not a "game breaker" in my need for AA's. I have over 240, and have only broke into a small chunk of what there is, untill I either max my aggro and defensive AA's, or find them no longer a problem for the content I do, I won't be trying for more buff slots. &lt;/P&gt;</description>
