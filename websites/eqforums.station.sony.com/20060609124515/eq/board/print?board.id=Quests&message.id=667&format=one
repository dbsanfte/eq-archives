				<DIV>I am currently doing the half elven tradeskills for the new cultural and I have some questions as to why the disparity in the things needed for the masters level items. Mainly the base hides needed for the swatches. For the half elfs, halflings, and iksars the base hide needed is racnar hides. Racnar only spawn in three places in the game skyshrine temple(on cov faction), Dragon necropolis(again cov faction unless you are hunting them in the halls of testing, which realistically requires a strong group with cov faction to get there or at least a coh mage to get past the entrance), and veeshans peak(requires a mini raid and ros faction to hunt there). </DIV>
<DIV>Now compare that to the other base fiber for leather for everyone else shissar scales. The only requirement to get these is to be able to get to ssra temple and be able to hunt the zoneline. This isnt so much a question about it being broken, or about the factions involved, as much as it is about why the disparity between the two, wouldnt it have been easier than coding for seperate to make em all shissar scales?</DIV>
<DIV>Anyways anyone have an answer?</DIV>
