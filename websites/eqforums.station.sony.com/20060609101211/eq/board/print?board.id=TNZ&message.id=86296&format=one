				<P>Thank you for your comments, this has helped my understanding a lot&nbsp; <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0></P>
<P>I had no idea drops were so good at the Chardok ent on the Burning Staff, getting 40 drops over 2 days (8hours playing time) sounds good to me. We thought the drops at Royals would be better.</P>
<P>I am in a 3 year old, off peak guild on an old server. We are not whiny PL'd 65's. We just got a shock when we discovered the bottleneck for elementals.</P>
<P>I now think we will avoid elemental planes altogether. We will kill Luclin and other mobs and maybe do Ssra a couple of times a month (Saturday nights for big Raids, rest of the week LDoN and small events)&nbsp;and in a year we will have our 40 active players (3-4 group raids) upgeared to do GoD. We want challenge but we also want fun, doing Ssra every saturday for months wouldnt be fun&nbsp;. VT shards arent fun from what I have read, and not a lot of challenge since they have to be farmed and if you cant farm them then wayyyy too time consuming on top of the normal time. Farming VP keys looks like its un fun also, Trak is only up occassionally, it will take months to get all the teeth.</P>
<P>In the meantime we will hope for changes to old world zones and LDoN scaling for less than 36 person raids and less than 6 person groups.</P>
<P>The biggest issue apart from all that is the freezing/rebooting bug its causing us to cancel events and lose members <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-mad.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0></P>
