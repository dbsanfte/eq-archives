<P>"The true issue on this thread, is that you dont want to garner any aggro at all so that your pet can tank multiple mobs while you or someone else heals it."</P>
<P>You're right,&nbsp;pets having different rules than players is so unfair.&nbsp; Just as healing pets should get aggro for the healer on the&nbsp;socially-aggroed adds,&nbsp;pets should get all the player tools to deal&nbsp;with thereafter holding the heal aggro (higher than social aggro) on said adds,&nbsp; or regaining it once aggro is lost.&nbsp; AE taunt, weapon affinity AAs for&nbsp;aggro proccing, etc.,&nbsp;so the adds don't go kill the mage and healer if you respond to the heal aggro appropriately with the pet!&nbsp; Excellent plan.&nbsp; &nbsp; And&nbsp;also, from now on, pets&nbsp;can have a setting to take aggro over players with less aggro in melee range, I think that is so far, good call.</P>
<P>Why didn't we think of this before?</P>
