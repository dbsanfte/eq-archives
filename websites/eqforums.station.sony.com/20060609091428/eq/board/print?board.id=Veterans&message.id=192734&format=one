I had the task (solo) before we took on Okahn (or whatever exactly the name is).  4 of the people in the group got thier mark .  I and one other person didnt.  We were all in xp range, got xp, were not zoning, etc.  He also had the task solo. We couldnt figure out why it didnt update for Ssindar or me.</p><p>We then tried several more saturday and failed like 4 times... (we didnt know you could do it in a raid, thought it had to be singlegroup /sigh)</p>
