    <description>-----------------------------&lt;br&gt;TEST SERVER CODE UPDATE 11/8/04&lt;br&gt;Please remember that all changes on Test are subject to change and may not make it to Live servers depending on the results of testing.&lt;br&gt;Thanks for playing on Test!&lt;br&gt;-------------------------------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- The /autofire command should work for non-GM clients now and various bugs related to it have been fixed.&lt;br&gt;- Added code to check and validate specialization skills. If the values are not legal, the player informed why they are not legal and they are reset.&lt;br&gt;- Added popup confirmation dialog when you attempt to give an augmented item to an NPC.&lt;br&gt;- Added chat message when submitting a /bug as feedback to let you know if it was submitted or cancelled.&lt;br&gt;- No-rent containers no longer poof on login if they contain items. They instead change into an unenchanted container with the same number of slots, and a chat message notifies the player.&lt;br&gt;- The Tradeskill window will now allow up to 500 total favorites (up from 100) across all tradeskills.&lt;br&gt;- Added optional parameters to /book command -- /book open, /book close&lt;br&gt;- Fixed a bug with haste items and haste augments. Their effects were stacking when they shouldn't have.  It will now only take the greatest haste effect from the item including augments.&lt;br&gt;- Fixed bug where a player that has over 2 million plat in his inventory was unable to purchase anything from a vendor or trader.&lt;br&gt;- /yell messages are no longer displayed if the yelling player is in your ignore list&lt;br&gt;- /Melody should now be working properly.&lt;br&gt;- Some models that were scaled dramatically could cause the collision system to fail, resulting in warps to ceiling and other strange side effects. In particular the vases in dranikcatacombsa at 1000,-1011, 0.&lt;br&gt;- Players standing on the lip of an edge should now slide off them more smoothly. This should dramatically reduce how often players experience 20k fall bug (which is still being looked into) and also make it much easier to get out of the water in many situations.&lt;br&gt;- There have been some optimizations to the collision system. You may see improved performance in zones with very large stationary objects (potimea, bloodfields, etc).&lt;br&gt;- Fixed problem with the Beastlord AA Bestial Alignment where if you had maxed buffs this AA would not reset if it did not take. &lt;br&gt;- Duration enhancement focuses and AAs should now increase the duration of pet buffs.&lt;br&gt;- The spell Nature's Blight was not increasing the damage as stated and should be working as intended now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;----------------------------------&lt;br&gt;TEST SERVER CODE UPDATE 10/25/2004&lt;br&gt;Please remember that all changes on Test are subject to change and may not make it to Live servers depending on the results of testing. &lt;br&gt;Thanks for playing on Test!&lt;br&gt;----------------------------------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-- Auto attack should now turn off when the player feigns death.  This should be true whether the player uses a skill (monk) or a spell (necro, sk, etc).&lt;br&gt;-- Fixed a number of small bugs in the zoom camera behavior.  These fixes include removing the possibility of having the first mousewheel click causing the camera to bounce back into first person, a bug that could cause the camera to get stuck “one click” out of first person, as well as smoothing out the camera motion a bit.&lt;br&gt;-- Scrolling to third person and tabbing to another window should no longer cause the screen to bounce back and forth.&lt;br&gt;-- /autofire is now available for testing. To use this, make a social key that uses the slash command "/autofire". Please be sure to let us know of any issues with this command. &lt;br&gt;-- Mounts should no longer be dismissed when zoning. &lt;br&gt;-- Summoning mounts in certain places should no longer cause players to fall through geometry.&lt;br&gt;-- Getting out of water should be much easier to do. &lt;br&gt;-- Berzerker: Hastenend War Cry should be fixed now.&lt;br&gt;-- If your stored AA's go above 30, they will no longer be set to 30 when you zone. However, you should still not be able to gain more than 30 unless you get a refund, get the AA from a GM, or get an AA from a script.&lt;br&gt;-- Spell scribe timers (putting a new spell into the spell book) now take only 1 second.&lt;br&gt;-- Players should no longer experience 20k falls when standing on cliff edges while suffering from low framerate. Please be on the lookout for collision problems and /bug with detailed locations if you experience any.&lt;br&gt;-- Fixed an issue with Half Elf Paladins of Tunare and the Origin AA.&lt;br&gt;-- The bounding radius for small races was too tall, preventing them from accessing some areas. For example, gnomes couldn't enter the small huts in steamfont. This was a global problem, that is just an example. Please be on the lookout for any movement or collision issues related to small races.&lt;br&gt;-- You may notice various NPCs that had been standing on tents or otherwise not where they should be are now properly positioned. Please bug any NPCs you see that appear to be incorrectly placed.&lt;br&gt;-- Weather effects should now be working properly when the Wake of Karana spell is used.&lt;br&gt;-- Sounds related to starting &amp; stopping of various weather types due to zoning and Wake of Karana should be working correctly.&lt;br&gt;-- Added NO_PET to item description window which will be displayed when an item has this flag.&lt;br&gt;-- Changed /who commands to display both class title and base class name for players over level 50, e.g. "Bedazzler (Enchanter)"&lt;br&gt;-- Fixed a bug that caused a lot of writing to the dbg.txt file during a raid&lt;br&gt;-- Bazaar trader mode is no longer cancelled when going from windowed to full-screen and vice-versa.&lt;br&gt;-- Fog effects are no longer carrying over into other zones.</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;The timer also does not reset if an illusion is already on.&amp;nbsp; I rather enjoy my&amp;nbsp;illusions and click&amp;nbsp;them often.&amp;nbsp; I almost never use this AA because I end up wasting it more than not.&amp;nbsp; With a reset as long as it is and the cost of the ability, I think it would be nice to at least have the timer reset when an illusion is on or overwrite illusions that do not give the statistics it does or something of that nature.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>Pretty much all AAs as far as I can tell don't reset if they get the "This spell did not take hold" message. If I hit rabid bear when I have Pestillence Shock up, I get a "Your spell did not take hold" message and the ability is down for 2 hours.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Shaman's Spiritual Channeling AA has the same problem as the above-mentioned Beastlord and Ranger AA's where if you are full on buffs it doesn't hold and still "uses" it, and the timer doesn't reset so you can't use it for 36 minutes.&amp;nbsp; Thanks.&amp;nbsp; =)&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>wrt Bard fizzle rates.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Assuming that the fizzle rates are the same it is more of a case of perception.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bards continuously cast new songs - every 3 seconds - whereas there are few other magic users that continusouly cast spells (every 3 seconds).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So if the rate is 1 fizzle in 100 (for instance), bards will get through 100 casts much quicker than any other class of spell user.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Aye, thank you very much for the response, it's greatly appreciated.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;And not to beat a dead horse, but are you truly saying that there has not been a significant drop in people online over the past few weeks, and that it does not effect gameplay at all?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>Harmful, I can see where you are coming from there but that's something that will need to be considered by the designers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bheran &amp; Healerith, the population of the playerbase is always something we pay close attention to. Server populations and guild memberships are things that will always have a certain amount of turnover even in the best conditions. My own experience as a player has shown me that when guilds that are stable for a long time suffer from loss of key people that often times the remnants of the guild is too slow to recruit new people. This has the compounding effect of making it harder for the rest of the guild to stick together since they can no longer do what they used to be able to do and morale drops. My suggestion to you is if maintaining guild strength is important to you, then you need to be as open with guild recruitment as you can stand to be. Regardless, just try to have fun because ultimately that's what it's all about. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Healerith, your question about Nature's Blight is not something I have the answer to and the person I think could answer it best is on vacation right now. Probably a good idea to try to get this subject going on your class forum somewhere since it's really a tuning issue you are bringing up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meresya/Polara, we did make a change where a bard getting feign death effects will cause the last song to stop. That was definitely a bug and should be fixed at this point. It was missed in the release notes. As for the fizzle rate issue, I can't speak for the design staff schedule about reviewing the situation. I do know that preliminary tests show that the fizzle rates are consistent with the fizzle rates associated with the spells that were tested, but this was only a preliminary test on a few songs that were allowed to be cast about 30,000 times each. At this point, the designers have the means to verify the fizzle rates are matching what they specify for the songs (as in, we are able to determine empirically that there are no code bugs causing more fizzles than expected), and the issue of if they fizzle too much is something that needs to be discussed with the designers at this point. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;MartosMT, the tuning issues you bring up are clearly important to you but unfortunately this thread probably isn't the best way to affect changes since it's just a test server code update thread and I don't have much say in that stuff.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seffrid, sorry you've had an unpleasant experience. There's a lot of people that work at keeping EQ going - 50+ on the dev team alone, and a good number of QA, hardware IT guys, and probably more people than I realize - and it's not always possible to get every bug to the right people. I'm the right person to fix this sky issue you describe, and I'll ask QA to try to identify what is going on. Everything has been working to the best of my knowledge, perhaps it's a specific hardware configuration bug. It wouldn't be the first time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Felrynn_FD, I looked at your JPGs and what is going on there is due to some settings that just need to be tweaked. The new sky system does render things differently and the 'horizon band' as we call it is something that should not be so visible. I'll ask about getting some time spent on making this look better.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vjik, I don't have any information about Turn Undead AA, sorry I can't be more helpful there. The main person to ask is on vacation right now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hope that answers some questions,</description>

When on 11/19/04, I asked who was assigned to do this, TSR-BradG replied: "you are asking me specific questions about our internal operations that I cannot answer, just as any other company we regard that information as confidential."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(2) Grumbuk at 8:55 a.m. on 11/23/04 writes: "...perhaps it's a specific hardware configuration bug.

You can check his statement out here:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=tech&amp;message.id=79137&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(3) Grumbuk on 11/23/04 writes: "I'll ask QA to try to identify what is going on.

We have already filed a truckload of bug reports about fog.  Some of them kind, some of them very straightforward, for example: "FIX THE FOG ALREADY !!!!!!!!!!!"  Sheesh, the fog has been around since March 2004; I can make a promise to file a bug report about fog every day until Christmas. Will that help?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(5) People have sent tons of materials to Sony.  Do you think Sony transfers them to the developers? No, it simply deletes them.  You want proof?

Gratz!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yep, just noticed that. Amazing. Well it don't matter.

I'm done fighting with Sony, I should have quit long ago.]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Zil"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;END OF QUOTE&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;People have been in a p*ss-off contest with Sony for EIGHT months because of fog.&lt;br&gt;* I personally quoted a countless number of times Grumbuk's written promise he made on April 8, 2004 to fix the fog.&lt;br&gt;* I wrote to Brenlo, to every TSR I know a name of, to developers (including Grumbuk except that his personal message box is disabled).&lt;br&gt;* I filed countless number of /bug reports, kind, obscene, and everything in between, in hopes to draw attention to this issue.  If one puts together my fog-related /bug reports that I wrote from Maiden's Eye alone, it would be a book.&lt;br&gt;* We challenged Sony to publish computer specs of at least one computer that does not have fog - Sony never did.  I installed EQ on a brand new Sony (!!!) computer PCG-K33 - it has fog there. &lt;br&gt;* TSR-RobertE wrote that he had communicated everything about the fog to the Development Team and that things at that were out of his control.&lt;br&gt;* TSR-BradG wrote to me in a personal message: "Re: So, any news on FOG? Believe me the second I have some info on it I will be relaying it."&lt;br&gt;* This is a part of the message I sent to Brenlo, TSR-BradG, and many others on 11/14/04: "Can you come forward to us and say whether you are EVER going to fix the fog, or are you simply waiting until we all quit?  What information about the fog have we not yet given to you during the 8 months that the fog has been around and during which Norrath has looked like the ugliest game out there?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Today, on 11/23/04 at 9:11 a.m. PST, a historic event has happened.  Through the writing of TSR-BradG, for the first time in the history of mankind Sony admitted, in public, in writing, and of its own will, that fog "is not an issue with any users computer".  It took us EIGHT MONTHS of bloody fight (with multiple account terminations) that fog is not a problem with our computers but a problem with EQ code.  TSR-BradG now uses this as a pretext to delete the tons of information we provided to Sony.  And 14 minutes away from that historic acknowledgment, Grumbuk is saying that he thought everything worked just fine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Grumbuk, stand up from your chair, walk over to TSR-BradG and Brenlo, and ask them: Have you ever heard about fog before? BradG, is it true that you wrote in plain English that fog is a known issue, Sony can reproduce it, but has no idea how to fix it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In case anyone wonders what fog is, consider these two screenshots. One of them from February 1999. The other is from now (published by Felrynn_FD):&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;http://www.damagedgoods.com/software/Everquest_Preview/wfpsunset.jpg&lt;br&gt;http://img46.exs.cx/img46/3208/sunsetgay3.jpg&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here is another sample of how EQ got broken (published by Drakah):&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;http://www.shakahr.com/tmp/supposedtobe.jpg&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The phenomenon you see on these screenshots is known as “fog”. It’s been around since March 2004 DX upgrade that was supposed to provide an eye candy to the EQ community.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you don’t know whether you have fog, go from PoK to West Freeport during Norrathian DAYTIME and see which of the two screenshots better represents what you see there. The bottom line is this: if in the Freeport newbie yard you don't see wall to wall, you have fog.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;/em waits for the fog fix since March 2004.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gwyth</description>

      <description>I can see from the pictures what people are referring to. The reason why this hasn't hit my list as a bug is because it is in fact working properly, it just isn't using settings that are what you (and the people you are referring to) would like. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The fact is, fog is going to be different now and the sky will probably never go back to the DX8 look. The artists always try to tune the settings as best they can to make it look as good as possible, which if they want can be pretty close to the old system but it will never be exactly the same as the DX8 sky/fog. Based on the feedback I'll suggest the settings get reviewed, perhaps they can be improved to the satisfaction of more players.</description>

Any steps you take to try to reduce this problem is much appreciated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While I understand that its impossible to get the DX8 look back 100%, it should be possible to replicate the look nearly exactly by simply preventing the distance fog from being drawn against the skybox, and only have it drawn against terrain/objects.  If you look at the old screenshots I posted, you can clearly see that while the terrain is fading out in the distance, the sky is clearly drawn all the way down to the point where it meets the horizon.  Thats the way the old engine did it (going back to the DX6 engine), so it should be a simple programming change to redo how the fog is drawn.  Preventing the fog from being drawn against the sky should effictivly remove the "band" of fog all of us are complaining about.  The other issue is the *color* of the fog.  The old fog was a greyish color, not a blinding white.  Hopefully these changes can be instituted so we can enjoy our favorite pastime again.</description>

&lt;P&gt;I just wanted to post to say it's not just a sky display issue... ie. it's not just that the sky is more hazy than it was before... everything past x feet is more hazy than it was before.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;It does not really matter to me, as my wife and I are moving on from EQ, but I wanted to make that point, regardless.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>Thank you, skaal, for your comment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First, Grumbuk promised on April 8, 2004 in writing to fix the issue.  Then, TSRs on the technical board lied to us for eight months (!!!) that this was a known issue that was being worked on but developers hadn't had yet figured out how to fix this.  Now the developer shows that this was not even on his to-do list, and he doesn't even understand what the issue is.  Well, I guess I'll post more specific information later when I am in a better mood.  (I will take it from a fog thread that Sony deleted - I keep copies of those materials on my computer since I was sure Sony would delete them anyway...)  For now, however, it's just disgusting how unprofessional this whole fog issue has been.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To the cr*p that you see on the pictures he refers to as working properly per artists' designs (haha... I am about to die from laughter...)  EQ looks laughably in comparison with just about anything.  People labeled it as EGA-quality look.  They complained that they could not see farther than a few ogres' length.  I lost count of friends who quit from EQ (and not to EQ2, shall I note...) - there will soon be no one to complain about fog!!!  Whatever...</description>

      <description>It's not a bug Grumbuk. Purify Soul(Cleric) had its refresh timer reduced many many patches ago. Purify Body(Monk) has not had its refresh timer touched. The cleric and monk version cost the same amount of AA and the same amount of AA to upgrade through the PoP upgrade. The refresh timers imho should be equal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks for your response.</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;Does this mean there's testing going on now regarding the actual fizzle rates bards are seeing?&amp;nbsp; And is there any status on it, as it has been a very long standing issue (since PoP's release), as well as on the list of things for four months now.....&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Can you have them insure bards are included on the feigns death fix too?&amp;nbsp; If Shadowhunter in WoS (OoW) processes feign death on the group, the bard is left singing the last song active (assuming it is cyclic), and since the bard is feigned, there is no way of stopping it without standing, regaining agro in the process, assuming they are fast enough to so do before gaining agro on the next song pulse.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Since spells should be stopped, so should songs.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Has there been any conversations on the effect of playerbase attrition as how it affects the game?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I (and from what I read, many others server-wide) have been experiencing serious issues with people either leaving the game altogether or moving to EQ2 or "that other game."&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;In a guild that had broken into the E-planes a few months ago and regularly had 50+ people at raids, and now we hardly ever field 10. Some ideas that have been bantered about on some boards were server mergings and across-the-board increases in levels of abilities that could be gained (ie: making knights more viable main tanks for raid mobs, increasjng druid/shaman healing power, cleric utility, etc). &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Thanks again for the new changes, as they are much appreciated.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
