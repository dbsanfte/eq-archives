				The FM caves with the mobs from the old Droga/Nurga are South of Droga, West of Nurga.  Closer to Nurga than to Droga, in fact.  These drop salts and skins more frequently than in Nurga/Droga.  It is more fun to get your faction up soloing (or grouping) in Nurga/Droga, as these zones are well laid out and reasonably challenging for such relatively easy mobs.  You are never forced to make more than a two pull (unless much lower level), and the proportion of casters is very high.<br><br><em>Edit:</em>  you can also get Chardok faction in Chardok B, which is very conveniently placed in Chardok <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0>.<p>Message Edited by Borek-VS on <span class=date_text>02-17-2005</span> <span class=time_text>08:31 AM</span>

				Yeah, I just got my Mage from max KoS to apprehensive to CoH people to the Chardok raid spots, and the goblins in the FM caves were definitely the easy spot to do so. They literally die in five seconds to the epic pet, and about 1/3 drops a skin and/or one or more salts. I'd go there for two to three hours and come out with a ten-slot backpack full of skins and salts... between that and some XP grinding in Droga with guild groups it took me 3-4 evenings.<br><br>FM caves are pretty boring, but the fast way to raise faction. Now, if only I hadn't pressed 'shift' rather than 'ctrl' a couple of times and accidentally handed in whole stacks rather than single skins and salts...

				<DIV>I love those goblin caves in the southwest.. very easy to clear them out with my paladin, and repops are very fast.&nbsp; That's where I finished up my faction work (that and turning in the skins/salts).&nbsp; Another tip: you can check your Chardok faction by conning "a goblin traitor" in the cave to the left.&nbsp; Just don't kill him!!!&nbsp; You will take a negative faction hit.&nbsp; The angry goblin also spawns in this cave, which is the final hand-in mob for the ring.&nbsp; This is where you will kill the named spawn.&nbsp; Also, a lot of goblins in this cave drop nice items for lower level alts.. like the (nerfed) circlet of shadows among other things.</DIV>
