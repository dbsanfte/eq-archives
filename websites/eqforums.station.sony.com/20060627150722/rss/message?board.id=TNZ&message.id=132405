      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;As a&amp;nbsp;level 5, shaman hunting in qeynos killing snakes, rats and such, this druid (level 40ish)sends me a tell. I didn't even know how to answer a tell, he explained how. He then&amp;nbsp; said, "want me to PL you?". I say "PL?" he agains explains. He then Ports us and takes me to some bandits camps, All the mobs were red and I was scared to death, He buffs me, hit me with DS and points to the first camp "go kill them" .We stayed &amp;nbsp;there&amp;nbsp;until I got to level 9. he then said he had to go, I kept thanking him, I was so amazed a stranger did this. I didn't know about the friends list, but i did write his name on a paper, which i lost a month or so later. I'm now level 70, and often go to the newbie areas and buff the lowbies. If i see a true new player (pretty much naked) I will offer some advice. If they accept and seem nice, I will stay with them and level them a little (not more than 2 level,s they need to work their skills and learn to manage mana and health). I will then give them some plat, decent equiptment or both. I keep them on my friend list a few weeks to make sure they are doing well. I think the best way to stay interested in the game is too help others. it's a real rush to see someone understand something new. To watch them gain confidence and really get into the game. I always ask them to please return the favor to another newbie&amp;nbsp;when they can. I've seen many acts of kindness, starting with that nice druid who took the time to help and explain to a newbie how the game works.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Well, like said earlier in this thread, most on my server considered me a noob. I started to play in July of 2003 on Feninn Ro, a server a RL friend played on). I made a dwarf paladin, who is my main to this day. FR is an old server and there are barely any low level characters that aren't alts. When I was lvl 6 or 7, I fianlly adventured outside of Kaladim, and learned the meaning of "TRAIN". Needless to say, the&amp;nbsp;halfinlinf who trianed me apologized and helped me recover my corpse. He then told me to /follow, which took me 10 minutes to understand. He took me to a goblin camp and proceeded to buff me. Having never been buffed by anybody, I started to freak. He clamed me down and proceeded to tell me he was going to power level me. It had taken me a week to get this far. I slayed goblins and looted up. He asked that i give him any bronze that may drop, which i did. One hour later I was 3 levels higher and very satisfied with my new friend Xenocyde, a 64 druid. I added him to my friends list said thank you and logged for the night.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The next night I logged in and started killing mobs in BB on my own again, and Xeno showed up. he gave me a hail and my trade window popped up with a full set of bronze armor and a Coldain Axe of the Frost. Apparently he was skilling up his b;acksmithing and instead of selling back the armor pieces he was helping the noobs in BB. I found out a week later that Xeno was a RL friend of the guy who got me into EQ. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Xeno's toon is still on the server, but the man that made the toon great, has since left EQ, I miss him and everyday if I see a low level toon, I help him out be it a buff, equipment or plat, I do what I can to carry on Xeno's legacy oof help.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Gimur DaTwink&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;62 Paladin of Brell Serelis&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Member of Platinum Dragons on Fennin Ro&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Flagged for fire!!!&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I would guess my main, a half elf druid, was around level 10 or 11 when hunting in Everfrost one day. A player called out that he had a Staff of the Observers (a really uber weapon in those early days of '99!) to give to the first person who found him. Most will know that Everfrost is a large and often confusing zone with some highly dangerous places for a level 10 character, so it wasn't going to be a doddle - especially as there would doubtless have been at least 30 people in the zone in those days, so the competition would have been fierce.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I made an /ooc enquiry as to what the staff was, so as to establish whether I wanted to try for it or not, knowing nothing about it at the time. As a result, I got a tell from another stranger who said he was a ranger and could track the guy for me if I was interested in the staff, as it wouldn't be any use to him. I thanked him, we met up (probably by Bandl) and off we went. Sure enough the ranger found him, and I got the staff.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;That weapon was awesome in it's day, and my druid equipped it well into his 30's, continuing against all the perceived wisdom to melee at least part of every fight as indeed he still does once the mob has turned as a result of being snared. Of course, he has a better weapon these days, but I'll never forget that Staff of the Observers and the two kind strangers who combined their kind deeds to enable me to receive it.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Prior to that, and on my first day in EQ I received a different kind of "charitable act" altogether. I had dabbled in the beta, and was struggling to "get into" the game, not really finding anything to draw me in despite a long period of playing CRPGs etc. I was missing that certain something. I was messing around outside Qeynos when a rogue sent me a tell, asking if I wanted to make a fortune? Of course, I knew it was a scam, but I was level 1 and bored with nothing to lose so I went along with it to see where it would lead. He explained about a pot of gold or somesuch corny reward awaiting me in a hidden location only he knew about, and said I should follow him and he'd show me where it was. Now I must stress I knew this was not for real, but for the first time in the game I was intrigued.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The rogue led me into the secret world of the Rogues Guild in Qeynos, through a false wall in the tavern, and down some corridors. "You go on from here alone and I'll meet up with you" he told me, and off I went - straight through a trap in the floor to a water-filled pit in which I died instantly to a phirana or somesuch. Duly resurrected outside Qeynos I got a tell from the rogue apologising and offering to bring my corpse out if I would consent to him dragging it - which in those early days included the ability to loot the corpse!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Needless to say I never saw my corpse, and I chuckle to this day at how little he made off it, and wonder how many other "suckers" he caught out. But, and here is the point of the story, when I feigned mock indignation at being ripped off (knowing all along that I would be), his reply was a classic, and I knew there and then that EQ was the game for me, the ultimate role-playing experience with other real people.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;He simply said "I'm a rogue, what did you expect?"&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Not a very charitable act, not a good samaritan, but he did do me the favour of drawing me into the game, and I've played it ever since - although the rogue is about the only class I haven't tried!&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;As a young enchanter, I received many unexpected gifts.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The two most memorable gifts my enchanter received, were from a total strangers.&amp;nbsp; The first one was a Robe of the Oracle.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I was at the bank in Freeport, getting ready to log off for the evening.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Before camping,&amp;nbsp;a very nice&amp;nbsp;druid approached me and&amp;nbsp;asked it I would help him trade some items with his wizard.&amp;nbsp; This was long before the shared bank came into existence.&amp;nbsp; I told him I would, but how&amp;nbsp;could he be sure I was trustworthy?&amp;nbsp; He replied that&amp;nbsp;my guild had a long history of being honorable.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So I helped him and after we were done, I scurried out the door.&amp;nbsp; I then received a tell from the guy asking me to come back.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;When I returned,&amp;nbsp;the trade window popped up and inside was a robe.&amp;nbsp; I asked if he needed to trade this&amp;nbsp;item also and he replied, no --&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;it was mine to keep.&amp;nbsp; I politely declined the offer, saying I&amp;nbsp;helped him out of the generosity of my heart and didn't expect anything in return.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; He&amp;nbsp;chuckled and said that he no longer needed it -- it was just taking up room in the bank and&amp;nbsp;it was his way of saying, thank you.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I must admit, it was quite a&amp;nbsp;thrill receiving something so grand.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It was a&amp;nbsp;massive improvement over the&amp;nbsp;gossamer robe I was wearing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The second most memorable gift, was while I was&amp;nbsp;visiting Queynos.&amp;nbsp; I was standing by the front gate, casting breeze and other buffs&amp;nbsp;on&amp;nbsp;all the low levels as they passed by.&amp;nbsp; It was a great way to practice my spells.&amp;nbsp; After awhile, a Ranger approached me and the trade window popped up with 2500p.&amp;nbsp; I quickly closed the window and told him he must have clicked on the wrong person.&amp;nbsp; He told me no, he had clicked on the&amp;nbsp;right person and&amp;nbsp;it was his way of thanking me for&amp;nbsp;keeping his alt buffed, which had helped a great deal.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;At level 16, I had only managed to save 300p.&amp;nbsp; Buying all those enchanter spells and trying to get my jewelry skills up, had kept me broke.&amp;nbsp; With 2500p, I was rich and didn't have to worry anymore about where my next cp was coming from.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;When I started just after Luclin it took me 3 days to hit level 5 on a wizard.&amp;nbsp; Then someone took about an hour to learn me the use of spells.&amp;nbsp; Equipment wise I would say an almost full suite of gnome skin armor on my rogue looked and felt bad ass.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Back when I was a young Paladin, I was hanging out in the East Commonlands tunnel (when it was so crowded you could hardly find a place to sit), and someone, out of the blue, gave me an Icepaw War Claw (1HS, damage 9, +3 agility, if I remember correctly).&amp;nbsp; I thought it was the best thing ever - a free, magical weapon (now I could fight willowisps), and it had&amp;nbsp;+3 Agility on it!&amp;nbsp; I considered anything with a stat modifier on it to be&amp;nbsp;the best of the best.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;I used it until I was well into my upper teens / early twenties.&amp;nbsp; It has since been passed down to my Druid.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I always want to return the favor to new players, but they are hard to find... and when I do see a very low level character in a newbie zone, I always wonder if they're just an alt, and wouldn't want anything I had to give.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Reading some of the posts I come to remember another time when someone helped me out.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I was in POK one night on my Shaman, at this time I was casting spells for donation so that I can practice my Alchemy Skill. A Higher level Pally came up to me and started to talk, I guess he liked the way the convo went, he asked for a few buffs with I gladly gave him and asked if he needed anything else. He said no but then asked what I was planning on doing, I told him I'm trying to practice Alchemy but low on PP. He asked if I could make SOW potions, I said sure how many would you want, he asked for three 10 doses and gave me 300P, I told him thats way to much for just three 10 doses. He said take it, consider it a donation to help you out.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;After I made him his potions and opened the trade window he gave me an additional 700P to practice with. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;He was a great man, and I was glad to have met him.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I remember in my first month (so March 2002) of playing sitting in Kelethin bank having a conversation with a RL friends I had introduced to the game about possible hunting areas.&amp;nbsp; Since I was about level 19 and she was about level 9 it was all on Faydwer and would have been very obvious that we were both completely new in the game.&amp;nbsp; During the conversation a much higher level player mentioned a couple of places we could try.&amp;nbsp; Eventually we both thanked her and moved on.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;As I was running down ther ramps I got a tell from her asking me to stop.&amp;nbsp; I did and she handed me a bracelet, it was a "Steel Wristband of Strategy", saying it came from a level 60 mob and I looked like I could use it.&amp;nbsp; I had never seen an item with such stats (+7 int no less), so I thanked her again before she gated.&amp;nbsp; It was the first (and only) time any of my toons have recieved a gift like that and I guess the only reason it happened was that it was obvious I was very inexperienced.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Sadly I didn't log then, so I have no idea who it was.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;As for me, what I do is log my cleric alt on whenever I die on&amp;nbsp;a raid and while waiting for a rez and /ooc "free Virtue and Temp at nexus stone."&amp;nbsp; Gets quite a crowd some evening if no one is selling :D&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I'm pretty much a newbie, as I only began playing the game in late May of this year. While my monk is now a proud 52, back when I was about level 4 or so, I had my first great good samaritan experience. I was hunting in the newbie area outside Freeport when I received a tell from an Iksar monk. I had never seen any Iksie yet and I hardly believed he was a monk. He asked me a few questions and then handed me two gems. I had never seen anything like those! He told me to sell them for some armor upgrades. I started to run off towards Boomba the Big but the Iksar stopped me and told me I would get a better deal at the female merchant farther in. I had no idea that Boomba gave lousy deals, but I also had no idea where she was! I followed the Iksie to her (near the entrance to North Freeport) and watched him feign death as a bunch of guards swarmed him. I had heard about this "feign death" and knew I had much to look forward to, but that was great to actually see it in action! The gems netted me about 100pp, a fortune it seemed! I don't know his name but I will always remember that time. &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;waaaay back in Oct / Nov 2001, when Brdaan was a lowly lvl 8.&amp;nbsp; I was hunting my spells in Neriak, when another chanter noticed me and started asking what I was doing.&amp;nbsp; Now note this is Rallos, a server not known for random kindness(more like random ganking), so being a bit concerned I answered anyway.&amp;nbsp; So, he and I talked for a while and he gave me a rod of insidious glamor(at the time still one of the best CHA items for a chanter), said it had served him well for a long time.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;this was probably the 1st real random act of kindness i'd seen, and I have been on Rallos from Jan / Feb 2001 with a couple short breaks for RL, but that was my primary for a long time and&amp;nbsp;I still have&amp;nbsp;it rod in my bag with me at 66, not that I wear it other than for a quick click&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;being as I am now getting old(just ask my kids), and can't remember anything, I don't have his name / guild anymore and i've rebuilt my pc a dozen times at least since then(now EQ has its own drive partition) so no friends list&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>My first character was a wood elf ranger girl on Lanys. I must've spent so much time in the newbie grounds dying, a druid woodelf (I think she was level 50-60 at the time) decided to help me and ported me from Kelethin to WC, then ran me (I was scared out of my wits, being in a new zone) to EC tunnel where I ducked away from all the trolls, ogres and iksar that were wandering around. She told me to stay there so I didn't move an inch and kept camo up. A couple minutes later a dark elf girl came along looking around, then I got a tell from them asking where I'd gone (was still invised hehe). She told me to drop invis so I did, then she handed me a bunch of tizmak leather and a shaded blade. I was amazed. Then she ported me back to butcherblock and she showed me to CB where at level 5 she had me running around slaying orcs (it would take me a while though cause my slashing wasn't good). I believe she helped me get to level 7 and also camoed me into the CB throne room to show me the Lord. It was awesome. =)&lt;br&gt;I believe her name had Nature in it somehow. Thank you, wherever you are. =)</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;This was some time early in 2000. I was playing a Dark Elf Necro, level 16 at teh time and had decided to check out this forbidding looking place called Befallen. I zoned in and landed slap bang in teh middle fo someone else's train. Next thing I know I had been feared and running all over teh place, well I ended up falling through a hole in teh floor and into the third level. When I got back to Befallen, everyone else had left and there I was trying to get corpse back. I petitioned, didn't know the GM's ignored those types of petitions at teh time and ended up sitting at zone in now level 9, waiting for an answer. Well,&amp;nbsp;I've been sat there for over 5 hours gradually working myself into a right panic when this guild zones in en masse and proceeds slaughter everything in sight, I'm in total panic by now, it's 3AM in the UK and I have no idea what to do, but I get this tell from an iksar asking what a youngster of my level was here for ? I must have blasted his poor eardrums with my scream for help to get my corpse. Next thing I know i get told, to 'consent' him and I had no idea what he meant so he had to explain it all to me, one minute later there is my corpse and he keeps coming back with others. I'm just standing there not believing my eyes, I couldn't thank him enough.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Well.. gee, there have been so many.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The first one was just a few minutes after I was born. Back in 2001, a newbie who started in Surefall actually started just outside of Surefall. That tunnel is really hard to get through without a light source. (Yes, I think I was born with a candle but I destroyed it somehow).&amp;nbsp;I had run into the tunnel, gotten turned around, and run back out of the tunnel about 6 times and was about to make it a 7th when a kind stranger stopped me. He told me to wait a moment, went and got a Fire Beetle, brought it back to where I was standing, slew it, got the eye and handed it to me. I thought he was a little weird until he explained that the eye would help me to see better. I was vastly relieved to finally get into Surefall.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I made it a point to go back there a few months later and look for newbies having the same problem, and give them all fire beetle eyes. &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I the past 16 months that I have been playing I have encounterd acts of kindness too numerous to count, but the one that sticks out in my mind is the one on the FV server when I started an Ikasr Necro there.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I was in PoK and not able to understand any of the many shouts going on.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Ushing emotes I expressed my frustration at not knowing Elvish to no one in particular.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Then I got a tell from someone named Bitz (or Bitzy I don't recall exactly) a gnome cleric. The tell was in my own language asking if I would like to learn Elvish and Human Tongue.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;She spent the next 20 minutes teaching me these new languages and when she was finished, said, "Wait here." and disappeared into the bank.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;When she returned, she gave me 1000pp, said "Good Luck" and disappeared.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I have since learned from other people that this particular gnome cleric makes a habit of helping newbies on the server in such a manner.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;Ok, this was a &lt;STRONG&gt;long&lt;/STRONG&gt; time, ago, in 2000 when Dinosaurs ruled the earth and red dragon scales were used to make &lt;EM&gt;armour&lt;/EM&gt;.&amp;nbsp; I'm an (almost) naked level 4 or so inkie fighting spiderlings in Nektulos with my nifty&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;tarnished&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;B*st*rd (name filter..grrr...)&amp;nbsp;sword, when a nice&amp;nbsp;Tier'Dal lady stops me by newbie log - she says only "Shadow knight!" I stop, and a Silvery Bracer and Symbol of loyalty to Vox appear in my trade window.&amp;nbsp; She says "Hit trade" - I do, and before I can catch her name or say thank you, she's gone.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I've been the recipient of about a zillion acts of kindness since, but that one still sticks in my memory.&amp;nbsp; I wore those bracers for a long time, and was pretty reluctant to trade them out.&amp;nbsp; I still have them today :D&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Total newb, first character, everyone said go to PC. I eagerly ran to PC, I saw another player begging for help to get his corpse, crying how he'd deleveled, then terror rained as i experienced my first real train! Zoned, logged. Returning later i was hit by a bandit at the tunnel entrance, as the bandit turned to leave I foolishly followed only to be jumped by many others, I ran, no map, no sense heading, no knowledge of loc, I died. Shaken, fearing the permanent loss of my hard earned gear I didn't know what to do. In desperation I shouted for help, not expecting any, when Shadowshardz answered my call. I was invised and escorted to the camps where we found nothing but abuse from the group hunting there. When in desperation I told her many thanks but I didn't want to waste her time, I returned to the tunnel to camp-out. I recieved a tell from her asking consent, she'd found me! My corpse was returned to me an she kindly offered to group with me, feeling relief gratitude an ineptitude I turned her down an logged. I often wish I had done differently that day. I saw her again when playing an alt, she once again came an gave my pet some things without my requesting it. I recently crossed paths with her and although she didn't remember me I had the chance to once again say thank-you and tell her of the awsome impression she made on this newb. Had I lost it all that day, I may have quit in frustration, Thankful I didn't&amp;nbsp;its one more gift she's given me, all she ever requested of me was to return the kindness, I always do.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;When&amp;nbsp;my main was in her early forties, she died in Timourous Deep, and the corpse, with all of my gear, floated to teh bottom of teh ocean.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I hadn't hit loc before I died, so only had a vague idea of where the corpse was, and spent over 2 hrs searching the ocean's floor for the corpse.&amp;nbsp; So I /ooc'd "Can anyone help me find my corpse?" and a necro answered.&amp;nbsp; We grouped up and he used his 'find corpse' spell to take me to my body (this was before necros got a lower level Summon Corpse spell and he wasn't high enoug for the spell yet).&amp;nbsp; He was very patient, as I was slow and kept losing him, and my corpse was FAR into TD.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I wish I remembered his name, I had him on my friends list but the my computer crashed and I wasn't able to retrieve any files.&amp;nbsp; Ah well, he probably doesnt remember me anyways, this was a couple of years ago, at least.&amp;nbsp; But I remember his kindness, and I pay it forward when I can.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;This was posted a month or so ago, but it was such an awesome experience for me that I don't mind posting it again.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I&amp;nbsp;had a level 15 barbarian shaman I had been working on for over&amp;nbsp;2 weeks.&amp;nbsp; The spells were starting to get expensive for this constantly poor character so I had been farming spider silk, bone chips and bat wings to sell in the bazaar.&amp;nbsp; I had also been casting SoW, and other low level shaman spells for "donations only if you can afford it" in the Plane of Knowledge.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;One Saturday night I was having trouble sleeping so I got up and thought I would run into the PoK and:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;1.&amp;nbsp; Practice summoning food and drink (working on conjuration skill)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;2.&amp;nbsp; Practice "True North" (working on divination skill)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;3.&amp;nbsp; Cast SoW and other low level spells on others for possible donations (but absolutely not required!)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I sent out an /ooc to let everyone in PoK know that I had set up shop at the big bank and proceeded to cast my practice spells until someone came around looking for some "fleety feeties..."&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I had been there for about 15 minutes and&amp;nbsp;had probably cast SoW a dozen times on various toons.&amp;nbsp; Things were slow.&amp;nbsp; I had noticed this one character fleeting around near where I was standing.&amp;nbsp; He had been there for about 5 or 10 minutes.&amp;nbsp; He suddenly came up to me and opened a trade window.&amp;nbsp; In it was 1,000 platinum and he had already clicked on the "trade" button!&amp;nbsp; I was shocked!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I immediately clicked on the cancel trade button, fearing that he had made a very serious mistake, but he immediately opened the trade window again.&amp;nbsp; Same amount!!!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I accepted the trade and then asked him why he was doing this.&amp;nbsp; It was such a shock to me.&amp;nbsp; I figured "no harm, no foul."&amp;nbsp; I could simply give it back to him when he realize the error.&amp;nbsp; But he came back and said, "I have well over 60,000 plat.&amp;nbsp; I simply do this on occasion because I can, friend."&amp;nbsp; Well, I couldn't believe my good fortune!&amp;nbsp; I immediately /kneel in his presence and thanked him.&amp;nbsp; I asked if there was ANYTHING I, as a wimpy little level 15 shaman, could do to thank him.&amp;nbsp; His response, "Do the same thing some day when you are in the same position, friend."&amp;nbsp; Doing a quick /who, I found that he was a "Level 69 character!!!"&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Flush with 1,000 platinum, I went off to the bazaar to see if there was anything I could purchase that would improve my "shammy" but didn't find anything of interest.&amp;nbsp; I guess I was just&amp;nbsp;getting sleepy again.&amp;nbsp; So, I started to leave the bazaar and go back to PoK when suddenly a trade window opened again.&amp;nbsp; Another 1,000 platinum!&amp;nbsp; All I had to do was click on the trade button.&amp;nbsp; Well I did it and found it was the SAME character that had given me the plat over in PoK not, 30 minutes earlier.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Again, he reminded me that this was his way of helping the game and others.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;This made such an impression on me that I went back to PoK began casting&amp;nbsp;SoW and every other minor spell I had on anyone that hailed me.&amp;nbsp; I forced those that wanted to donate to keep their donations and told them, that someone else had donated for them and that as long as I could keep my mana up I was casting until no one else wanted SoW.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I managed to cast for at least an hour with brief "sits" in between to bring my mana back up.&amp;nbsp; That was a complete blast!!!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I do not plan on giving out the name of my benefactor as I don't want him to be overwhemed by beggers, etc.&amp;nbsp; But I&amp;nbsp;have him in my friends list and I check every time I jump on to see if he is online.&amp;nbsp; I can hardly wait to be one of the first to "/salute" when he dings level 70!!!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I will remember this for as long as I play&amp;nbsp;Everquest.&amp;nbsp; One day, I hope to be able to identify a lowly character, practicing his skills and working to increase his plat, just like he did.&amp;nbsp; I will give me the chance to continue the legacy he started with me!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I hope this brought a smile to your face!&amp;nbsp; Generousity like this is uncommon, and I hope to do the same thing one day!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;/KNEEL....&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;/BOW.....&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;/SALUTE&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;As a post script to this story, three nights after this message was originally posted in TNZ, I logged on to EQ and did a quick who on my friends list and found that my benefactor had in fact made level 70 in the few days since this event occured.&amp;nbsp; I was able to be one of the first to send him a /tell congratulating him on his accomplishment.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;BTW, he is still in my friends list and I see him on all the time.&amp;nbsp; Since I don't want to be a pest, I don't say hi much but it is comforting to me to&amp;nbsp;know that he's always there, protecting the less powerful in Norrath!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;This was when my bard was in the mid-40s... not sure if that qualifies as "newbie", but I'm going to tell it anyway.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I was scrounging for cheap&amp;nbsp;gear upgrades in the bazaar, and&amp;nbsp;just about to leave, when a higher level bard&amp;nbsp;by the name of Jukebox walked up and inspected, then&amp;nbsp;hailed me. I returned his greeting, and he began asking me&amp;nbsp;questions about my character, how long I had been playing, what I wanted to accomplish, etc. I was a little confused at first, but I answered each one, and next thing I knew, the trade window opened up with a Thunderous Drum of Karana, and he had already confirmed the trade.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I paused for a long time, in disbelief that someone was just giving me such an amazing drum. They sold for about 10k at the time, which was about 10x as much money as I had ever seen at once. He told me to go ahead and take it, and I finally clicked trade. He told me to equip it, and let him know how I liked it (I loved it!). I thanked him many times... hopefully not enough to make a pest of myself.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;That was probably the one&amp;nbsp;main thing that motivated me to stick with my bard, and&amp;nbsp;get him to where he is now. Unfortunately, I think the bard who gave me that drum left the game, because I haven't seen him around for a long time. If I do, I will definitely have to thank him again :smileywink:&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
