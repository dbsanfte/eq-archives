      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I am a 70 ranger only about 85 AAs only defensive AAs I have is PE, natural Durability 3, combat stability 2, and Combat Aility 2. I was playing with a 65 Pally (with only like 20 AAs and pretty much no Defensive AAs) friend boxing a cleric. I let him tank and noticed he was taking far less damage than I was. I was self buffed and brell had 8500 hps and 1756 AC. He had Tenacity and had 7800hps and only 1576 AC. I also imagine that our defense, parry, and dodge skills were close since I am 5 levels higher than him. I am fully aware that I&amp;nbsp;am a crappy&amp;nbsp;tank so I usually don't. But that got me a little confused. I thought that AC and defensive AAs alone determined how much damage you take. Do we have some kind of mitigation penalty or tank classes have an innate bonus?&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;So I'm in Ashengate tonnight working on a few quests when our SK tank goes AFK and we get an add.&amp;nbsp; Ok, no problem, I go to agro, and the rogue in my group says "don't worry, going defensive, lasts 5 min".&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Is there any reaaon at all we can't get something like this for us Rangers?&amp;nbsp; There is no reason at all I can think of that we should not get the disc's of our parrent class, but somehow, a rogue needs them.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Since the release of TSS I have had some problems with my nuke reset timers, heres the deal.&amp;nbsp; Pre-TSS i could chain 2 fire nukes(Heath Embers and&amp;nbsp;Ancient:Burning Chaos)&amp;nbsp;and 2 ice(Ancient:North Wind and Frost Wind).&amp;nbsp; Now after TSS went live I can chain 2 ice (Ancient:North Wind and Icefall Chill) but only when I cast either Heath Embers or Volcanic Ash I begin casting the second and it never finishes casting, although I do see the spell bar going across.&amp;nbsp; Nor does it say anything when I begin casting although the spell is highlighted on the spell casting bar.&amp;nbsp; So im limited to three of the normal fire/ice nukes excluding summers dew which doesen't work as well while others are down.&amp;nbsp; From every other ranger I have talked to they don't have the same issue and are able to cast fine.&amp;nbsp; If talked to a GM and told me to run a complete file check, and use standard UI, done both and still diden't work and I filed a bug report and now 2 weeks later it still doesent work.&amp;nbsp; Any suggestions of what do, or anyone having similar problems? Any feedback would be great, thanks.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>A kinda Ranger Backstab ability...</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Rangers&amp;message.id=8555#M8555</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;As a high end Ranger I don't understand why Sony will not give what most rangers want. Our bow has been a joke most of EQ, back in pop when the AA's fist came out it for once was worth having. It did more damage then our melee weapons and I'd say it seemed most rangers including myself were very happy. Over time it has been dumped down and never really given any attention to, so now even with the best bow in the game it's once again almost totally worthless. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Anyways, like how rogues have a Backstab ability I don't see what rangers cant have a "Critshot" or "Sharpshooter" ability that runs off a 12 second timer and uses some endurance. We have a Disc (Trueshot) that is almost pointless to use other than the fact that our melee Disc is so bad I try and avoid using it so I don't start swearing to myself about how some punk that made it somehow felt it was so class defining and uber luber cool~&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I don't see why an ability like this can't&amp;nbsp;travel through our levels getting stronger as we get better versions of it, kind of like the new kick disc we have. The things that can be done with AA's on the bow is somewhat limitless. We could snare, dot, blind, stun on and on. It could make some great AA's and really help define the ranger class. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Eq is one of the best games because of the options you have with your character. This has always been the thing that held EQ back for me and I know many others that I have talked to, lack of the use of our bow. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;At a point in time when&amp;nbsp;I have 13k+ wizzys standing next to me on raids I don't see why it matters that we have a 1k or 2k more HP than them. Our AC and defense wont help us anymore than if it was = to theirs. I'm not asking to be equal to a berserkers, rogues or wizzys DPS but It would be nice to be above our our own melee dps using our bow. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Btw, why is track not like the Bazaar's track to find a trader???&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>Ranger Trainers: Disarm</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Rangers&amp;message.id=8546#M8546</link>
      <description>So, I noticed I have 20 training points from levelling to 74, and since&#xD;
Disarm has been a bit of a pain to level up, I decided to burn all 20&#xD;
in Disarm to get it to 180. I go to my local ranger trainer after&#xD;
hitting Origin, check Disarm in the training box, check the required&#xD;
plat to skill Disarm and go get some plat from the bank. Upon clicking&#xD;
the button to train Disarm, the trainer announced that he could train&#xD;
me no further in Disarm. Are the trainers still coded to think Disarm&#xD;
caps at 75?&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;A href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Rangers&amp;amp;message.id=8479" target=_blank&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Rangers&amp;amp;message.id=8479&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I've been in an Anguish+ guild for over a year now, and I was using the Bow off Freatha from RSS. Good bow high delay good damage, I just recently got the Plaugebreeze and it took a while to get.&amp;nbsp; I was wondering instead of trying to gear up to better bows through Drops why doesn't Sony Entertainment experiment with combining Tradeskills with Components that can be put on the lower Raid mobs and best componets on the zone&amp;nbsp;Boss mob? &amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;So instead of getting a Bow from Time, and getting a Bow from Anguish, and your bank is now full of Bows from other places now. Why not tradeskill the bow to a Higher level much like the Augmentation that can be made better from Jewel cutting. So this would work a relief on the bottlenecks Bow drops, it would utilize the strength of EQ, which is the Questing. Fletching would become more interesting again for many people, and the Fletcher can make class specific bows.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (:smileyvery-happy: How cool would it be to see a Pally Cleanse an undead mob with a bow, or through fletching add a Componet that changes it to SK spell Theft of Hate Recourse.)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;With this kind of Bow System in place you can continue to create Bow drops in current content&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;furture raid targets and choose to place a Bow or a Bow Componet on the loot table like the Bazu Stone.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The draw back of putting this into place is the Coding it would require to make it happen, but with that might not be to hard since the Augmentation portion is in place and in essence you would just be adding onto it.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;This idea is not new really, Rangers have the Trueshot Bow quest and this could be expanded,&amp;nbsp;you could make the bow better by doing certain quests.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I love that quest,&amp;nbsp;would be nice to see something more done with it, and something like this can&amp;nbsp;lend itself to the other classes.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>Hello Rangers,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm hoping to get some advice on the usefulnes of the Planestriders Hauberk.&amp;nbsp; The prices on the chain pattern seem pretty reasonable on my server (~10kpp) and so I was wondering how useful other Rangers thought the chest piece would be for a 56 Ranger like myself.&amp;nbsp; I'm not, for the record, especially fast levelling given the time I have to play - so it would be &lt;i&gt;quite&lt;/i&gt; a while until I could actually cast PotW on my own.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So,&amp;nbsp; I guess I'm wondering if anyone has feebdack pro or con on spending in the neighborhood of 10k on the ornate chain piece over other upgrades.&amp;nbsp; I don't have a magelo to post yet, but I'm at the point where masters level DoN cultural is about equivalent to my armor.&amp;nbsp; The click effect on the orante chest piece seems worth the price, but I was hoping to get soome others' feedback.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks for the advice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Bow delays and ratio vs dps</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Rangers&amp;message.id=8530#M8530</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I don't understand exactly how to determine DPS with bows and arrows.&amp;nbsp; I'm sure the info is here somewhere, but I haven't been able to find it.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Also, I'm trying to understand something about bows.&amp;nbsp; The Soulseeker bow (looks to be the best) has a dmg 45 with 26 delay and range of 210.&amp;nbsp; Now, that gives it a ratio of 1.730769.&amp;nbsp; From what I have read, the fleeting quiver makes it a 45/20.8 bow with a ratio of 2.16346154.&amp;nbsp; With the 50% haste potion and fleeting quiver, does that mean it's a 45/7.8 bow with a ratio of 5.769231?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Posts have stated that the fleeting quiver is an arrow haste and not a bow haste.&amp;nbsp; Arrows say 0 delay so how does that work?&amp;nbsp; I mean 20% of 0 is still 0.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;What's possible with a bard or chanter buffs?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Is there a cap on how fast a bow can be?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Obviously my formula isn't right since this doesn't even take into account the haste of worn items (which I believe cap at 46%) or special haste clickies like the one in Time.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I'm a very mathimatical person so if someone would post a formlua of all the possible ways speeds enhance bows, I'd greatly appreciate it.&amp;nbsp; I know it's possible to have over 100% haste so there's got to be a basic speed to start things.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>Ranger 49 &amp; 52 nuke, why so torturous to get them?</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Rangers&amp;message.id=8489#M8489</link>
      <description>Both of these quests are miserable. It seems unless you multi-box, they aren't going to be doable until 60+.&amp;nbsp; Finding a group in this level range is hard enough, tyring to convince a group to do those quests, blah :(&lt;br&gt;It doesn't seem like there will be an upgrade till 64 o_0&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The 52 nuke almost feels like a necessity to distinguish a ranger from the other classes in this level range while grouping. The dots are worthless in a group, no one cares for ranger buffs in the low 50s, the heal doesn't do anything.&amp;nbsp; So I'm stuck with a 180ish hitting nuke and melee dmg that's rivelled by mage/bst pets still.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don't see sk's or beastlords having this problem. Their nukes are not only superior to the ranger version, they are easily obtainable,&amp;nbsp; but they also have other useful spells to cast while in a group too :/&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is there a balancing reason for this?&lt;br&gt;Is this a dead issue since no one cares about the 50s?&lt;br&gt;Are there plans to make these researchable atleast?&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>TSS, how did we do Equipmentwise?</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Rangers&amp;message.id=8479#M8479</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;We had a discussion not long ago, that our improvment in archery needed to come in the form of itemization. while I did not completely agree with it, I did agree 1) part of it did, and 2) the drop rate of bows, especially raid bows is so low, that it could well be the majority of rangers, even those that raid are still using planar bows or treant bows.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Seriously, there are soo many awesome range items out there, that most ranges end up wth the worst range items in stats, foci and clickies, etc.&amp;nbsp;then virtually every other class.&amp;nbsp; And even when a decent bow drops, it is just as often picked up by a rogue, war, sk, or pallly who may just be taking it for "when" they use a bow.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Guild raids maybe 5 times per week, and I am surprised if I have seen one bow drop every 3-6 months.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Anyway we can get an increased drop rate and some bows that rival the other decent equipment in the game for stats etc?&amp;nbsp; Maybe the addition of more "ranger only" bows?&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Obiwonkanobe on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;10-06-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;11:06 AM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

      <title>Warning!  Bandolier Bug!</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Rangers&amp;message.id=8470#M8470</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Just wanted to warn you folks about a bug with the Bandolier that affected my ranger today.&amp;nbsp; I have an unaugged Druzzil's Composite Treant Laminated Compound Bow that I have been using as my main all-purpose bow.&amp;nbsp; Today I bought a second one and a Volcanic Sink Geode (150 dd proc aug) from the DoN merchant to go in it.&amp;nbsp; This way I would have one bow for root-and-shoot and another bow for&amp;nbsp;slightly more DPS with the aug's proc, and I planned to use the Bandolier to switch easily between them as the situation requires.&amp;nbsp; But the Bandolier is bugged!&amp;nbsp; It will not switch back and forth between the two bows; it just leaves whichever one is already equipped in place.&amp;nbsp; I have /bugged it so the devs will know, and /petitioned to get my wasted plat and crystals back, but I thought I should warn my fellow rangers about this bug, since using the Bandolier to select between differently augged but otherwise identical bows seems like a&amp;nbsp;blatantly obvious thing to do.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <title>Epic Effect going to 75?  Did I imagine that</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Rangers&amp;message.id=8468#M8468</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I was certain I'd read that one change that was coming in with TSS, was that our nuke focus on our Epic was going to go up to level 75.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Did I imagine that?&amp;nbsp; As it stands now, on Lucy, even after the big update, Oshimai's Blessing and Grinbik's Blessing are both listed as capped at 70.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Does anyone else know whether these are scheduled for improvement?&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>Archery</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Rangers&amp;message.id=8465#M8465</link>
      <description>Is anyone on the live servers have trouble with archery/arrows. I notice when i show my bow from a distance my arrows fly straight into the sky and never hit the mob, but if i'm really close and can see my misses on the target mob... i get hits. Just wondering if this just prog server problem or serverwide problem. Thanks for feedback in advance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maxiius&lt;br&gt;60 Warder of the Combine&lt;br&gt;Realm of Insanity&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
