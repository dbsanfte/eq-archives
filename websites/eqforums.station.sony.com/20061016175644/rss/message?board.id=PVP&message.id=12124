When you are being spammed by hackers 15-20 lines of text is usually not enough to catch the offence. If GMs would simply walk around, watch some pvp fights or go to zones like Crypt of Nadox, PoV, PoF where it is common to find level 70 warriors using the Earthshaker / Disc exploit to kill the whole zone while powerleveling a group of people, they could witness the cheating first hand. The Earthshaker exploit is so common now that people “WTB (Earthshaker) ES Pulls” in general chat.

And no I don’t want to go back to a blue server, I just want to be on a pvp server where cheating is the exception and not the norm. &lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>I have to heartily disagree with anyone calling Earthshaker&#xD;
powerleveling a blatant exploit. I think it's an old piece of&#xD;
player-crafted technique content that should be left in.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
In cases where it has caused problems, I would have to agree with the&#xD;
way GMs have handled it, when they've actually chosen to intervene to&#xD;
do so. As far as I've witnessed this means leaving ES pullers alone&#xD;
most of the time, but if an ES puller decides to train and kill Plane&#xD;
of Valor while several groups are trying to straight exp off the same&#xD;
mobs, then suspending and/or banning the ES puller for zone disruption.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
I think ES pulling is harmless as long as it doesn't interfere with&#xD;
normal grind experience, etc. Once it starts interfering with that&#xD;
you're coming closer to an early DoD style universe in which the only&#xD;
highly acceptable forms of experience are paid for, and let's face it,&#xD;
that's not what the intent of the games' designers was. &lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
In my opinion, don't remove the content or ban its users, simply make&#xD;
it clear that this kind of niche powerleveling must be performed&#xD;
without the disruption or harassment of players who aren't choosing to&#xD;
partake in it.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
As far as greater hacking exploits are concerned, I think Hotmix&#xD;
touched on a very real, longstanding, broader concern: GM effectiveness&#xD;
where issues that are difficult to /report are concerned.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Not only do GMs almost always request a /report for hacking&#xD;
accusations, but also for plain 'ole harassment and disruption reports,&#xD;
such as training, etc. It is extremely hard to capture an effective&#xD;
report to this end. I haven't seen any trainers enter a zone and /ooc&#xD;
HEY IM GONNA TRAIN YOU TO HARASS YOU NOW recently. I doubt you have,&#xD;
either. The best you're likely to get is to the effect of.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
trainerdude says out of character 'inc train'&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
you say out of character '**SMURF**? **SMURF**'&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
trainerdude's trained mob hits YOU for 834438943 points of damage&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
trainerdude's trained mob hits YOU for 834438943 points of damage&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
trainerdude's trained mob hits YOU for 834438943 points of damage&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
trainerdude's trained mob hits YOU for 834438943 points of damage&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
trainerdude's trained mob hits YOU for 834438943 points of damage&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
you have been slain by trainerdude's trained mob! returning to bind point&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
please wait...&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
And you're not even going to get those helpful indicative labels for&#xD;
the mobs. In the end, all you'll get is a GM contacting trainerdude and&#xD;
trainerdude saying the train was accidental and a result of botched&#xD;
exploration in the zone or something similar. The same is true&#xD;
reporting hackers, they're not going to be admitting to hacking, and&#xD;
/reporting chat as proof of something someone wishes to conceal is&#xD;
nearly impossible. &lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Either GMs need to commit some active patrolling of PvP and exp-heavy&#xD;
zones, or they need to find a quick and easy way to parse logs to&#xD;
detect hacking, harassment, etc. Until they do we'll be doomed to&#xD;
submitting utterly useless, non-revelatory reports that don't **SMURF** any&#xD;
of the offenders whatsoever and to facing the fact there really is no&#xD;
effective system in place by which harassment and hacking can be&#xD;
reported and dealt with.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
And please, if you don't play the PvP server, or maintain an&#xD;
antagonistic attitude towards it, don't enter this board and trash on&#xD;
it. We play here, most of us would never consider playing anywhere&#xD;
else, most of us hate you&amp;nbsp; just as much as you hate us, so stay&#xD;
where you belong and let us try to provide valuable feedback here in&#xD;
the hopes of working out the kinks on our server. You all get a new one&#xD;
on June 28th. We don't, so we're trying to fix the one we have.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

      <description>I think SOE should keep zek around so these idiots don't ruin the pve servers. Get them all in one server and let them wreak destruction on each other.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&gt; - Earthshaker pulls, aka shakerpaging, are not exploits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I suppose bard AE DoT kiting wasn't an exploit either...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;IIRC a GM actually took an Earthshaker away from a group of people on Stromm shortly after OoW launched when they were using it to kill half of PoFire at once.  It is possible they were using pathing exploits or warping hacks at the same time though, I don't know the full story I just know someone lost an Earthshaker then. lol&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Zunnoab-Stromm on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;06-05-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;04:28 AM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;My sense is that they don't really care.  EQ is a game in decline.  Its peak subscribership was long ago.  For Sony, it's all about riding this gravy train until it pulls into the station now.  That means not spending a lot on new development, and putting what development effort they are still willing to invest in it into the things that are going to generate revenue (like new expansions).  The unfortunate reality is that putting more GMs on Zek to observe people doing these things isn't a money maker.  Neither is addressing the structural issues that make the PVP system so screwey (see the top ten issues post by Pinhead) right now.  Don't expect that to change anytime soon.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We've all been ganked by the player who seems to be able to gate, and succor, and track when their class shouldn't have those abilities.  Yeah, it sucks, but it's been going on for years.  Its obvious that SOE either can't stop it, or, more likely, they aren't interested enough to spend the money that it would take to stop it.  You'd probably just accept that it's a reality of everquest PVP.  About all you can do is vote with your feet and play some other game (or on a non-PVP server) if it bothers you that much.  Lets not forget that it's a game, and games are supposed to be fun.  When it stops being fun, it's time to do something else.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;lol, eq hasnt been fun for a while now, its more or less is a way to bide your time while theres nothing else to do.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;But i would not want to see eq go, i like interacting with real people, doing that makes console games lame cause everything is basically preset. and starting a character on another mmorpg like WoW or something, is not something ide want to do givin all the time i have in on my char. if/ when&amp;nbsp;eq goes under ill be done with games.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</description>
