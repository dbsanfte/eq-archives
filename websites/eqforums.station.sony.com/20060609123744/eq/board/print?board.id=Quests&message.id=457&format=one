<DIV>The maid and the butler were not common spawns.&nbsp; We will have to wait to see if they work or not.&nbsp; I have been trying for the last several week to do the call of flames mistmoore part before the revamp.&nbsp; In that time I have gotten very familiar with a&nbsp;number of quests, and as far as I can see, many are now broken.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I have not yet found the Avenging Caitiff (for the turn in of the fangs) in Lfay.&nbsp; But then with several checks a day and often several hours a day spent in mistmoore for the past three weeks, I didn't find him there either. My own ranger appears to be too young to be given the quest from the quest givers in Kelethin (I bought the fangs).&nbsp; I have a friend with a ranger of appropriate age who will be trying the quest to see if there are changes in it or not.&nbsp; Should get a report back in a day or two.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The Hemo Entologist (for a rogue quest) was always on track while I was trying to get the Caitiff.&nbsp; He was no where to be found in Lfay (I have spent several hours tracking and criss-crossing the zone).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I don't know what mobs drop the Mistmoore Granite (or is it gargoyle granite, I get confused with the LDON smithing drop), haven't looked at them all yet to see what is known on Alla's.&nbsp; However, there are no gargoyles outside, or at least none that have popped while I've been tracking.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I have spoken to Ssynthi, who has been moved outside.&nbsp; She tells you to get the flower from the crypt east of her.&nbsp; Unfortunately, due east is the zone wall.&nbsp; No crypt.&nbsp; Not quite due east is the shadowman tower thing.&nbsp; I've climbed all over it and found no ground spawns.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I understand as well that the Task system tasks for both Splitpaw and Mistmoore have not been fixed/updated.</DIV>

<P>I can help with a couple of these.&nbsp; The maid/butler have definitely moved to LFay.&nbsp; Look in one of the old orc camps.&nbsp; They spawn there, but you may have to wipe the camp a couple of times to get them to pop.</P>
<P>The Hemo Entologist&nbsp; pops over at the totem.&nbsp; Again, you may have to wipe the MoBs there a couple of times for that particular critter to show up.</FONT></P>
<P>Hope this helps a little.</FONT></P>
