&lt;DIV&gt;Late October 12th the Witches of Stillmoon staged an unplanned raid to kill Greig Veneficus. The poor guy never had a chance. There were three deaths during the raid all quickly rezzed by our heroic cleric one of which was our first loss the other two being two of your officers sacrificing themselves to keep a larger than intended pull from reaching the raid. In the end we took down Grieg with no deaths during the battle. Everyone did an absolutely outstanding job following raid directives and beating the fight right outa the arrogant SOB. Everyone left happy and satisfied with a job well done, a couple with excellent no-drop loot, this was an excellent practice run o our raiding prowess and if it's any indication it won't be long before we start Planar progression as a guild. &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
