<DIV>There is one other thing.. I'm not sure if this is a bug or not, but I feel as though it's worth mentioning.&nbsp; I scoured the boards looking for information, but didn't find anything.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I mentioned in another thread that I was able to do the Kunark Landing quest over and over, yet I am unable to obtain the same task twice from the OT and DL taskmasters.. I'm confused.&nbsp; I have spent up to 30 minutes spamming the taskmasters to try and get the same task again, with no luck.&nbsp; Is this how it's supposed to be?&nbsp; Is it related to level?&nbsp; I haven't been able to successfully complete a task with my paladin yet, so I can't do a comparison with a higher level toon than my druid.</DIV><BR>

<P>I received a response on this one...</P>
<P>"Some task groups have more tasks available in them than others, and some task masters have more task groups available to them than others. This means that you may get the same task repeatedly from one task master. But in the case of the Dreadlands and Overthere task masters, they have a great deal more task groups and tasks in each group available, so there will be less chance of getting the same task over again."<BR></P>
