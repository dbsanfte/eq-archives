<P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">Wow, what a thread and what a great variance of comments. I take full responsibility for the revamp of VP. It was my first zone project as a designer on this team when I started. Keep in mind; I did this revamp right after LDoN was launched. I'll give you some insight on what the VP revamp entailed:<namespace prefix = o ns = "http://www.lithium.com/unique/URI"></P>
<P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">1) Ripped out all of the old, horrible pathing in the zone and repathed the zone.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">2) Changed the placement of base population in the zone and made it more varied, as well as more dense in specific hallways to make you crawl to specific rooms and use those as safe points for pulling the rest of the hallways. A good example of this is the "safe cubby" which was used in old VP as a place to pull Hoshkar to kill him. In the current VP, that's a good place to place a group and pull hallways of NPCs to.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">3) Increased the difficulty of the base population of the zone and changed the drops and added rare NPCs that drop new loot, as well as the old loot off the old dragons. I felt that, it would be unfair to take away something like the Robe of the Azure Sky from players. So the rares, which, I tried to give mimic the old dragons in terms of abilities, dropped the old loot.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">4) Added quests to the zone - 1 per dragon. Looking back, if I had more time, I would have probably had some anti-dragon quests that occurred outside of the zone that gave players an additional benefit to killing in the zone. The quests in the zone were extremely popular at the time, which was great. However, killing in the zone wasn't popular because everyone wanted to "save" their faction.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">5) Changed the key quest. I felt under the old key quest, getting access to an elemental planes level zone (in terms of difficulty and reward via exp/loot) would have been too easy. I added in a "gateway" dragon that was roughly as difficult as a tier3 god in POP would limit the access to players that was on the verge of being elemental flagged. I wanted to make a "faster" access pathway into the zone instead of camping the old key mobs, so I introduced an alternate method of getting the items needed for the key, which was a faster method, but required a group. Initially I got good feedback on this. Not sure how people feel about it in today's game.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">6) Changed all of the dragons in the zone and made them "elemental mini" difficulty. I tried to shoot for around the same difficulty as Arch Mage Yozanni in Plane of Fire. Phara Dar was tuned to be around Xegony difficulty.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">I took 3 long (~70 hour work weeks) to design, implement, and test all of the content in the revamped Veeshan's Peak. This includes the itemization (I am/was the item's guy back then too, heh) and adding in spell requests for the various spells each NPC casts. At the time, there were a glut of Elemental guilds on a lot of servers, and my goal was to remove some stress off those 4 zones and offer an alternative place to hunt. I also wanted the quests to be decent rewards for players who could put in an amount of time outside of raiding, especially after having to kill an elemental gateway boss, and do a good amount of factioning.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">VP at the time was one of the least used zones in the game. You definitely could go into VP and kill all of the dragons solo. Once one group did that zone every week or maybe every week and a half, there was no other zone usage of the zone. I wanted more out of the zone - I wanted it to be a place that's used more. And for a good while after the revamp (I'd say up until Omens or so) the zone usage from the reports I saw showed that it was used more after the revamp than before.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">Of course however, like every old zone, the usability of the zone reduces substantially over the years. The original poster thinks that there's disconnect between us and the players, but in my opinion, the original poster really doesn't seem to see why this zone isn't used anymore - it's because realistically, things from Gates of Discord and before are rarely used because there's newer, better, more rewarding content in each and every expansion we put out. It's simply going to happen in a game that now has 11 expansions and is pushing an 8th year of being Live. You could replace this VP thread and say the same thing for the Solusek C, Cazic Thule, or Siren's Grotto revamps. Heck, you can probably say the same thing for zones that don't have the revamp, such as <namespace prefix = st1 ns = "http://www.lithium.com/unique/URI"><place><PlaceName>Dawnshroud</PlaceName> <PlaceType>Peaks</PlaceType></place>, Crypt of Decay, or Riwwi.</P>

<DIV>Also, to quickly comment on the tuning of the Shade outside of VP, as well as the events inside/base population inside. I had a superb guild on the Test server, who was elemental planes capable (however, they weren't in Plane of Fire yet - they had just killed Rallos Zek) test all of the events for me. For the Shade, I used 48 non-elementally equipped players from this raiding guild and after the tuning they were able to do it fine.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I also used this same guild (48 of them) to test the events inside. I based the events on the statistics/power of mini-bosses in Plane of Earth/Fire in terms of HP, AC, damage output, and spells and then had this guild test them. I'm sufficiently confident that these events are on par with AMY from Plane of Fire, and Xegony from Plane of Air.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Edit: P.S. Keep in mind, the Test server players generally have lesser gear and lesser AAs than a Live server player, simply due to the fact that there are more players playing on Live, making grouping and acquiring gear easier. However, I'd contend some of the Test server guilds are more skillful compared to Live server guilds because of this - they have to do more with less, which made for a good comparison point in tuning.</DIV><p>Message Edited by Zajeer-Dev on <span class=date_text>06-07-2006</span> <span class=time_text>04:14 PM</span>

				<DIV>Very interesting stuff, Zajeer - thanks for the Dev perspective. I think the use of new VP may have peaked not right away, but after some time - when those who grew to be able to kill Suled Dar's Shade were still able to get upgrades from inside (largely quests, as you said).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>One question regarding encounter design: do you tend to design a mob's abilities (and the other challenges of the event) with a particular solution in mind, or do you say "Let's give this mob a 3k dd, hatelist-based shadowstep, and adds that proc an aggro reducer, and see what the players figure out?"</DIV>

<P>Depends on the encounter. Some of the encounters&nbsp;I start with an outline of what we want it to do (how difficult it would be, how much HP/AC it has) and then I try and figure out how to make the encounter interesting. Sometimes though, the idea of what the encounter is about comes first, and then I fill in the blanks on how much HP/AC it has, what spells, etc. A good example of this is when I wrote up the Suchun raid. The main idea in my head was to make the encounter based on keeping your mana/endurance above a certain point, and if you didn't, you die. I then worked around that idea and made it into a 3 wave event, with portals/adds, mini-bosses, and a final boss at the end. I then expanded upon that event during testing, when players said "hey, it would be cool to add this" and in some situations I added it.</P>
<P>Feedback during the beta process can be really cool if you get a good guild to test - a guild that wants to test and make sure everything is correct. I rely a lot on player ideas for a lot of varied things on events. Some of you guys that have tested with me on beta know - I'm pretty open about making an event more fun (as well as killing players in the process).<BR></P>

				<DIV>VT i could see that sometime, but as of now VT atleast on our server gets cleared fairly often, like tonight we were going to just for remembering old times, and for some fun away from the high game raiding push, and we just found it it got cleared last night by another guild basically for the same reason, heh.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>as for time gear, ah hell no, time is still a big part for guilds to work through, and most guilds even when time is trivial and 99% of the loot goes to alts, guilds will still do Time just because there is some very key items for certain classes there.</DIV>

And if a tank actually needs to group to kill the vast majority of races' DoN masters ingridient stuff and they are just doing it for skillups, they suck. Period. There's a large difference b/w Deep trash and Ssraeshza trash and the crap in Veeshan's Peak. The only ones that even compare are the ones that need Storm Volaas Hair, which hit harder than any other races' mobs and have a **SMURF**ty drop rate and need two to make a single swatch. A person wanting this stuff for skill ups for the other races should easily be able to tank the mobs required for it other than those requiring Storm Volaas Hair and Great Reptile bits.

And 1:40 is still better than 1:100, especially since there are only 20~ Raptors in CT and they are spread out over the whole zone, the above ground level part that is, and some of those wander around the two temple areas making it more annoying to get them.<BR>

				<DIV></DIV>yttrium does drop better than piles of gravel, but reptile teeth are even MORE ridiculous. I actually had good luck in the hole for gravel, but only past the city, before that it bit. Of course, I was not looking for it either, just happened to get a bunch while doing other things down there. Made some guildees happy with it though.

				There is for sure some huge differences in the ease of master level
armor drops between races.&nbsp; Like huge as in, on one hand nearly
trivial, on the other, so ridiculous its not worth it. <br>
<br>
However, I'm not sure that asking for revamps of old zone content is
the answer to fix things.&nbsp; More likely it should either be,
A)&nbsp; change the required drops for certain racial armor or B) allow
the items to drop off similar mobs in different zones. <br>
<br>
Like Pile of Gravel:<br>
<b>Plane of Nightmare</b> a weathered gargoyle (Level: 57)<br>
<b>Ruins of Old Paineel</b> (The Hole) a broken gargoyle (Levels: 56 -
58) a crumbling gargoyle (Levels: 46 - 48) a destroyed gargoyle
(Levels: 46 - 47)a ruined gargoyle (Levels: 48 - 53)a stone ward
(Levels: 55 - 58) an ancient gargoyle (Level: 55) an old gargoyle
(Level: 49)<br>
<b>The Ruined City of Dranik</b> a malfunctioning stoneworker (Level: 66) a transmuted stoneworker (Ruined City of Dranik) (Levels: 64 - 68)<br>
<br>
Vs my troll armor<br>
<b>Plane of Nightmare</b> a tar`dak hunter (Level: 54)<br>
<b>Veeshan's Peak</b> a lava basilisk (Veeshan's Peak) (Levels: 60 - 64) Magma Basilisk (Level: 65)<br>
<b>Vegarlson, the Earthen Badlands</b>A Needlescale Basilisk (Levels: 63 - 64)<br>
<br>
PoN is common between the two.&nbsp; But the drop rate for teeth is
just absurd.&nbsp; I heard someone above say something about a stack(s)
of piles of gravel... I don't think I've ever been able to stomach
farming more than 3 teeth at a time in PoN.&nbsp; Thats quite a few
hours for a few teeth.&nbsp; For loot that is not sold that often, and
for skillups that are much easier to get via Shadowscream.<br>
<br>
The remaining zones, lets compare:<br>
VP and PoEarth...vs... the Hole and Rcod.<br>
<br>
See any problems there? The plane of earth vs the hole hehe.&nbsp; Or
VP vs the hole.&nbsp; Its not even on the same playing field in terms
of difficulty.&nbsp; And two very difficult keyed zones vs one easy key
zone?&nbsp; What gives?<br>

				Personally I did everyone of the quests from VP for my twink Zure at
the time they came out. I even did a couple for my cleric as well. At
the time they were better than some pieces of gear you could get from
raids with focus effects. In today's standards they woudln't be worth
the effort of the rare drops but it was fun gaining the faction and
actually working on the quest. <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-wink.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0><br>

<P>Zajeer, thanks for the detailed response.&nbsp; Interesting to see a designer's point of view.</P>
<P>My biggest frustration with this zone, is like another person alluded to.&nbsp; Mob density.&nbsp; It's not easy getting folks to come here, and working this zone solo...it's difficult to make headway against the sheer number of mobs.&nbsp; Once you leave the ZI area, ever single pull involves a split.</P>
<P>I realize you didn't take this isnto account when you designed it, as it was intended as a raid zone. Anyway, thank you again for taking the time to set me straight on some things.</P>

<P class=MsoNormal 0pt? 0in **SMURF**?MARGIN:>5) Changed the key quest. I felt under the old key quest, getting access to an elemental planes level zone (in terms of difficulty and reward via exp/loot) would have been too easy. I added in a "gateway" dragon that was roughly as difficult as a tier3 god in POP would limit the access to players that was on the verge of being elemental flagged. I wanted to make a "faster" access pathway into the zone instead of camping the old key mobs, so I introduced an alternate method of getting the items needed for the key, which was a faster method, but required a group. Initially I got good feedback on this. Not sure how people feel about it in today's game.<namespace prefix = o ns = "http://www.lithium.com/unique/URI">&nbsp;<BR>

<P><BR>I understand your reasoning, but being from a guild that has passed that point I had to run thorugh the old key quest on my own to be able to zone in and then had that taken away from me.</P>
<P>My guild isn't going to take down the dragon to 1) re-flag me, 2) re-flag anyone else (if there is anyone else) 3) flag anyone that has done the "other" access options - again if there is anyone else&nbsp;4) for quest loot that is below what&nbsp;is dropping now.&nbsp; And I have looked for other guilds doing this and have yet to 1) find any or 2) be online when there is a guild doing it.</P>
<P>Perhaps it is just me, but I dislike having something taken away from me for what seems to be an "Arbitrary" decision.&nbsp; You felt that "under the old key quest, getting access to an elemental planes level zone (in terms of difficulty and reward via exp/loot) would have been too easy" so you introduced a raid required mob for access.</P>
<UL>
<LI>MPG Trials only require a single group and drop better loot.&nbsp; </LI>
<LI>A variety of OoW/DoD Rares that can be duoed, drop better loot.&nbsp; </LI>
<LI>Quests rewards in PoR that can be duoed and soloed offer better loot.</LI></UL>
<P>Point is, trying to get&nbsp;a raid together for the sole fact of getting myself re-keyed (since what does it offer to anyone else in my guild) is fruitless.&nbsp; Perhaps it is time to allow the old key re-entry on its own merits (just don't give it the Augment Change without doing the raid).</P>
<P>Will this give new life to this zone?&nbsp; Doubt it, but then I am probably in the minority on this one.</P>
