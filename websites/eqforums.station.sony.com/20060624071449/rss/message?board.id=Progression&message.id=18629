&lt;DIV&gt;That's only partially correct.&amp;nbsp; No doubt, that it will pull people away from normal servers (but that will only be for a time.&amp;nbsp; &lt;U&gt;Once The Combine gets up to like GoD or Omens, then people will move back to their normal servers to play their "main" characters.&lt;/U&gt;)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;However, there are&amp;nbsp; a lot of old people returning to play on this server.&amp;nbsp; A lot!&amp;nbsp; The EQ population seems to be pretty stable right now, perhaps even increasing slightly, as people return from other games.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;once the combine gets up to like god you will already have a main character on combine, speaking of a year+ till god will be unlocked&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;they announced another expansion? now where is the logic in that...less people playing a game, more expansions coming out...well its soeÂ´s logic&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Yes and no.&amp;nbsp; You'll have a character that you invested time in, but you will still have your old character (who's probably better equipped, with more AAs and stuff) on your old server, not to mention your old friends and stuff.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Announced is too strong of a word.&amp;nbsp; The expansion wasn't formally announced, but mentioned at the last community summit.&amp;nbsp; You can check Loral's site (&lt;A href="http://www.mobhunter.com" target=_blank&gt;www.mobhunter.com&lt;/A&gt;) for some of the information&amp;nbsp;on what it would include.&amp;nbsp; No ETA on when it will be released; they haven't even announced the name yet (though there's plenty of speculation that the name will be The Serpent's Spine.)&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I am slightly confused by the introduction of the new progression server. If SOE is making so much money off the sale of expansions, why did they go up in price a few expansions ago?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;What I mean is... if SOE can afford to sell less copies of the expansions, then&amp;nbsp; why do they have to charge a higher price. I thought the law of economics was... the more you sell, the lower the cost per item so you can provide a lower price.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;EQ isn't exactly growing in population. I would venture to guess that the majority of The Combine's population is going to be comming from the current population.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;People will be leaving there servers to join a new one that requires an expansion to be broken before the next one can be played. Unless we have an uber guild that is going to plow through the entire game (One guild in EQ broke GoD pre-OoW. Did anyone beat OoW pre-DoN?) and unlock it in a few months, I don't see how the new expansions are going to sell very well. SOE said they wanted to release two expansions per year. If the expansion is not unlocked, why buy it?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I am curious of what the devs think of the progression server and such an issue. What would it do to our expansion prices and if SOE will continue to offer EQ if they can't sell the expansions they cram down our throats before we are ready for them.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;Most of my comments were made in jest, but I do wory about more increases to prices. I surely do hope they slow down the rate of release and people don't break the combine too quickly.</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;The cost of doing business goes up over time.&amp;nbsp; They need to increase prices in order to cover increased expenses.&amp;nbsp; Although, I don't recall a price increase for the expansions.&amp;nbsp; Maybe I wasn't paying attention.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;They charge what they can get. They justify it any way they can.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Expansions when up in price because they got more profit that way.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;People gotta understand the cost of making something has little effect on the price requested. If I can make something for a buck and sell it for thousands you bet I will. Art comes to mind. Apple used to expect half the price of their sold units to be profit. Companies sell at what the market will bear. If that means they make a prifit they make the items, if the market won't bear a profitable sale price, then they stop making the items. But prices don't go up because costs do, no matter how many companies may claim that as a justification. Prices go up because some market analyst says the market will bear it, meaning people will pay the increased price and keep buying the product.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The Progression server most likely grew out of the common desire by many people for&amp;nbsp;a "Classic" eq server.&amp;nbsp; They can't go back to Classic, at least not easily or inexpensively, but they could do this.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Some of the people who are/will play on Combine are returning accounts or people who would have otherwise quit the game.&amp;nbsp; If even 100 from each server left to play on Combine, that wouldn't impact any server that greatly and its 100 accounts that is still paying cash for the game.&amp;nbsp; If we get 100 people to restart their accounts, that is 100 more subscriptions than SOE has now.&amp;nbsp; There are also people out there who would like to try EQ but don't want to come into a mature server in a mature game.&amp;nbsp; This allows them a chance to keep up with the Joneses.&amp;nbsp; Again, any new subscriptions are more subscriptions.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Some people who will be playing on combine DON'T want the expansions unlocked quickly.&amp;nbsp; They want a slower paced game.&amp;nbsp; While some people are going to try and be that uber guild, a lot of people are would probably sabotage them if they could.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;As far as the money goes, I believe the expansion costs are primarily to cover the cost of development, while the subscriptions pay for the operating expenses and profit.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I guess I am just opposite in my viewpoint from yours on this server.&amp;nbsp; I see it as SOE trying to do something many people have been requesting for years.&amp;nbsp; I also think that if it doesn't pay for itself, it will be shut down.&amp;nbsp; So what's to lose?&amp;nbsp; While I am not in favor of taking development away from the main game, I think this server is a pretty reasonable offering.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>Well the idea of the server i guess was to bring soem attention back to Everquest.&amp;nbsp; Eq players who moved on to EQ, WoW players who are lookin for a lil more challenge or to see waht those "OG EQ players" are talkin about when they say EQ was so the best game ever, those old Eq players who cancled back during luclin pop u-name-the-expansion-that-broket-their-heart,&amp;nbsp; those Current EQ players who are wantin to start a new char but dotn wana have to power lvl or twink or spend a year just playign catch up, those new players to mmos that may look at eq adn not like it becasue of the previous group (mature population almost completely dead newb-mid-much of hte high end of eq).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;MMOs generally run on subs, u take 100,000 players payin 15 bucks / month and u can generate quite a bit of profit for simply hosting current content.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The expansions are to keep ppl interested and are going up in prices cause sony feels their worth more, i dunno why maybe labor costs went up *giggle* but basically the expansion prices are to make producing the expansion somewhat profitable. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Basically those who are gonna be playing on "The Combine" probablly dotn give a **HALFLING** about teh next best EQ expansion so these folks prob wouldnt be buying it anyway but if they snag some extra subs, good times. &lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
