    <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new client is not needed, and I promise you the client is not the reason people leave the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for using the EQ2 client for EQ... no. For all your talk about clunky controls and all that, I find EQ to be the best-controlled MMO out there.

      <title>New Everquest Game Client?</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=SOE&amp;message.id=3800#M3800</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;I have played Everquest for more years then I care to admit.  I have left, come back, left again, come back again, etc.  During those times away, I have played the other MMOs (World of Warcraft, Everquest 2, Dark Age of Camelot, City of Villains, Dungeons and Dragons Online, and others).  They all had their things that were nice, and they all had things that were bad.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The thing that amazes me is that out of all of the MMOs on the market today, Everquest still has the best core-system.  Now understand, I am NOT saying that Everquest looks the best, runs the best, NOR has the best user interface.  In actuality, it does not.  But, the core system of Everquest seems to be the best.  It might be the fact that it is six years old and has had time to develop slowly.  Who knows, but there is something about Everquest that is worth coming back to.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;That brings me to the point of this thread... Everytime I come back to Everquest, I play the game and think &amp;quot;hmmm not quite as nice as I remembered it.&amp;quot;  The simple fact is that the game client is out-dated.  It's just plain old.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So, my question is this SoE... Will there EVER be a new game client created for Everquest in the future?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Wouldn't it be worth the time to devote one of the upcoming expansions solely to creating a brand new game client from scratch that is on par with the rest of the MMO industry?  You don't have to change the server, the rules of the game, or anything core to the system.  Just make a new game client.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It seems to me that if Everquest was to come out with a brand new game client that was on par with the MMOs coming out today, more people would come back to Everquest.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Call me crazy, but I just do not believe that you can expect to keep running Everquest on this out-dated game client for ever.  Eventually, it will just get too old and be more of a niche game then anything.  Already, I have friends that are new to the MMO craze that absolutely refuse to try Everquest solely based on the way it looks feels.  That's potential customers that were lost ONLY because the game client is out-dated.  I know I can't be alone in thinking this way...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I guess since this thread is dieing a horrible death that it means SoE is happy with the current state of the EQ game client, and there is no hope of it ever being updated in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So... what we got now is what we have next year.. the year after.. and the year after that...  Just a new expansion twice a year until there are not enough customers left to warrant another one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All sarcasm aside, I have to say that this is the biggest &amp;quot;drop the ball&amp;quot; that any software manufacturer has ever done in the history of the gaming industry.  Before you ignore this thread and move on, please hear me out cause I say this with love.. not hate.  This is what is called constructive criticism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sony Online Entertainment has the single best and LARGEST MMORPG content in the history of MMORPGs.  You have a proven product, an already created fan following, and everything you need to continue to dominate the industry.  All you have to do is spend ONE YEAR making a whole new game client that utilizes your existing servers, and you will be able to retake your lost customers from World of Warcraft and continue to dominate the industry for another six years at least.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other software publishers would kill to have the advantage that Sony Online Entertainment has with Everquest.  The competitors have to create everything from scratch and HOPE that they can get a foot in the door long enough to create a fan following.  Sony Online Entertainment already has that and then some, but they won't make a new game client.  It doesn't make sense.  It really just doesn't make sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only thing I can come up with is that somebody in charge wants Everquest to fail.  But, why?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just admit it already.  Nobody will hold anybody accountable for making the wrong decissions.  Everquest 2 was a failure.  But, Everquest 1 does NOT have to be a failure.  Even if you was to put Everquest 2's game client on top of the already existing Everquest 1 server environment, you would already have a better game then Everquest 2.  With out a doubt.  Hands down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you don't believe me, then do one of your poles that Sony Online Entertainment has done in the past.  Ask the public &amp;quot;Would you consider coming back to Everquest 1 if we used the Everquest 2 game client with the Everquest 1 server rules, lore, and existing content?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I bet everything I have that at least 80% will answer YES.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description>

Will there EVER be a new game client created for Everquest in the future?&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'll take a stab at this.  They have updated the &amp;quot;client&amp;quot; twice now (which I am arguing is the graphics engine.)  The last time was during Gates of Discord. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With the Tunare engine, they can produce graphics that look just as good as any game on the market today.  Just check out Freeport as an example of what that puppy can do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes.  I am aware they have updated the game client in the past, but there is noway anybody can argue that Everquest looks as good as World of Warcraft, Everquest 2, or Dungeons and Dragons Online.  In comparison, the characters and the majority of the zones look way out-dated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, even though the game client has been updated to allow for more user friendly control and modification, it still is not on par with the games coming out right now.  The controls feel clunky after playing a game like World of Warcraft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please understand that this is NOT an attempt to put Everquest down.  On the contrary, I am just praying that Sony Online Entertainment will take the time to fully upgrade the game client to the current MMO industries standards.  I would hate to see SoE allow Everquest to just die off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another thing that bothers me, and I honestly have NO CLUE how you would solve this problem is the simple fact that someone starting new in Everquest today would be years behind anybody who has been playing the game for a long time now.  How does a completely new person to Everquest get to level 70 with 400+ AAs on their own, so that they can then get in to an already running guild.  It's not like there are thousands of &amp;quot;new players&amp;quot; to level up and gear up with in the game anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are just my concerns, and the only reason I even bother to mention them is because I have been a fan of the game for many years.  The future of Everquest does mean something to me.  It's like driving past your old high school and noticing that the place is going down hill fast.  You kinda feel a part of you die inside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description>

High level and/or experienced players can help out the newer players, show them around, answer questions etc. Not sure how much this happens over the whole of Norrath, but I always willing to lend a hand when I can.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are plenty of family guilds out there, that love taking in new players, helping them any way they can and have lots of fun playing the game.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And you don't have to be level 70 with tons of AA to enjoy Norrath. After two years my highest level character is level 59 and I love playing this game. New challenges for me every single day and fun things to do and see everywhere. I'll get to 70 some day I guess, but I for one am in no rush whatsoever.&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by GoTT-Daisy on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;03-27-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;10:57 AM&lt;/span&gt;</description>
