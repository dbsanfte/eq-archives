&lt;P&gt;quote&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Make a Tundrabear Sandwich. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Combine in Oven: 1 Tundra Kodiak Meat + 1 Jug of Sauces = Saucybear Meat. (trivial 51) &lt;BR&gt;Combine in Mixing Bowl: Saucybear Meat + 1 Loaf of Bread = Tundrabear Sandwich. (trivial &amp;lt;51) &lt;BR&gt;Tundra Kodiak Meat drops off of Tundra Kodiaks in East Wastes. It does not drop every time but both the kodiaks and their meat are common enough that this shouldn't be too painful. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Take the sandwich to Guard Leif, who is at -281, 500 outside the Paladin Guild. The guild is located just before the Temple of Lore, on the right, by the creepy statue with the glowing red eyes. Leif stands on guard just to the right of the entrance to the guild. Be careful not to be confused by Leifur, a completely different coldain that hangs out in the basement of a building and gives the bard armor quests. Give Guard Leif the tundrabear sandwich and his napkin, and he will give you back his Used Napkin. Return the napkin to Mordin and he'll give you "Trita's Napkin". &lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
