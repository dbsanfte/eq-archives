<DIV><STRONG>Craig Knapp - EverQuest Producer<BR><BR></STRONG><A href="http://newsletters.station.sony.com/eq1/images/en/content/craig_front.jpg" target=_blank><STRONG><IMG src="http://newsletters.station.sony.com/eq1/images/en/content/craig_front_sm.jpg" align=left border=0 NOSEND="1"></STRONG></A>Craig Knapp was recently appointed as the new producer of EverQuest. We wanted to take a moment and introduce him to our community and give you a little insight into this international man of mystery!<BR><BR></DIV>

<DIV><A href="http://newsletters.station.sony.com/eq1/images/en/content/craig_right.jpg" target=_blank><STRONG><IMG hspace=5 src="http://newsletters.station.sony.com/eq1/images/en/content/craig_right_sm.jpg" align=left vspace=2 border=0></STRONG></A><STRONG>Tell us about your new role on the team.<BR></STRONG>I’m responsible for the EverQuest development team and the EverQuest game. We’re the group that is in charge of all that you see inside of Norrath. This includes the art team that builds the assets, the design team that sets the storyline and content, and the programming team which makes it all run. There are a number of other departments at the company that help support our role of course, but we’re in charge of developing and maintaining Norrath. 
<P><STRONG>What is your favorite in-game EQ memory? What is your least?</STRONG><BR>I’m a big fan of live events, especially ones where Norrath is truly alive and players’ decisions ultimately decide the final outcome. The Fall of Grobb is high on the list because it was not only fun to be involved, but you could also just sit back and really watch the storyline play out. It was awesome. Some of the live events in the Tower of Frozen Shadow were done very well and our whole team had fun watching Tirranun march around in Lavastorm before DoN released. We’ve got some similar things in development right now that I have high hopes for. We’ll all have to wait until June/July to see where it sits on the “favorites list”, but they’ll be some more in August as well. </P>
<P>In terms of least favorite, I’d have to say the newbie experience. EQ was my first MMO and back then, there wasn’t much instruction on some of the basic game play. There wasn’t a tutorial at the time and I think we all forget how much there is to learn to play EQ effectively. We joke around the office that EverQuest is like the “graduate school” of MMO’s, you have to be pretty smart to play well. We want to keep that tradition, but also strive to make the beginning game less of a shock. I think our current tutorial and some of the recent changes we’ll be doing really accomplishes that. </P>
<P><STRONG>What is your vision for the game and what can players expect over the next couple of years?</STRONG><BR>I want to be very clear that EverQuest isn't going to be pushed along the lines of "my” vision by any means. My vision would likely only please those people who play EverQuest the same way I do and would really limit the game. Norrath is enjoyed in so many ways and by so many different play styles. Any one vision would only touch on a fraction of those. </P>
<P>Fortunately, we have a tremendously talented team with diverse play styles and they have a lot of great ideas on the direction of EverQuest. Over the past few months we’ve spent a tremendous amount of time discussing and debating the things that we should do in the next year. It’s really been exciting because it gave us some time to re-evaluate how ideas get green-lighted. We came to the conclusion that everything we did had to be something that (a) we would love to see as players or (b) something that we felt we needed to do for the long-term health of the game. That helped us establish a clear benchmark for what ideas got put on the “to do” list. </P>
<P>Without spoiling it all, I think the content we have planned from now until next February is going to be some of the best in EverQuest’s great history. Our team is excited about the direction we’re headed and it really makes you look forward to showing up to work. The only problem we have now is that we have a lot of great ideas we’ll have to table until spring of 2006.</P>
<P><STRONG>Tell us about your team.</STRONG><BR>I work with an incredibly talented group of individuals who are always striving to make EverQuest the ultimate game play experience for our players. Chris Lena is our Project Manager and he’s a tremendous asset to the team as he runs most of the day to day operations. Jamey Ryan is our Lead Programmer and his team takes all the great ideas and brings them to life. Our Lead Designer is Travis McGeathy and his team is in charge of providing fresh and compelling content for our players. As I mentioned earlier, I think the community will be very pleased with the direction of some of the new content. The Environment Art group is led by John Roy and those guys continue to push the boundaries of the EQ graphics engine—EverQuest has never looked better! Cory Rohlfs is the Character Art Lead and his team is responsible for some of the best creatures Norrath has seen to date. The entire team’s creativity and passion for the game is awe-inspiring and I consider it a privilege to work with them.</P>
<P><STRONG>What is your favorite race/class combo?</STRONG><BR>A Dark Elf Wizard of course, but I’ve been starting a number of new race/class combinations recently as we’re making some significant changes to the newbie experience. </P>
<P><STRONG>What's your favorite color? </STRONG><BR>Green</P>
<P><STRONG>What kind of car do you drive? </STRONG><BR>I’m not a car person at all, but since you asked; I have a 1998 Jeep Grand Cherokee with well over 100K miles on it. It’s quickly becoming like the old Tom Hanks movie the “Money Pit”, but it still gets my dog Matty and I around (or at least most of the time). </P>
<P>What kind of car do you wish you could drive? An old run-down Jeep Cherokee (minus the money pit).</P>
<P><STRONG>What is your favorite joke that you can tell in polite company?</STRONG><BR>Considering at our last design team meeting I was told that I’m not very funny and should avoid attempts at humor, I’ll skip this one. </P>
<P><STRONG>Favorite cartoon as a kid? </STRONG><BR>There’s a lot to choose from there because I watched so many cartoons growing up. I’m not even sure the exact name of it, but what started the addiction was a Hercules cartoon that started at 6 AM on Sunday morning. I remember my family thought I was insane for getting up so early. Transformers and GI Joe were also some that I watched until I was way too old and Disney’s Recess is still worth watching. </P>
<P><STRONG>What do you like to do outside of the office/game?</STRONG><BR>I’m a big fan of board games, but my current hobby is really the PSP. I’ve played most of the games that have been released and have particularly enjoyed two of them. Untold Legends is a great game and I was really impressed with the final product. I got the opportunity to play it before it was released and I thought the game came out very polished. The other game that I’ve spent a lot of time with is Lumines. I had a hard time getting into it, but it’s really grown on me.</P>
<P><STRONG>Do you like your pizza with or without pepperoni?</STRONG><BR>No pizza please.</P>
<P><STRONG><A href="http://newsletters.station.sony.com/eq1/images/en/content/craig_left.jpg" target=_blank><IMG src="http://newsletters.station.sony.com/eq1/images/en/content/craig_left_sm.jpg" align=right vspace=5 border=0></A>For someone who wants to give MMO games a try, why should they play EverQuest?</STRONG><BR>There are a number of different answers I can give to this one, but the real reason is that EverQuest is flat out the best MMO out there. It has the most fun and unique content of any MMO and Norrath is truly an immersive world. The most important reason to play EverQuest is because of its tremendous community. The friendships that have been made through EverQuest are absolutely amazing. I’ve met some of the most kind and gracious folks in my life through EQ and you hear similar stories around the community all the time. I don’t think any other MMO can say that they’ve done that for so many people. </P>
<P>Thanks, Craig!</P>

<P><STRONG>Last Voyage – Part 1</STRONG></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Lying upon the half rotten mattress, Caleb was certain of only one thing and that was that he was dying. Throughout his life he thought that when the time came, he would fear it, fight it off, or find some way to deny that it was taking place. His life had never been one of certainty or stability? What sailor’s ever was? From the spires of Erudin to the piers of Freeport, there was not a stretch of ocean or isolated islet in which a man or woman could not find themselves a grave.<BR><BR>Once, in a particularly fierce storm, he had been thrown from the forecastle to the deck, and for the rest of his days carried a limp to remind him of the incident. It also reminded him of how worse it could have been, for his companion had been thrown overboard in that very same storm. They made all the appropriate prayers, all the traditional offerings, but the sea does not give up its dead so easily. He was never found.<BR><BR>Closing his eyes, he thought about what it would be like. The pain until now had been excruciating, and he believed it would as the Artificers had explained in their doctrine, that the body as a machine would begin to fail, and only when it was finally beyond repair would it be released from all its functions. He was fairly certain that whatever waited for him, it could be no crueler than the fever which was sapping not only his strength, but his will as well.<BR><BR>Opening his eyes a sliver, even the flickering candle which illuminated his cabin seemed as bright as the sun itself, Caleb tried to gasp. It came out as a hacking cough. They were leagues away from the shore; there was no way that this could be possible.<BR><BR>"Merinda?"<BR><BR>"I am here, and there is nothing left to fear?"</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P align=center>* * *</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>"I tell you sir, straight out and now, that if this much longer keeps up, there be not a one who'll be left the sail for the next shipment."<BR><BR>Patrician nodded to the little man who spoke with the sailor's lilt. He brushed the sleeves of his velvet frock coat, pulled at the white lace cuffs, and examined the tar stained piece of canvas which covered the perfect outline of a human body. He shook his head, smiling slightly at the thought of the sailor next to him. Service to the Militia often </P>
<P>marked a man in many subtle ways, but Patrician was not one of them. <BR><BR>The skin of his rich, dark brown forehead betrayed no hint of his advancing years, not a wrinkle of worry or doubt, and his green eyes sparked with intensity. He had no doubt that the sailor had been expecting some bored functionary or hard nosed member of the Militia. <BR><BR>"Really, do you think I would be here if Lucan did not think this was of some importance?"&nbsp; </P>
<P>The little man shook his head, stringy brown hair whipping about as he did so.<BR><BR>"No, no, no sir, that said I did not at all, it's just that it's long been a time since Lucan has been interested a bit in what goes on down here?" <BR><BR>Patrician sniffed, lifting the corner of the canvas with the tip of his hard soled riding boot.<BR><BR>"A fever? Preceded by dizziness and general lassitude?" <BR><BR>"Sir?" <BR><BR>Patrician brought a hand to his face, "Was he tired and off balance?" <BR><BR>"Yes sir, days we were into the trip, and he squawked, pardon sir, he complained loud long and all about how his eyes were on fire. We found on the floor him we did, the sixth or seventh day out. Died in his cabin just the day before today he did, and the courier we had aboard with us, he sent word to the Militia he did."<BR><BR>Patrician nodded, and turned from the canvas covered body. His eyes rested upon The Harlequin, a three masted merchant ship registered to the city of Freeport which sat at the end of the pier. A bored looking longshoreman was heaving barrels over the side into the bay. Whatever sickness had overtaken the sailor, the authorities could not risk its spread into the city. The cargo of fine wine from Qeynos, worth thousands, was now destined for the silty bottom of the harbor. The sailors were confined to their ship, apart from the weasel of a captain. The Priests of Marr had confirmed that whatever had befallen the ship, it had not spread to the man who commanded it.<BR><BR>"Well, commit this particular soul to the deep, and I will get back to you within a few days."<BR><BR>"Sir?"<BR><BR>"I do not have time to stand here arguing with you, just do it. Someone will be down to speak with you later."<BR><BR>Patrician stalked off towards the harbor masters office, wondering exactly why he had been assigned to deal with this particular problem.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P align=center>* * *</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>"Because I asked you to, old man"<BR><BR>Smirking, Patrician sniffed at the glass of wine in his hand. Across from him, Ingival was paring his fingernails with a stiletto, his pinched features, long tapering nose and wispy goatee reminding him as always of a rat.<BR><BR>"I dare say I should be the one giving you the orders? Captain."<BR><BR>Ingival snorted, "No need for sarcasm, finger waggler. Lucan knows his business, and that business has me in charge of the Guard. You, you're a book banging fop he retains for reasons only the devils themselves can fathom. If I tell you to walk back end first to the land of the hairy feet, you'll do it and like it. You're a corpse caster, a Necromancer, and all I need to know is that you were asked into this situation because you prefer the cold, loose lips of the dead to living flesh."<BR><BR>Patrician looked over the rim of his glass at Ingival, eyebrow raised quizzically.<BR><BR>"You're fairly certain of yourself Captain.&nbsp; Tell me, if I am so desperately loathed, why even stomach my presence?"<BR><BR>The Captain of the Guard snorted and then spat into the straw which covered the floor next to the table.<BR><BR>"Because I was ordered to."<BR><BR>"Charming?"</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>"Isn't it?"<BR><BR>An uncomfortable silence followed the air between the two men thick with tension and barely restrained anger. The sound of footsteps, hard boots against damp cobblestone, punctured the silence, and Ingival rose from his seat.<BR><BR>"My dealings with you are finished, necromancer. One of my men has been assigned to assist you with this particular case. I haven't time in the day to go chasing after dead sailors whose lives matter not a whit to even their own mothers. I'll expect your report in a week."<BR><BR>Ingival opened the door, surprising the lithe young man whose arm was raised, ready to grasp the handle. His close cropped hair, shaved nearly to the scalp and leaving only blonde stubble, was indication enough that he was one of the Militia. The polished black boots, and the grey breeches tucked into the top, completed the impression. Even though he wore a torn and tar stained tunic, evidently a feeble attempt to mix in with the sailors on the docks, the youth reeked of inexperience.&nbsp; Possibly a squire to one of the more important officers in the Militia.<BR><BR>"Aron, that finely dressed fop over there is Patrician. Whatever you have on these waterlogged carcasses, you share. EVERYTHING. Am I clear on that?"<BR><BR>Aron glanced over at Patrician nervously and then looked up at Ingival. <BR><BR>"Clear sir."<BR><BR>Patrician finished off the wine in his glass. Things were definitely going to prove interesting, and for all the wrong reasons.<BR><BR><BR><EM>To be continued…</EM></P>

<P><STRONG>Author Bio:</STRONG></P>
<P>Jeff Franzmann (Hassan al'Nasir on Karana) has been playing EverQuest since it was in Beta, and while he's taken some time off to explore other worlds, he always returns to Norrath. A technical supervisor in Winnipeg, Manitoba, the long cold winters have provided him with ample opportunities to indulge in two of his favorite hobbies; writing and gaming, all while raising a family consisting of his fiance Tania, their son Aubrey, three cats, a dog, and assorted fish scattered across two aquariums.</P></DIV>

<DIV><STRONG>In-game Updates<BR></STRONG>Just in case you missed last month’s update notes, no worries! We have the highlights for you below: </DIV>
<UL>
<LI>Level up text has been added for all levels between 11 and 70 
<LI>A new button has been added to character select: Return Home. If a character has not been played in the past 6 hours, this button is enabled and pressing it will log the character into the game in their starting city.
