    <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Despite the usual bickering amongst the now-spoiled EQ community, I applaud the concept of a progression server. Unfortunately, reality is what it is. We might as well call this the Schiavo Server; what we're witnessing here is EQ on life support with people fussing and fighting over mundane topics while the health of the game deteriorates.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Let's face it, folks. Hardly anyone has learned a thing over the last seven years. The players certainly&amp;nbsp;haven't, and that will be demonstrated with the release of Combine. It's going to be one giant race for bragging rights and server-firsts. The disrespect for old-world content which has plagued EQ for years will be magnified tenfold. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Some of the devs clearly don't get it either. This quote by Rashere absolutely baffles me:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;We are not attempting to revert EQ back to its original state.&amp;nbsp; Not only is that a technical impossibility, but the nostalgia people have is due more to it being the first large persistent world that people encountered than any specific gameplay mechanic that has since been changed.&amp;nbsp; That feeling is no more able to be recaptured than the feeling of a first kiss.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;It doesn't amaze me that a&amp;nbsp;dev is absolutely clueless. No, what amazes me is that so many players open up wide and swallow this load of crap. They don't even question it. If Rashere says it, hey, it must be so. &lt;STRONG&gt;Bologna&lt;/STRONG&gt;. What Rashere said in the above paragraph translates to, "Your feelings about EQ are comparable to those of a lovesick teenager, and I can't be bothered with them. I'm an all-knowing developer paid by SOE to invent the future, not respect the past."&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Rashere is flat-out wrong, as is anyone else who insists in a condescending manner that nostalgia is not an integral part of the game. Nostalgia is, was, and always will be something that &lt;EM&gt;can&lt;/EM&gt; be created -- but only if the creator respects its significance. But SOE never has. They don't want to make the game intimate like it once was, they simply want to bleed subscriptions as long as possible. Just as politicians mistakingly "solve" problems by throwing money at them, so goes SOE with their&amp;nbsp;mind-numbing expansions.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;No one -- not Rashere, not hardcore players, not casual players, seems to realize that the magic and mystique of old-world zones&amp;nbsp;&lt;EM&gt;could&lt;/EM&gt; have been preserved. SOE did&amp;nbsp;&lt;EM&gt;not&lt;/EM&gt; need to make the world so ridiculously large so that 90% of the content is empty and depressing. If they had been even slightly creative with the items, plot lines, and content within the existing zones we grew to love so much, there are many who would still be playing (and paying) today.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;To those who&amp;nbsp;knew, respected, and appreciated&amp;nbsp;the magic that was early EQ, I sincerely hope you rekindle&amp;nbsp;those feelings on the Combine Server. And I sincerely hope I'm wrong when I say it's one last hoorah for a world we'll never see again.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>Based on what you posted, which looks to be basically correct, AoW *was* beaten pre-luclin, so you were incorrect.&amp;nbsp; i.e. AoW was beaten, w/o charm giants, and without AeT.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, my whole point was that the tank, unless he was a fool, wouldn't disc forti because it would blow his def... obviously, a rogue/bard/ranger/etc would use his riposte/avoidance disc.&amp;nbsp; That wasn't really up for debate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;AoW definitely involved some luck, but I liked that.&amp;nbsp; It also involved a lot of fast reflexes... when your tank died cause the AoW decided to flurry a lot, if your clerics' reaction times were half a second slower than ideal, the tank died... with Vish, I've seen us win with the tank shouting for 20s that he's the MT, and ppl are too busy chatting on skype or whatever to pay attention.&amp;nbsp; It's so easy.&amp;nbsp; Sure, Vish was challenging to figure out, to learn what each mob did, how to use the clouds, how to handle the dt ae, why not to kill those stupid mobs with the stun/knockback, etc... but once you learn all that, it's trivial, and easily repeated, and requires no skill.&amp;nbsp; You'd have to be a moron to miss the deathtouches with audio triggers now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;AoW was exciting because the outcome wasn't guaranteed.&amp;nbsp; Vish is boring, because you always win.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>"Fortitude was available from Kunark on, so could be used against AoW,&#xD;
with the real difficulty in tank transitions being in not having AET&#xD;
when before Luclin...opps, wait, guilds did not start beating AoW till&#xD;
Luclin, so that ends that difficulty too."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lol I knew you'd say that, obviously someone who didn't play a tank class back in Velious.&amp;nbsp; You couldn't use forti on aow because it counted as a disc, and then you couldn't use defensive, and you couldn't survive w/o defensive.&amp;nbsp; With the new disc system, you can use forti, then as soon as it drops, pop defensive.&amp;nbsp; So no, you could not use forti on AoW as you can today.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, you're wrong about when AoW was killed.&amp;nbsp; He was killed on 2 servers during Velious, Legacy of Steel/Shock of Swords did him together on Nameless, and FoH did him on Veeshan.&amp;nbsp; They didn't have AeT.&amp;nbsp; Also, on this new server, we will probably have to do him w/o AeT, since he'll probably be part of the process of unlocking luclin.&amp;nbsp; The devs at the summit, when they explained the idea of progression servers unlocking, used the example of the aow unlocking Luclin, so it's a good bet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I already agreed with you that some classes, especially random_dps_class_04, has to pay more attention on vish than on aow.&amp;nbsp; A rogue still had to pay attention though.&amp;nbsp; They had to watch the tank switches, turn off attack between them, control aggro, etc... but if they **SMURF**ed up, they just died, they didn't wipe the guild (although turning the aow then made half the guild riposte him).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, the guild as a whole, even after beating aow once, was still quite likely to lose again.&amp;nbsp; That's not true of vish.&amp;nbsp; Once you get the strat down, you can just win every time.&amp;nbsp; AoW, no matter how good your strat... it was always touch and go.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Ummmm...you don't know much about tanking.  Let's say, for example, MT dies, and AoW switches to wrong person.  If that person is a ranger, a monk(did they have a void disc back then, I think so), a rogue, a bard(LoL), or a warrior(tho it was not as good an idea for the warrior), they could use said void disc(for warriors that is fortitude) to buy the right tank time to get controll.  You could not chain discs, but you could use them, and if you are going to die anyway, do it usefully.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, I am not exactly wrong about killing AoW, I just don't count those done pre-charm nerf.  here are the details:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;July 27, 2001 - LoS/SoS kill AoW&lt;br&gt;Aug 2, 2001 - LoS/SoS kill AoW&lt;br&gt;Aug 3, 2001 - Charm and Bind nerf in Kael&lt;br&gt;Dec 2, 2001 - LoS/SoS and FoH/?? kill AoW&lt;br&gt;Dec 4, 2001 - Luclin Launches&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You could lose AoW after you first beat him, basically due strictly to luck.  AoW was kinda like Reparme, in that, if he wanted you dead, you died.  Beating AoW during Velious/Luclin(post nerf) was all about how many tanks did he decide to kill.  I prefer events that you can win even when the RNG is unkind, as opposed to events where you are at the mercy of luck.  Skill is required in both, but skill should be the deciding factor.</description>

      <description>We've cockblocked lower guilds that we were not concerned about passing us on more than one occasion.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Sometimes it prevents them from having access to mobs we want for loot, and gives us exclusive rights to those mobs.&amp;nbsp; If we didn't cb them, they'd get 10% of the loot and we'd get 90%, so we'd still be ahead (or 20/80, or whatever), but by cb'ing them and keeping them out of a certain zone, we can increase our lead even further.&amp;nbsp; One guild I was in was the first on server to kill Emp Ssra, then we prevented any other guild from even having a shot at him until we were done with Vex Thal.&amp;nbsp; No one would have been able to even touch him for 6 months after us anyways, but we bought ourselves even more time to farm Vex Thal without anyone else to worry about.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eze, all is fair in love and war.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

If raid content is instinced, another guild has zero effect on your ability to get loot, and the only way you stay ahead is by, *gasp*, beating more raid content faster than them.  If you can't do that, you don't deserve to be ahead.</description>

      <description>"The scripts aren't difficult? Alrighty, I'll go ahead and inform CD,&#xD;
TR, Assent, etc that what they're doing is very very easy, so they&#xD;
might as well quit."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The scripts are hard to figure out, then once you've figured it out, it's forever trivial and repetitive.&amp;nbsp; AoW was easy to figure out, but every time it was still hard to execute it, and you never knew if you'd win.&lt;p&gt;"As for the instancing hurtin raids, I find this arguement out and&#xD;
out selfish and childish. Let's establish something, right now, this is&#xD;
NON-arguable. C***blocking another guild is NOT a "valid tactic" or&#xD;
"strategy". It's an affirmation the other guild is better, stronger,&#xD;
faster, tighter knit, and the ONLY way for you to succeed is to&#xD;
sabotage their efforts. That's not competition, that's not racing.&#xD;
Racing is putting two guilds, head to head, who gets it done first. Who&#xD;
puts in that extra hour for those extra two attempts when a mob almsot&#xD;
went down and you wiped at 20%, instead of calling it quits, it's about&#xD;
who takes the time to think about the content being done and figure&#xD;
things out, who's members do more extra work outside the raid to&#xD;
strengthen themselves the most to benefit the guild, who sacrifices&#xD;
more for the benefit of the raid. THAT'S competition. C***blocking is&#xD;
"Well, they'll surpass us if they have a shot, so we're going to deny&#xD;
them that." It's acting immature, plain and simple."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lol @ "NON-arguable".&amp;nbsp; It can be a perfectly valid strategy.&amp;nbsp; Say your guild is a bit beyond the next.&amp;nbsp; If you can **SMURF** them on Emp Ssra, you can have Vex Thal to yourself.&amp;nbsp; If you didn't, and they got in, sure you'd get some spawns, maybe the majority, but you'd probably lose some too.&amp;nbsp; It's not about being afraid they will surpass us if we don't cb them.&amp;nbsp; It's about knowing that cb'ing them will allow us to progress faster in the end, and get more loot ourselves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Way to offer the greatest arguement for &lt;STRONG&gt;why&lt;/STRONG&gt; instancing should work.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;My advancement shouldn't be dictated by your ability to try to screw me over.&amp;nbsp; It's childish and absolutely pathetic.&amp;nbsp; The fact that you think it's a valid tactic is a pretty clear indicator of who not to group with on the Combine.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;No, it's "We can't maintain our lead with them getting the same loot, so we have to block them." The guild with the most SKILL should progress the fastest, not the one without ethics.&lt;BR&gt;</description>

      <description>I agree that newer encounters often require more equivalent levels of attention from all players across the board, like the dt in vish.&amp;nbsp; However, I think that it's much easier on the guild as a whole, in that once we figured vish out, we rarely lost it.&amp;nbsp; AoW wasn't like that.&amp;nbsp; On Vish, we just chaos chain on the main tank.&amp;nbsp; If it's 5s or even 10s sometimes between heals, the tank might live.&amp;nbsp; With AoW, if that cheal is off by half a second, the tank is dead.&amp;nbsp; In fact, even if the cheal is dead on, once per second, the tank might be dead if aow gets a good round.&amp;nbsp; When a tank splatted, the clerics had to react immediately and much faster than on Vish.&amp;nbsp; Now you just /disc fortitude to give yourself 10-12s or so plus the amount of time you already had.&amp;nbsp; You can easily survive 20s without a heal if you're a halfway decent tank.&amp;nbsp; The AoW could eat an uber velious tank in 1 round if unlucky, 2 if lucky.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That kind of incredibly challenging encounter is gone from EQ.&amp;nbsp; The kind where, no matter how well you knew the encounter, no matter how good your strats, there was a good chance you'd lose anyways.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

Ya, that will work.  Even then you get your facts wrong.  Fortitude was available from Kunark on, so could be used against AoW, with the real difficulty in tank transitions being in not having AET when before Luclin...opps, wait, guilds did not start beating AoW till Luclin, so that ends that difficulty too.</description>

      <description>In a way, newer style raids are easier, and in way, they are harder.&amp;nbsp; The style of raids changed.&amp;nbsp; They used to be about reflexes, reacting time, gear quality, and speed in mobilization.&amp;nbsp; Now they are about figuring out a gimmick or puzzle.&amp;nbsp; The older fights didn't really get easier with time except in that your gear got better.&amp;nbsp; The new fights are very hard at first, but once you figure out the trick, they become immediately trivial.&amp;nbsp; Once you learn how to win the fight, you can do it again and again and again, without a very impressive raid force, and without much skill.&amp;nbsp; In the old days, every time you engaged the AoW, you weren't sure if you were going to win, until gear got to the point where it gave you wiggle room if you screwed up.&amp;nbsp; IMO, the older style was more fun, because it wasn't so boring to farm mobs when each time it was challenging.&amp;nbsp; Some people prefer the newer style raids, where it's just about figuring out a puzzle.&amp;nbsp; It's just a matter of preference.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>His point is that instancing is midway between solo gaming and mmorpg's.&amp;nbsp; The more you instance, the more you move along the spectrum away from an mmorpg and towards a solo game.&amp;nbsp; If you carry instancing to it's endpoint, you end up with a solo game.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our position is that we want to move all the way to the mmorpg end of that spectrum, a persistent, realistic world in which all people interact, and in which all people are able to change the world and hence the gaming experience of other players.&amp;nbsp; We believe that that is what makes mmorpg's worth playing.&amp;nbsp; When you instance, you're no longer playing a 2000 player game, you're playing a 54 person game (or 6, or whatever) because the other players are all effectively cut off from you and cannot influence you, nor you them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I understood the point he was making. I was not taking about taking instancing&amp;nbsp;to it's endpoint, I was&amp;nbsp;just using raid instancing as an example.&amp;nbsp;That would only result in worst case 50 people be separated from the game world for a couple hours.&amp;nbsp;I understand your position. The funny thing is I am not even a huge fan of instancing. I was just trying to say that I think that something could be done to open up the content for people who will be blocked from experiencing it. I am sure there is a better way to have a compromise where guilds could still compete and casual players can still access content. I guess the fundamental difference in opinion is whether or not casual players have a right to&amp;nbsp; content if they can not compete for it. I think we do, but if you don't then I suppose we can never agree. If you find the competitions between the uber guilds fun I don't want you to lose that. I was just trying to say that I think a compromise can be met if it was discussed properly. The problem is that it doesn't seem possible to discuss it without turning into a flame fest so I give up. The progression server will be what it will be and I will play it until I stop having fun.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I will say that I am not referring to the post you made to me. I thought they were fair and you explained what it was you had to say. Perhaps it is just a few bad apples that have no interest in discussion.&lt;/P&gt;</description>
