      <title>Sony doesn't trust Guides, player testimony, or screenshots. How are exploiters to be caught?</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=SOE&amp;message.id=4378#M4378</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Tonight (6/5/06) on the FV server, in Ruins of Takish a group of folks were obviously ghosting. They were taking down Criwea Strongbow without taking damage... blinking in and out of sight.&amp;nbsp; As luck would have it there were 3 guides on, so I sent a tell to the highest level one. Long story short, according to the Guide they are not allowed to travel around for investigative work.&amp;nbsp; I was told to submit a /report.&amp;nbsp; Umm... How exactly is a non-exploiter expected to get close enough to a raid mob to /report someone ghosting?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Heck, speaking from experience, even when a GM does get on in time they do nothing. I petitioned against some folks who were ghosting in PoF about a month ago. Within maybe half an hour I got a response saying they had no evidence. The kicker is, the exploiters were STILL in the zone, still ghosting! So I petitioned again, telling if they actually looked instead of saying there's no evidence they'd have their evidence.&amp;nbsp; Those folks are still around; nothing has been done.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So I have a few questions:&lt;br&gt;1- Why doesn't Sony trust their own Guides to go look and see if someone is exploiting?&amp;nbsp; Why tie their hands like that?&lt;br&gt;2- Why do Guides tell players to submit a petition when by the time a GM sees it the exploiters will be gone anyway, but if the Guide simply went and took a look they'd see it first hand?&lt;br&gt;3- Why do Guides and GMs frustrate players by asking for a /report, when they should know full well that (1) a report won't prove ghosting and (2) it's basically impossible to get close enough to a raid boss to do a /report anyway?&lt;br&gt;4- Why do GMs say there's no evidence instead of simply going to take a look?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If proof of any of these claims is needed I can provide numbers for the petition responses, and screenshots/logs of the Guide conversation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thank you.&lt;br&gt;-Nashwan&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN **SMURF**"FONT-SIZE: 11pt; COLOR: #cccccc; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;The in-game petition system has a lot of potential, but it is hamstrung by several things.&amp;nbsp; It has been the target of complaints for a very long time and it even fuels the SOE hating conspiracists who insist SOE hates its customers.&amp;nbsp; I think that’s extreme but the sentiment does come from some valid aggravation.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN **SMURF**"FONT-SIZE: 11pt; COLOR: #cccccc; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;OL type=1&gt;&#xD;

&lt;LI class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; COLOR: #cccccc; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in"&gt;&lt;SPAN **SMURF**"FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;Once you do get through this KB step, you can create a new ticket.&amp;nbsp; The&amp;nbsp;tickets, however are broken into categories with NO flexibility.&amp;nbsp; There needs to be better sub-categories and some "other" categories.&amp;nbsp; The current categories assume that every possible scenario is within their list and its not (not even close).&amp;nbsp; For example, I /petition someone with an offensive name of "hungli keamoose".&amp;nbsp; Is that a first&amp;nbsp;name offense or a last name offense ?&amp;nbsp; I know either will get it handled but it’s an example that the categories don't cover the problems.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; COLOR: #cccccc; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in"&gt;&lt;SPAN **SMURF**"FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;GM's frequently misunderstand or misread petitions and reply incorrectly.&amp;nbsp; This happens more than anyone cares to admit and is one of the major problems.&amp;nbsp; However, it could be alleviated if we simply allowed dynamic communication.&amp;nbsp; If a GM responds by misunderstanding, the petitioner could simply add a comment and clarify the issue.&amp;nbsp; However, GM's always close the petition and lock it so the petitioner can NOT add any info nor respond.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; COLOR: #cccccc; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in"&gt;&lt;SPAN **SMURF**"FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;Once the GM has closed the petition, the petitioner has to go all the way through steps 1,2,3 &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;SPAN **SMURF**"FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;AGAIN&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;, often to just restate what they already said.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; COLOR: #cccccc; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in"&gt;&lt;SPAN **SMURF**"FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;Players can only have one petition at a time, even if there are valid reasons for multiple petitions.&amp;nbsp; I understand you don't want to flood the GM's with petitions but if I see someone with an offensive name, I should be able to report them.&amp;nbsp; If I have an open petition for a stuck character or lost item , I can't report a cheater, exploiter, offensive name simply because I can't have two petitions open at once.&amp;nbsp; Also, imagine someone has the bad luck of handing their epic to their pet, which they petition.&amp;nbsp; Then, they get stuck in a death loop or something else.&amp;nbsp; They can't get help for both things ?!?&amp;nbsp; This makes no sense.&amp;nbsp; Make it so players can have two open issues simultaneously for themselves and they can report cheaters, exploits, bad names without limit.&amp;nbsp; If you restrict how many exploits a player can report .....well.....that kinda says enough, doesn't it?&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN **SMURF**"FONT-SIZE: 11pt; COLOR: #cccccc; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;Those are the problems, as I see them.&amp;nbsp; Here are my requests/suggestions to make this system usable:&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;OL type=1&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; COLOR: #cccccc; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: list .5in"&gt;&lt;SPAN **SMURF**"FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;Bypass the knowledge base.&amp;nbsp; Make a button called "quick petition".&amp;nbsp; Folks can use the KB if they want and will skip it if they don't (which they do anyway).&amp;nbsp; &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; COLOR: #cccccc; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: list .5in"&gt;&lt;SPAN **SMURF**"FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;Add an "other" sub-category for everything and a top level category called "other".&amp;nbsp; Also review recent petitions and make sure they fit in categories or add categories as needed.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; COLOR: #cccccc; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: list .5in"&gt;&lt;SPAN **SMURF**"FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;Only the customer will decide if their issue is resolved.&amp;nbsp; Only let the customer close a petition.&amp;nbsp; If there is a limit on personal petitions, they will choose to close them eventually.&amp;nbsp; Customers do this anyway by opening NEW petitions and it just aggravates them.&amp;nbsp; Change your internal system to stop tracking quota of closed petitions.&amp;nbsp; It’s a metric that is causing terrible backlash.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; COLOR: #cccccc; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: list .5in"&gt;&lt;SPAN **SMURF**"FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;Make a copy or forward button so you can open a new petition and automatically include all the info from a previous one, so you don't have to type it all in again.&amp;nbsp; Also, if you copy or forward the same subject you should SKIP the kb step automatically.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; COLOR: #cccccc; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: list .5in"&gt;&lt;SPAN **SMURF**"FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Remove the restrictions on certain petitions.&amp;nbsp; Any petition that reports a cheat or exploit or bad name or abuse should not be limited or affected by other open petitions.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Let players have two open petitions for their own help, on each character.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN **SMURF**"FONT-SIZE: 11pt; COLOR: #cccccc; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;Frankly, right now, a lot of customers are vilifying EQ Customer Service.&amp;nbsp; There is a lot of dissatisfaction.&amp;nbsp; Fixing this system could help a lot in that regard and shows customers some serious care about customers.&amp;nbsp; Simply telling customers "we are improving the GM/petition system" would go a long way.&amp;nbsp; As it is right now, it’s broken and has limited value.&amp;nbsp; It aggravates virtually everyone who uses it.&amp;nbsp; &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN **SMURF**"FONT-SIZE: 11pt; COLOR: #cccccc; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;It’s not all bad news, however.&amp;nbsp; The "ticket" tracking system can work, if implemented properly.&amp;nbsp; This just needs to make customers feel like you care about their problem and you are interested in helping the, instead of punishing them for having a problem.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: center" align=center&gt;&lt;SPAN **SMURF**"FONT-SIZE: 11pt; COLOR: #cccccc; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR align=center width="100%" SIZE=3&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN **SMURF**"FONT-SIZE: 11pt; COLOR: #cccccc; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;Again, I hope you don't view this as inflammatory nor CS-bashing, because it isn't.&amp;nbsp; I've posted some obvious problems along with suggestions for improvement and encouragement that it can be a good system.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN **SMURF**"FONT-SIZE: 11pt; COLOR: #cccccc; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN **SMURF**"FONT-SIZE: 11pt; COLOR: #cccccc; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;(corrected spelling)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN **SMURF**"FONT-SIZE: 11pt; COLOR: #cccccc; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;We apologize for the extremely short notice!&amp;nbsp; Unfortunately we need to bring all of our game forums down tonight for emergency maintenance.&amp;nbsp; We expect the forums to be available again at approximately 7pm PDT.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Again, all SOE game forums will be coming down TONIGHT at 5pm PDT for emergency maintenance.&amp;nbsp; ETA for forum availability is 7pm PDT.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;If the ETA changes between now and 5pm PDT I will update it here.&amp;nbsp; Otherwise I will try to keep you updated on the new portion of EQPlayers should the ETA change after 5pm PDT. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;UPDATE: The forums may be sporadically available between 5:30pm PDT and 7pm PDT while the QA department checks on the maintenance done, so you may find you have limited&amp;nbsp;access&amp;nbsp;during this time period.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Kytherea on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;05-23-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;04:33 PM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;EverQuest Titanium contains all the expansions save PoR for a hair less than 20 USD.&lt;br&gt;EverQuest PoR runs a hair less than 30 USD for the digital download.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please consider offering a 'catch up you current install' digital download bundle in the&lt;br&gt;40-50 USD range.  Ideally, one could return to EQ (perhaps to play on the progression&lt;br&gt;server) and for a mere 45$ get their distro caught up with all the current expansions&lt;br&gt;released, including PoR.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It would certainly make the barrier to returning much lower.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;P.S.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A welcome back cookie as a /claim item would be a nice touch.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Hello all. I have been reading alot on the new physics card by Ageia here as of late and it looks like a really great technology that EQ could do alot with. Partical effects, destroyable objects, collision stuff and the like. However i have yet to find one single thread here about it. Anyone know if this is something in EQ's future or if the engine overhauls would be too great. Holding off buying one for a while myself. EQ only game I play and as of right now Ageia physx card does not groove with XP64. Anyway what do yall think / have heard?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Myrdale Forestroamer&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>I just started palying again and I am now behind on a few expansions. What I was thinking was that it is cheaper for me to go purchase the Titanium and use that to update me. So I guess what I need to know is it cool to purchase Titanium and use the code on an existing account to bring it up to date instead of going an buying 4 expansions at $10 and $20 each?</description>

      <title>Everquest's fundamental growth problem</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=SOE&amp;message.id=4311#M4311</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I was having a conversation at work with another MMORPG player, a guy I had just met, and we were talking about various games we've played in the MMORPG universe. We talked about WoW, and how it was neat, but never really absorbed us. He talked about the game he played on a regular basis, FFXI. I tried it when it came out on US PC, didn't know much Japanese, and ended up quitting as a result. When he asked me what I played, I told him EverQuest, and he asked how the game was. Being a longtime fan of the game, (wouldn't still be playing if I wasn't ;) ) I found myself giving an answer that surprised me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I told him that while EverQuest was a pretty fun game for someone who's been playing it for a while, it's a pretty poor game to get started in these days.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We segue for a second. EverQuest II was supposed to be Sony's next hope- a next-generation game with which they could slowly ween the EverQuest playerbase from. (SOE said much to the contrary, and while I don't believe for a second that the plan with EQII was to eventually close EQ, it makes no sense to have two products from the same company compete against each other.) As is becoming apparent, that isn't happening, and Sony has responded with recent graphically intense expansions, having to keep the looks of a prior generation's game up to date with another.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The content of the past few expansions has dealt mostly with the 65-70 range, however, and this is where EverQuest's great growth problem lies. As we've all seen, EverQuest is extremely stratified. Almost all play takes place from 60-70; if you're below those levels, on most servers you can check the /lfg box all night and not see another person in your range looking.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All of this brings me to my point, and what I feel is EverQuest's problem #1- a new player &lt;i&gt;cannot&lt;/i&gt; play the game and eventually progress to that stratified tier of players.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If a new player has friends, they often powerlevel him through this phase. There is the option of forming lower level alts to play with your EverQuest newbie friend; but in practice, most people would rather have their friend level up to play with the characters they've gotten used to (EverQuest is very main-centric these days.) The new player also has the option of monster missions; however, I believe that to a new player, learning the game, 60 levels of monster missions is the most horrid thing you can do- especially when you leave MM's to fight in the real Norrath, and quickly find yourself playing a different game.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the traditional EverQuest mold of looking for strangers to team up with and kill the dragons, EverQuest no longer offers that pre-60. Which leads to the fundamental problem; how do you encourage growth in EverQuest, in the current stratified atmosphere?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first question I asked myself in response to this was &amp;quot;does Sony &lt;i&gt;want&lt;/i&gt; EverQuest to grow?&amp;quot; While a company is usually always hoping to grow their product, SOE faces the difficult position now of having two products compete with each other. Several EQ players have EQII subscriptions, but then again, several EQ players also have WoW subscriptions. However, I don't believe that at this point SOE hopes to shunt the EQ playerbase, via migration, over to EQII. The alternative here, and the one I believe Sony will stick to, is one of ugly coexistence. Thus I expect Sony continues to hope for the growth of both games.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That being said, what can realistically be done about this problem? Monster missions were a cure to the &lt;i&gt;absolute&lt;/i&gt; problem of not being able to level, but in the end they were more of a shot in the arm than a panacea.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are no easy solutions to this. One could go for another XP cutting mission in the lower levels, but in the end all that does is restrict a player's learning, while simultaneously bombarding them frequently with new abilities before they've gotten a grip on the old ones. Reducing the exp required to level only shrinks the 1-60 world, and makes the level appropriate content that much more useless, as it's being used for less time. Another option, which SOE will, eventually, pick up on, is to offer pre-loaded characters. The MMORPG gamer in me that levelled quite a few characters quite high despises this idea, and I'd like to see it held off for as long as economically feasible. This doesn't just shrink 1-60 content; it all but wipes it from the game.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The only option I see in which to develop an environment in which new player growth is fostered is a difficult one, radically shifting the attitudes of the playerbase- SOE must break the &amp;quot;culture of the main&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;People place a lot of attachment, and a lot of effort into their main characters. There is a virtually limitless ceiling (yes, some people have hit it, and I think you folks are sick and need some sunlight) on experience for characters, and as content grows stronger, you need more and more experience and abilities to be able to handle it. Raiding requires large amounts of experience to be placed into a character. There is a large, large incentive these days to stick to one character as &amp;quot;yours&amp;quot;, with a few other &amp;quot;alts&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sony must start developing content which encourages players to dust off old characters, or to start new ones. An environment must be created where a new player can log in, get through the tutorial- and then be able to reliably find a couple of people to partner up with. If players are continuously steered towards the next advancement mission, this won't occur.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The next expansion, as word has found its way out, will have content from 1-70. A great danger I see here is if this is a '35-70' expansion in the sense that GoD and OoW were. If most of the content is steered towards the high end, there's nothing new to entice people to explore any of the lower-level areas. They'll sit mostly dead except for powerlevelling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Old content needs to be reinvigorated alongside new lower level content, and &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; in the way that Nektulos was. If you have an array of content for lower-level players, supplement that by making small changes to the zones that old players grew up in. The Befallen revamp was a good example, but changes don't even have to be so immense. Have some unusually strong, unusually numerous wolves in WC from one patch to the next. Have a small camp of &amp;quot;boat sabateurs&amp;quot; near the docks in BB. If old content is more dynamic then it currently is- typically dead and static 11 months out of the year, then affected by some anniversary or holiday event the other- it'll be more attractive, and people might just opt out of that 700th black wing run to go explore that new content in Toxxullia Forest with their little beastlord. You don't have to make radical changes to the world; you just need to keep it &lt;i&gt;alive&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another question that needs to be explored is the high-end. Sony last tried this with PoP, releasing LoY and LDoN, two mid-range geared expansions after a long, high-level progressive one. In the end, a lot of guilds ended up killing Quarm week after week while waiting for something new- and not everyone necessarily wants to play an alt at all. Progression is also usually held in check by experience and gear, both of which consume large amounts of playtime. Content for these players has to be maintained, upgraded, and freshly designed, and all of this takes manhours.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I suggest slightly increasing the amount of players which reach the &amp;quot;end&amp;quot; of an expansion before the release of the next expansion. Have a Mata Muram style boss around- something to shoot for, but something that probably won't be dead until that next expansion &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; released. Having three guilds at the end of one expansion before the next is released, I think, is perhaps too quick. Let the people that &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; to beat the content as fast as possible end up with a month of farming the last boss, and devote what time you can save towards freshening up old zones. It doesn't take a large-scale, heavily planned effort; just a few visible ones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In order to continue the growth of EverQuest, SOE need to put more effort into making Norrath a relivable world. Players have to have a reason to explore that old content, and to be that community a new player can join, beyond the transient urge to try out another character. With a solid effort at giving new players the game every role-playing MMORPG promises- a dynamic world in which you can meet friends and explore the world- EverQuest can pull out of the holding pattern it is in and introduce a whole new breed of players to Norrath.&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

Also, it will offer a single point where players can manage payments and link to other Sony-run sites carrying player rankings and information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It's not going to stop at the PC,&amp;quot; said Nathan Pearce, a creative director at Sony Online Entertainment, which is a subsidiary of Sony Pictures Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the debut, Station Launcher will connect users to Sony's &amp;quot;EverQuest,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;The Matrix Online,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Star Wars Galaxies,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;PlanetSide&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;EverQuest II.&amp;quot; Unlimited play of all five games through a Sony Station Access subscription plan costs $24.99 a month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sony also will add &amp;quot;Vanguard: Saga of Heroes&amp;quot; to the Station Launcher lineup this winter, Pearce said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Games on Station Launcher will constantly update to computers with live online connections so subscribers can go straight into play rather than waiting for new information to download every time they boot up. The service uses technology from Microsoft that transfers files using leftover bandwidth, ensuring uninterrupted computer use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has had unexpected success with Xbox Live, which connects through its Xbox and Xbox 360 consoles and allows players to compete, download content, chat and build an online profile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The community-oriented features behind Xbox Live's popularity are nothing new to many PC gamers who have been chatting, competing, trading and building virtual characters inside individual games for years. They have also helped to drive the success of upstarts like MySpace.com as well as major online companies like eBay Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sony, which aims to retain its dominance in the $30 billion global video game market with the PS3, has vaguely outlined its plan to offer features that will match Xbox Live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
