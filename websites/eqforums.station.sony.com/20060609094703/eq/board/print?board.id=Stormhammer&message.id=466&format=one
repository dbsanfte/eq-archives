				<DIV>I agree that it was a great idea....and it's sort of nice to have the "collect as fast as you can" events, but I really hope they are not all like that. It's a nice little change from the norm but on the other hand it shouldnt be overdone.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>As far as the guild recruitment thing: I am very happy they have decided to do this.....but it puts my guild (and no doubt a few of the other guilds) in a pinch, we are a casual family guild....makes it kinda of hard to get all our people together if we don't have at least a 1 week notice....we have been given a&nbsp;3 day notice and I am scrambling to get my people together to at least have 2 representatives for the time slots. I was kinda bummed when they didn't announce when the guild recruitment would be since we had all been told that the summer festival would start on Monday, I just sort of assumed that they would start the recruitment thing on Monday so I set aside my time and it didn't happen....</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
<DIV>There will obviously be things that people would say should change and I am sure they will take these suggestions in and apply them to the next festival (or any event like this). But the general idea of this festival is great imo! For all the people at SOE that put their time and ideas into creating this I would like to say thank you = )</DIV></DIV>
