    <title>KB Downtime @ Fri Sept 24 5pm PDT</title>
    <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Kane&amp;message.id=50</link>
    <description>Copied from the tech boards, since I doubt it will be answered there.  Maybe it will be answered here, though I'm starting to doubt that too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;---&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kane Bayle was just shut down with 13 minutes warning, on a Friday night. We were told to go to EQLive for information on this downtime. So, some questions:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. Why is Kane Bayle down?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. What is the ETA?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3. Why has this not been posted for the customers to see?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am getting tired of paying for a service and not seeing these two questions answered, either here on the boards, on EQLive, or in Chat. We are your customers. Treat us with respect.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thank you in advance.</description>
