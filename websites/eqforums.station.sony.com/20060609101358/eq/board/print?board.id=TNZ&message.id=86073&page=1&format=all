				<DIV>For me PoP saved EQ, Gave me goals although hard still possicle but of course not instantly. I am Guild Leader of a Family type RP guild which is rather small but very old to.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I am well aware there is some content I may not get to because im not uber, but im not complaining if I ever really want to see it I can go uber some day it isnt SOE's fault that high level members get taken by other guilds as mentioned above it is because that paying member wanted more out of their game.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Seems lately here we get these people who get to 65 in a week then whine and throw fits that they cant have every thing sence the newer players so used to having every thing handed to then starting at creation now.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I my self am only 3 big fights from being elemental and the only way I got this far was by putting a lot of effort into my goals. if you really want to get to these places it is possible even if your not uber, whinning about it isnt going to get you there.</DIV>

<DIV>See, my guild raids 3-4 hours a night, 5 days a week&nbsp;and are in qvic.&nbsp; Since most guild members are adults that have full time jobs, some have families, raiding much more than that is impossible.&nbsp; We do long raids on Sundays as we can start earlier.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I realise that doesn't fit in with your distorted view of raiding guilds, but I will continue to point out and correct&nbsp;the blatant lies people post here about them.</DIV>

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>onomatopoeia has some decent points later on (I disagree with many of them, but they are decent).&nbsp; However, here she/he is distorting the record in much the same way as she complains about.&nbsp; 3-4 raids on weekdays, longer on Sunday -&gt; 20+ hours per week.&nbsp; The quote about 20+ hours/day or 10+ hours per day is over the wall (although, we all probably know people who do spend 10+ hours/day).&nbsp; The point would have been the same if the number had been 20+ hours/week.</P>
<P>I didn't start until a couple of months before Kunark, so I didn't experience the lines in Lower Guk and Sol B.&nbsp; However, to say the difference between casual guild equipment and full raid equipment has not exploded&nbsp;since then&nbsp;is quite naieve.&nbsp; At one time, you could join a Hate raid and contribute to the raid even if you were equipped with sub-par junk.&nbsp; That is no longer true with the current high end content.</P>
<P>Now that we know GoD was designed with level 70 in mind, it is clear why only a small select group of players&nbsp;has been successful there.&nbsp; The selection criteria is, of course, equipment -- and better than a normal casual guild player can expect to see (other than a couple of nice items).</P>

				<P>Okay I am beginning to revise my sympathy for casuals who cannot get into the elementals..</P>
<P>Look, you can't just jump into Planes of Power and expect to be flagged for elementals straight away. When I started leading raids, we had raids of 2-3 groups and we were lucky if we had more than 1 cleric, so we did Velious and Luclin content. That's where I started. I am now elemental flagged, along with virtually everyone in our guild.</P>
<P>Go back. Do Velious, and when you feel ready, go onto Luclin. Skip VT if you don't want to do the timesink, but make sure you do SSRA because it's widely acknowledged as a well designed raiding zone. You need to get Luclin quality gear as a minimum before killing PoP targets. And many of the Luclin targets are a lot of fun (there are loads of them, even without VT).</P>
<P>By then you should have well geared people. You can start on PoP content.</P>
<P>If you only have 3-4 groups don't despair. A lot of the content is doable for you if you have geared up in Luclin beforehand. The following things should all be perfectly feasible, though those marked with an asterix I would leave till last as they will need practise and precision to beat.</P>
<P>PoN: Spider Queen, Croc, Hedge, Terris Thule*</P>
<P>PoI: Xanamech, Bohemoth*</P>
<P>PoD: Grummus*</P>
<P>CoD: Paffa, Carpin Cycle*</P>
<P>PoV: Aerin Dar*</P>
<P>Torment: Saryn</P>
<P>Drunder: VZ, named mobs, TZ*</P>
<P>BoT: Each of the 4 towers</P>
<P>HoH: The two non dragon trials</P>
<P>and I probably missed some.</P>
<P>Once you have been through all that, you should only need RD, Bertox and MM to be flagged for Solro tower. Make a short term alliance, go on open raids, make your own open raid whatever it takes to get some more numbers and kill these targets. You don't want to farm these mobs, you want to kill them once to get the flag.</P>
<P>And then you are flagged for Solro Tower. Solro Tower has 5 minis, all doable with 4 groups, as is Solusk Ro probably if you gear up enough. Oh, loot in Solro is great, and you get a ton of ornate armour.</P>
<P>By the time you have farmed Solro Tower to death, you will be able to 4 group Agnarr without difficulty.</P>
<P>Then you just need RZ. Once again, form an alliance, join an open raid, make your own open raid. Kill him. It will take you a few tries unless you really know what you are doing.</P>
<P>And then you are flagged for elementals. Get many AAs. Get a few good drops from named in Earth. Go to GoD.</P>
<P>This whole process will take probably 6 months minimum. Yes, it's a long time.&nbsp;But it is actually a very fun journey with many rewards (new zones, new things to see, sense of acheivement when you have a flag, new loot, new challenges). Get started, have fun and good luck.</P>
<P>Shackleton</P>
<P>P.S. Sorry for length and slight hijack, had to get it off my chest.</P>

				<P>Something that just struck me after reading thread after thread of the same thing in this envy debate.</P>
<P>The assumption that people in Ep/Time just magically had SoE wave a hand over them and bless them with access. They all did all the lower-end/Older expansion content to get there. And the leaders did it in gear that was one expansion old. Without spoiler sites handing out strats on how to kill every mob in the game.</P>
<P>Sometimes I think that a lot of the people that want to have equal access to EP/Time/GoD gear while only playing 5 hours a week have only been playing this game since PoP or later. They don't seem to grasp that people fought Vox/Naggy in Banded and Bronze armor, a FBSS with 21% haste and no stats on it was godly, Shaman stat buffs actually meant something, and if you had a weapon with&nbsp;a 3:1 ratio you were Uber. You can buy "Casual Uberness" in the Bazaar or from LDoN</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>LDoN gets boring. Time gets boring the 40th time you're through it also I bet. Stop prepetuating the myth that <STRONG>ALL </STRONG>of GoD needs Elemental+ gear to do. Natimbi can now be done by a group of low 50s in decent gear. Decent like Cultural Armor, recommended level 45, player made. You know, the stuff that you can buy that is better than the Skyshrine Quest armor people mentioned raiding for that wasn't good enough for you? All the GoD zones were re-tuned. In Natimbi, none of the animals are KoS anymore. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>People complaining that places other than PoP have lone and tiresome corpse runs? Well gee, if you raided anything before PoP that was what you were in for. You want to play in GoD? That's what you're in for. And in GoD there are mobs that see through Rogue SoS, so better have a Necro in group to summon those bodies. And some Cloudy Potions since you'll have to run back to the zone to get summoned.</P>
<P>I was the 10th player the day my first guild was formed. I was level 3 and had never left Everfrost Canyons that day. Had to spend 2 days in Gfay waiting for a GM to come certify us. I was in that guild for 2+ years, leaving it 3 months ago. I tried and tried to get us started on a progression. Plate cycle in Kael, then Arena. Working faction and getting Thurg armor. <STRONG>More important than any of that was learning how to coordinate on a raid</STRONG>. Finally getting to a point to try Halls of Testing in ToV. Had a nice run through first time. Had a very cool Ranger friend from one of the Server's top guilds nursemaid us through it. Had nice drop rate. People went en mass to SS to finish their armors. 75% were vocally disappointed in the end result. Our problem? We were doing this last November, and mudflation and trickle down, most everyone had better stuff already. But HoT is where you learn <STRONG>how</STRONG> to raid. How to deal with things like AE and Gaters. But in the Loot First culture that EQ is more and more becomming, raiding all but stopped aside from an occasional epic. We became a LDoN guild. No one wanted to put in the time to learn since gearing up was not necessary. </P>
<P>Flagging is a blessing and a curse. I really don't see a ton of stuff in PoV that really necessitated having to pass that darned PoJ trial to kill. The Trial dynamic is completely different from the grouping dynamic in the zone it unlocks. Sony did the right thing when they unlocked Tier 2 and some of Tier 3 awhile back, even though it did turn BoT into Karnors 2.0. The only Tier 3 zone that remains flagged has an alternate entry quest that is one groupable in Plane of Storms. There really are not enough "camps" in Elementals to let in anyone that is 65 for example.</P>
<P>Without a single piece of raid loot, I have tanked all 100 mobs in an Vxed GoD trial. With no Enchanter pet crutch. We ran into trouble at the very end and did not get chance to hail because of a wipe, but we did drop named that dropped a great hybrid cloak that rotted because we had none on trial <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-sad.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0>&nbsp; Before saying there is nothing to do outside Elemental flagged zones, go out and try. If you or your group can do a Hard LDoN (remember that? The ones that are boring to death?) then you can do the trials to get flagged for KT in GoD.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I wish you well</P>

				<P>Thank you for your comments, this has helped my understanding a lot&nbsp; <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0></P>
<P>I had no idea drops were so good at the Chardok ent on the Burning Staff, getting 40 drops over 2 days (8hours playing time) sounds good to me. We thought the drops at Royals would be better.</P>
<P>I am in a 3 year old, off peak guild on an old server. We are not whiny PL'd 65's. We just got a shock when we discovered the bottleneck for elementals.</P>
<P>I now think we will avoid elemental planes altogether. We will kill Luclin and other mobs and maybe do Ssra a couple of times a month (Saturday nights for big Raids, rest of the week LDoN and small events)&nbsp;and in a year we will have our 40 active players (3-4 group raids) upgeared to do GoD. We want challenge but we also want fun, doing Ssra every saturday for months wouldnt be fun&nbsp;. VT shards arent fun from what I have read, and not a lot of challenge since they have to be farmed and if you cant farm them then wayyyy too time consuming on top of the normal time. Farming VP keys looks like its un fun also, Trak is only up occassionally, it will take months to get all the teeth.</P>
<P>In the meantime we will hope for changes to old world zones and LDoN scaling for less than 36 person raids and less than 6 person groups.</P>
<P>The biggest issue apart from all that is the freezing/rebooting bug its causing us to cancel events and lose members <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-mad.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0></P>

				<P>SSRA might surprise you =)</P>
<P>It is up there with places like NToV for fun factor. The encounters are well designed and although the mobs are all pretty similar looking, there's enough atmosphere and lore for you to actually think "What have I done???" when you awaken the Cursed, Destroyer of Gods... The loot and droprate is also very good (especially for cursed cycle) and there are enough different targets of different difficulty that it will keep you busy for a while =) Recommend you start with Rhag cycle and work from there =)</P>
<P>VT key shard camp isn't as bad as people say. But VT itself really is as bad as people say. It's a very /yawn zone and not friendly to casuals because it takes a loooong time to clear.</P>
<P>Be sure to stop by in Griegs End at some point and kill Grieg Venecius. I love that zone =)</P>

				For me and most my friends the problem isn't equipment envy.  The problem is that you need the equipment to make any reasonable use of the expansions.  Sony needs to make money on the expansions to keep the game alive and there is not enough content to make the expansions really worth while to folks like me. (I'm speaking of GoD and also from what I fear OOW will be).  I'd really like to have a refund on GoD.  So what the end up doing is putting in one or two nifty things and the regular folks cough up the bucks to pay for the expansion content for the upper tiered guilds. I don't want to do that any more.  The reasonable thing is to have most the content that almost anyone can enjoy and a few zones that upper levels only can enjoy as part of an expansion.<br><br>I want to enjoy the journey.  I've lost the company of a lot of friends because I've refused to level madly through the game.  I want to go to new places and enjoy and learn them without having to wait for things to be green.  Or having to raid much (if at all). When you guys talk about working hard to get stuff.. it shouldn't BE work it should be fun.  I all the time hear about the drudgery of keying and back keying.  It shouldn't be drudgery it should be fun.  They need to find a way to make progression fun because the game, like life, isn't really about being there it's about getting there.  (I'm not saying everyone else should enjoy the game the same way I do only that this is the way I play it.)  To allow me to play the game the way I have enjoyed it up till now then say 'no! you must raid  now you must mindlessly work on keys now" is just rude.

				Don't snub gear just because it's from old expansions.  The game is designed in such a way that there's a reasonbly logical progression of gear.<br><br>Last night my guild was working on the Rathe encounter.  Being able to make a credible attempt at the encounter does in fact require a large number of people with a large number of flags with a large amount of good gear.  But do you know where we were 18 months ago?  NToV, gearing up. I suspect a few members still have some isolated items from ToV equipped.  I know for a fact at least 2 guilds coming up behind us spent their time in ToV as well.   It's still a completely valid starting point for a guild, and certainly not to be snubbed.  <br><br>We more or less skipped Luclin outside of isolated targets (Grieg, the AR mobs, Burrower Beast, 1 THO kill (never again!), occasional SSRA targets). And for reasons I don't recall, pretty much everone got an emp key, so we did kill emp once or twice. We mostly skipped Luclin because 2 guilds had SSRA and VT locked down, and low-level PoP was wide open.  Those guilds have moved on, though, and VT is most often cleared by semi-open raids these days.<br><br>Mostly we hit the BoT towers.  They reset every few hours, so it's not hard to find something up to kill.  Again, don't knock the gear, I'm still using some stuff from the towers, as are most of my guildies.  These aren't very difficult encounters (only sand tower is hard at all) and the loot at the point you get it is quite exciting.   Did we hit the towers over and over and over?  Yeah, we did, but we got a lot of nice loot, had a lot of fun, and every raid night a lot of guildies logged happy with their new stuff.  A guild of 30ish could have a lot of fun farming these towers.<br><br>The PoP flag encounters are hard if you're coming to them in a true progession style.  They will challenge your patience.  You will lose.  Several times, to most of them.  But it's all the better when you win.  My guild had particular difficulty with RZtW.  I don't even know how many times we ran through that script.  But you know what I do remember?  Literally jumping out of my chair and yelling the night we did beat him.      My favorite EQ moment ever.  I'd been a member of my guild for a reasonable amount of time at that point, but that was the moment I became    committed to the guild to the very end.  We'd faced a major challenge, been hit with major frustration, showed a couple of cracks, but in the end we managed to all work together flawlessly and we came through it.  <br><br>I think PoP is a marvellously designed expansion for guilds.  As you move along, you're *forced* to learn to play better as a guild.  With the exception of a few "gimmes" (Fennin Ro and his boy Sol Ro come to mind), the encounters become increasingly more difficult and require increasingly more coordination with your raid force.   That's good for guilds, learning to work together with ever increasing precision and teamwork.<br><br>PoP takes time, and it takes effort. So be it.  I wouldn't have it any other way.

<P>They will need to tweak the non EP road to GoD I think. If everyone uses Luclin etc then they need to cut and randomise the pop times to avoid queues, SSra the new KC? They also need to upgrade many of the old world zones and make LDoN gear available for resale (for poits credit) back to the adventure merchants. It takes far too long to purchase anything considering no one buys mid level LDoN stuff. This make the rewards far too long in coming.</P>

<DIV>The solution is not removing the flagging system but rather do away with the huge death penalties, removing the no drops making everything tradable, and making alternate ways for smaller groups to get flagged. If you own the expansions and have the appropriate level, you should be able to reap their rewards no matter what your playing style. SOE should make gear level appropriate but remove the no drop part. </DIV>
