<DIV>Hiya all.&nbsp; I truly hope that this is the correct place for this...&nbsp; Missions and quests seemed closer than all the other listings I have found so far though.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>For reference below, I will detail two of the groups that I tried to pull these missions with (3-boxed):</DIV>
<DIV>Group 1: 70 Cleric (DE), 69 Mage (DE, Agnostic), 61 Shaman (Barb, Tribunal)&nbsp; **all these are apprehensive to the Dark Reign Camp**</DIV>
<DIV>Group 2: 62 Warrior (WE, Rallos Zek), 61 Shaman (Barb, Tribunal), 57 Bard (WE, Agnostic)</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Problems:</DIV>
<DIV>With BOTH groups, I could only get the ones standing at the fire to talk to me...&nbsp; the ones closest to the wall wouldn't talk to me (seemed like my faction wasn't high enough) and the rest would just give a message stating that my group does not meet the requirements for requesting a mission, or something to that effect.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>With Group 1, if the cleric requested the adventure from the ones in the middle, I would get a message stating that the average level of the group was too low.&nbsp; If I tried to get with the shaman, I would get a message stating that the average level was too high.&nbsp; This had me scratching my head so I thought maybe the level spread was only 7 levels (even though It was stated that the level spread would be 10 on one of the threads by a dev...&nbsp; I will post link to that thread once I am able to find it again) so I tried with Group 2.&nbsp; If my shaman requested, the group average was too high.&nbsp; If the Bard requested, the average was too low (please note a <U>5</U> level difference here).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Questions:</DIV>
<DIV>Is anyone else able to get a mission from these camps? Is there a quest or something you have to do before you can get the missions?</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Thank you very much for any help that you can provide (even if it's just pointing me into the right direction so I can fix my own idiocy...&nbsp; whatever, I just want to be able to enjoy the expansion), and sorry for the incomplete post before... not sure exactly what happened there</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>

				everyone starts out with very low faction with both camps, well they're supposed to <br><br>the trick is to do mission after mission to get better faction at the certain camp you want.  after completing a mission you get a faction token to turn in at the "alliance camp"<br><br>if you cant get a mission from either good or evil camps, try to get a mission from the "alliance" camp which is by the nagafens lair zone in which is directly south from the evil camp by the lip of the lava pit...<br><br>if you go there read the missions that they say to you, they mention either the good or evil camps that they work for.  you may need to do alliance camp missions in order to unlock the ones at the good/evil camps first.<br><br>hope this helps

<P>you take them SE of nagafen's lair zone in (south of evil camp) at the lip of the lava pit, there are "allliance" wayfarers there, you give the token to either the male (evil) or female (good) to gain faction with the tokens, do this after each&nbsp; mission</FONT></P>

<DIV>I'm a bit confused on why they've chosen this method of implementation for the new adventures:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>1. With the current low population of "Active" players, it's been close to impossible to get ldons, and many days</DIV>
<DIV>pickup groups. Now that there are 2 seperate camps with faction hits reducing people available for groups at</DIV>
<DIV>either camp will be 1/2, or less, unless one manages to stay netural'ish, by doing adventures in both camps on a regular basis.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>2. Not knowing what items are available at each camp, before selecting which camp to faction with: how would one </DIV>
<DIV>know what is the best camp, in the long run, to take adventures from for thier class?&nbsp; From what I've read you can currently</DIV>
<DIV>only see items from 300-340??&nbsp;points &amp; below.&nbsp; Hopefully there will be a complete list of items available for each camp</DIV>
<DIV>soon.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>3. Unless there are different items for each camp, why even go the faction route?</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>4. Are there also faction + &amp; - for each camp killing mobs while in the new DoN missions?</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Not having done a mission yet, would like to know a little more before rushing in and selecting one of the camps, to avoid problems</DIV>
<DIV>later on.... 1st post&nbsp; to boards, so be gentle <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0></DIV>

				It appears that there are incrementing awards at each camp as you increase your faction.  Someone just mentioned that they won a free AA for raising their faction at one camp.<br><br>You can use the Wayfarers over east of the Nagafen entrance to turn in tokens for the faction you want and even perform solo tasks that effect your faction.<br><br>The tasks themselves and the gear from each camp seems to be the same.  You will, however, have to trade your crystals for the opposite sides crystals but I don't really see this as any more restricting than the LDON camp items.

</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I had the same problem...</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>in group, we had the lowest at 59 and highest at 66 (if i remember well: 59Wiz, 61SK, 64Cle, 66Nec, 65Rng, &nbsp;64 druid).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>the only quest we could get was: A simple task. All other quest was saying that group was too hight for that mission.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>let me say this ! this mission was a HELL, mob quad for 700 (i was tank, got wacked a few time)... this mission is more like 65+</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>now DEV question:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>-Explain how those mission work, restriction, Dynamic on getting one.</DIV>
<DIV>-Why when i asked for a mission, none was avail to me, getting the message that group was too hight and that </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;the Necro could only get this one (that was too hight and hard for the group we had)</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Thx in advance.</DIV>
