    <description>&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Fact#1 -  EQ PvPers are and always have been in the vast minority.  That's not up for debate.  If you don't like it, too bad.&lt;p&gt;Fact#2 -  EQ was not designed around PvP.  That's not up for debate.  If you don't like it, too bad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In regards to fact number 1. In the case of all the servers in everquest, there is 1 pvp server. In terms of pvp being the minority, yes, the pvp server is the minority, in terms of people not liking pvp is false, SoE has made it that way by only supporting 1 pvp server.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In regards to fact number 2. This fact as you claimed it, is a highly debatable subject. Verant developed everquest, not SoE, and not once has verant ever said Everquest was not built for pvp, because what is a fact, is that there were pvp servers in everquest's release, and at it's peak, there were 4 of them, 3 of them with differen't rule sets. You can't say something wasn't made for pvp, because original everquest pvp was very balenced indeed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here's a matter of opinion, SoE took over the game with the development of luclin, and since then THEY have geared everqust away from pvp.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everquest was definetly made so that it could support pvp.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>True "Classic" fans would go PVP</title>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;If they allowed a PVP and PVE server most classic fans would go to the PVP server. When you really think about it &amp;quot;progression&amp;quot; on a pvp version of this server would come to a huge halt. If a guild is about to kill Nagafen and unlock Kunark how much do you bet tons of people who don't want Kunark would zerg the raid and wipe them? Preserving the &amp;quot;classic&amp;quot; feel of the server. By time its PVE version reached Velious or hell even Luclin the PVP server could still probably be working on getting Kunark opened or just getting into Kunark.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;PVP would just about halt the progression of a progression server, so if it is available I'm there :smileywink:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Just wanted to point it out.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>PvP is too poorly implemented / balanced in Everquest.  EQ is a PvE game, with a bit of PvP grafted onto it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PvP is a small minority of the total EQ player base.  Since classic will also be a minority, the number of ppl wanting to do both is probably quite small, too small to justify a server.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Most EQ players have never wanted PvP, it's always been a choice.&amp;nbsp; We used to have multi-PvP servers, now we have one.&amp;nbsp; For those of us on the "bluebie/carebear" servers, 99.999% (made up but most likely true percentage) are NOT PvP.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;And, by the way, Wikipedia says:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;One pronunciation of the gaming term &lt;A title=Pwn href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pwn" target=_blank&gt;pwn&lt;/A&gt;. &lt;/LI&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I think all classic server fans would go with all NPCs have harmtouch that refreshes every 10 seconds.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I'm so there if that happens.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Progression != classic. i keep getting irritated by this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;also, PVP is poorly done in EQ. im sorry to tell you this, but its true. and i havent seen enough demand for PVP to justify making a PVP progressive server&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Chanaluss_of_Kunzar on &lt;span class="date_text"&gt;04-18-2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;12:39 PM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Hopefully dev's will notice that pvp is in a high demand, and this would be a great opportunity to gain back respect and support of the developing team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>actually you went farther then that, you went on to point out how pvper's are and always have been a minority. You seemed to talk on behalf of pvpers by saying &amp;quot;Most people who enjoy PvP are not going to be EQ for long. It's not built for it.&amp;quot; not only does part of that sentence not even make sense, you have no right to speak on a pvper's part especially if you havn't played on a pvp server pre luclin (when most people who enjoyed pvp overwhelmingly agree that was when it was the most balanced contrary to your bluebie claim)&lt;br&gt;Seriously people give up your anti pk crusade and go fight some mobs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

Just because less than 10% of the population of everquest plays on zek, doesn't mean they don't like pvp. I don't play on zek for various reasons, however I still love eq pvp.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Zek is a horrible example of how everquest pvp was and is today.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

If you don't think that is true than I can't help you understand it. It's like arguing that 10 is less than 9. I never said anything about what people like or dislike. I said less people play on PvP servers and that is a fact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You continue to make things up to argue about. Either read the thread or stop posting.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why do YOU keep posting parsis? seriously no one cares about your bluebie opinion by saying only a small percent of players like pvp your pretty much implying there shouldn't be a server for us, soo I guess all minorities in the western world shouldn't have a home and lifestyle anyway similar to their culture? Why are you so anti --- whatever? go post your &lt;u&gt;positive&lt;/u&gt; opinion for a bluebie classic server and get out of this thread.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I keep posting because knucklehead kept misqouting me. The original poster said that more people would play on a PvP server than a PvE server. I said this was not true. Thats it. Thats all i said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You guys seem to think i'm saying something negative about PvP.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
