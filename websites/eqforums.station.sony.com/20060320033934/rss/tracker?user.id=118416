      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Yes, it can be done at level 50.  That's when I assisted my brother's druid to get through his epic, though he was 52 by the end of the quest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My ranger, whose epic requires the same initial steps, was able to begin and complete the early steps at level 49.  She was 51 by the end of her quest (and yes, she has both swords).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Faction is very much an issue, so if you have a Druid around 49-ish, the factions might be the only thing standing in your way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Happy Questing!  :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;3 weeks, every time I logged in, camping the Ghoul Arch Magus in Lower Guk for the Shining Metallic Robes.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
I slew him numerous times, but he kept dropping the leggings&#xD;
instead.&amp;nbsp; *mutters something mildly unladylike about RNG and&#xD;
Murphy's Law*&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
I was starting to get a little twitchy, so when I saw one on sale at a&#xD;
semi-reasonable price in Bazaar, my resolve to hunt every piece myself&#xD;
crumbled before the temptation to remain sane.&amp;nbsp; My chanter was finally&#xD;
able to progress in her epic 1.0 quest (now completed).&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
I've gone back to that camp a time or two, since I have a young Rogue&#xD;
coming up and that epic also requires the robes... but so far, even&#xD;
though I may see the ghoul, he's never wearing his robes.&amp;nbsp; *sighs*&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
So... I find other things to do with my time. ;)&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
And... I hope the RNG is in a kinder mood when I start seriously camping for the Rogue.&amp;nbsp; &lt;span&gt;:smileysurprised:&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
For the Fabled Mithril Breastplate, and the Fabled robe of the Ishva, I&#xD;
think it was around 17 hours each camp, non-stop.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; At least&#xD;
with the other camp situation I paused for little things like sleep...&#xD;
but I also knew it would have to spawn eventually.&amp;nbsp; The Fabled,&#xD;
that round, we didn't know how long we'd have and didn't want to miss&#xD;
the opportunity.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Lore&amp;message.id=9598#M9598</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Yes, I've wondered about the lines of succession also.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Especially since the latest storyline entries indicated that Firiona Vie was beginning to go grey... the King (formerly believed to be her father) must be even older, and Norrathian Elves do seem to die of old age eventually.  So... who's next in line?  Was Firiona the Queen's only child?  Was that the only Queen, or was there another before her?  Will the king remarry, and produce another child before his end comes?  Yet it seems he has gone this long alone, which would make a marriage now appear to be more about expediency in preserving the royal line than about his own good or the good of Felwithe (beyond preventing chaos upon his demise).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I would imagine that the King of the High Elves would not desire a feeding-frenzy to tear apart his realm if he were to perish without anyone being appointed and acknowledged as Heir to the Throne... though it's not like Firiona picked who would be her biological father, so it's slightly possible that King Tearis Thex might eventually have forgiven her -- if her biological father hadn't spread word so far and wide of claiming the girl for his own offspring!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The dark Thex line hasn't mentioned if the current reigning King has any offspring. They've been around at least as long as the High Elven king, if I'm understanding correctly.  So... just how old and senile are they growing? And who will replace them when they die or are assassinated?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One thing I've missed in Norrath is the appearance of both elderly and children -- at least among NPC's.  I can understand not having player characters overly young or old, since the role-play message is that your character has &amp;quot;just come of age according to their kind&amp;quot; when you create them.  However, it does seem odd that there are almost no children or elders (visually) in any of the towns.  Just one or two &amp;quot;smaller adults&amp;quot; that are treated as children in the quests (Joshua and Shanai are the only ones I can recall at the moment).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's a little distracting having all the NPC's being folks &amp;quot;in their prime&amp;quot; ... one wonders if there's a school or hospital hidden behind a door somewhere, and that's where they lock away the young and old respectively!  *shudders at the thought*&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I like the idea of doing at least &amp;quot;minor&amp;quot; facelifts to more of the older zones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One example would be the Faydarks and the Commonlands.  If they just update the trees to Jaggedpine / PoKnowledge style, it would make a huge difference visually without really changing anything in the layout or functionality of the zone.  I like Kelethin as it is, though I'd prefer railings added to the ramps so that a body can see where the ramps are located without having to peek over the edge!  ;)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I like the idea of making some of the 2-zone cities into a single zone, but keep as much of the feel and layout of the original as possible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I like the idea of Felwithe becoming a single zone containing all its current facilities, and adding a bit more &amp;quot;royal&amp;quot; feel to it.  If ever a city cried for a library, it's Felwithe!  Hey, the High Elves live a long time, and are supposed to be among the more wise/intelligent races on Norrath, and they do seem to keep histories, etc.  So where's the Felwithe Library, pray tell?? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I also like the idea of Qeynos becoming one zone, though preferably keeping its layout and flavor and *which-faction-controls-where* a little more closely than Freeport did.  Same for Neriak... that city always could give me the shivers, but it does get old having to zone twice before one can buy the Hate stones.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Something I think would be fun, though I acknowledge that others may well disagree (and such folks are free to disagree politely) would be to add castles to the towns that are supposed to have resident Royalty.  Include within each castle a guarded door that doesn't open (for players, maybe GM's could open it if there's an event where the royals appear).  Behind that door, said royal residents are in council and therefore unapproachable, but have the general castle grounds there so the faithful can visit and pay their respects. That would seem to be an ideal spot to station the city's tribute master, and task-givers, for example.  Perhaps the cultural forge and other cultural tradeskill supplies would be most at home there also?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I would imagine that original zones would mostly or totally be updated before they'd move on to the expansions, such as Kunark.  However, there is a point to the concept that the folks &amp;quot;rebuilding their empire&amp;quot; would probably be doing some rebuilding in their city also.  *nods*&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I don't mind the lime green so much myself, but what frustrates me is that I put labels on stuff and those get wiped.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Labels for where the forges and pottery wheels and ovens are.  Labels for where some favorite Quest NPC's are that I'd likely be taking younger characters to visit ere long.  Labels on various shops, including the bank.  Quicker and easier, for me, to look at the labels than use the Find function.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And the sewer map is incorrect in one exit label -- one goes to North Ro, not to East Freeport.  But my correction, for my own personal use, was wiped out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I like it that default maps exist, it saves one the trouble of having to make their own.  However, having edits erased is frustrating.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can we find a happy medium / compromise please?  :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
