    <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So, we've had quite the discussion about opening up forage to everyone; some people in favor, some opposed, and the community totally split.  However, we can always request that there be drops added to the loot tables, so people can get the items that way.  So, what I ask of you, is to provide me a list of foraged only items that you think should be a mob drop as well. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Please keep this thread on topic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, and only include the items (and possibly a short explanation.)  If you want to argue the forage point, please do so in the other thread.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;That being said, go to it:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;If the foraged item is no drop, a forage bot or asking for help from a forager is not possible anyway. Just because a quest is not completable by all, does not mean it is broken.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;I agree completely. I don't want the devs giving out forage ability willy nilly to every whiner that comes along complaining. There are reasons why each class/race combo has the abilities that they do, it is so everyone has some sort of value to the broader community. If we all could do everything equally well, then this would be a very boring game, indeed.</description>

&lt;P&gt;And just because we refuse to look at it objectively, does not mean that the skill (foraging) is not broken in terms of the overall game.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Doesn't mean it is either. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;But face it, unlike many many MANY other things, foraging has not been looked at since Kunark development.&amp;nbsp; That's a long time ago.&amp;nbsp; Let's see... in that time there have been new races and classes.&amp;nbsp; In that time melees have gotten disciplines and casters gotten spells every level.&amp;nbsp; Changes have been made to just about every aspect of the game.&amp;nbsp; Except foraging.&amp;nbsp; (And no, autoinventory is not a foraging only ability)&lt;/P&gt;</description>

The following would occur:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I go to Lake Rathetear and forage 100 times and get 5 ratheberries.&lt;br&gt;Every person that didn't have forage before but has since skilled up to 50 goes to Lake Rathetear and forages 1,000,000 times each and all of them together will have foraged exactly ZERO ratheberries.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Foraging has been looked at and has been changed because foraging is no longer tiered. Someone with a forage skill of 50 can get the rare forages (just a whole lot less than I can). Before the change the so-called rare forages were literally impossible to forage without a skill level above 100.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by gcubed on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;07-04-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;12:51 PM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Are you saying they should be allowed to forage simply because they&#xD;
want to do things for themselves? Does this mean I should be able to&#xD;
enchant silver bars because I want to get to 300 in jewelcrafting&#xD;
myself without the aid of others? Enchanted silver would not be game or&#xD;
class breaking, after all the enchanters do have other functions&#xD;
besides enchanting metal and probably would be quite happy if I quit&#xD;
running up to them asking them to enchant 100 stacks of silver for me.&#xD;
How about I be given the ability to embue emeralds because I want to&#xD;
get smithing to 300 and want to do it myself. Again druids have other&#xD;
functions besides embuing rocks so it wouldn't be class breaking. Since&#xD;
I am a Tunare worshipper it wouldn't be game breaking. I could even&#xD;
come up with a lame lore reason for me embuing emeralds. Not only am I&#xD;
a Tunare worshipper but I am a ranger making me partially a druid. I grew up with&#xD;
druids in Surefall Glade. The Druid GM's like me just as much as the&#xD;
Ranger GM's, why wouldn't they teach a few select high level rangers to&#xD;
embue emeralds?&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
I have read one person advocating gutting forage. Only food and drink&#xD;
could be foraged. Anything with a tradeskill tag would be removed from&#xD;
the forage table. Anything of any value would be removed from the&#xD;
forage table. The person that advocated this evidently is just mean&#xD;
spirited or is clueless as to what is on the forage tables. (Hint:&#xD;
Almost 100% of the food and drink items on the forage tables have a&#xD;
tradeskill tags.)&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
There has been arguements that granting forage to everyone (even with a&#xD;
skill limit of 50) would just make things convenient. Why not just&#xD;
advocate putting Tradeskill vendors in the PoK with all the tradeskill&#xD;
items on them.&amp;nbsp; Oh.. wait... we had that for a while. Oddly it was the&#xD;
tradeskillers themselves that made a stink about it. The final results&#xD;
of that little unintended experiment were, shall we say, less than&#xD;
desireable.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
There have been arguements based on lore for extending forage to&#xD;
everyone. Most of these arguements are based on a mixture EQ lore and&#xD;
outside lore. I am sorry but if you wish to use lore as an argument you&#xD;
have to base it on EQ lore alone. What happens in middle-earth, what&#xD;
the pioneers did in their movement west in the new world, etc. has no&#xD;
relationship to EverQuest. Nowhere in EQ lore does it state that even a&#xD;
single DE enchanter (or any other race/class combination that didn't&#xD;
have forage), even an extraordinary one, ever foraged anything.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
I have seen attempts at logic used to explain why foraging should be&#xD;
extended to everyone. This simplest of these is basically anyone can be&#xD;
taught to forage in the real world (we will ignore this attempt to mix&#xD;
real world with EverQuest) even those of limited intelligence.&#xD;
Logically any player race or class that is capable of learning (and&#xD;
they all are) should be able to forage because it is, after all, a&#xD;
learned skill. Well let see. We have a world that really doesn't exist&#xD;
except in the imagination of the players. That world has an entire&#xD;
pantheon of dieties that on whim interfere with the mortal world. We&#xD;
have mortals that can kill those dieties and in many cases with ease.&#xD;
We have magic that can both work with and bend the laws of nature. The&#xD;
player races have no children, the gnolls and orcs should have taken&#xD;
over long ago. When you die, it isn't over. Yep, it is easy to see that&#xD;
Logic is the dominant force in EverQuest.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
So far the best arguement for extending foraging to everyone is quest&#xD;
related. The problem is the solution of extending foraging is entirely&#xD;
bass ackwards. Foraging doesn't need fixing, the quests need fixing.&#xD;
Change the quests so they don't require foraging (the race/class&#xD;
non-specific quests).&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Well, like with Vegeta-X we will just have to disagree what we see as the fundamental points of the argument.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;But once again:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;No, I am not in favor of all classes being the same.&amp;nbsp; However, with the blurring of races and classes that can forage, I don't feel the differences are as definitive as you apparently believe them to be.&amp;nbsp; If it was ONLY iksars for example, or ONLY rangers and druids, I would see the point more clearly.&amp;nbsp; But with all&amp;nbsp;Druids, all Rangers, all Bards, all Wood Elves and all Iksars I simply don't see it as an especially class defining ability, I do see it more in line with swimming.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I've always said that I can accept forage staying the way it is.&amp;nbsp; I still believe that with the greater number of races and classes that are now in the game, it should be looked at, for example perhaps beastlords should have forage.&amp;nbsp; Maybe it has been looked at, maybe it hasn't.&amp;nbsp; At this point we don't know.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;My prefered solution is that the sloppy itemization and coding should be fixed.&amp;nbsp; That would include quests with no drop foraged components have the results correctly tagged.&amp;nbsp; As I've used before, if the final product is tagged Cleric, Druid, Shaman wearable then a cleric should be able to get the result and there are no clerics, zip, nada, none that can forage.&amp;nbsp; Same thing goes for other items, while I guess it is harmless, why should a warrior have a warrior only weapon that includes mana?&amp;nbsp; Answer is it is easier to copy something and give it a new name than it is to copy it, give it a new name, and take the mana off.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;To go through all the thousands of items and quests and all that to fix the sloppy stuff would take considerable time away from doing other, yes, more important&amp;nbsp;things.&amp;nbsp; To give everybody forage (which I usually preface with "even if") is probably easier and faster than fixing stuff.&amp;nbsp; While I don't believe that a sloppy solution is the best recourse for a sloppy problem, it is an option.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;When I do talk about "even if everyone had forage" I am talking about a 50 skill, and it would preferably be a skill that had to be trained up 50 and not just set at 50 (although for programming sake, whatever's easier...).&amp;nbsp; Maybe to even things out, wood elves and iksars would be able to skill up/train to 100 or 75 or something.&amp;nbsp; Druids and Rangers would still have the clear advantage, that lorewise they do have superior abilities in this area would not be changed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The reality is, most people are not going to do much with a 50 skill.&amp;nbsp; Most people probably won't bother with it any more than they do their swimming skill.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It provides a sloppy fix to a sloppy problem and does not take away anything from anyone.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

Back in the beginning it was discovered that the wolf illusion made everything indifferent even things that were by race or religion hostile. That is to say a ranger or druid that had a wolf form spell could move through a zone (say for example Neriak) without any agro while under this illusion. The sloppy&amp;nbsp; solution was to make the wolf illusion KoS to EVERYTHING. This was hard coded into the illusion. So in todays game I have an AA ability that increases my attack speed, my attack rating, a run speed modifier and health regen. The problem is that it also has a wolf illusion component. If I use it I will agro any nearby friendly MObs. Rangers are not alone with this problem Druids also have abilities tied to the wolf illusion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now you are suggesting that SOE take the easy way out again with one of our abilities and create a sloppy solution. Pardon me for not being totally impressed with the idea.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

For the most part the animals don't care one way or the other about wolfform. Additionally with the brownies you get a positive faction hit. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you believe the Enchanters had as big of a negative impact (remember we are talking about a hard coded change that was applied to wolfform only), I suggest a simple experiment. Take a Druid friend, an Enchanter friend and a Beastlord friend from each race to Jazzy's tent in Undershore. Have the enchanter cycle you through every illusion they have (not even the werewolf illusion will provoke a response). Then have each Beastlord use their AA ablility to change form into their warder. Finally have the Druid cast wolfform on you. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Honestly I can see it that if they give everyone the ability to have&#xD;
forage at skill level 50,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; that they re-address the&#xD;
'trivial' values of forages.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; So basically all this fighting&#xD;
will end up being for the ability to get fruit, veggies, berries,&#xD;
roots, rabbit meat, fishing grubs and pods of water.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
Personally I have a ranger on a different computer that I can forage&#xD;
with constantly while i'm playing.&amp;nbsp; I am not 'overly' opposed to&#xD;
giving all classes the option to gain basic foraging,&amp;nbsp; but when&#xD;
they gave the limited skill to wood elves and iksar,&amp;nbsp; that was&#xD;
more for a roleplay reasoning.&amp;nbsp; That could be argued to be part of&#xD;
their culture that they are raised with.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Many other races&#xD;
you would have a hard time arguing the case for that.&amp;nbsp; Not saying&#xD;
you can't come up with some RP reasoning ( as i'm sure people will do&#xD;
just to 'prove me wrong' ) &lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
I am open to adding quest / TS items to drop lists though even at a good drop rate ( something like nodding blue lilly in OS )&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

      <description>ok I will make a deal.. everyone can have a Forage skill of 50 and as compensation there should be the following added to the game&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) pottery made throwing potions that slow mobs attack speed 25 percent&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) Rez stones added to guild lobby that give a 25 &lt;font size="1"&gt;(at level 6)&lt;/font&gt; ~60 &lt;font size="1"&gt;(at level 70)&lt;/font&gt; percent rez based on level to all corpses you have in the guild lobby.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3) items/augs that grant temporary skills with a skill of 50 (backstab, picklocking, feign death) probably restricted to levels 65+&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;All items that are foragable should drop from all MoB in the same area as an uncommon&amp;nbsp;event.&amp;nbsp; Lack of the drop has reduced enjoyment of the game for a number of folks who don't&amp;nbsp; want to play their own forager and lack the RL people skills to be willing to approach other players for help.&amp;nbsp; Neither my druid nor my iksar necro will be diminished by that change.&amp;nbsp; I'd see difficulties only if the foragable items became common drops but not otherwise.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;With 2 druids i have no need of forage mob dropping, but&amp;nbsp;I do believe, that all forage should&amp;nbsp;mob drop somewhere at a rate equal to its forage rate, so that no tradeskiller is crippled by the lack of an item.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;We foragers get it free, isnt that enough to satisfy ?&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;What you really need to be complaining about is not your lack of forage ability but the lack of an alternative levelling up path that doesn't involve rare forages. Maybe that is what you should be asking Ngreth to add because it allows you to get what you really want, which is the ability to increase your skill more readily, without trivializing someone elses abilities.</description>
