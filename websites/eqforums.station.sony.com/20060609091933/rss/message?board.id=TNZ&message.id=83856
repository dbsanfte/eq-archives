&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Faction FAQ 4.5&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#006600&gt;*****************************************&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What is faction?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In essence, faction is how much a specific group (faction) likes or dislikes you based on your Race/Class/Religion and what actions you have accomplished.&lt;BR&gt;Every NPC/Monster has some sort of faction some can not be changed (Centaurs in South Karana), some are all by themselves (Lady Shae on FelGuard faction in Freeport Inn), and still others are part of a group of factions (Iksar Monks are on the Swifttail Faction).&lt;BR&gt;Every player is considered to be on the faction of their guild (make an Iksar Monk you are a Swifttail), but Players are always indifferent to other Players. Faction is only relevant to NPC’s.&lt;BR&gt;Every NPC will view you favorably, angrily, or all points in between depending upon where you stand in regard to their faction. Example: Iksars are automatically hated by all the races, but are tolerated by some of the more shady/evil religions/classes. A Paladin of Freeport may be loved by the citizens of Freeport, yet hated by the Shadow Knights of Freeport.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#006600&gt;*****************************************&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Why do I need to be concerned with faction?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;1st -- The obvious answer is – if your faction is bad enough, NPCs will attack you on site. Really annoying if you are at a merchant selling and a wandering guard is KOS (Kill on Sight) to you and whacks you dead, before you even realize you are being attacked.&lt;BR&gt;2nd -- If you want to buy/sell with merchants, you will have to raise your faction if you are dubious, since merchants will not buy and sell unless you are viewed Apprehensive or better. (NOTE: Sneak Skill makes you automatically Indifferent to a merchant when you are behind them).&lt;BR&gt;3rd – Better faction will make for better prices when buying/selling from a merchant (but Charisma has a greater affect in this area).&lt;BR&gt;4th – Many quests require you to be at a certain faction before you can do these Quests. (My Iksar Monk had to kill enough Orcs in Commonlands to go from “Ready to attack” to “Amiable” before I could do the Human Monk Belt Quests and I had to get to Indifferent before they would even train me).&lt;BR&gt;5th – Having many places where you can bank is a good thing, but being able to reach the bank may require you to cross the path of many other factions.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#006600&gt;*****************************************&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What are the Faction standings?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Ally = +4 1450 to 2500&lt;BR&gt;Warmly = +3 1100 to 1450&lt;BR&gt;Kindly = +2 750 to 1100&lt;BR&gt;Amiable = +1 150 to 750&lt;BR&gt;Indifferent = 0 0 to 150&lt;BR&gt;Apprehensive = -1 0 to -150&lt;BR&gt;Dubious = -2 -150 to -750&lt;BR&gt;Threateningly = -3 -750 to -1100&lt;BR&gt;Ready to Attack = -4 -1100 to -2500 &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Easily put your standings from the point of Indifference are explained above: &lt;BR&gt;Each faction step up to a specific faction equals a 1 grade increase to how NPCs on that faction view you. The same works for losing faction standing with a group. The last column of numbers are roughly the amount of faction hits it takes to go up or down a level. These numbers are based on “Old parsing data” and have been subject to disagreement. Use them as a guide and not the end all be all.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#006600&gt;*****************************************&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;EM&gt;NOTE:&lt;/EM&gt; Creatures that con Threateningly or Ready to Attack – may attack you if you get too close to them (or within their agro range) and Merchants who are Dubious to you will not sell to you. &#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Also At both Ally and Ready to Attack you can continue taking faction hits to a point (roughly that point at 2500 faction hits from 0) until it reaches the point “where you faction can no longer get any better/worse. If you reach this point you are max/lowest faction standing with that group, but you still remain Ally/Ready to Attack. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#006600&gt;*****************************************&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Is there a point to continue to raising my faction when I hit the low tier of Ally to max Ally?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;With certain quests you have to be at the higher end of a faction level, before you will be offered it. When I first reached Amiable with the human monks they wouldn’t offer me the human monk belt quest. I killed many more orcs, went back and was still Amiable yet now they offered me the quests for the belt. I needed to be High Amiable to be offered the quest, which lends itself to the theory that quests require the Player to have reached a specific point value in the faction standing. So then +200 Amiable on the above faction list is different than +500 Amiable.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#006600&gt;*****************************************&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;How can I raise/lower my faction rating with a group?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Generally, killing NPCs or completing quests will raise/lower factions, but you must always be aware that similar creatures may offer different faction adjustments depending upon what zone you are in. &#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Example 1:&lt;/EM&gt; Killing an Orc in East Commonlands will lower your faction with the Deathfist Orcs (Those orcs in and around the Commonlands) But raise your faction with the Warriors of Rivervale, the Paladins of Freeport, the Monks of Freeport, and the Citizens of the Commonlands. Killing the Orcs in Crushbone, will alter your faction with a variety of Elf factions in the Faydark zones. Also killing the orcs in HighPassHold will alter factions related to that zone. Not all orcs are allied to or against the same set of factions. &#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Also, two NPCs have the name Opal Darkbriar: Head of the Casters Guild in W Freeport and Head of the Evil Clerics in E Freeport. Yet the faction of Opal Darkbriar refers only to the Evil Cleric (The caster being on Arcane Scientist faction).&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Example 2:&lt;/EM&gt; If I turn in (for Quest) an Orc Scalp (off a Shralok Orc or Crushbone Orc) to Captain Ashlan in HighPassHold I will get Faction Increases with 5 Various factions (Guards and Merchants of HPH, Freeport Militia, CorruptQeynosGuards, and the Head of HighHoldKeep) with no faction decreases. &#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Depending upon what the quest does, or for which group the quest is for, may determine which factions are raised or lowered. Do a quest for one group that is hated by another group and your faction standing may go up for the quest giver and down for the opposing faction. Same for killing creatures: The Deathfist orcs give good factions with those groups that are in direct contention with it (monks, paladins, citizens and Halfling Warriors). &#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Be aware that some factions can not be raised once lowered. Kill a fairy in Faydark and you will begin to ruin your faction for all of those fairies with no known way to raise it back up.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#006600&gt;*****************************************&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;How do I know point wise where I am on the faction table?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;There really isn’t any guaranteed way to know, but if you do a quest or kill a mob to the point that your faction changes, you can be pretty sure you are at the lowest tier of that faction. &#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The only you can find you standing is to “con” a creature. From a distance, target an NPC and hit the ‘c’ key on your keyboard. This will return a message in a color. The color refers to the relative danger/level of the mob in order of difficulty: Red (most deadly), Yellow, White (even to your level, but generally too dangerous to solo), Dark Blue, Light Blue (easy, and will still give experience), Green (easiest and will not give experience). The message will mention the faction standing (Ally, Indifferent, Ready to Attack, etc…)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#006600&gt;*****************************************&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Note:&lt;/EM&gt; not all quests or mobs give the same faction change. &lt;BR&gt;Killing a Kobold in the Warrens gives you about a 1 point towards raising your factions with the guards of Erud. Killing a named Kobold (Cook, Prince, King) gives you about a 5 point increase with Guards of Erud. Killing the Heretic Elial Brooks in Toxxulia Forest gives you about a 20 point faction increase with the Casters of Erud; however, killing the Heretic Elial Brooks lowers your faction with the Heretics by about 25 points. Heretic faction can be fixed by slaughtering many Kobolds, but it drops faster than the caster faction raises. Generally bad faction changes are larger than good faction changes. &#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Also, the Inert Potion Quest in Erud Palace raises five hard to raise factions, but not equally. So when questing or killing and many different factions raise/lower –they may not raise all the same rate and generally will lower factions faster than raising them.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#006600&gt;*****************************************&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Are there faction caps?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Yes, depending upon your Race/Class/Religion will depend upon how high you can go with other factions. My Iksar Monk (Evil Race/neutral class/evil religion) with most “Good” factions can get up to Kindly and then get no better, with most “Evil” group I can get up to Warmly before I can get no better, and with many “neutral” groups I can get up to ally. There are exceptions, but too many to be concerned with here. &#xD;
&lt;P&gt;There is also a sort of faction cap going the other way with all groups on a “Merchant” faction. (Remember, not all folks who sell items are on a “Merchant” faction). The faction will cap at “Dubious”, but the point standing will continue to drop until you hit the negative 2500 point value. &#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Example:&lt;/EM&gt; My Iksar Monk cons “Ready to Attack” to the banker of Kelethin, but dubious to the Merchants. They are both on the same faction. I raise my Merchant faction enough points and find that I am now Dubious to the Banker yet I am still Dubious to the Merchants. That is because of the downside cap to merchant faction.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#006600&gt;*****************************************&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;Okay – you want to know what quests are available or creatures to kill to get in good with specific factions, or just want to know what factions are in which area. There are many online guides and sites that offer tips, but in reality only one site is needed to garner about all the info you want. (Check Illia’s Bestiary for faction info)&lt;BR&gt;http://everquest.allakhazam.com/&lt;BR&gt;And if they don’t have the answer you want, they will have a link to a site that does. &#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I also offer a guide that explains how I got my Iksar Monk to max faction with nearly every group in every “Good” City in the old world. I can bank in every “Good” City except for Halas and Kaladim, but I do explain how you can get in good with the Kaladim Banker. &#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The guide is &lt;STRONG&gt;5+ pages in Microsoft Word &lt;/STRONG&gt;(which is why I do not post the guide) but send me an e-mail at: &#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;fangsmiley@adelphia.net &lt;/STRONG&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;asking for the guide and I will be glad to e-mail it out to you. &#xD;
&lt;P&gt;And of course – if you ever have a question just ask. If I do not know the answer, someone else on this board will. &#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Good Luck&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>Ready to Attack = -4 -1100 to -2500 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This actually goes MUCH lower than neg 2500.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;AS all players start with the capability to RAISE or LOWER their faction 2000 from where they started allowing for a total 4000 faction range for any player.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My case is one that I verified vs Iksar necro /shaman faction.  Serano is factioned up all the way possible on bone chips AND by killing over 2k Iksar outcasts thus maxing Iksar necro faction (brood something)  Yet I still con Scowls Ready to attack to both factioned mobs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thus my BASE start point for those factions must have been at least at neg 3101 if this neg 1100 is the accurate STOP point for being Scowls.  I don't know if there is any faction lower than neg 3101 - but if the start of the scowls faction is accurate - than faction can start as low as neg 3101.</description>

      <description>Scowls -2100 to -801&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh - I didn't see this one at first.  If - that is accurate instead of Skrax's number than that would make the lowest VERIFIED starting faction at neg 2801 so far as my woof elf vs iksar necro faction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This would also seem to indicate that I could drop from my baseline of neg 2801 all the way down to neg 4801 if I was to kill a lot of iksar on necro faction.</description>

&lt;P&gt;Again, those numbers were from old (3+ years) parsing logs and are rough estimates that have been debated even then.&amp;nbsp; They are meant as only a sort of guide to give you an idea where you stand.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I will be the first to say they are not exact, but they are close enough for you to guage where you stand and to also re-iterate that while you can con the same message (dubious for example) you can be worlds apart where you stand on a mobs "dubious" list.&amp;nbsp; While you won't get a merchant to sell to you at any "dubious" point, you may get a quest giver to acknowledge you if you are High dubious as opposed to low dubious.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Now, if Sony could just input a way for you to open up a window and check what your faction is with the races out there in number form.&amp;nbsp; Right now, it's just guess work on where your faction is until it switches to the next one.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;EQOA shows your faction change in points every time you kill something or finish a quest.&amp;nbsp; It even tells what your current, numeric faction is in () after it changes.&amp;nbsp; Very helpful.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;It would be nice if EQ did the same thing.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;I turned in probably ten-thousands of muffins in the Freeport muffin quest with several different characters a few years ago to make my own faction list. Mine look alot like Skrax list but with some differences.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;I assume turning in 1 muffin (store-bought) would be the smallest faction adjustment in game. Here is the lenght of each faction from entering it to leave it:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;(Sorry about the tripple post :( Don't know what happened.)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;I turned in probably ten-thousands of muffins in the Freeport muffin quest with several different characters a few years ago to make my own faction list.

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;ally:&amp;nbsp; %&lt;BR&gt;warmly: 350 &lt;BR&gt;kindly: 250&lt;BR&gt;amiably: 400&lt;BR&gt;indifferently: 100&lt;BR&gt;apprehensively: 100&lt;BR&gt;dubiously: 400&lt;BR&gt;threathningly:&amp;nbsp; 250&lt;BR&gt;ready to attack:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; %&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Ally and KoS has no fixed length. Max ally is 2000 hits above your starting faction depending on race/class/diety and max KoS is 2000 below starting faction.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;So max ally is much higher with for example your home town where you start amiably. Some factions where you start out KoS you can never get to ally because its outside 2000 hits. As a high-elf enchanter I have "could not possibly get better" with Legion of Cabilis but Im "only" warmly.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Since we have so many threads floated on this section of the boards I copied and pasted this great FAQ to the Game Guides section.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>More accurate numbers would be:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ally 1100 to 2100&lt;br&gt;Warmly 750 to 1099&lt;br&gt;Kindly 500 to 749&lt;br&gt;Amiable 100 to 499&lt;br&gt;Indifferent 0 to 99&lt;br&gt;Apprehensive -100 to -1&lt;br&gt;Dubious -500 to -101&lt;br&gt;Threatening -800 to -501&lt;br&gt;Scowls -2100 to -801&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There's a little uncertainty about the Warmly range due to changes in game about two years ago... some people think it starts at 800 or 850, and might go up to 1149.  Also max-ally is debated... it might be as high as 2300.  But all the numbers I've listed are absolutely correct from -500 to +500.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There's a whole chat forum full of old info and advice at EQDruids.  There is also a great deal of faction information in Illia's Bestiary at Allakhazam... notably a big post under the Venril Sathir faction.</description>

      <description>I find sylsyl's numbers accurate, except max faction is an even +2000 -- every faction I've measured (quite a few) has maxed at 2000 so I am sure of it. I would also bet that threatening starts at -750 and ready to attack starts at -2000 which would balance both sides of the faction scale evenly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mukkul&lt;br&gt;65 Iksar Shaman</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;Absolutely correct. My Enchanter can go from Scowling all the way to Dubious with a faction-modifier spell, and his best gives a +300 faction boost.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;Ya,&amp;nbsp; But that doesn't help the total newbs.&amp;nbsp; I had a question about faction and did a search and pulled this gem up.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I was thinking faction was important enough, and this post informative enough, that it deserved a special place.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>Agree with Inoseta, this should have a permanent, easy acess place for Newbies and veterans too. This was added to my notebook along time ago, still use it.&#xD;

      <description>*grin* You're totally right Inoseta :) It would be really good for the Guide section anyway, but then maybe even the entire document (which I got by e-mail from him)&#xD;

      <description>&lt;P&gt;Ya, the full document was really good.&amp;nbsp; Would be nice if he would give permission to append it.&amp;nbsp; That way if he won't get bombarded with emails every couple of days.&amp;nbsp; I assume there was a reason he wouldn't post the document on the boards and wanted to email it privatly.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
