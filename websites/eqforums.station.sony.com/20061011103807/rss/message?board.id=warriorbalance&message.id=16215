    <description>&lt;div&gt;Commanding Voice is a &amp;quot;shout&amp;quot; which is closer to a &amp;quot;skill&amp;quot; like Bazu or Cyclone than a &amp;quot;disc&amp;quot; like defensive.  A self-motivating &amp;quot;shout&amp;quot; would work for me.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Basically Cellan, what I had a problem with would be most akin to telling paladins they're all being nerfed to 4K HP at level 70.  Then giving them a new Yaulp with a 5 minute recast, 4 minute duration that provides the rest of their HP (ALL Pally +HP on gear turns into +Yaulp) but Yaulp also silences you now... that kind of thing.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The issues I have with Aura of Runes being used to &amp;quot;rebalance&amp;quot; warriors:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I feel Runes are magical, and just from a personal flavor standpoint I don't like it- though that's hardly something anyone else should pay much attention to.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Aura blocks other discs... I shouldn't have to take a step back- by dropping aura- to take a step forward- with defensive+potion if the only healer dies, or via Savage Onslaught for a runner/gater burndown...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If I do take that step down, I'm then locked out of being &amp;quot;Balanced&amp;quot; for whatever time I lost from Aura + the 1 minute additional reuse.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just out of curiosity, how would you like being 4K hp unless you cast that silencing megabuff Yaulp with a 4 minute duration, and 5 minute recast?  How would you like bein balanced 80% of the time, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;assuming&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; you can keep the Mega-Yaulp up?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;If each fight lasts ~40 seconds, mob Triples, hits 66% of the time, every 2 seconds, mob gets a hit once a second, so warrior negates 1 DI per second.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Paladin Heals&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Touch of Piety is 1714 pre-focus and pre AA... post focus average its 2050.  1 cast per 40 second fight alone is equal to a -1DI of about 51.  DB 1 DI 51=1021 max hits.   So any mob with a max hit of 1020 or less a pally tanks better than a warrior casting 1 heal per 40 second fight.  2 Heals raises the DI to 102(2041 Max hit)  My shaman twink can drop 2K mana pre-AA/Spec/Focus per fight and stay up in mana during most grind groups until bathroom breaks, respawn pauses, etc.  2 stuns- Ancient Force of Jeron,  Force of Piety, and 2 casts of Touch of Piety is 1302 mana pre-AA/Focus/Specialization.  2 Pained Memory, and half of Canni V will net my shaman back about 1253 mana per fight, but also require another 420 spent, so a net return of 833 for a net spent during a fight of about 1170.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shadowknight Taps&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ancient Bite of Muram Recourse-  +135 mana, Inruku's Bite recourse  +130 mana.  265 mana per fight cast, IF both are cast once per fight,  after 1.5 fights a cleric will have what ammounts to a mana free CH to cast.  , that means for 9600hp to even EQUAL -1DI, You're looking at a DI of 160 - (DB1 DI 160 max hit 3201)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So 2 Bite recourses to a cleric will flat out DESTROY -1DI in non-defensive content.... Requireing at minimum a mob with a DI of 160.  Two Paladin heals will negate -1DI  requiring a DI of 102 or better.  To be completely fair, a fight will be marginally shorter with a warrior tanking than a paladin tanking depending on how long it takes the DPS classes to ramp up with the initial snap agro availability, plus of course (for an SK) the bonus mana for a DD class being able to get another DD in (essentially mana free) every so often.  (Time/Damage varies on class, AA, and Focus)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What this basically means isn't that knights are broken, what it means is:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Paladins probably need a minor boost.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;-1DI hasn't scaled at all similar to the increase in spell efficiency&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This should probably be looked at.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Whatever solution is chosen should be a long term self scaling solution that isn't Expanion era or mob DPS dependant.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;-1DI is the part that's broken, not Paladin heals, or SK Taps.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sheesh, I'm a knight and I can see what Heimdall is saying. I agree with him, haveing one of his defensive type discaplines shouldn't negate his offensive ones. I must say though Heim that I have a 5 min offensive dicsapline and I can't use any other till it's done, includeing my mini vie thing. I think dicsaplines are something you have to maintain concentration on or something to keep it going and that's the reasn you can't use two at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spells on the other hand are fire and forget, once yuu spend the mana and cast the spell it does what it does cause it allready used the energy that drives it, so it lasts however long it lasts. Technically I think how dicsaplines work is that you are useing your endurance the entire time it's in use. I know the endurance all leaves soon as you click the dis, but in reality its a slow burn as you go through your dicsapline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I do think however that you should be able to use a agro dicsapline combined with an offensive and defensive if you should so choose, it's your endurance it's your choice how you spend it. I do understand not haveing two dicsaplines of the same type stack. I.E. two defensive types, since that would be a balance issue, like not haveing two types of vie stack on each other.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It isn't like these spells grown on trees, I haven't even otten the three newest ones yet cause it takes forever. You guys base everything on extreams.......... OH NO one of the top end sk's on the server soloed Vindie..........therefore all sk's can solo vindie.  Oh NO, a top end sk tanked such and so.........therefor all sk's can tank such and so....You know this is not true, yet you continue to harp about how pathetic warriors are against some of the best geared, highest aa'd sk's in the game. That's silly.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I'm pretty sure you tank as well if not better in RSS than I do heimdall. I know a warrior that can survive a 20k fall, I have grouped with him, he has no trouble agroing off me or keeping agro on one mob, or 4 mobs. I know I don't match up to him, no way in hell.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I think haveing that aura be available at that rate would be fair . I don't think it's fair it doesn't stack with other self buffs though, thats kinda defeating the purpose.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;increasing mitigation/avoidance isn't adding a downward scaling ability, rather the opposite.&amp;nbsp; Because mitigation/avoidance are based on mob DPS, it will be yet another upward scaling ability.&amp;nbsp; If looking for downward scaling, then "fixed value" abilities are what you should be looking for.&amp;nbsp; Aura of Runes and Mock are of that sort, not exactly working so well, but provide something to work with to adding this type of package to the class.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Who gives a **SMURF** about downward scaling right now?  In CURRENT CUTTING EDGE GROUP CONTENT warriors are being out tanked by knights.  We're not talking about going and farming a Fabled FBSS for some nitwit's twink with a pack of level 70's and the knight is untouched by spamming 3 stuns so the mobs never even move. We're talking about going to RSS, The Nest, 69.1, and so on and being out tanked.</description>

&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Ummm, Warriors are outtanking Knights in cutting edge content.&amp;nbsp; That is the benefit of scaling power that Warriors are designed around.&amp;nbsp; If you are a Warrior getting outtanked by a Knight in current cutting edge group content, then the Knight has you outclassed.&amp;nbsp; That is the benefit of gear and AAs.&amp;nbsp; So yes, an&amp;nbsp; Anguish Knight will outtank an EP Warrior in hard content for the most part, but when you put them in the same level of progression.... well..... NOT.</description>

&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;yoou mean the parses that showed well over a fiftten percent difference&amp;nbsp; between using the same weapon setups and a % difference btween a shadowknight using a shield and a warrior with a dps setting.&amp;nbsp; throw in the warrior spellbook and the balance right back to the warrior.. wait no it doesnt the balance never shifted to the knight in the first place. warriors can choose to equip a shield&amp;nbsp; and use that for mitigation. it is not the shadowknights fault you choose not to. Shield use for warriors should be for high dps groups where the extra mitigation they gain makes the group more efficeint&amp;nbsp; and for tough raid mobs as well as groupable named. and of course a beneficial rotation of all three warrior configurations during the course of a fight.(such as wehen a mob enrages or flurries). we all know&amp;nbsp; that warriors&amp;nbsp; can tank any groupable content fine&amp;nbsp; even with their highest damage intake configuration. currently the only problem with this is the major loss of aggro geenration warriors recieve when switching to the shield and an innate aggro modifer would more than address this issue. simple fix that doesnt upset the balance of the game and allow all three tanks to be viable for content. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Jesus, how long ago was that quote?  I think the coversation has changed four times since then.  I don't even remember what I was talking about at the time for hte most part.  Noone ever said it was the SK's fault we don't use shields.  Its Sony's fault.  We all know that.  According to Frodlin, the parses showed with just one spell knights were tanking single group level mobs better than a warrior.  Tossing warrior discs doesn't change the fact that the knight still has the rest of his spellbook in reserve as well.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Downward scaling is very important, as getting tools which are more upward scaling acheives nothing in group content, and further separates an already pretty high gap on raid content.   It's a mistake not to go the route of Aura of Runes.    The issue is.. you want something that will help in group content, which AoR would do if it were useful, yet be immaterial to raids, which AoR would be.    The two new Knight skills do not scale at all, they're more powerful the less damage a mob does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to change innate mitigation to match that, you can blow out of the water the tanking balance as NPC's hit harder.   &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;hr&gt;Frodlin wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Downward scaling is very important, as getting tools which are more upward scaling acheives nothing in group content, and further separates an already pretty high gap on raid content.   It's a mistake not to go the route of Aura of Runes.    The issue is.. you want something that will help in group content, which AoR would do if it were useful, yet be immaterial to raids, which AoR would be.    The two new Knight skills do not scale at all, they're more powerful the less damage a mob does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to change innate mitigation to match that, you can blow out of the water the tanking balance as NPC's hit harder.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;I agree with you here on points, but I think the &amp;quot;gap&amp;quot; generated by PoR spells is not nearly as significant as you are thinking it is. From what I understand about procs and procrate mods and how they work... Lucy has WoT and DS at a procratemod of 400, my understanding is that you will take the base proc rate (2ppm) and treat the mod as a percentage gain/loss. So in this case you have a base rate of 8 procs per minute. 4 procs in most single group fights of around 30 seconds (grind content). Conversely Mock will fire twice in the same fight, so Decrepit Skin is avoiding 1000 damage per fight will mock is avoiding 500. That's assuming though optimal conditions for Decrepit Skin that simply don't exist in group content. For one you have mobs that flee at 20% in most grind content, right there that means 20% of each fight I'm not getting hit and so Decrepid Skin has 0% chance of proccing 20% of the time. So that 1000ish per fight is really more like 800 per fight, or 300 more then Mock per fight, 600 more per minute or 10 DPS. That's not even figuring in for caster mobs who further aren't attacking each time they cast and thus not triggering procs, casters are fairly common in single group stuff and on average they cast alot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now 10dps is certainly a gap, but it's not an insurmountable gap. I am extremely opposed to the thought of revamping old warrior discs to close a gap formed specifically from PoR abilities, if the gap is not acceptable it needs to be addressed by mock and champion's aura. If AoR is not worth it then it needs to be balanced versus omens SK abilities, not PoR ones. As far as endurance versus mana (because I know you are going to bring this up) Mock is not an additive endurance expenditure, it's the exact same endurance as Bazu is and it's an alternative endurance expenditure. It's cost is not so much needed to be balanced up again Decrepit Skin, as it is needed to be balanced versus Bazu, because whether you are mocking or not you are spending the same 350 endurance every 30 seconds. Simply adding a 3rd hit to Mock's rune recourse would effectively remove any gap between the two abilities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

If mock were 1400 agro and 3 hits of 250rune then there would be little to no reason not to use it for grinds, as opposed to not using AoR2 because you need to conserve endurance for Bazu. Something that effects all warriors 1-70 all the time is never going to compete in a group setting to my abilities because it simply can't and stay within the realm of class balance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I don't want to be the Rune tank.  I don't want to click Aura of Runes every 5 minutes to get to where I'm supposed to be balance wise.  Warriors were supposed to, through pure fighting skill, be the best tank.  And Aura of Runes isn't fighting skill.  Besides which, if Endurance regeneration and Endurance usage was balanced around how often we use Bazu, and your Aura of Runes basically taking every point of Endurance we regen between recasts, that throws the endurance balance which already sucks off kilter.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Lets get back on track... before we look for downward scaling tools, lets fix current cutting edge group mitigation for warriors vs knights.&lt;/div&gt;</description>
