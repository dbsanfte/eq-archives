      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3" color="#ffffff" face="Times New Roman"&gt;1. Continue to work on decreasing the ease of hacking in the game, recent changes have made ghosting (modem plugging) much more difficult but the use of third party programs is still rampant. It is also suggested that the disciplinary actions taken be increased in general.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3" color="#ffffff" face="Times New Roman"&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3" color="#ffffff" face="Times New Roman"&gt;2. Rebalance the resist system for spells (particularly those from the OOW expansion and beyond). The last PvP overhaul balanced resists around the Gates of Discord expansion. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3" color="#ffffff" face="Times New Roman"&gt;Since then, through the avilability of resist augments and far superior gear in general, the significantly higher resists do not reflect the PvP resists on spells, which have not scaled as such.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;A.) Currently all spells supposedly have a 5% chance to land on any cast (although this is debatable), many players would like to see this increased to at least 10% if not higher.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;B.) Add a PvP resist check to the bard song &amp;quot;Ervaj's Lost Composition&amp;quot; or allow its effects to be significantly mitigated, either innately or by resists&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;C.) Increase the rate at which Enchanter, Magician and to some extent Wizard nukes land&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;D.) Increase the rate at which Shadow Knight lifetaps land or give the healing component a chance to land regardless of the damage&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;E.) Change the resist rates of ALL spells below level 50. Currently the Necromancer lifetap line has a -200 check even at level 26 which can make it incredibly unbalanced.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;F.) Adjust the resist check on Paladin stun spells so that they actually land an appreciable amount of time, currently, Paladins are very difficult to kill, but without extremely good gear their damage output is rather low.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3" color="#ffffff" face="Times New Roman"&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;3. Completely implement the PvP point system or remove it entirely. The point system as it is currently implemented does not reflect the system that was tested during the PvP beta. &lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;A.) In a great many cases, players have stated that they lose far more points from &lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3" color="#ffffff" face="Times New Roman"&gt;a single PvP death than any number of kills gets them.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;B.) The gear that is available on the PvP merchant is dismal at best when put in comparison to far more easily obtainable modern gear. Many players would like to see gear that is of Time quality or early to mid GoD quality on the merchant seeing as comparable gear can easily be obtained with one group or solo.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;C.) Remove or expand the leader board. Currently the leader board only reflects those classes that get PvP kills often, currently the top 20 players include: rangers, rogues, wizards, monks, necromancers and berserkers. It would be much more accommodating if a separate leader board for every class was introduced as well.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3" color="#ffffff" face="Times New Roman"&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3" color="#ffffff" face="Times New Roman"&gt;4. Balance melee PvP damage against caster PvP damage. Due to the way PvE has scaled, melee characters in general sport much higher HP than casters while putting out more damage as well. Currently, a well geared melee can easily dispatch almost any caster, even equally geared.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;A.) Restore the AC used in calculations to 100% (from 80%) for casters only&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;B.) Remove the 66% damage cap that is applied to all direct damage spells. Melees do not suffer the same penalties in respect to their combat even though they can deal equally if not more damage than any caster.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3" color="#ffffff" face="Times New Roman"&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3" color="#ffffff" face="Times New Roman"&gt;5. Currently rangers are able to shoot at a target with little to no line of sight, sometimes through terrain. This combined with the fact that they can shoot while moving, can give them an unfair advantage particularly against caster classes. Either revert the archery damage back to how it was before the last PvP overhaul or give rangers a penalty to hit moving targets or while moving themselves.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3" color="#ffffff" face="Times New Roman"&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3" color="#ffffff" face="Times New Roman"&gt;6. Some changes need to be made to specific weapon procs.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;A.) All DoN era proc augments currently lack PvP resist checks, their PvE resists are just fine but they almost never ever land in a PvP situation&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;B.) The weapon proc “One Hundred Blows” and monk epic effect “Peace of the Disciple” are currently unresistable in PvP, most players feel that they are extremely overpowered, combined or alone, they allow a monk to chain stun a player until they are dead&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;i.) Give the procs resist checks between -100 and 150 to magic or prismatic (average resist?)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;ii.) Remove the procs entirely from PvP just like charm and fear spells&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3" color="#ffffff" face="Times New Roman"&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3" color="#ffffff" face="Times New Roman"&gt;7. Add a required level to some items that currently do not have one. Players who are new to the Zek server often have trouble dealing with other &amp;quot;deleveled&amp;quot; players who are using very stat heavy gear. Most of the time, these players do not even have the damage output to break their opponents regeneration. Many players (both long time and new) have suggested that the following changes be made to the Zek server only.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;A.) All epic 1.0 weapons should be given a required level of 46 or 50. After all, no one has any business running around with them pre 50 anyway.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;B.) Add a &amp;quot;recommended&amp;quot; level of 30-35 to the &amp;quot;Fungus Covered Scale Tunic&amp;quot;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;C.) much of the armor gear from Velious and Luclin also lack level requirements even though their complimentary weapons all have requirements on them&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3" color="#ffffff" face="Times New Roman"&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3" color="#ffffff" face="Times New Roman"&gt;8. Increase the level range on the Zek server. Many players would like to see the level range of PvP increased from +/- 4 to +/- 6 or 8.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3" color="#ffffff" face="Times New Roman"&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3" color="#ffffff" face="Times New Roman"&gt;9. Remove the &amp;quot;heal&amp;quot; potions from the Zek server. Many players have argued that these lend an unfair advantage to players during PvP encounters and seriously hinder the ability of some classes to succeed PvP (particularly those who do not have the ability to snare or dispel without significant difficulty).&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3" color="#ffffff" face="Times New Roman"&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3" color="#ffffff" face="Times New Roman"&gt;10. Place the Zek server in a location in which it can more easily be seen at the server selection screen like it was before.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3" color="#ffffff" face="Times New Roman"&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3" color="#ffffff" face="Times New Roman"&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3" color="#ffffff" face="Times New Roman"&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3" color="#ffffff" face="Times New Roman"&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3" color="#ffffff" face="Times New Roman"&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3" color="#ffffff" face="Times New Roman"&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3" color="#ffffff" face="Times New Roman"&gt;I just threw 10 in there in liu of being able to think of anything else. I honestly dont have a heck of a lot of feedback at the moment so tell me what you think.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3" color="#ffffff" face="Times New Roman"&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My problem with PvP.</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=PVP&amp;message.id=11633#M11633</link>
      <description>OK, before everyone starts in on me, I will admit, I have never played on any zek servers.  My problem is with the Arena areas.  The main Arena itself, easy to get to, in a neutral area so toons of certain factions won't get KoS along the way as small arenas in  the cities, but it's biggest problem (at least on the tribunal server, which I frequent) is the fact that uber-twinked 70's like to camp there and if anyone a little bit less powerful comes in, even if they don't engage these people, all of a sudden, boom, boom, boom, dead.  How much fun is that, honestly?  I like to get together with my guildmates and friends, and go in and maybe do a 3 on 3 or something, and not neessarily to the death.  I agree that it should either be made an instanced zone, or make it so that you can only target toons within a 5 level difference from you either way, or even maybe putting an arena inside of the guild halls for friendly combat.  It's pummeling like this that made me quit playing other games because I would start up with a new or semi-new character and try to play, then boom!  Whomped from behind, no warning, just dead.  I don't actually see what satisfaction a 70th level toon gets from slaughtering a 50 something....it's pathetic, really.  Well, there's my 2 cents for the day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>pvp on all servers</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=PVP&amp;message.id=11627#M11627</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We all know WoW has a ton of business, for one reason only I think, the PvP. Bringing a pvp system to EQ other than just some server like Zek would bring back a ton of more people. Sure I guess not make every zone pvp or whatever, all you need is one. Sure you'd say the Arena but come on either no one is ever there, because there's nothing to do, or people just run out if they about to die. Adding a zone like Battle Grounds on WoW would be sweet, a game and a pvp action. And if its possible to some how link the instances server-wide. I dont know, just my 2cp&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>What's a good PVP level?</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=PVP&amp;message.id=11620#M11620</link>
      <description>Hey guys&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;:smileyhappy:&lt;/span&gt; I played EQ for a long time (old school RZ FTW) but quit about two years ago after I realized how messed up high-lvl pvp became (Spells dont land, melees kill casters in 5 hits, ect ect) and how casual players cannot hope to compete with 24/7 raid guilds in PVP. After experimenting with some other games, I still havent found the kind of PVP that old school rallos zek had to offer, like around the velious days/early POP days. Now, I know high lvl pvp is wacky, but i was wondering if there was a decent level pre-60 that offers some decent pvp? I still have my main char and a ton of cash so I would be able to fairly twink out a lower level. What do you guys think?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=PVP&amp;message.id=11583#M11583</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;I came back from 4 years and missed 7 expensions. 4 years ago i remember every zone i went to there are at least 20 players in each zone. But now where ever i go there is usually 1 player on the list with my name on it. I am now lvl 30 and same thing still happening. It is very boring to lvl in every zone just myself alone. So i would like to know where do all the ppl gather that hunts except bazaar and plan of knowledge?&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Unlike the other thread, this one is for more &amp;quot;indeapth&amp;quot; changes, things that may or may not be possible without extensive code changes. I dont want to hear whines about certain classes being stupidly overpowered here, that's for the other thread. I want to gather input about balancing PvP in respect to one versus one, group on group and raid on raid, as well as input about rules and level ranges. I want data and input, not whines and moans.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;EDIT for clarification: Think of this as a discussion over wants and wishes, while the other thread is for immediate needs.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Pinhedd_SZ on &lt;span class="date_text"&gt;01-27-2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;07:50 PM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantitative PvP changes discussion</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=PVP&amp;message.id=11575#M11575</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I'd like to gather some ideas on quantitative changes that could be made to PvP in general. These are things that should be simple, such as &amp;quot;change the base resist on spell X from Y to Z&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;raise the cap on A from B to C&amp;quot;. This is NOT a discussion about who owns who, or which class is the most overpowered, or what needs to be nerfed first, I just want to collect some easy balancing ideas after that point I will find a happy medium and see what comes out.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;EDIT for clarification: think of this as a thread for needed changes that can easily be done, put wants and wishes in the other thread.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Pinhedd_SZ on &lt;span class="date_text"&gt;01-27-2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;07:51 PM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=PVP&amp;message.id=11546#M11546</link>
      <description>Eq2 is releasing 2 US pvp servers, if you want pvp, this is where it's going to be SUPPORTED and Balenced as well as continiously developed. Leave everquest 1, because SoE is just going to dump it soon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why you ask? Because they just revamped the whole everquest 2 class system. You can now pick your class when you create your charecter, also it's alot more funner, easier tradeskills, and easier leveling. Great new system, feels like old eq 1.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Try it out for yourself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;is the single most unbelievable thing on this forum.   it gets updated once a month yet i see all the things are usually the same its like paste and copy the list and that will make it ok cause at least we posted it for that month.   some actions done to these things would be great.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;5)&lt;span&gt;       &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Make “Touch of Innoruuk” and all Shadow Knight Life Taps land more frequently.  Also make the spell Blood of Inruku land more frequently in pvp and perhaps an adjustment to the spell Dread Gaze.  Currently if cast it will aggro any pets etc at the raid.  Would it be possible to make it so that it doesn't affect members of a raid's pets? &lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;this has been on the issues list since 9.24.04  that is 1 year and 4months and in that time it says the exact same thing.   things have been adjusted in pvp like rangers, druids getting new snares, wizards getting new aa as well as mages to help in pvp and in this time you cant fix a simple thing like adding a pvp resist check that isnt 0 to our lifetaps.   Its beyond comphrendable.   Our life tap does 66 percent of max dmg in pvp that is about say 400-500 pts dmg.   now when its resisted 1 outta 4 times, and partially resisted 2 outta those 4 it makes it really darn hard to do anything in pvp, add to this our other spells like spears get resisted about everytime, and our dots even with dot focus's maxed does about 500dmg max a tick if that and this is if the spell lands but they can also be easily dispelled by anyone.    Now when a wizard can click an aa and then click another aa then nuke for crits of 2k + over and over how the heck is an sk supposed to survive.   I know the big arguement of we get ht will be brought up, and i think that is pure bullpoop.    play an sk sometime and see if you can get someone down to 40 percent.    I know we shouldnt just be able to run around killing people at will but at least give us a chance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Bring back, Discord (PVP) Server</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=PVP&amp;message.id=11529#M11529</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;A new server is needed for pvp, but do you remember the Discord server? It was out for about 6 weeks before the discord expansion.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Everyone could attack everyone, no limits&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If you died for any reason: pk, drowned, fall off a cliff, you go back to level 1&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;triple experience all the time&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If a player killed you, they could loot all your gear&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;One character per server&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This was the BEST pvp fun I have ever had on EQ or any other game.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;While it was out, I was a barbarian and hunting in Everfrost with about 140 other barbarians, fighting for each kill, after we starting hitting level 6, a ton of fights, but eventually we worked together to get stronger as a nation, then went into Blackburrow to level, and on out into Qeynos Hills where we fought the humans. It was like a huge world of Risk, where you built up your army then went to attack the next territory.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If this was a permanent server then guilds would have formed and more alliances etc, still it was the most hardcore pvp server ever, and it was the most fun. Talk about a fear of death, you where focused constantly, it was great, and even with newer games out, a server like this would attract alot of players.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>cleric in pvp</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=PVP&amp;message.id=11515#M11515</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;Hi,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; I thought this would be good place to post a thread. I play on stormhammer(for now),and I just recently did a pvp tournament with my cleric. In which I was immediately ganged up on by 2-3ppl,theres more to that situation than, a cleric is  a pain in the ass to fight in pvp..&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;  I never pvp'd before,and I didnt know what to really to do to kill ppl. All I could do was keep healing myself,and piss them off for doing that(took 3 of them at least 15mins or more to kill me; I ran out of mana,and used all my Vet skills). I posted on a clerics forum,but noone seems to really do pvp.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; I was just looking for strats to pvp if the occasion arises. What spell lineups should be used? Im currently lvl 66,and I dont have any 66 spells and very little lvl 65 spells.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; In that pvp I tried stunning and it seems stuns are almost pointless with all the high resist gear,and my highest dd; condemation,is soo slow to cast..All I was doing was debuffing ppl,and  healing myself? Besides using summoned proc hammer what other dps is at clerics disposal,besides pet hammer and ds shield( i only have the 15pt dmg one)..&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; any strats would be great,as I really dont plan to pvp much,but if I like it,I might do it more often..&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>My opinion on that top 10 list</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=PVP&amp;message.id=11510#M11510</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;1)         More people want to see that the people who train all the time and blatenly hack al the time get banned.  There are less MQ2/Showeq users on Zek than on any other server.  But the people who use it and use it all the time and nothing happens to them.  This problem can be fixxed easy.  Go to the big pvp battles annon and watch.  Everyone warping ban them right then and there.  Go to a few raids anon of the top guilds and see who uses the hax and ban them right there.  This will get rid of the top 10 known hackers on the server warning ppl that the developers are watching them and doing thier job.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;2)        The resist on procs is not that major, and developers havent been looking at it for a long while.  Move it down the list to a lower number.   Most people who care about this are over powered melee who want to proc even more stuns.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;3)         Points have meant nothing since day 1 it was implemented.  The turning in of Signets from Sullon Zek made it even more so.  The only real problem I see is that the gear you can buy needs to be updated to about time level gear instead of just VT gear.  Again not a major issue that the devs havent looked at.  Move it down the list.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;4)         Out of range healers and buffers are plain stupid.  The best fix for this is if they heal or buff someone who is pvping they should lose thier status and become pvp enabled.  Again not a major issue, but if the level range was opened to +/- 20 levels pvp would open up and cause more action.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;5)        Poor sks cant tap.  Help them out!  Other than potions its the only way they can heal themselves.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;6)        Rangers are way over powered and thier shooting out thier rear while running oor makes them invincable to all casters.  Casters cant hit them unless they can see thier feet.  Why isnt bowing the same way.  Either make spells the same or fix rangers.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;7)        Bards mana drain does suck.  Only problem is that there are not enough bards to make this a real problem. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;8)        Discord was fun, but only for a few days.  Fix this server before starting a new one.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;9)        Yes monks are over powered with thier chain stuns, but also look at run 8 and tstaff.  Make them resistable and have run 8 be reduced to run 5 on zek.  Run 8 was for pulling mobs, but now a monk can run from just inside my spell casting range with a 30% focus to melee range before i can get a 2.3 second cast spell off.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;10)      What is the point of spells being able to hit more if they dont land?  Both need to be fixed.  They should land for more and land more often.  Also since melee have such a distinct advantage in pvp, casters should get melee avoidance and mitagtion.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>According to MMORPGCHART.com:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;67% of the MMORPG market share is taken by PvP games (World of Warcraft, Lineage, Lineage2)&lt;br&gt;8.1% of the MMORPG market share is taken by EQ &amp;amp; EQ2&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;World of Warcraft  &amp;gt;2 Million Subscribers&lt;br&gt;Lineage &amp;gt; 2 million Subscribers&lt;br&gt;Lineage 2 &amp;gt; 2 million Subscribers&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everquest  &amp;lt; 500, 000 Subscribers&lt;br&gt;EQ 2 &amp;lt; 300, 000 Subscribers&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By not paying attention to PvP, SOE has lost out on a BIG OPPORTUNITY.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>I'm done.  7 years, and I'm finally going to read the credits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sony has butchered PvP to the point it is freaking pointless to hang around.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Caster PvP ( neglecting necro's ) is a joke.&lt;br&gt;PvE is being totally screwed too, EQ is making it's last few laps around the toilet bowl before it's gone.&lt;br&gt;Sony is putting out ANOTHER expansion, but won't fix the 1,000 problems they already have.  I mean nothing like putting out another expansion to add MORE problems to the infinite list of crap they can't figure out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sony pull your heads out of....  well... Stop being gluttons, and provide QUALITY gaming, and you might get out of this with something left over.  Living off the fumes of what Varent had going isn't doing you justice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;EQ is dying, and Sony is trying to squeeze the last penny out now. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For those of you I fought on the battle field, GL to all of you with whatever you do in life, but this is my stop.</description>
