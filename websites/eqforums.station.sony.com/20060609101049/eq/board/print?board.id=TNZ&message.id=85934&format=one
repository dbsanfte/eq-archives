A lot of those small guilds who sit their bewailing their lack of elemental access have never made any real effort to raid NToV, Sleepers, Ssra, Seru, or VT. Seru can be downed with ~40 people in pre-VT gear...<BR>

There are plenty of small to medium sized guilds moving up in PoP. I'm watching it happen on my server. And not only are they not playing 10 hours a day to do it, they aren't raiding more the 3-4 nights a week.<BR>

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR><BR><BR>Wow. Clearly my small guild is not even on your radar. Raids with about 40 people to advance... ok, we have fielded 20 on a good day. Raiding no more than 3-4 nights per week to advance... try 3-4 nights per month, again on a good month. <BR><BR>I am not elemental, nor do I ever see myself being so. Heck, I have 2 PoP flags to my name, and yes, I am level 65. This basically means that I have bought two expansions (PoP and Discord) that I will never see more than half of what I paid for. And that doesn't really bother me, in the game. It does mean, however, that <B>I will not waste my money on another expansion</B>. There's plenty for me to do in the game that I already own, and I will continue to enjoy it while the rest of you run off on your raids... or just run off because you're bored with the endless raids.<BR><BR>That, I think, is the bottom line: if they continue to release new content for those with flags, or just those with the old flags to get the gear they need to survive, then they will stop selling expansions to those of us who know that content is unreachable.<BR>

<P>Well, my guild has over 70 people in it, of whom there are usually 8-10 online simultaneously at most, with about 40 characters actively played. We haven't raided in months because it is impossible to get anyone interested in doing it. Our membership has been stable since last Summer pretty much - a couple or three people moved to bigger guilds but still regularly hunt with us anyway. We have about half a dozen 65ths and as many again 60 - 65. </P>
<P>I have a 65th Cleric, 80AAs and a 63rd SK in the guild, and I'm levelling up an enchanter (now 52nd) who will go at least to 60.</P>
<P>The guild is cheerful, unstressed and as an officer I have heard no complaints about lack of raids, lack of flags, lack of access to zones or content or anything else for months. We spent much of yesterday getting drops for LoY spells for characters in the 60s, something people hadn't gotten around to until now because they were having fun doing other stuff.</P>
<P>We see links to drops from Time and GoD in the various channels we are all in, but personally I no more feel that those diminish my gameplay than in real life seeing someone drive past me in a super-expensive sportscar makes me feel I need one too.</P>
<P>I have bought all the expansions to date and got excellent value out of&nbsp;nearly all of them. I didn't much like GoD, but that's because I don't like the look and feel of it, not because&nbsp;I felt I was being excluded from content.</P>
<P>I do dislike flagging, as it happens, because I think it's tedious and boring. On those grounds I'd see it abandoned in a blink. However, if access to all PoP Planes was made open tomorrow, I'd still not be interested in going there - I rarely visit the PoP planes now unless it's to help out a friend doing a quest. </P>
<P>EQ is now huge. I can't see any way for anyone other than the truly dedicated, hardcore player who does little else with his or her life than play EQ to see most of the higher end content. It's like life - you have to pick and choose and concentrate on the parts you enjoy - there's no way you can do it everything yourself that you read about other people doing.</P>
