      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;I believe one of the major motivators for people creating characters on the Combine server is going to be nostalgia.&amp;nbsp; Boats were a big part of that nostalgia, in fact it's one of the things players who are now playing EQ2 mention they miss the most.&amp;nbsp; It's certainly nice to have an alternative method for getting from point A to point B, but nothing replaces the roleplaying and nostalgic fun of sitting on the deck of a boat...or jumping off to explore an island and then wondering if another boat will ever come along.&amp;nbsp; :)</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I have been away from EQ1 for quite awhile (since PoP launched).&amp;nbsp; I'm wondering if someone can give me a guide to the new features, commands, and options available now.&amp;nbsp; I've been playing the past couple of days and things like bandolier and potion belts have been mentioned.&amp;nbsp; I see new features in my inventory window I have no idea what they are for, completely new window types, etc.&amp;nbsp; Guidance would be greatly appreciated to help fill me in and catch me up to speed.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Thanks&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Okay dokay I think I've got it now:&amp;nbsp; used to be that no matter what you would end up triggering the higher level AA effect right :)&amp;nbsp; Yippe, I finally understand what the heck they changed.&amp;nbsp; Thanks to everyone who took time to answer my question.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <title>Re: Bear Form</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=shamanbalance&amp;message.id=3456#M3456</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;The only time an improved bear form might be useful is in a zone that doesn't permit mounts.&amp;nbsp; Otherwise being on your mount offers you all the benefits of perpetual sitting while still allowing you to cast (HP and mana regen).&amp;nbsp; Unfortunately, the mount&amp;nbsp;doesn't permit foraging.&amp;nbsp; I'm an Iksar shaman and that's just one of the things that bugs me about mounts.&amp;nbsp; Afterall they eat like crazy - seems to me they might actually help you forage around for stuff while they are looking for food.&amp;nbsp; But anyway getting back on topic...&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I agree that the bear form WIS stat boost becomes a non-issue since you should be able to easily max your WIS with your gear.&amp;nbsp; I used bear from when I was young with poor equipment and no money for a mount - but once my financial situation and gear improved I no longer needed it.&amp;nbsp; I do think though that being able to turn into a bear is one of the things that makes being a shaman fun, and it also makes us easily recognizable.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So, a bear form that was designed for indoor (no mount situations) would be lovely.&amp;nbsp; I suggest some form of mana regen as the effect.&amp;nbsp; Especially now that Omens of War is supposed to be adding additional buff space(s).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;U&gt;From the August 11, 2004 Path Message:&lt;/U&gt;&lt;BR&gt;"When an AA is an upgrade of another AA and both are triggered abilities, players can make a hotkey and use either one, but will only get the upgraded effect if they use the hotkey for the upgraded ability."&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;U&gt;Sahsha:&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Umm...okay...I don't get it.&amp;nbsp; Could someone please give me an example of what they are talking about here?&amp;nbsp; Does this mean that for the best effect to occur you would need to activate both hotkeys together (original effect, and upgrade)?&amp;nbsp; If this is a change what in the world was it doing before and how is this now different?&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;U&gt;Nolrog:&lt;/U&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If you have an AA ability called Superior Patching (making up abilites to make this more humorous, and because I'm too lazy to look real ones up) you can create a hot key for it.&amp;nbsp; A few levels later, you get a new AA ability called Impoved Superior Patching.&amp;nbsp; If you punch the Superior Patching hot key, it does not trigger the Improved Superior Patching ability.&amp;nbsp; You have to create a new hot key for that new ability for it to work.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Okay, so how is this different?&amp;nbsp; Was it not already working that way before?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Still confused a bit...&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
