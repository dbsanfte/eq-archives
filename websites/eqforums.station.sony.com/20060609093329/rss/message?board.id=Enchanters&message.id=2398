&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN class=postbody&gt;Repost from the post I made on the runes site for those that don't visit that site.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN class=postbody&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN class=postbody&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN class=postbody&gt;I do believe that OoW will be better received by the general community than GoD and even PoP were. The atmosphere of OoW zones is more Kunark like with forts and abandon ruins all over the place.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Getting to OoW zones. About a week ago on Beta they added a Priest of Discord outside the library in PoK. Just tell him you wish to go to Omens and he will port you to Dranik’s Scar the first Omens zone. Unlike the LDoN Magus the PoD does not port you right away. It takes a few seconds before he does port you. Switch to 3rd person view and you will notice that the PoD opens up a cool looking portal and you can see through it to where your going. I thought this was a pretty neat effect.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When you get the chance go to one of the zones with lots of water to check out the new reflective water. First time I saw it was in Lake Rathe on my way to the Arena. I must say I was impressed.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When fighting in Omens the first thing you may notice is that the mobs hit for drastically less than GoD mobs. In Walls of Slaughter a level 65-70 zone the trash mobs hit for slightly less than LDoN Hard mobs.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Custom PC Titles&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Type Shift + T to see the list of titles available to you. The titles are based on level, amount of AA’s, and tradeskills. Later on there will be titles based on content conquered. Personally I went with the title “Visionary.”&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Guild Tribute&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;HUGE plat sink. There is an option for Officers to turn off the guild tribute and I suggest most guilds to turn it off when not on a raid.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Task System&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The task system is basically a bunch of mini quests. They can be done solo or you can group up with people doing the same quest.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;An example of a task I was given. In Overthere I was asked to send some very important information to a person in FM. The NPC in FM told me he had an assignment for me. To go to the dining hall in Temple of Droga and see what the goblins where planning. Those see invis giants in FM are fun…. NOT! Once there I was assigned to kill 10 flame masters. I soloed two fairly easy and then I ran into two Rangers also doing the same task so we grouped up. Once grouped we all got credit for killing the flame masters so the task went faster than I expected it to be.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;There are three level of tasks based on expected duration. Short about 60 minutes, medium about 90 minutes, long about 120 minutes. Currently the highest level you can get a task in level 66. There are plans to make up to level 70 tasks.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The exp rewards on tasks are ok. I got 20% exp in AA while killing in Droga and another 20% for completing the task.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Spells&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Spells used in beta are the same spells you see on Lucy. You get spells in the same way we got PoP spells. Each level has a turn-in rune. 66-68 runes are tradable while 69-70 runes are not.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I parsed our new pet at about 50-54 DPS. Nice improvement over our old pet that did about 30-33 DPS. It also has a new weapon graphic, nothing fancy but better than the dull graphic it had before.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;AA's&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I see myself getting a lot of basic AA’s like extra spell slot, raised FT cap, and extra buff slots.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Of the class specific AA’s I liked Soothing Words and Stasis the most. Stasis has a really long recast time on it though. I did not try out Destructive Fury out due to too many prerequisites that I did not have.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Any questions about Omens?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;First off, what guild tribute options are there?&amp;nbsp; And what are the prices?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Second our pet does a bit more dps but does it still only haev 1500-2k health?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;How rare are the runes for the spells?&amp;nbsp; Do they drop off trash or just namers?&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>From other forums, spells drop off named from many zones.  The harder the zone, the better the chance of a top end spell.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is Wake of Felicity finished?  It doesn't look finished.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Are we getting a PBAOE mez?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Are the level caps on lucy final?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Are there XP L 71+ mobs?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pacify code looks different, how did they change it?</description>

&lt;P&gt;There is no WoM upgrade.&amp;nbsp; WoF is a normal AE mezz.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Plenty of mobs to exp off of that are above level 70.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I did not notice any changes to Pacify.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>WoF lasts 9 ticks and doens't overwrite normal mez?  Strange features for a nomral aoe mez.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is charm usable in every OoW zone you where in?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is there DC bait?</description>

      <description>WoF won't overwrite normal mezzes and has a 9 tick duration on lucy.  Plus it has a lower level cap than our normal mez (L 73).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This seems unexpected.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, on L 71-73 mobs, we can root, tash, slow and single target mez?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Grats bards.  =)</description>
