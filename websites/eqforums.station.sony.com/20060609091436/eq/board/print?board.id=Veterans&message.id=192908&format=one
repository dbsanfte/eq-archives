				<div></div><p>Could this be related to line-of-site issues in the zone?  I have hunted extensive in arcstone, and there are some really annoying LOS issues in the zone. </p><p>First, ground objects seem to block LOS in the Z-axis infinitely (meaning, from the ground to the sky).  Many times I will be levitated on the hill, run out into the open to tag a mob with a DD spell, and get the message &quot;You cannot see your target&quot;.  In old world zones, this is no problem but it happens here.  What I noticed was, the mob was lower than me on the Z-axis, but there would be a rock on the ground between me and the mob.  If I moved to a side, and the rock no longer on a direct path from me to the mob, then I could cast OK.</p><p>Please understand, the rock is not directly in the LOS path from me to the mob, because I am levitated and much higher than it in the Z-axis.</p><p>It seems plausible to me, the quest credit could be bugged if it checks Line-of-Sight from the mob.  If it does, it would be easy for something to block that LOS and therefore you don't get credit for the quest kill.  Hopefully, devs can check this out and fix it if that is the case.</p><p>Medaiin</p>
