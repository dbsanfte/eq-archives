      <description>I'm coming from an almost entirely EQ2 background, played EQ for a while but never got into the lore. EQ2 is a phenomenal game but I basically maxed out my character and there's not much else I could be doing at the moment, so I've come over here for the progression server. The EQ2 lore boards actually have quite a lot of discussion on this point, most of it with a number of broken record trolls that can't understand the possibility of some tie-ins between the game. But a popular topic, for instance, was if MM was a god in the EQ2 world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Researching that, I actually dug up an early beta post by one of the main EQ2 devs saying that they had consulted extensively with the current EQ devs and that there was no lore divergence up until the next couple expansions at least (at that point it would've covered up until OoW, I think). Of course this is sort of backwards from the question you're asking (EQ2 lore in EQ1), so here's my take on different kinds of lore:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Note: "the past" refers to before the divergence, "the future" refers to afterward&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;EQ2 spoilers ahoy!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. Things directly influenced by the rending/shattering exist in EQ2, but not in EQ1.&lt;br&gt;Ex: Because of the cataclysmic events, Nagafen and Vox are freed and pop out a big pile of prismatic eggs. This obviously does not happen in the EQ1 timeline.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. People and places that exist in "the future" in one game, and could exist in the other, exist in both games until contradicted.&lt;br&gt;Ex: Darathar is a dragon that to my knowledge does not exist in EQ1 lore. His factional allegiances are a bit questionable and he doesn't seem to have been a major player in the dragon world before. He assumes a human guise to manipulate mortals and uses a tool called the Harness to martial forces of drakota to attack Nagafen and Vox, presumably over their stockpile of prismatic eggs. Do the Harness or Darathar exist in EQ1? It's not something you'll want to be building elaborate theories off of, but sure, why not?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3. Events that happen in "the future" in both games are a question mark until they're confirmed one way or the other.&lt;br&gt;Ex: MM's godhood is a big question mark in EQ2. No confirmation one way or the other, so it's silly to say definitively that it happened or didn't happen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4. Events that happen in "the past" but were referenced first in "the future" exist in both games until contradicted.&lt;br&gt;Vhalen is responsible for a lot of the lore in EQ2. Aside from being awesome at his job, he claims to have tomes and tomes of information that he draws lore from which predate even the existence of EQ2. Unless the devs make a boo-boo, things that are referenced to exist in the past probably exist in the past in both games, even if they weren't brought to light until a current expansion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ex: In EQ2 one of the more interesting plotlines that pervades in the background of the game is the shadowed men invasion of Norrath. There are a series of books that describe the shadowed men as interplanetary, transdimensional bringers of darkness. Their plot has been hatching on Norrath for a while, but they haven't struck yet, though they have advanced their plans by the time EQ2 rolls around. They are also tied in with the creation of Bertoxxulous, or at least the fall of the Xulous. Unless there's something in EQ1 which contradicts this (which I'd like to know actually, as it's my favorite lore subject :D) then it probably is true in EQ1 as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;5. Things that are clearly directly contradictory are true as per the game.&lt;br&gt;Ex: I can't think of any right now, but a couple were posted above.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;6. Zone layouts are up for grabs as per artistic license.&lt;br&gt;It's just too hard, given the "approximate" nature of the representation of zones in both games and the amount of unexplored territory, to really get a handle on this. I mean, look at the difference between Nek 2.0 and Nek 1.0, and those were actually supposed to cover the same territory with no catastrophic changes. Same with Freeport 1.0 to Freeport 2.0.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course, any of this is subject to change at any time at the whim of the devs. History has shown that even trusted, confirmed lore sources are sometimes self-contradictory. What it basically amounts to is that this discussion is fun, but really doesn't mean jack... the devs will do as they see fit and we'll be left trying to string the lore together :P&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Vahlar who is the Dev Responsible for EQ1 lore has made similar statements refering to the "Big Book of Lore" they have at SoE. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I imagine its a lot of old notes from the Likes of Bill Trost. (whatever happened to him anyhow?)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Norrath was based on the Pen and Paper game world he&amp;nbsp;Steve Clover and Brad McQuiad developed. Seemingly they wrote very detailed notes and back stories for the whole Universe, many of which we still have not seen. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;gaspar the eq was written well before oow came out and devlopment started around pop.&amp;nbsp; so far as i know the presence of muramites have never been acknowledged.. perhasp their all hifdingin out in taelesia who knows.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;"There is only one solution: Destroy them all." &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Rallos Zek's burning eyes moved disdainfully from one god to the next, hoping his harsh edict had convinced more of them to take his side. It had been countless ages since virtually all the gods had gathered together like this, and he did not intend to miss the opportunity to expand his influence. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;"I maintain that this would be an overreaction," Tunare said, shaking her head. The mortals need our guidance, not our wrath. We should inspire them and strengthen the spirituality within them, not snuff it out." &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;"You mean your precious elves?" Rallos countered. "Did they need your guidance as their greed soiled your plane, murdering your servants in their lust for power and wealth? Attacking the very manifestation of your being as if you were a boar for the slaughter?" &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;She scowled and shook her head. "That is your influence at work, Rallos. It was only when they breached the Planes of Power that you lost the delight you had taken in their growing viciousness." &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;"We all agree that the mortals have gone too far," Brell interjected, sensing the need to interrupt before the argument dragged on further. "But surely the answer isn't to wipe away all our handiwork. After all, it is only a few races that have committed offenses worthy of such action. Perhaps a selective pruning is in order rather than complete annihilation." &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Solusek Ro shook his head. "I must agree with Rallos on this matter. Wipe them out; it is the only way." &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;"The solution is obvious," interjected Cazic-Thule. "If my influence were allowed to grow, the mortals would not be in a position to challenge us. Fear will keep them in check, as it always should have." &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Karana scowled. "Preposterous. It has been proven that any one of us alone can be overcome by the mortals. It is underestimating them that has brought us to this place, that has forced us to become allies in action if not in principle. But the solution must be one that we can all agree to." &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;"How can you be so blind?" Rallos growled. "How can you not see that the mortals must be made to pay for their insolence?" &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;"You ignore the honor in their hearts," Mithaniel Marr countered. "They have earned the right to exist, to ascend to greatness." &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;"Greatness?" Innoruuk cackled gleefully. "Leave them to their own devices and they will devour themselves in jealousy and hatred. The solution is not for us to kill them, but to step aside and let them feed upon each other." &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;"We don't have time for that," Solusek Ro asserted. "The demi-planes are already weakened--in fact, some have simply faded from existence, as our powers have grown too thin to sustain them. We must refocus our resources and strike back while we still can." &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Quellious had listened to the bickering for what seemed like ages. Though time had no meaning for them in this place, she could bear to listen no longer. She spoke softly, yet with a directness that silenced the others. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;"I propose a compromise," she said, her gaze moving from one god to the next. "It will not be ideal for any of us, and it does not come without risk. But I feel it is the only way to satisfy all our objectives and restore balance between us and the mortals." &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Bristlebane perked an ear. "Speak, please, for this endless debate is maddening even for me." &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Quellious continued. "We all agree the mortals have gained too much power, but there are non-destructive ways to correct this. There is also a way for us to regain our strength, though it means removing our influence from this world for a time. But if we all agree--including those who sit upon the greater wheel of Elemental Power--it could save us all." &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;"Speak, Tranquil One," Xegony said, breaking her long silence. "We will listen to your proposal." &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Quellious nodded. "It is through their unity that the mortals initially became strong. The first thing we must do is to disrupt that unity?" &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When Quellious had finished, Erollisi Marr nodded. "It would be an acceptable compromise." &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;"Agreed," her twin brother added. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;"It does not matter to me," Innoruuk grinned, "for I still believe that the mortals will destroy themselves eventually." &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Brell rubbed his chin thoughtfully. "I will do as you suggest." &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The Faceless shrugged. "It seems like a waste of time, but I will follow the wishes of this council." &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Tunare sighed sadly. "I will do what you ask in order to make this work." &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Fennin Ro spoke for the first time since he had entered the chamber. "The rulers of the Elemental Planes will abide by this decision." &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;One by one the other gods either agreed or said nothing, nodding silently. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Quellious eyed Rallos Zek as he whispered something to Solusek Ro. The Prince of Flame shook his head. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;"We agree," the god of War said at last. "When does it begin?" &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;"In seven mortal days' time, we will act as one. Will that be long enough to do what is needed?" &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;"It will," Solusek Ro said coldly. Tunare nodded with reluctance. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;"Then it is agreed," the Tribunal spoke in a single voice. "This council stands adjourned." &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The gods began to leave the chambers, but Quellious lingered. She noticed as Rallos approached Cazic-Thule and began to whisper something to him, and watched as Solusek Ro did the same to Brell. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Tunare stood next to her. "Is this really the only way?" &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;"I believe it is," Quellious responded softly. "But I think we need to remain watchful, as not everyone may honor the intent of this pact." &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Karana approached the two goddesses. "I have some trepidation in this matter, and I'd wager you feel the same." &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;"I do," replied Quellious. "But I have another proposal to share with the two of you to ensure our interests are preserved." &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As the three gods left the council chamber together, Rallos Zek eyed them loathingly. He muttered to himself. "So, Quellious, you have your allies and I have mine. But your weakness will be your downfall. Let the endgame begin."&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

who knows.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That's true, but they knew in general what the next two expansions were going to be and Moorgard said that they had no conflicts and were planning on working together to try to make as few conflicts as possible. Muramites might not be acknowledged but according to his statement they're not contradictory to the EQ2 universe. There's a difference between existing in the game and existing in the universe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'd dig it up for you but it's from the very early beta (maybe even alpha, or pre-alpha) boards and I've since lost it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;This book is titled "The Age of Cataclysms". It is a chronicle of history as told by the Sage of Ages. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Forward: This volume is a copy of one the more recent tomes within our library. This was a chronicle of the several times the Sage of Ages spoke to us of his infinite knowledge. It is only now that we can understand what his visions can teach us. The Sage of Ages, or Sages as the case may be, has observed Norrath for time immemorial. This story is a glimpse into just one of the many viewpoints of unrecorded history. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As the Age of Cataclysms came, the Dragons would watch as their world would change drastically. Their jewel, their present from the great Mother, was being ripped apart before their very eyes. The gods had come and gone, and in their wake devastation followed. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Having followed the great wars of the lesser races for much of the last Age, they were not convinced that the heroes were stable enough to use as tools. This is because they did not understand that the lessers were as important as those that were not draconic. This is something the Dragons would come to know in time. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;For the time being, they would continue observing from a far as the world broke apart. The turbulence of the seas was what began to alarm them at first. They could tell this was something greater than they were capable of. With the absence of the gods, they could not blame it on divine interference. But what it was, they could not say. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When the rumblings beneath the earth began, they asked all of their agents within Sub-Tunaria if there was a cause thant was simply mundane. Not hearing an answer from their eyes and ears, they became alarmed. Ultimately, one of the Ring spoke first. One spoke the name of the Exiled Ones. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;During the Age of Turmoil, the invading heroes would undo all that the Ring of old had seeked to contain. The blatant disregard toward the Laws on part of the King of Fire and the Queen of Ice is what was contained within the deepest tomb. When it was released, destruction unlike anything the Dragons had seen in any Age was wreaked across the land. Perhaps Nagafen and Vox had been freed from their prison after all these Ages. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The Ring convened as it had done so in the past. One group wanted to move their prison to their homeland to watch over them. One group wanted to seal their prisons forever. And one individual suggested the using of the Drakota. After many ages, they gave in and allowed the Drakota to be used once again. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The Truthspeaker, the Dragon who was in control of the Drakota, traveled to the prison of the King of Fire and saw that the worst come to pass. The destruction of the world was being caused by the joining of the two. At once, he took his faithful Drakota to the ice prison that entombed Vox. His worst fears were true, for within the Ice Queen's prison was the Fire King. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The Truthspeaker waited for the Fire King to leave, knowing that he could not suffer the freezing temperatures of the prison for too long. As Nagafen left, the Truthspeaker unleashed the Drakota upon Vox. Where the Destroyer of past ages was seduced by the foolish lies of the fiends and failed, the Truthspeaker was successful. Vox was destroyed. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Not letting the victory pass, the Truthspeaker assaulted the King of Fire before he could reach the safety of his lair - his former prison. The Truthspeaker would suffer only half a victory during this age, for the King of Fire had drawn from powers not his own to defeat the Drakota. The Age would end, but the Truthspeaker would vow that in the next Age, the bane of the Ring would cease once and for all.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;It would appaer the sleeper is the drakota... everything seems based on eq history but simplified and adjusted for its own application... i think this is a good indicater that eq2 revision history is not canon to eq lore&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

There's a couple factions in the former Plane of Sky, the first main one being the Doomwing Legion under Lord Vyemm who believes the prophecy of the sleeper's return is pretty much metaphorical and the Sleeper himself is never coming back. The second one is Harla Dar who is fanatically devoted to Kerafyrm and awaits his return. There's others, like Gore/Talendor and Venekor, but I'm not entirely clear on their standing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Darathar was a dragon that had control of the Harness, a magical item that gives the user power over the drakota. He used this to attack Naggy and Vox since dragons don't attack each other directly. The current owner of the Harness is unknown as far as I know.&lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Oh and also, I'd like to add that the Truthspeaker that the Sage of Ages refers to in that passage is Darathar, who was coincidentally posing as the Sage of Ages. So the passage you quoted is Darathar talking through the guise of the Sage of Ages about himself. Obviously that story has an agenda :P&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;i guess we will have to see what happens over the next 400 years notice though that in eq the war of fay ends during the age of turmoil... we in eq have passed the age of Turmoil and are currently in the age of War. although it is certainly possible that in eq2 the trolls retook grobb and lost it back to the froglocks it is unlikely the froglocks will reclaim grobb if they establish their own city which has been suggested will happen by the devs. eq begins in 5960 after the Age of Cataclysms&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;div&gt;actually retconned can be done by the creators to.  In Star Trek, the guy(I think it was Cochran) who invented faster than light travel for Earth had his age changed from when he invented the warp drive(and maybe his birthdate).  In the original episodes it he was in his late fifties, yet in First Contact, he was in his thirties.  Another point of interest, &amp;quot;Splinter of the Mind's Eye&amp;quot; was orginally going to be the canon story after &amp;quot;A New Hope&amp;quot;, if &amp;quot;A New Hope&amp;quot; did not do well.  And here is the definiton of ret con from dictionary.com&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;retcon&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;/ret'kon/ retroactive continuity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The common situation in fiction where a new story &amp;quot;reveals&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;things about events in previous stories, usually leaving the&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;facts&amp;quot; the same (thus preserving continuity) while completely&lt;br&gt;changing their interpretation. For example, revealing that a&lt;br&gt;whole season of &amp;quot;Dallas&amp;quot; was a dream was a retcon.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;P.S. I swear I'm not a sci-fi nerd&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;My stance is that if it is contradictory to whatever game that you are playing then said lore is not applicable.&amp;nbsp; If there is nothing that contradicts it in the game you are playing, then there is nothing wrong with considering it as a way to fill in some of the lore gaps in the games.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Discrepancies can also be explained from a RP perspective as being that the dating used by those who study history in EQ2 could be off some number of years that might put it outside of EQLive's time frame.&amp;nbsp; Or they could have just simply have the wrong information due to misinterpretation of descriptions of what happened or misinformation spread to re-write what happened.&amp;nbsp; Personally I don't see anything wrong with someone using lore from another EQ game to &lt;STRONG&gt;further&lt;/STRONG&gt; support a view&amp;nbsp;about EQ1 they hold&amp;nbsp;as long as that lore isn't contradicted by something in EQ Live.&amp;nbsp; I also don't see any problem with someone using non-contradictory lore to fill in gaps in EQ history, but if something&amp;nbsp;is introduced&amp;nbsp;ingame via an expansion or other&amp;nbsp;serverwide shared event&amp;nbsp;and "proves"&amp;nbsp;that history&amp;nbsp;to be false then they are out of luck.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;But I'm not interested in an RP perspective as to why one game is different from another.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;What's your RP explanation for why Ganondorf and Hyrule don't appear in this game?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;It's as relevent in terms of validity.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Something isn't "fact until a point later in which it becomes not fact", things are either always fact, or they're never fact.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I mean the big problem is that EQ 1 has "proven" that EQ 2 is false.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Ezedriel on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;04-29-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;07:57 AM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;The Trakanon Prophecy was &amp;quot;fact&amp;quot; until it was retconned, Eze.  Lore can be, and often is fact until it is such time as it is shown to be otherwise.&lt;/div&gt;</description>
