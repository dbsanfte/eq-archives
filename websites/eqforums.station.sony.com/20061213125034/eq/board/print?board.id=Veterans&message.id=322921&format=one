It's not too hard, even with low dps imo, its all about tactics.&nbsp;
We found that each aug event was like that.&nbsp; Every single one of
them we were thinking was too hard when we first did them, it wasn't
until the 2nd or 3rd time that we adjusted tactics, and found them to
be just fine.&nbsp; I'd say that Shades of Calm is a bit too long (you
know what I'm talking about here), and I'd say that The Sleepless Guard
is a bit too difficult (unless you consider his location and what he
unlocks) - once his respawn gets fixed (the lockout doesnt work, hes up
everytime).&nbsp; Doppleganger as I said above, isn't on the way to
anything, and requires a bit too much clearing, but his event is fine
once you adjust tactics.&nbsp; Overall, if nothing changed on all of
the aug minis - I wouldn't be upset.&nbsp; I'm just nitpicking on them,
as its really only very minor things to pick about.<br>
<br>
I really love how you made them mini-events.&nbsp; It really is a
better mechanism than a randomly popping named tied to a trigger or
specific boss being dead.<br><div></div>
