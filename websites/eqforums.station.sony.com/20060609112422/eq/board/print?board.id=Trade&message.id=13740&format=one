				I can't say all that much about the specifics of Tradeskills, but I can speak a bit to the statistics.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Kaspin is correct that all this technically speaks to is that assured
failures % is working properly, given the current information.&nbsp;
But more can be said with a little bit of additional information from
Ngreth.<br>
<br>
At what skill level does the combine reach the 95% success rate?&nbsp;
That's the one piece of information that's missing.&nbsp; If it is like
5 skill points below the test skills, then this is all but
conclusionary evidence that the 15% modifier trophy is not adversely
effecting combine rates of recipes above the natural skill level.<br>
<br>
That's all it would say (though it would disprove the "it lowers the
skill" theory), and nothing really more.&nbsp; You could generalize it
out to the other modifiers, but technically nothing else would be
"proved", without testing the others thoroughly.&nbsp; But, truth is
that's an insane amount of work.&nbsp; The last time I did 1k combines
in something close to "one sitting", my wrist was sore for 3
days.&nbsp; Oh, and thanks Ngreth for making the Rock Salt to Fine Salt
combine doable in multiples.&nbsp; My wrist appreciates it.<br>
<br>
Also, people need to remember, what I call, "The **SMURF** Rule of Statistics (EQ version)". <br>
<br>
"Expected % only happens as X (# of combines) approaches
infinity."&nbsp; So you can only expect to make 95% of your combines
after an infinite amount of combines.&nbsp; 1,000,000,000,000,000,000
isn't at infinity, and in fact, the success amount at that point could
easily be a bit off from the Expected %, due to variance.&nbsp; Stats
aren't a nice thing to deal with at times.&nbsp; <span><img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-sad.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0></span><br>
<br>
Still, there could be issues with one of one of the lower modifiers not
actually having an effect.&nbsp; This test in no way addresses that
issue, though you're free to make the generalization.<br>
