You will have to play with the shrouds for a while before you can use some of the more powerful shrouds. <BR><FONT color=#0000a0><B>Rytan -</B></FONT> hah! I win! <BR><FONT color=#0000a0><B>Kytherea -</B></FONT> Occassionally we have to let you win Rytan <BR><BR><FONT color=#800000><B>Brekkee -</B></FONT> *Havenhawk* Are there plans for new melee disciplines for the 65+ crowd? <BR><FONT color=#0000a0><B>Rytan -</B></FONT> Yes there is a new combat ability for each of the melee classes. Additionally, a few of the hybrids are getting new combat abilities with DoD as well. <BR><BR><FONT color=#800000><B>Brekkee -</B></FONT> *Leeroy* Will we be seeing more stories from the Wayfarer brotherhood in DoDh ? <BR><FONT color=#0000a0><B>AbsorEQ -</B></FONT> This expansion doesn't involve the Wayfarers, though there's always the chance that they will again involve themselves in the story of Norrath. <BR><FONT color=#0000a0><B>Prathun -</B></FONT> The Wayfarer's Brotherhood storyline doesn't intersect with Depths of Darkhollow. So, no. <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0> <BR><BR><FONT color=#800000><B>Brekkee -</B></FONT> *Jetfire* Will we be seeing the classic special mobs (Summoned, Undead, Animals) or will those of us with those special abilities be left out? <BR><FONT color=#0000a0><B>Rytan -</B></FONT> Yes there will be examples of each of the various special NPC types such as summoned, animal, undead, etc. <BR><BR><FONT color=#800000><B>Brekkee -</B></FONT> *Ilsi* Will there be "cute" spirit shrouds as well as "scary" ones? <BR><FONT color=#0000a0><B>Rytan -</B></FONT> Well I'm not really one to determine what's cute, but there are a few spirit shrouds that aren't your typical menacing monster. The fairy, the sporali, and several animals are available in addition to the more menacing monsters. <BR><BR><FONT color=#800000><B>Brekkee -</B></FONT> That will wrap it up for tonight.
