<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I've met some women on here who've become really close friends of mine, but none I'd date.&nbsp; I find it hard to trust very many ppl I talk to onilne lol.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Probably the closest I got to it was when I was grouped with a Warrior on Bertox.&nbsp; She had just got done helping me kill Maligar.&nbsp; We were having some problems within the guild and we were both pretty mad since we were officers.&nbsp; She logs on her Druid and we group again.&nbsp; She ports us to Grimling Forest and we sit down and just have a long conversation starting with problems in the guild.&nbsp; Then it goes to RL stuff like problems we're having with our significant others or whatnot.&nbsp; Was kinda cool...I never really connected with someone in game like that.&nbsp; But like I said before, we're just satisfied with being good friends since we both have someone we're seeing RL.</DIV>
