    <title>Tank balance</title>

    <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I was reading through more posts, seeing more disinformation and junk as always in this forum, and so decided to lay out what I think is the real problem here. People are b**ching and moaning and claiming class X is superior, and we get hyperbole like "knights out-tank warriors" (which is not true anyway, healing&amp;nbsp;is not equal to tanking, period, else people would be suggesting to people on the low end to only go for hp augs instead of ac augs) or all these stupid inane comparisons of tank class aggro (newsflash, our aggro is irrelevant to each other, its only next to the people we need to keep aggro over that matters, as I don't think anyone is going to complain they can't keep aggro over the other tank classes if the other tank class isn't trying to get aggro).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Look, when I think about building a group for something, I have always looked at it this way:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;1) Warriors - needed for the heaviest encounters&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;2) Paladins - needed for group heals and backup rez&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;3) SKs - needed for pulling&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;That's the only distinction I, and anyone I have ever played with has made when choosing tanks (and lets be honest here, 9/10 times people are taking whatever tank in their GUILD that is available or sends them a tell first, not any particular kind).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The problem isn't the fact that the "tanking gap has been closed", the problem is that we have&amp;nbsp;not had CHALLENGING CONTENT for anyone that has even Plane of Time or Qvic level equipment (yeah, a few things may be a little challenging at that level, but seriously, the fact that its debatable at all is ridiculous).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Is the tanking gap closed? Do monks and rangers tank as well as us? They certainly seem to tank all the time in exp groups now. I don't think so. I think the gimp content has led to bunching all of us up at the top because we all have such high ac, have so many avoidance and mitigation aa, that the absolute scale of differences in how we tank means the differences are trivial.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I mean, seriously, if you have anguish gear, there is little reason for a knight to "need" to use a shield and shield block unless their 1h/2h weapon difference dictates it. Yeah, many use the 1h/shield because of all the ac and magelo padding, but seriously, from an efficiency standpoint knights should be using their 2.0/2,5 epics&amp;nbsp;99.9% of the time.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;You can talk about "closing the gap" all you want, but the fact of the matter is, guilds are not having knights main tank any serious raid bosses, regardless of how much more hp/ac they have (and with a shield equipped). because raid bosses are not gimp experience mobs, and they will splat knights, and I am not talking wholly about under defensive either. When we are light on warriors, I have been asked to tank in low end places like tacvi before (3400+ ac) and I still go splat 1/2 the time. Is it all DI(-1)? It shouldn't be, I don't know, but our warriors with 500 less ac than me and only a little more hp than me never seem to go splat at near that rate unless we are wiping to something.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I wish SoE would implement some serious single group challenging content with high exp yields and drops even raiders would want (augs and clickies if that's the only way they can justify useful items, or just put in some freaking occasional 350+ hp items for one slot per class or class/type as random zone wide drops maybe) that were not balanced for your average group, but were balanced for your freaking high end raiders.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Remember when GoD was new? And even people that had been in Time for a year before GoD came out wanted to do ikki trials and group in KT for augs and items? And it was hard. It was barely doable for those with lesser gear, but it was doable. People took warriors for groups that were camping named because they hit freaking hard (many of those named still hit harder than 90 of single group content that has come out since). They took paladins for backup rez and heals, they took sks for pulling. And knights *could* tank that stuff if they were geared up enough. I personally thought that was how it should be (if anyone can think of some other  make sks more desired, I'm all for it, I have always thought they got the short end of the stick outside of soloing, and soloing now isn't even that great for them like it used to be).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Right now, I feel like instead of the above, this is what people do when looking for a tank:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;1) Warrior - generic group&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;2) Paladin - fighting undead, heals&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;3) SK - can't find a puller&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;99% of content doesn't require a "puller" anymore. It just doesn't. And the content that really does, an SK is a poor choice particularly if they are the tank. Though maybe it doesn't matter when the ranger can tank the gimp content. Paladins had it good for a few months when people were camping illsilan and those undead DoD missions, but that advantage is fading quick as people move into new expansions with little undead. With no serious need for a defensive warrior, and no need for a puller specifically in most cases, I know I'd want a paladin (personally, I may be biased being one, and being more defensive oriented so I like having back up healers) due simply to the group heals, nothing else.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So I guess my question is, should we be asking for SoE to introduce some freaking challenging content (and yes, that means some people can't do it until they get equipped for it), or should we be asking for group-favorable abilities that make warriors, and sks to a lesser extent, preferred in certain content or in certain group class makeups?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I personally wish SoE would just add some seriously hard and rewarding content so that the actual differences in classes matters again and becomes apparent.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I know many want more gimmicks and more class "parity" in&amp;nbsp;non-tanking abilities though, so what do YOU (person reading this) want?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I'm not talking about taunt changes or aggro or endurance regen or itemization. Those problems are irrelevant to TANK balance, they are game mechanics problems that need fixes regardless. But so many people are complaining about tank balance in the group game, I'd like to know what people really want. Better content that scales to the differing abilities of classes, or more "parity" in non-tanking junk so that there is no difference between tanks at all.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Hmmm..what classes work well together in a duo set?...I personally have found that I work well with druids, ok with clerics and a shaman can make me a deity. Certain classes probably work better together than other classes.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;BB, all that stuff about presitge classes and the like is simply me stateing how i think things are going, or how&amp;nbsp;I precieve them to be going. That doesn't mean that's what's happeneing persay, I certainly don't have a hotline to any designer. If SoE is implamenting things more in the line of how I view the game that doesn't mean I am dictateing anything to them, just that my guesses where more astute than other peoples guesses.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;A weapon's quality is more than just its ratio.&amp;nbsp; The actual damage and actual delay plays a part.&amp;nbsp; Primary, Secondary and Tertiary stats all play a part.&amp;nbsp; For example a 9/19 6STR 6STA sword is theoretically of higher quality than a 13/26 no-stat sword.&amp;nbsp; Further, a 25/40 sword eventually loses out to the 9/19 sword at about level 48 if I recall.&amp;nbsp; That's why I don't object to swords like the GSoM, they may have similar ratios, but they're not in the same league as 2.0s for pure quality.</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;" paladins and shadowknights have had their taunt caps increased to match warriors "&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;Vindi is a 4 year old monstrosity that doesn't relate to current events, he doesn't hit any harder than a wos mob and I can solo those easily. The idea is ludicris. Old content is old contet, I can solo practically all of fear...so?...It's not built for level 70's...Vindi was designed for level 60 not powerhouse 70's.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;War gods don't care about thier warriors, they are all about war, they exist for the fight. You liveing or dieing &amp;nbsp;is purely up to the bean counters, the gods themselves don't give a stich. Paladins and SK's and Rangers are warriors who didn't like the war gods way of dealing things so alligned with gods who were more apt to reward service to thier cause with something more than just a rank in some afterlife army.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Heck, the Vikeing warrior's&amp;nbsp;went to the "great battle in the sky" where they fight all day and drink all night. Knights are&amp;nbsp;too reserved for that sort of "dumb jock" mentallity. In fact,&amp;nbsp;I suspect war gods themselves like knights. Without all the religious crusades they constantly launch, the number of wars would be severally reduced. War gods and knights have a symbiotic relationship. Knights luanch crusades, warriors fight them, war gods are happy.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;No knights means no crusades, thus unhappy war gods and out of work warriors.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Why shouldn't knights tank like warriors? They are warriors, spell casting warriors. Trying to make "hybrid" classes was silly anyway. Paladins aren't half warrior/ half cleric. That was a dumb notion to begin with, they are Paladins. Holy warriors who are granted spells by their diety as recompense for thier service. The paper game is pretty straight forward.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Paladin has same thaco, same attacks, same hitdice, same con bounus, same armor bonus, same armor types. The only difference is that warriors get weapon spec and paladins get spells, that's the basic crux of it. That and warriors get more feats than paladins do, but the spells balance it out really well and at epic levels they have all the feats they would need anyhow. Paladins are indeed tanks, very powerful tanks. The Blackguards are so evil that they give a neg 2 modifier to any one around them that can't be resisted.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;You can state the differences between EQ and D and D all day, but they are far more closely related than some of you want to admit. Knights are seriously closer to thier paper cousins than they have ever been.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;Paladin is a warrior class that favors good alignments with dietic favors,&amp;nbsp;Shadowknight is a warrior class that favors evil. Rangers are a warrior class based on druidic lore. Plain ol warriors are just that, plain ol generic warriors, dime a dozen. When one falls 10 takes thier place, cannon fodder, arrow catchers, groundpounders, grunts, jarheads, leathernecks.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Knights and rangers are basically prestige classes of warrior.&amp;nbsp;They are tank pluses because they are in fact warrior pluses.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;For me, my frustration is from a few areas, that could be fixed.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;In my guild, talking to my fellow Paladins &amp;amp; Shadowknights, they have stated that its almost impossible to get low on mana, chain aggroing.&amp;nbsp; Thats fine, i dont worry about that.&amp;nbsp; If their design allows them to do so, why would it matter to me.&amp;nbsp; What matters to me though, is that i spend much more mana (end) then they do, and have half the aggro produced vs end spent.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Knights have aggro tools =ing&amp;nbsp; 1) The same taunt (soon to be "fixed") 2) spell aggro (pretty much at will) 3) worn foci to raise their aggro when producing.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Warriors have a little less aggro then that.&amp;nbsp; 1) The same taunt (soon to be "fixed") 2) mock/bazu (requiring conservation 100% of the time) 3) worn foci to raise their aggro preduction. 4) weapon procs (which imho are being seriously gimped *SC and generic weaps, that dps are able to equip, and do)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I find the diff a bit larger then most.&amp;nbsp; On a tank switch (cyc and aetaunt) are very situational (in demi and por zones), and leaving taunt and mock (followed by bazu on the recycle)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;When talking to others, they explain that war have 4 ways to keep/get aggro.&amp;nbsp; And the arguement can be made that not one of them can be spammed, nor promised aggro.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I beleive, and its just an opinion that:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1) Mock and Bazu need to get split up&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;2) Bazu should have a (taunt modifier) on it, that randomly does exactly what taunt does (without failure)&amp;nbsp; ie. +1 over top aggro&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;3) End Regen (i am a huge advocate, that endurance is nothing but a weak form of mana) needs a huge Regen added asap ( OR ) costs reduced extremely, to equal a knights mana spent spam casting. *considering*&amp;nbsp; Mock/bazu is the warriors spell line, and therefore should equal that of casters spell chains.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;4)Reduce the amount of keys that a warrior must use, to do the most basic skills of the class (taunt).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I use 5 keys , just to produce aggro.&amp;nbsp; I could make hotkeys, but your pretty tied into the committment of using all them if you do that, i do not.&amp;nbsp; I like to burn what i need and save what i can (end - mana) is all about conserving, It takes me 35 min to recover a full end bar.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;5) PoR zones need to get fixed.&amp;nbsp; Broken or not, on the 2nd trash dog (i am a warrior that tanks trash, i like earning my dkp), i am OOE.&amp;nbsp; The drain dot is way too harsh, and without a recovery method (other then a death) which i am actually happy to get in POR at times, cuz its faster then regening from zero, its too much, and makes warriors almost useless (minus, taunt, and ae, and if your like me *vishes* shoulders)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I've been reading these posts, and OBV i dont post much.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;but&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I do NOT believe nerfing a class (knights) to fix another is smart.&amp;nbsp; I never will&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I do believe that End was poorly implimented, and in ways, broke warriors.&amp;nbsp; Before it, we had discs on a "little" longer timers, but didnt have double punishments via timer + end, but we did get the Incite lines.&amp;nbsp; SO its an opinion.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I do think that specific weaps should exsist.&amp;nbsp; Our class is "based" off gear, and weaps are a part of that&amp;nbsp; (i am totally against sony's current loot format = 3 loots, 1) caster, 2) all/all and 3 is junk, or more caster or last blood)&amp;nbsp; It should be at least 5 loots&amp;nbsp; 2 = caster, 2 = melee , 1 random of the 2, or all/all.&amp;nbsp; POR mobs for non DK drop 1 loot getting to the zone boss.&amp;nbsp; I find that insulting for the work you do.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Regen/Costs should be a top priority at the SONY HQ.&amp;nbsp; Its not a warrior only issue.&amp;nbsp; Any pure melee is feeling the pains of this&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I personally could care less about more dps vs a knight.&amp;nbsp; My goal when i play is A) living through the fight , and B) holding the aggro while doing it.&amp;nbsp; Nothing else matters to me.&amp;nbsp; Its nice to see my savage onslaught, but its dorfed by 11k to 20k crits by slaying undead.&amp;nbsp; I didnt plan on becomming a dps class.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I have other conserns, but this isnt the place to express them.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Anyways, thats my opinion, least i was fortunate to express it.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;The developers prolly have what they want in mind allready. Since the exspansions we get were developed over several months.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;BB, aside from maybe 200 chariots and the immortals, at least 80% of the Persian army were conscripts who had no desire to be there to begin with. They also depended on a central command figure ( the king) and when he retreated, the army lost morale and fell apart.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;Sigh.........BB....I don't care what Ali would do to Suger Ray.........The example&amp;nbsp;I was useing was Suger Ray vs random big dumb jock. We both know Suger would defeat big dumb. The Greeks defeated the Persians under Alexander because his army..while outnumbered 5 to one, where highly trained professionals and most of the persian troops were not. Classic case of little but well trained with high skill defeating a much larger unskilled foe.</description>

      <description>Sharbreena,&lt;br&gt;Actually, the Persians were &lt;u&gt;highly&lt;/u&gt; trained - some of the best mounted knights and charioteers in the ancient world. The Greeks however had Myrmidons (Warriors).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Back to the thread:&lt;br&gt;It ought to be abundantly clear that things being the way they are, the best path to improving the situation for Warriors is twofold:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. A range of content difficulty up to so hard to tank that a &lt;u&gt;best&lt;/u&gt; possible equipped non-raid Warrior (at this point full Grandmasters and the best non-raid augments and accessories available) is hard pressed to succeed using Evassive/Stonewall/Defensive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Such Warrior preferred content can't be on a flag progression path in all fairness. Nor can the mobs drop unique no possible alternative items (like the spells dropped in 68.3 or the augments dropped in RSS).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. Warriors to have &lt;u&gt;great&lt;/u&gt; flexability in weapon use. If necessary, weapons tailored to meet Warrior needs - Shieldmate weapons are the most readily apparent&amp;nbsp; instance of this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2Handed - greatest DPS and adequate aggro when using the Provoke line and Mock/Cyclone Blade (which must be put on the same timer).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;DW - high DPS and adequate aggro when using the Provoke line alone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sword and Board - highest passive defensive configuration. Adequate aggro when using the Provoke line and Mock/Cyclone Blade. High DPS (although lower than 2H and DW) when using resivised offensive disciplines (shorter refresh). Highest total defensive capability when combined with desfensive discipines.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What needed is:&lt;br&gt;A new weapon buff right clicky or two to upgrade SoTP/Aten's gloves. One for aggo and one for DPS that are mutally exclusive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mock on Cyclone Blade's timer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2H Bash or kick/slam upgraded to match the spell interrupting capability of bash.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apples or oranges, not ignorance. IF Warriors are to be "freed" from random aggro events as a developer stated when defending the entirely inappropriate Swiftcleave as our long anticipated real mainhand upgrade, then I expect procs like Lure of Ice, not another half-spatchedcocked retread of the venerable Y'Kesha proc with a new name and the same tired old doesn't stun and the pathectic DD doesn't stick.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Revision of offensive and defensive disciplines to give Warriors an offensive and defensive "stance" when used in combination with appropriate weapons, augments, and weapon buffs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And no more nonsence like WoT/DS that further enhances Knight downward scaling and soloing capability. They have nearly double the capability of Warirors right now versus all but the most difficult content.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These things aren't asking for godmode. They aren't even really asking for great Warrior superiority vs the hardest group content (if a top of the line &lt;u&gt;non-raiding&lt;/u&gt; Wariror can handle it, lower progression &lt;u&gt;raid&lt;/u&gt; Knights have 0 legitimate complaint). It's asking for a bone - an end to Warrior class neglect and stagnation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Though I agree with BB post and Lunarks to an extent, I think discussion implementation sometimes can be a good thing as long as it stays reasonable to some extent. After all it is brainstorming a bit and generally better ideas usually come out of that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Like BB said he wants to reinviison defensive and offensive discs. My idea for defensive at least it to break it down into 3 seperate discs with their own flexabilitys and penaltys. While chain will last as long as defensive now, but it would be set in stages.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stage one: The most flexable and mitagtion disc, but also the shortest duration with no penalty. Think somewhat along the lines of monk/beastlord discs. Not exactly the number I would think but in concept.&lt;br&gt;Stage two: Less flaxable and less mitagtion, but longer duration. Minor penalty.&lt;br&gt;Stage three: Even more less flexable and less mitagation, but even longer duration. More of a penalty.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over all this would make warrior defensive abiltiy more powerful, becuase stage 1 and 2 will more and likely greater then 45% and carry less penalty over a whole duration if a warrior chains these discs. It will also make the warrior more flexable in group content. The problem is it won't be as safe as to say push the button and wait the 3 minutes as defensive is now. It will make it more tricky in raid situations. Ideally I don't this wouldn't give warriors do much more defensive power in groups, but rather more flexability.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Make Aura of runes mod 400 proc, half the reuse time and endurance cost and maybe add an aggro component. *shrug*&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Offensively speaking. I do beleive there are some minor offensive discs on test that would be good to start on the leveling warrior and be to continue on up. &lt;a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4605&amp;amp;source=Live" target=_blank&gt;Slice being on them.&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; It helps with maintaint aggro if adjusted right and is made flexable....a substaining disc if you will. You guys got a lot of very fleable discs on test right now that if twicked and balanced well could give a lot of flexability to the class, specially once they get the whole out of combat stuff around. *shrug*&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hard to really approach DPS discs for a warrior really because if a warrior is just trying to DPS, he normally isn't going to try to get aggro. I think this is is what difficult about warrior DPS to some extent. Warriors have no control on their aggro, specially if they don't want it. Maybe if they actually, I know is strange, had a detaunt&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now if you are talking about just stances like the suggestion of druids stances.....well they haven't really even but such things on test or anything yet, so good luck on that one. Though I figure such just basic stances system be more fit for the ranger class, but that is just me *shrug*&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

      <description>I believe Slice is one of the capabilities from the Special Openings System that was abandoned since SoE believed it to be awkward.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If such a system came into being and the "prompts" that you could use an ability appeared in the form of text messages ala "Mayong Mistmore looks VULNERABLE", I agree it would be pretty horrible. I have to read enough battle spam watching for import stuff now and sending things to various windows only helps so much.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If such a message appeared accompianed by an ability button ungraying, so long as the window of opprotunity was not at true twich speed (1 second), it would work fine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But if you get right down to it, as others mentioned recently in this thread, many of the more solid ideas om this general area went to make the Berserker class.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And sadly the more reasonably powerful capabilities like Defensive, Fortitude, and shield use are either at-will slow refresh or passive happening all the time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The best we can expect is upgrading Warrior kick/slam/bash to produce a high damage Stunning Blow that has it's greatest impact when a mob is casting a slow spell like Gate or CH.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Something like Skepicism (making this up on the spot) that provides a short duration 25% Spell Shield for you or your group (since as we know, - not being spellcasters, Warriors have some natural immunity to magic. Ya don't believe that fireball is anything other than illusion, it effects you less) is much much more likely to end up in the Berserker repitoire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>The main problem with the openign system it was too twitchy and being that we get a lot of our information from spam of text and visual ques in EQ1 are a little hard to program in with the wide variety of graphical customization such as old/new models, Pixel shaders and etc in such an old system. I don't think it would have worked that well to begin with. Not to mention the over all AI on NPC's to adjust to it....it would have been a far to much of an undertaking. Course at the time the combat system didn't need much of a real over all, just some minor adjustments. It works well in eq2 because it has a system based around it....so it works well there. I jsut don't think it would have worked totally well here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Though most of the abilities behind it I don't think are that harsh to implement into todays combat system....makign it more of a player choice when to use an abiltie allows more free room to move and adjust to ones own style. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I also don't think brainstorming will result much into zerkers getting much more from the warrior idea threads. Zerkers have gotten more of their own identity and abilties now. The problem with both beastlords and zerkers is that I don't think they were really defined when they came in on what they were able to do. DPS was mainly it....sort of short on what the classes do now. The have defined role now so most thing I don't think will be past around to them. I think you can expect better.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;also the slow abilties you mention is partially the revamp on defensive discs I mentioned. Stage 1 and 2 being the more optimal ones to use on group content. 1 being the most extremely flexable of abilties. Course the hinderance would be endurance unless they get the out of combat regen adjusted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

      <description>I won't pretend to know implimentation details, BUT.....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Such a system does not have to be as complicated as Call of Challange, an ability that has a chance of working if the mobs is fleeing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All that "needs" to happen is a "Special Openings" random spin every combat round that an opening is not currently active. For example intOpening=getRandom(100)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;if(intOpening&amp;gt;10 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; intOpening&amp;lt;15) then {&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; if (vulnerableTo ThisKindof Attack(mob[Targeted]) == TRUE) {&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; plyrOpening=constSlice&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; tmrOpening=constTwoSeconds&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ungray(btnSlice)&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; displayMessage("You see an opprotunity to cut ", mobName[mob[Targeted]], "'s", bodyPart[getRandom(constNbrOfBodyParts)]&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; }&lt;br&gt;}&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Overly simplified no doubt, but there need not be any mob attribute beyond vulnerability and nothing in the mob AI whatsoever. The &lt;u&gt;appearance&lt;/u&gt; that mobs "create" vulnerabilities doesn't require that they actually create them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's kinda like WoW's Rage system in that the burden is all in the player's methods and attributes, not necessarily the mob's.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>"EQ is not SoulCaliber or Doom. We don't manuver, look for openings,&#xD;
etc. It has never been a "skill game", at most it's been a pay&#xD;
attention game. (Mayong Mistmore looks VUNERABLE)."&lt;br&gt;- Battleblade&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;I don't know what to tell you. That's just wrong. Getting your whole raid to watch for an emote is challenging sure, but that's not why I play the game. On that note, knights are one of a couple classes that are really more skill-intensive in a lot of parts of the game than others.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
