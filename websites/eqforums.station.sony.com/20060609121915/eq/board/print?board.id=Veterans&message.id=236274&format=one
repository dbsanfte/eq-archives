And if a tank actually needs to group to kill the vast majority of races' DoN masters ingridient stuff and they are just doing it for skillups, they suck. Period. There's a large difference b/w Deep trash and Ssraeshza trash and the crap in Veeshan's Peak. The only ones that even compare are the ones that need Storm Volaas Hair, which hit harder than any other races' mobs and have a **SMURF**ty drop rate and need two to make a single swatch. A person wanting this stuff for skill ups for the other races should easily be able to tank the mobs required for it other than those requiring Storm Volaas Hair and Great Reptile bits.
