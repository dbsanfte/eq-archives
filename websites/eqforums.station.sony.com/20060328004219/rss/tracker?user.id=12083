      <description>I read through that link in the previous message. Kind of wish they would have had a non-test person there for their input.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I would never move to test. I am in the #1 guild on my server, and I would want my entire guild there with me. No way they would ever all move to the test server. Double xp full time? No thanks. Risk (even how remote) of a character wipe at any time? No thanks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The argument of &amp;quot;Well, if main servers can copy or move to test, then test people should be able to copy or move to live.&amp;quot;. Again, big no. Test server has advantages the alpha servers do not. Have you read the threads about people wanting double xp full time now instead of on special occasions? Imagine the uproar of people making it to production servers that had the double xp full time, and buffing commands to get them leveled. Never going to happen, not an option.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It all comes down to 1 thing. It's very simple. Do you need more people testing on Test? If not, ignore this entire thread like it never happened. If you do, then to get us high end players there, you need to make it hassle free. We have commitments on our production servers, so if you want us to give testing some time, let us copy there. There is no way I am going to testbuff to level 25, then level myself to 70 (even with the double xp), then try to find a guild, etc etc, so I can test content for you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;And yeah, you may get people copying to test server, then not doing much testing. You know what though? You would get more people on test testing some things. If you don't allow copying the only guarantee I will give you is that you'll get very little or no additional testing done from the high end community.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Up to you though. &lt;span&gt;:smileywink:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

      <description>Getting a character copied to the test server itself might not be enough. When I have played on test server, I have wanted to test the high end content. Oh sure, may be a new spell I can test, or a new aa, but what if I want to test the high end content? Well, now I need a guild. Do I use a guild on the server? (Not sure how they work. Still app periods and all?) Do I try to convince my live server guild to transfer with me and set some time aside to fit in raid on test server with our regular live server raids?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Personally, there have been times on the test server where I really wanted to help test that level 70 aa, or spell, but the buff command would get me to 20 and expect me to dedicate my own time to level to 70. Just not going to happen. Too many commitments on my main server to grind 50 levels so I can test a new aa.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;That is the reason I would want my main copied there. Or at least let us get ourself to 70 via a command. I pretty much want to test what my main would be using. In order to do that, I need to be at my mains level on test.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I guess if you have a full server population playing 24/7 on the test server, then you are gtg. If you need more people to be there testing, then throw us a bone. Make it easier for us high end players to help you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

      <description>I think in Dark Ages of Camelot they have a unique fix to this. If there is a mob needed for a quest or task, and more than 1 person shows up to kill it, the mob drops enough quest pieces for everyone that was there that needed it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;That wouldn't help on all camps of course. Some are simply there for loot. But even for Quillmane, enough cloaks would drop for the people there (mages) that needed them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They would likely have to cap that at something though. No more than 5 dropping per kill.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

      <description>I've made the argument that mains should be able to get copied to test. There is NO way I am going to level a toon on test to 70 just to test things out. I spend too much time on my main server with raids and things to use all the rest of my avail time to level a toon on Test. Test only allows you to buff to level 20 right?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If they let me copy my main there, I would actually use the test server.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>I am maxed aa's with 30 saved (1491). Max into level 70. Have all group leader aa's and 8 saved.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have to tell you, all double xp is going to get you is to the point I am at, and you know what? It sucks. I log in for raids now and that's about it, because there is no point in xp for me anymore.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was really hoping this expansion would add aa's so I would have something to do again. Nope. So I need to wait for the next exmapsion before xp means anything to me anymore.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So be careful what you ask for. You might just get it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;You know what needs to happen? Just to clue people in a little bit and give them some perspective? Have a few days of how EQ used to be.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When I see people asking for and Arcstone portal from the Guildhall, I just have to shake my head.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Are these people just new to the game, where PoK was always there?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here is how Velious went guys for those of you too new to know:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warrior_01 shouts, &amp;quot;Could I get a port to great divide please?&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;Wizard_01 tells Warrior_01, &amp;quot;Sure. Do you have your key from there?&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;Warrior_01 tells Wizard_01, &amp;quot;Ummm, key? What key?&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;Wizard_01 tells Warrior_01, &amp;quot;Well, you need to pick up a key off that ground at that portal first before I can port you there.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;Warrior_01 tells Wizard_01, &amp;quot;Ugh. So how do I do that?&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;Wizard_01 tells Warrior_01, &amp;quot;Well, you'll need to run there to get the key off the ground. Then in the future you can be ported.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That was the same for Cobalt Scar as well and others. Couldn't even get ported there until you had the drop from that portal area. I still have those drops on one of my toons.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So for CS, it meant North Ro onto boat for IceClad. Another boat from that IceClad island to the docks. With boats, if they were even working for you, you have a nice long journey to wait. Run through Iceclad to the bridge for Eastern Wastes. Run through EW for Kael. Run through Kael for Awakening Land. Through Awakening Land (watch out for the dragon, he sees invis) to SkyShrine. Once in Skyshrine, do you have the key to get into CS? No, Hmmm. Better see if a guildie does and can come let you into Cobalt Scar. Once in Cobalt scar, pick up the drop. NOW you can be ported there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yup, put eq back to the way it was for a few days. Spell books in face until level 35. Old UI. Clicking into the Bazaar puts you at shady in East Commonlands. No linking, so get ready to set up those hotkeys with all stats in them. No more happy porting from PoK with the stones, no more guildhall with ports to places. The most uber porting thing you hve besides druid and wizards is in Timorous Deep. The pot room with some clicky port things there. Watch out for the dragon that wanders close though. And forget about binding at those pots. Bind won't work there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then after a few days of that, ask if anyone really needs to have an Arcstone portal from the guild hall.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just my perspective..&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Edited: We Don't need an Arcstone portal. If you can't tell the magus, &amp;quot;North Ro&amp;quot;, zone into Freeport and click; if that is just too much work, then you might not want to see what the actual expansion progression tasks look like.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by NeinLyves on &lt;span class="date_text"&gt;03-21-2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;09:42 AM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Well, actually, the reason for the crashes is because of the xp weekend. First thing people do is grab instances to grind xp. That puts too much load on the instance servers, and everyone suffers. Same thing happened last time there was a double xp thing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nest missions rock with double xp + xp potion or aa.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when everyone is doing it...... *BOOM*&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>I crashed again in there last night. Got a coh to AM area, killed him and all that. Then I went to the seperating wall and looked through to the other side (was shrunk), and hang. Needed to be remove from the mission so I would pop outside of zone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The fact that it happens to some and not all people is interesting. If it happened to all, you could point a finger at possible backface culling in that area all awry and too many polygons flooding the graphics engine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since it only happens to some though, it must be a driver issue of some kind. I've done complete file checks so I have the same files everyone else does. That rules out the geometry files.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Perhaps some diagnostics for this area could be dumped to a debug file.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We all get that box that says, &amp;quot;The EQ client has crash. Would you like to send your information to SoE?&amp;quot;. I always reply Yes, but is that doing any good? If not, let's get more debug information in that report so it can be tracked down.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We can rule out things like aura effects because this was happening before all the new stuff showed up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

      <description>Mining pick is correct. Same clue in Thurgadin one and I completed it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
