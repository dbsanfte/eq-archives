    <description>&lt;DIV&gt;It has come to our attention that some users may have received an email indicating that your email account has been or may be suspended. These emails may also include attachments. I just wanted to inform you that these emails did not come from us, and would recommend against opening any attachments you may have received as part of the email.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
