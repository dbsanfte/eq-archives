<DIV>The task does not update when you hail him. Ceridan waves at you when you hail him, but does not say anything.</DIV>

<P>I was also able to run through this task successfully on Test as well.&nbsp; If anyone is still running into this issue can you let me know what class you're playing?</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>This can happen if you dont go into the bank with him (ie if you hail him over the counter) It seems to block the ability of hails to work properly on occasion. Try getting on the counter or going in with him before hailing.</P></DIV>
