				<DIV>I received this task at lvl 51 from the task master that is almost direct straight into DL from the cave entrance of Firiona Vie.&nbsp; The task is called "Keeping Order" and the second to last step I am trying to complete appears to be broken.&nbsp; The step is to explore the entrance of the cave in Firiona Vie that leads to the dreadlands.&nbsp; It says, "As one last ditch effort you should explore the entrance to make sure that there is nothing of value there."&nbsp; Not only have I waited for possible ground spawn or an&nbsp;NPC that needs to be hailed, I have explored the entire cave structure.&nbsp; I have petitioned this twice and have received no help from the GMs.&nbsp; After spending 2 hours working on this quest I would like to be able to complete it.&nbsp; Any help that can be given would be greatly appreciated.</DIV>

				<DIV>Task is called Drolvargs and Drachnids, I received it as a 53 cleric, It is a long quest, I've pretty much completed it, and am on the second to last step. It asks me to explore the ruins in the center of the forest of the firiona vie zone. I have explored every set of ruins in the zone at least twice, and some three times. I had a similar problem with a task involving Karnor's Castle, but I can't remember the name of it. Just wanted to ask if anyone else is having a problem getting the confirmation that you've explored the spot in firiona vie zone. Hopefully when i log in tomorrow it will let it confirm but if it doesn't that's alot of work, these long tasks do take a long time when your doing them solo, to just abandon since it won't complete.</DIV>

<DIV>anyways, find a walkthrough on a board somewhere, went through every step in order, and got</DIV>
<DIV>the message at every stage, completed task showed on screen, and went on to the next mini task, 6 in all. After completion,</DIV>
<DIV>get message task was complete, then some lore about a dragon, task "Journey of Yar'Lir",&nbsp; no longer on task list,</DIV>
<DIV>so I'd assume its complete. Recieved no exp, coin, loot, faction, no notta! Made sure to have logging on,</DIV>
<DIV>so checked afterwards, and definately no reward at all for the task.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Does this qualify as broken, or just a lousy task, no idea; if it's not broken see no reason for anyone</DIV>

				Some of the level 10ish tasks from Qeynos send you to Everfrost to kill giant woolly spiders.  But all the giant woolly spiders get stuck under the world along the edges of the river.  So it's very unlikely that the average newb could ever find any to kill.

				The "Nok, Nok Who's Powder" task (obtained at level 32 from one of the Iksar task masters in the Swamp of No Hope) contains this same direction as its next-to-last step. The directions say, "explore the ENTRANCE . . .," but I've been through every inch of that tunnel complex--and all three of its "entrances" (FV, PoK, and DL) many times over, with no luck. As there's only one cave in Firiona Vie that "leads to the Dreadlands," it's probably a safe bet that this one's broken.<br><br>NOTE: The directions in my task included a reference (hint?) about learning much from "the faces of the wild." So, I turned my attention to the two statues at the FV entrance . . . clicked them, tried climbing them, cursed at them, etc. Nothing. And thinking that maybe the task writers were playing fast and loose with the word "entrance," I backed up and investigated the many stones in that area (some of which seem to have runes or designs on them), hoping to find a friendly(?) face. Still nothing. Except multiple butt-kickings, courtesy of the local drachnids.<br><br>Merely FYI,<br>Ras

<P>I saw Ashlanne's recent <A href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Quests&amp;message.id=652" target=_blank>Quest issue list </A>post and noticed the list of broken tasks.&nbsp; I realized I hadn't addressed or updated everyone on all of the fixes and findings regarding these, so here goes.</P>
<P>
<HR>

<P></P>
<P>The following tasks are believed broken. Please see the seperate Broken Tasks forum for details. (Some might be fixed now, but it doesn't say so!)</P>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Lost in Petrification </STRONG>- Kill 10 sathirian protectors in DL.&nbsp; No such mob exists. </LI></UL>
<P>
<HR>

<P>This may have been fixed before I had a chance to look at it.&nbsp; When I checked on this task the only kill requirements I found were killing 10 petrifier cockatrices and killing 10 stonegazer cockatrices.&nbsp; If anyone runs into this issue again or if they currently have a task with this issue, please let us know.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>

<LI><STRONG>Whirling Dervish</STRONG>, a short task.&nbsp;- Explore the iksar tower on the north-east island of Timorous Deep. Task does not update.&nbsp; 
<HR>
</LI>
<P>I just attempted this task on a live server today and it updated correctly for me.&nbsp; Is this still an issue?&nbsp; If so, can you give me the /loc that you are at when you are expecting the task to update?</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>

<LI><STRONG>Wooly Adventures </STRONG>- There is no blue compass line directing you to Droganoth Hrothgar in Everfrost Peaks. 
<HR>
</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This was another task I ran through on a live server and the blue line appeared on my compass after I had completed the first two sections of the task.&nbsp; Is anyone still having this problem?</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>

<LI><STRONG>Scary Caves&nbsp;from Dreadlands </STRONG>- It says to explore the courtyard on the left just inside the castle. But it doesn't trigger unless you go to the courtyard on the right just inside the castle.&nbsp; 
<HR>
</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr **SMURF**"MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P>This has been corrected on Test and now reads, "explore the courtyard on the right just inside the castle."&nbsp; This should be fixed on live servers with the next update.<BR></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>

<LI><STRONG>Keeping Order </STRONG>- Exploring the entrance of the cave in Firiona Vie that leads to the dreadlands doesn't update the task. 
<HR>
</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr **SMURF**"MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P>This task and all others involving exploring sections of Firiona Vie should be working correctly.&nbsp; The fix I mentioned earlier about those tasks not updating was included in the previous update.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>

<LI><STRONG>Keeping The Goblins Out from Lavastorm </STRONG>- The task does not update when you loot&nbsp;Cinder Goblin Toes. 
<HR>
</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr **SMURF**"MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P>As Gordish mentioned this task is now updating properly, but I will look into the issue brought up about it's completion text.<BR></P>
<P>
<HR>

<P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI><STRONG>Drolvargs and Drachnids </STRONG>- Exploring the ruins in the center of the forest of the firiona vie zone doesn't update the task. 
<HR>
</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<DIV>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr>
<P>As with the Keeping Order task this task should be working correctly now as well.</P>
<P>Since it didn't get included in Ashlanne's post I also wanted to mention that the Nok, Nok Who's Powder task was also fixed.&nbsp; </P>
<P>If any of these tasks are still having trouble or if there are new issues you come across, please continue to let us know.</P>

<DIV>On another note, if anyone runs across a task master that is not offering them any tasks, and is not directing you to other task masters, please let me know the name of the task master, the zone they are in, and the level and class of the character you were playing when you found them.&nbsp; I'm currently looking through them to make sure you will always either have tasks offered to you, or will be directed to other task masters.</DIV>

<DIV>Step One:&nbsp; Explore the bar deep on the first level of Old Sebilis</DIV>
<DIV>Step Two:&nbsp; Explore the mystical orb leading to the ruins of Old Sebilis</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Ok, now that is just silly.&nbsp; Since you have to "explore the orb" to get into sebilis in the first place, why the bloody .... should you have to go back to it again after going to the bar?&nbsp; I suppose its no big problem for non-gaters, since that is the way out anyway, but still seems senseless to me.</DIV>
