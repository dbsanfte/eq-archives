				If I was going to take a wild guess at the mob (which I wouldn't, given that all the tasks I have seen give exact mob names), I'd go looking for a drolvarg guard, or something of that ilk.  Based on the theory that Karnors is on VS faction, so drolvargs might be described as "Sathirian".

<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>After all the talk about looking for gold and maps...the first step basically says to explore the iksar tower on the north-east island of Timorous Deep.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I did this.&nbsp; Over and over.&nbsp; I tried all the other huts/ruins/towers on the other islands around even though they could not be thought of as north-east and any way at all.&nbsp; NONE of them updated my task and moved me on.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I appealed in game and got back the message to try these boards.&nbsp; I did and no-one could help so I reported it as a bug and have heard nothing since.&nbsp; I keep meaning to go back to the Timorous Deep to see if my next step updates but have not got round to doing it yet.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>So, watch out if you want to try this task.</DIV>

<DIV>Have you double-checked your task to make sure you read it right?&nbsp; Is one of the problems I sometimes have that I read the descriptions and then jump into conclusions and only then notice I was sent to another zone or something.&nbsp; No chance that you need to go see Aviaks in Lake Rathe or anything?</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Alt Q to bring up the task menu again, the name of the task will also be there.&nbsp; To be really useful to the developers they would need to know the name of the task and your level and class when you got it.&nbsp; Sometimes the name is used multiple times, other tasks share common parts.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Some tasks are broken.&nbsp; Kharl took down some information yesterday on one where he had to deliver lake pebbles to an npc in Felwithe.&nbsp; There was no line on his compass.&nbsp; I checked his task menu and yes, he was at the right place at the right stage.&nbsp; We looked through pretty much every inch and cranny (ok, I did not check under the water) AND tracked both felwithe zones and couldn't find the NPC.&nbsp; Don't know if it has always been bugged or maybe the NPC was forgotten after the zone repop from the recent FV quests.</DIV>
<DIV><BR>I've also had problems with turn in mobs in Hollowshade not being there.&nbsp; Haven't tried one of those tasks lately but probably will this week.</DIV>

				I'm doing the Wooly Adventures task from the guard in the Halas bank. First two stages are kill 10 giant wooly spiders and loot 4 spider silk, which I have completed no plroblem with my 11 shaman. Then I am supposed to hand them in to Droganoth Hrothgar in Everfrost Peake, but no blue line on my compass. I bugged it and then ran to the NPC at the mammoth ramp, but she isn't the right person. I'm going to get hubby to bring out his ranger later, but for now, I'm going to have to camp on this one. Everfrost Peaks is a bit too dangerous for me to be running around aimlessly.

				I did the Scary Caves task at level 66 from Dreadlands.  It says to explore the courtyard on the left just inside the castle.  But it doesn't trigger unless you go to the courtyard on the right just inside the castle.

				I have been trying some tasks this morning. Every one I tried from Butcherblock sent me to Castle Mistmoore, which is now way too high for my level (42). I am about to go to The Rathe Mountains and try to get some for Tainted Paw and see if the same problem exists there. I am going to try to kill the correct type of mob in South karana and see if I can be given credit for them (I'm doubtful).

				At level 16 I got the medium task Merchant Protection in East Commonlands.  After a bunch of killing and stuff the FINAL step is to talk to Clorka Swampera in Innothule Swamp.  The compass line points to Clorka properly, and I can hail her.  But when I do, she just says she's waiting for someone important and I don't get credit for finishing the task.
