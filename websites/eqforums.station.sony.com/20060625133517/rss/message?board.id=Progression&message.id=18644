&lt;P&gt;I'd vote for reverting the city guards back.&amp;nbsp; I have a feeling that this server is going to be pretty crowded, at least or the first few months, and we're going to need as many exp spots as possible available.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The original reasoning on making the guards unattractive targets was to make sure that they were available to newbie characters.&amp;nbsp; But for this server, there's going to be very few actual newbies to the game.&amp;nbsp; The majority of people being attracted to this server are people wishing to relive how EQ use to be, or to experience content that they missed.&amp;nbsp; Also there's most likely not going to be a tutorial, and it's a "specialty" server, so there's no real need to have extra hand holding here for newbie players.&amp;nbsp; This server is going to be a harsher environment than the average server (at least at the start) like the PvP servers were.&amp;nbsp; And that should be expected by everyone trying it out.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Also, from what I remember, I usually felt much safer when there were people camping the guards.&amp;nbsp; They usually offered more help than the guards.&amp;nbsp; And many times you'd find yourself with unasked for buffs and heals.&amp;nbsp; It was great.&amp;nbsp; In fact, it probably did more good for newbies than anything else because it immersed you in the social aspect of the game right from the start&amp;nbsp; -- you start interacting with actual players and can ask them for help, etc.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Occasionally there were cases when you'd run to the guards and they were killed, and the person there wasn't very friendly and wouldn't help you, and you'd end up having to run to the zone, and some times you'd end up dead because of it.&amp;nbsp; But those instances were few and far between.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It was by far more of a boon the have higher lvl players hanging out hanging out there than not.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;So particularly for this server, I see no reason whatsoever why the guards shouldn't be reverted back to their old state.&amp;nbsp; Some have stated in this thread that they thought they were easy money because they could be kited.&amp;nbsp; But this doesn't make much sense because what about hill giants?&amp;nbsp; Should we remove them too, because they actually have poorer MR than guards, and there's ever greater room in Rathe Mnts to kite them around.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;But if money from them is viewed as such a problem, go ahead and leave them without coins, but give them back their old resists, HP levels, and exp.&amp;nbsp; That way they wouldn't be quite as desirable.&amp;nbsp; People would mainly just use them if they needed an exp camp.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;But I'd say revert them back to the way they were, coinage and all.&amp;nbsp; They really didn't have anymore than the usual mob their lvl.&amp;nbsp; And low level players got a chance to loot FS weps and what-have-you.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I say revert them back, it can only help this server.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <title>City NPC's MUST be reverted back.</title>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;City NPC's and City Guards were a huge part of leveling back when there were only the original zones. Many people, including myself, spent a good majority of their time in cities/outside cities killing guards/npc's to level, be it solo, duo or even a full group. Not only was it fun to be doing something different than a dungeon, it was cool to chose a faction to destroy/raise and it totally immersified the feeling of the game. Being able to control whatever you attack/kill in original Everquest was what made it so great. Now alot of guards/npc's you can't even attack, and if you can, the experience is a fraction of what it used to be. It was nerfed a while back to make killing city npc/guards practically worthless. Some of them even dissapear on death with no corpse such as merchants do. There simply is not enough content in original for the sheer mass of interest this server has shown without the ability to kill city npc/guards like you used to. The reason players resorted to city npc/guards in the first place way back in original, was becuase many other places were full/camped and they could not get a group. This is going to happen all over again, except we won't have city guards/npc's anymore. It was a terrible decision to change city guard/npc's over and over throughout the years, to arrive at a point we are at now, where it is pointless to attack them. It completely ruins the immersion, and now it will do alot worse.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Certain things are understandable, such as the change that was made to city guards that are right outside the front of a city. They were buffed up and made extremely hard to kill. That is fine, we need those guards to protect lower levels. However inside &amp;amp; further outside cities is a different story. These guards/npc's need to be attackable and need to yield the same experience they used to, instead of 1/10th a light blue kill.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;An example are the Dwarf Citizens in Butcherblock Mountains. Extremely popular for druids back in the day. There are about 5 different camps of these citizens, and almost every class could be seen here and there camping them. Now, you cannot even attack them whatsoever.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Another example are the bards around freeport, some instantly dissapear upon death now and yield no experience, while others just give 1/10th a light blue kill.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Mechanics in Akanon.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Freeport guards.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Ogre guards.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Barbarian guards.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Gnomes in steamfont/lesser fay.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Gnome guards in steamfont.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Etc. etc. These experience locations are all now ruined, and worthless. These spots and many more represent a huge fraction of the world that we are a part of. Removing these/making them useless is stupid. It not only ruins immersion but steals content away from us.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Revert all city/guard npc's save for the entrance guards back to the way they were before any changes happened!&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>If you guys have been around for a while camps are not recongnized by&#xD;
guides, or GM's in the game. The reason that camps worked is that other&#xD;
players respected each other enought to allow them to have an area or a&#xD;
mob to themselves. If another group or person moved into an area and&#xD;
started killing, there is really nothing that anyone can do about it&#xD;
except maybe yell in the zone that such and such is a camp stealer and&#xD;
hope that they get black listed.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Starting zones will honestly be the SUCK when the server goes live.&#xD;
Unless they are going to put infinite mobs to kill in the starting&#xD;
zones, grinding will be horrbile. The game is called everQUEST. If they&#xD;
put more quests in the game that yielded xp that did not always involve&#xD;
killing or if it did that mob was untouchable by anyone that is not on&#xD;
the quest, I believe that would help a LOT with the overcrowding of&#xD;
zones and areas. I understand that this may have not been the way the&#xD;
game was originally played but after 10 years they know for the&#xD;
millions of posts the things that DID NOT work well in with the&#xD;
original game and should hope to fix them so that if they had a chance&#xD;
to do it all agian, they would impliment those changes.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Trust me I am all for the nostalgia of starting the game that kept me&#xD;
up a many nights. What I do not want is to see the same exact problems&#xD;
that were around with the original game rehashed such as rangers being&#xD;
horrible tanks, and rogues having problems with losing agro and 1 point&#xD;
backstabs, pallies and sk's unable to hold agro and druids/wizards&#xD;
being the gods of soloing. I really think that the reason that WoW has&#xD;
been and continues to be so sucessful is that instances are the answer&#xD;
to dungeon overcrowding. Instead of camping the FBSS, make an instance&#xD;
where you have to&amp;nbsp; work through the dungeon to get to the mob that&#xD;
drops it and then defeat it.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
I know that is not the ORIGINAL vision of the game&amp;nbsp; they keep&#xD;
telling us this will not be EQ CLASSIC. The fixed issues are supposedly&#xD;
staying fixed. So to me, it seems that it is counter-productive to put&#xD;
out a server and doing the same exact things that ended up causing the&#xD;
drop off the the subscriptions towards the release of the next gen&#xD;
games. Trust me the novelty will wear off quickly as people realize&#xD;
that they were just suckered into coming back into a world that really&#xD;
doesnt&amp;nbsp; offer anything more that what they had paid for and quit&#xD;
the game for in the first place.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;The argument that there will be no "true" newbies doesn't hold up. When you are starting out with a non-twinked character and are forced to play it old school, I don't care how long you have been playing the game, your hp is going to suck, your mana is going to suck, your dps is going to suck, your weapons and armor are going to suck, and you WILL be killed by moss snakes, large rats and decaying skeletons at level 1. Without the guards to run to, you will suffer many needless deaths and much frustration and you will soon be cursing the person who came along and killed every guard&amp;nbsp;in the zone. &lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;What I meant by there being few true newbies attracted to this 'specialty' server, is the mindset.&amp;nbsp; Sure we'll have nothing but 2 ac guild tunics and starting newbie weps which are actually worse than rusty, but are WE going to get frustrated if we find the guards gone?&amp;nbsp; We know we're just going to respawn 5 inches away with our wep in hand and spells pre-memed.&amp;nbsp; Not much frustration there -- heck, newbie deaths are free heals!&amp;nbsp; Most experienced players just fight till their hps go completely down so they can get the free heal.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Also, I'm speaking from my experience when I first started out, and from what I've seen since then.&amp;nbsp; It was only very rare cases where the person or group camping the guards didn't help, and didn't help four-fold as compared to what assistance the guards offer.&amp;nbsp; I also remember being very excited being told that I could loot FS weps, and sometimes the coins.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I'm being totally honest here.&amp;nbsp; I feel my first impressions of the game were vastly improved by other people hunting the guards!&amp;nbsp; I was excited to gain a nice starting FS weapon, and some spending money from many players telling me that I could loot the guards.&amp;nbsp; I was also very happy to receive buffs and heals instead of kill steals from the guards.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;It made the game instantly exciting for me, and it also made me dream -- when I get older, one day I'll be able to take on guards too!&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;So let's say my reasoning is wrong, and that there will be massive amounts of first time EQ players attracted to the server.&amp;nbsp; Campable guards will be a blessing for them, as it always has been 9 out of 10 times for every other newbie.&amp;nbsp; I pray that the guards are camped when I start!&amp;nbsp; :smileyvery-happy:&amp;nbsp; Please punish me with that!&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Nobody, and I mean nobody, will be able to kill the city entrance guards that exist in EQ today, that is, with only level 50. Nobody cares if those stay the same, they need to protect newbies.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;I DID read your original post, and newbies don't always confine themselves to the entrance of the cities. What about the guards that used to be on the bridge in Nektulos Forest? How about the ones that used to be at the crossroads in BBM? Or at the wall in Misty Thicket? Low level players xp'ing in those places need the guards to be there as well because the city entrance or the zoneline may be too far away for them to get to before they are killed. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Killing certain NPC other than guards, like the dwarves near the docks in BBM, I don't mind so much, UNLESS the NPC is a quest NPC and your permacamping it is preventing me from finishing a quest or acquiring a quest item that can't be obtained in any other way. A person camping a quest NPC, should be courteous enough to stand aside when someone comes along who needs that NPC for a turn in or a dropped item instead of telling them "It's mine, go away" as many do. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Vegeta-X on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;06-10-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;03:31 PM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;I stopped reading when people got whiny about guards.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Listen... the point of EQ is that it is an RPG. I don't want to kill guards, but maybe you do. EQ has choices and that's why it's fun. And who's to say that guards are not intended to be killed? I joined EQ as a darkelf and I found it quite enjoyable to kill human guards in Qeynos. I even snuck past the GMs that couldn't be killed and killed stuff inside the city. I would consider that killing stuff that was intended to be killed. Evil kills good. Good kills evil. Welcome to imagination.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Heh heh, I remember back in the day I used to frequently find trolls just INSIDE Felwithe near the bridge single pulling the guards. I used to defend my High Elf cousins with my ranger by running around Sowed pulling every guard and NPC I could get aggro from back to the zoneline where the trolls were hanging out. It was funny as heck, some of the nasty tells I used to get from them (after they respawned at their bind, of course). :-D&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Actually, such activities are considered against the PNP, and would be addressed by GM's had they observed it occuring. We aren't supposed to train people, even if we don't like their chosen NPC targets. I have been such an ogre, though I normally play an elf, and I just don't understand why it would matter to anyone who is killing which NPC; unless it is a contested spawn.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;But training people cannot be justified by saying you are&amp;nbsp;role playing. That has been said by many GM's.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>If they wanted to let people RP that, they chould just add in a basic&#xD;
quest that lets you "raise the alarm"&amp;nbsp; and get the guards to&#xD;
follow you briefly.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;The only problem I have with killing guards is that if they do away with tutorial on this new server, you are going to have a lot of low levels running to the guards for help when they get an unexpected add or something they attack turns out to be more than they can handle. A lot of these players will suffer many needless deaths because the guards who are supposed to be there to protect them from being overwhelmed at an early age won't be there because someone came along and killed them for xp, loot, or whatever. Having specific, named guards there to be killed for quests, loot or xp, is good, but killing every generic guard that comes wandering by isn't, because you may be frustrating a true noob to the game who may then quit because he got killed 10 times in a row because there was no guard to save him. The game needs new players to survive, so they need a certain amount of sheltering through the early levels and this holds particularly true on a new server where there is no uber gear trickling down yet so they can't build themselves up without help from anyone.</description>

      <description>Something i find rather funny about this, is that people don't remember how inept guards were. Often times, they'd not take action till you were already dead. Other times the guards&amp;lt;yes i'm talking about the gate guards&amp;gt; would wander out into the newbie area, because they agro from where they stand. Fire beetle walks near guard. it chases it, kills it. Snake? Chases it. Kills it. Effective newbie safety measure? How about when you're fine, and all of a sudden, a guard comes from nowhere, and steals your kill. That's also, an effective newbie help. i mean, it means you lose less hp and mana, so you can go fight something else&amp;lt;even though you wasted time/hp/mana on the thing you just got KSed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I killed city guards way back when, on both a necromancer, and a druid. Gnomes still hate both of them to this day. same for freeport guards. Newbies LOVED us. Why? i was there for exp&amp;lt;and others too, we normally had multiple people camping different guard camps&amp;gt;, so i'd loot the coin, and keep going, those swords were heavy, and not worth my time as either class. Newbies get a bit of a boon right there. In freeport, i had them also looting helmets left and right, as well as the swords. My necro absolutely hated trolls&amp;lt;long story&amp;gt;, and i'd kill troll guards all the time, as well as human guards in Qeynos&amp;lt;anything that wasn't a DE was more or less fair game to her&amp;gt;.&amp;nbsp; And ya know what else? I had a pet on my necro, and a 15 minute snare on my druid... Pet took out stuff on noobs that were running or /y for help &amp;lt;yes, people used that forgotten command&amp;gt;. When i leveled alts back then, and there were no guards, i never, ever encountered a higher level who wouldn't send a pet, a small DD&amp;lt;which they kept loaded just for this occasion&amp;gt;, or a heal my way&amp;lt;even necros would throw an HoT on me at the cost of their own HP&amp;gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Honestly, i don't care if guards are campable or not. They're fun to kill. They're not "uber" exp. they WERE one of the few camps, where you could log on for 10 minutes, do a few kills, and log off. Or, lets say all the good exp areas are crowded yay! Where do you go? Considering people say "Its time to progress!", i say its time to take your head out of your ass, but that's a whole other paragraph=p &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;People here probably don't remember Naggy/vox fights before kunark. SSoY will be stupidly good. Ghoulbane will be the best 1-hander in game provided they take Jagged pine out. You say that the dragons will go down with 100 players 40+? Okay, lets see, Dragon fear alone can kill those 100 players who are 40+&amp;lt;especially those below 45 who will get full duration and have 0% resistance to it, since they'll likely be in bronze armor with a few people decked out in crafted and the like&amp;gt;. People looking at this server are judging the boss mobs by standards of todays gear. Centi shortsword, an all around PoS by today's standards would have been considered darn near gamebreaking way back when. Rubicite armor, was removed for being "Overpowered" and over camped&amp;lt;high levels camping mobs that lower people needed for EXP&amp;gt;. In all reality, a group of 40-60 people could down naggy/vox pretty easy if all are 46+ and get the easier to get mr&amp;lt;just need about 90-100, and some FR/CR gear in smaller amounts, as well as decent magic weapons&amp;gt; for resisting Dragon fear, as well as having a 50 warrior in full crafted armor with 2 clerics devoted just to them. Getting to that point requires levels, and unforunately, alot of people are gonna level fast since experience is much faster in the game now with the hotspots that will be left behind in the old world, as well as the hell levels. Hell levels were unpleasant, but they did stagger the level range. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;OK, rant off!&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Well, personally I never saw a need for any of the newbie guards to be off limits. If they are being killed there is always a zoneline somewhere not too far away. And dieing as a newbie just isn't a big deal. Gotta learn to make do without running to guards soon, why not right away. All this guard dependence was lame, in my opinion.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Game would have been, and would be, just as fun if the guards never helped a newbie at all. In the beginning we began our lives inside the cities anyway, and had to learn to zone before we could even engage our first mob. Zoning to avoid dieing is what we use later on. Why promote using guards for a few levels?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I guess too, as a newbie, I didn't use guards much if at all, and usually right away headed out to unguarded areas and used zonelines as my only safe out. Crushbone at level 5, and how long can it take to get to level 5? The chessboard at level 9, and the zoneline is the only way to safety from there. Level 10 and I was in the west commonlands fighting wisps. No guards will help with wisps, anywhere, anyway!&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Newbies shouldn't be allowed to depend on guards.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Maybe I should make a dark elf this time, fits me mood better.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;Just remember this, though. The less often newbies get killed, the faster they level up, the faster they level up, the sooner they can leave the safety of the zones with the guards in them, and the more likely it will be that you will find times when the zones are completely free of newbs, so then you can kill guards as much as you like. It is actually to everyones benefit that you should allow the newbs to utilize the guards during peak times and then killing them when they aren't needed as much because of low zone population. I used to do the guards in Nektulos from time to time because they were only level 15 and dropped bronze weps, which was good money back in the day, but&amp;nbsp;I always left a few there during times when there were newbs xp'ing in the zone, because I had gone through running for the guards only to find them not there because someone killed them for xp many times and didn't think it was fair to put others through that. There were also plenty of&amp;nbsp;iron and stone&amp;nbsp;guardians running around Nektulos back then to help protect the newbs, so guards weren't quite as important as they were after Nektulos was repopulated and the guardians disappeared.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Since "it doesn't effect your playstyle" is a viable argument against someone.&amp;nbsp; I will ask the devs to just give me lvl 50 on the progression server. No argument shall stand in my way, as it doesn't effect them!&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Jay you are absolutely clueless. You think killing city npc/guards is killing easy mobs and is exploiting? Wow... Just wow.. They are just as hard if not harder than other mobs of their level, it is not exploiting.. unless you do exploit, which you can do same as well in a DUNGEON. How does people killing city npc/guards affect you? If you don't want to, then don't. Oh that's right, it DOESN'T affect you. You probably just made a warrior a few years ago and would lfg for hours and see casters soloing stuff you couldn't and you got all bitter and have been crying to anyone who would listen ever since. Grow up baby girl.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
