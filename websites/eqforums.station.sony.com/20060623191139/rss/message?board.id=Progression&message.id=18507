    <title>Slower exp today compared to yesterday?</title>
    <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Progression&amp;message.id=18507</link>
    <description>I dont know if its just me, But I created a Dark Elf last night just to mess around, Got out to Nektulos the quick way (whack a guard) and started killing....and killing...and killing. For some reason after about 30-40mins I was still only level 2, just about to hit level 3. I dunno if its changed or if im just used to any other games Ive been playing lately but its slow as hell now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I remember being able to get level 1-2 in only 2 or 3 kills, now your getting half a yellow bar per kill while killing an even con? and Dont bother trying to kill a yellow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So...are there exp bonuses in the main newbie zones (which are now in luclin)? Is this why noone levels up in the old world zones anymore? In the last few years ive been playing EQ on and off powerleveling a character here and there. I always choose to hunt in Nektulos/Freeport, and work my way to S Ro and Oasis. I love that are and it brings back memories. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But what happened to the exp? just need this answered is it just me? Since ive been playing other games and im used to those leveling systems? or were any bonuses that were in the old world zones gone now and thats why those zones are deserted?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If thats the deal that needs to be switched back for sure. Theres not enough level 1 monsters in the game to support the grinding of hundreds of people at a time. The idea is to breeze by the first few levels to spread out the crowd.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Well yah but I just have a pretty fond memory of when I made my first characters when EQ first came out...and that first kill I made the exp bar would go up to half and so on...why was it made so much harder to level?&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Well; I'm not sure why it took that long....&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;lvl 1 was usually quick for me, 5-6 kills to 2....then a &lt;STRONG&gt;lot&lt;/STRONG&gt; longer to lvl 3..... /shrug&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;OP, was your character completely untwinked? I've made a melee this week and levelled it to 5 so far, and aside from some cloth and a couple of weapons I have gotten from newbie skeletons, I don't have any gear. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;In the past, my level 1's have been tremendously&amp;nbsp;well geared for their level, so the obvious assumption is that the much lower dps, hp and armor class this time around has made the levelling much slower. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</description>
