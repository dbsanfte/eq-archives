				<DIV>KK, first off didn't really know where to post this so here it is please move to correct area if its helpful.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Drakkin Breath Weapon Quest.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>First off you need to head to the council of 6 and speak with the Council Aide who will give you a couple of small quests to run in the upper lvls of the zone. </DIV>
<DIV>Secondly once those are complete you are then allowed to run a quest for your particular color drakkin...After completing this you will then be allowed to get quests from your parent Dragon which is located in "The Grove" just outside the city.</DIV>
<DIV>(did not elaborate on this area as it is self explanitory for the most part and not really the area of the quest I was looking to update)</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Also folks, when rreading the description of the quest they will give a hint to the nature of the mob you need to find....use that description and try to fit it too a mob type in EQ. Thats how I have been figuring out the lastest mobs.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Ok, now for the part which i&nbsp; wanted to give info for:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Every 5 lvls your dragon parent (corresponding color to which your character chose) will give you a quest to improve your breath weapon. Once you have gained the first lvl your breath weapon skill will show up in the AA box basic AA category. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>LVL&nbsp;1 -Find and kill Hollows Widow---Located by killing all mobs in the area just to the north of the city entrance. (second field Pumas,bears,drakes etc clear everything)</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There doesnt seem to be a clear PH so clear everything.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>LVL 2 -Find and Kill Charbones. He is located on the top floor of CR where all the low lvl mobs are. Go to the first room on the left that has a Curtained entry. Kill all mobs in this area&nbsp;&nbsp; and Charbones will spawn on the raised platform in the middle of the room. Don't get discouraged it may take awhile to git any of these quest mobs to spawn.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>LVL 3 -Find and kill Bloodmaw. He is located in the bear cave which is also in the nooby area at CR. Just follow the far wall North and there will be cave entrances with mobs in them. Find the entrance with bears and head in to the last room deep in he spawns in the center of the room.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>LVL 4 -Find and kill Plaguebringer. He is located in Blightfire moors not far from the zone in CR. Kill rats until he spawns. Also there seem to be no static spawn I have seen him sp[awn on both sides of the road...so plan on moving around this area if you want to find him.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>LVL 5 -Find and kill Dragoneater. He is located in Blightfire center of the map a bit north. The key mobs you are looking for are Sporali Shrooms surrounding the Corpse of..yep you guessed it, a dragon. Kill the Shrooms until this Shroom Spawns. Was B to my 35 Ranger.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>LVL 6 -Find Duskfall. This feller is located in Eastern Blightfire Moors. If you head on over to the Ghostwolf area and start killing them eventually he will spawn. Blue to my 35 Ranger.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Will try to update more as I kill them. Also will add in Locs when I have time.</DIV>
