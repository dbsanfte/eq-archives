    <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;You said "well actually" as if something i said was incorrect. If you understood the context why did you feel the need to correct me hehe? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS. I think this is how unintended arguments begin on these boards!&lt;span&gt;:smileywink:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's a very old topic and one that is worked over much more thoroughly on TSW where I've been active since the old boards. Obviously, if the only augs I had available to me were the grouping ones I'd be loaded up on AC augs. especially given that i duo with a shammy a lot, total hp are somewhat marginalized as a concern there anyhoos. However,&amp;nbsp; raiding is&amp;nbsp; a different environemnt with very different healing impact. I'm not being kept up by an occasional HOT and a fast heal when i run low hehe. My hp bar is being filled concurrently by many fast heals, or, by use of a ch chain. I have never, ever tanked under such heals without losing some healing value for lack of HP. Unless, i died on incoming!&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Grizzlesnozz on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;08-06-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;11:18 AM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

      <title>Proposal for Mitigation Changes</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=warriorbalance&amp;message.id=24266#M24266</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I am of the opinion that the triviality of content in conjunction with the ease of high stat gear acquisition in the game has resulting in a blurring of class-based advantages that needs to be addressed in a way that does not unduly impact players and the classes they play.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;A) Class Based Mitigation and Gear&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;*Irrespective of level of gear, there should be a clear distinction in the mitigation of incoming dps from a mob between classes/archetypes via the DI distribution at any particular interaction of player AC and mob ATK.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;*As has been stated by various devs, and as is the COMMON perceptions of what the roles of the various classes should be (class mavens notwithstanding) the mitigation of incoming dps by player classes should be WAR &amp;gt;PAL/SK &amp;gt; OTHER (I am purposefully limiting this to the actual heavy tank archetypes, arguments of where the rest belong is a different issue, the point being that knights should mitigate dps better than other classes and warriors should mitigate better than knights).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;*DI(-1) was introduced to warriors as a method of keeping the gap between warriors and knights, but with the exponential rise in player AC since that time, and the relative stagnation of the content with regard to interaction with player AC to create DI distributions, this mitigation advantage has become smaller in real world content.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;*I propose two changes to revitalize the tanking gaps between warriors and knights and knights and others:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;1) Move warriors to DI(-3)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;2) Move knights to DI(-1)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;3) Change the warrior worn AC modifier from ~1.57 to ~1.65 (this will result in around 100-200 ac boost to warriors depending on where their gear is)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;*The DI mod change is self-explanatory, it creates an always on, class-based rather than gear-based tanking disparity between classes and archetypes, and in conjunction with higher player AC more accurately results in mitigation differences that mirror where things were when DI(-1) went in.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;*The AC modifier is a way to get around the problem of gear that is more and more often lacking in class specific armor sets, thus negating one of the advantages warriors were supposed to have, and is also a nod to the realities of warrior gear choices in that warriors are more likely to wear HP based augs over AC based augs due to their raid role as an MT that needs to maintain enough hps for a heal chain to keep them up while under defensive disciplines. It also just makes plain sense for the same reason that warriors get a greater stamina to hp conversion rate.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;*Avoidance is ignored in this argument because it has relatively little differential effect on war vs knight balance, and is more of a plate tank versus light tank balancing issue.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;B) Viability of Shield Use and Stats&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;*When it comes to weapon choice and setups, it is all about dps. Either the dps you can output or the dps you have coming into you. The stat disparity between mainhand and offhand setups versus 2h setups is pointless and results in more magelo-fluffing and knights using 1h/shield in situations that its pointless to do so rather than any balance issue. The difference in stats between dualwield or 1h/shield and a 2her used to be small (10-20%) and has not grown to the nearly 75% range in many cases.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;*2h stats (ac and hp specifically) should be on par or slightly under than which you get from a mainhand and offhand item for several reasons:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;1) There is very little point in a warrior to ever use a 2her outside of using something like fellstrike discipline, when they can get a dual wield set up that provides equivalent dps while providing far more stats.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;2) With regard to plate tanks, the use of a 1h/shield and the over-cap ac and shield block avoidance creates MORE than enough benefit to use over a 2her, the stat differences are overkill.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;3) The basic statistic inferiority of 2hers is enough in and of itself (fewer procs, meaning less dps that scales with things like crit aa, almost always less mods like shielding and avoidance, the reduction in the potential number of focus-like effects, etc), with the hp/ac inferiority being overkill&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;4) The fact that 2hers are the first things to rot in raiding guilds should be reality enough.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;*I believe that such a change would result in far more 2h use, which would come closer to that which it seems that some devs somewhere must want with all the 2hers they keep itemizing.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;*Due to the impact of shield block on avoidance, shield use needs to be made viable for warriors as it is for knights. In order to do so, there needs to be two changes:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;1) Aggro generation needs to be changed for warriors, either providing more on-demand aggro or providing shield use specific aggro. Aggro generation does not need to be equivalent to dual wield, but does need to be viable. Enabling procs from bashes and putting anger and eb type effects on shields and augs that go on shields could do it. Maybe a modification to generated aggro (innate echo of anger type thing that stacks with EoA effects) when wielding a shield.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;2) DPS loss needs to be equivalent to knight dps loss when going to 1h/shield (around 20% rather than 40% like it is for warriors now), either by shield mate weapons *that are itemized with the recognition that warrior aa and skill caps may require lower ratios than knights get* or some mechanic that alters the ratio of mainhand weapon when a warrior wears a shield.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;*We all know the issues with shields, and bar a few people that seem to not want warriors to be able to use them, the majority of posters sure seem to be willing to grant the need that this needs to be fixed.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;C) Endurance Regen and Costs and Combat Skill Refresh Times&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;*Mostly self-explanatory, there needs to be either an increase in endurance regen and/or a reduction in endurance costs. Warriors should not go OoE anymore often than knights go OoM in groups when we are using these reserves to do little more than maintain aggro over dps classes.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;*Some of these refresh timers need to be looked at, there should be a cost balance that limits the aggro that can be built and maintained by warriors, but the double whammy of high cost and long refresh is unfair. There should be the option of in an "oh crap" moment, lay on the aggro and get it at a costly endurance&amp;nbsp;expense. Maybe a new ability on a different timer that has&amp;nbsp;a VERY high cost that can basically at best be used once in a great while, but which is unlinked from the other disciplines? Hell, if you have to link it with defensive so that it can't be used on raid bosses as a regular method of gaining aggro and tank switches? I don't know.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;------------&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;To me, those changes would balance the tank classes nicely (IMHO). Obviously, I have a different opinion than others. But that's what this knight thinks.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I still say it's more an issue of raiders and casuals, I have had up to twice the hps of casual tanks in groups and more mana than the casual cleric. You can't balance them against me and hope to be fair. You can't lock casuals out of group zones, the gear mobs drop in those zones should allow a casual tank to upgrade so they can tank there. The raider can't be upgraded by any thing in a group really and has no trouble tanking anywhere, knight or warrior.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I understand that pop had a decent progression tree, but as they add each new exspansion that disparity between casuals and raiders gets bigger and balance for groups becomes more difficult. In fact I have softened some of my stance about "warriors vs knights" because&amp;nbsp;I do see it as more a fairness isuue between high end raiders and casuals. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Casual groups do have encounters where a warrior would be better for then tanking than a knight....as long as they are all causual...If I'm in the group,&amp;nbsp;I&amp;nbsp;end up tanking because I'm the 800 pound gorilla with &amp;nbsp;much better gear, shielding, avoidance, improved 3's on everything and yadda yadda. I admit that allowing raid gear to get so massive is what lead to this, and it is a beast of thier own creation, but It won't wrk to have raid mobs drop wimpier stuff than what we have now.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;They painted themselves into a corner and&amp;nbsp;I don't see an easy way to make it fair and balanced in group formats for casuals that will be any threat to a group of high end raiders. I mean they could&amp;nbsp;I suppose try to make really challangeing zones, but would the gear droped be higher end upgrades? &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Raiders are just going to have to except the fact that they are too uber for most those zones and that raids are thier challange now. Groups are just xp grinds for aa's. if so would you force casuals to have to raid to be able to achieve the high end group format? Every one talks about "price you pay" for chooseing a class,&amp;nbsp;I would offer that thier is a "price to be paid" for being a high end raider, and that's ho hum groups.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

Take a look at the contrast between POP cultural and ornate with POTime gear. I can tell you that even EP geared folks were considerted incredibly strong by comparison with non raiders. Things pre EP folks raided they could group, nevermind Time geared players. It wasn't that different and the ratio of contrast in gear was greater, not, smaller imo. The difference back then in a warriors aggro was massive too, like not in the same ballpark. A BOW - DBOTW warrior made huge dps by comparison to a warrior with group gear at the time. They were still rading stuff like BF's and they were rare hehe. If all the warriors in your group have far less progression than you, you should be tanking!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lower progression folks don't need to do the same group content high progression folks do today. They never have. Time will take care of that IF the content retains value for them when they are ready for it. Yeah, it's not easy and needs a lot of work, but, imo they need to do it. Leaving even moderate raiding folks with no challenging, fun group content and watching many of them them log in only for raids isn't a good trend hehe. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Makeing group content challangeing is difficult for high end raiders because of the huge variance you have gearwise. I'm in the top 20 of sk's on my server gear wise, meaning&amp;nbsp;I could prolly tank nearly any group scenario, push it to upper limits with me or high end warriors and it would lock out casuals. As&amp;nbsp;I mentioned before, raiders raid for gear and stuff, grouping is more a hassle to grind for xp and aa's..or flags/keys. Grouping for many casuals is how they advance thier characters, so you couldn't make things too&amp;nbsp; high end in the group format or it would leave them hanging.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;You can't have a group level progression chart that would garner gear similar to high end raiders either or why bother raiding? That's the real balance point right now, how to get content that's challangeing for high end peeps with out being killer to casuals who don't have access to high end gear. That's why group mobs seem so lame to high end raiders, that's the bear minimum they could go and still make it doable for casuals.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Remember, casuals are locked out of raid zones predominatly allready, so they can't be locked out of group content cause that's thier only avenue&amp;nbsp;for progression. If they can't progress either they will just stop playing, and those peeps eventually stop paying. So, it's not really a class issue so much as a style issue, raider vs casual. I have been both and believe me, there is a HUGE difference in what I can do now compared to what I could hope to do then.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

However, we're a bit behind older servers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;When I progressed fully luclin and POP geared into ep's stuff hit hard. When we first got there a druid could not reliably keep me out with any kind of reasonable pull rate. Knights had very hard times with some named mobs, although, that changed pretty quickly with progression. There wasn't much gear for me on groupable mobs, or, maybe none. We were given plenty of reasons to go there though and group. Lots of our guildies with more moderate gear would get occasional upgrades, xp was good, zones were fun, there were drops that were interesting if not upgrades.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When we broke into GOD it was very hard to keep me up in places like Tipt, KT and even some work in Vxed hehe. Again, I needed a cleric, slower and even secondary healer at times. Knights had a tough time with named at first, but, they progressed through it. This occured again in MPG and RSS to a slightly lesser degree. I remember when we got to MPG and knights had a very tough time staying up as did any warriors with less progression than our 3 or 4 biggest fellows. tanking high dps nameds for them was much like BOT. they preffered having a warrior around. Clerics were mandatory at first etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They can do it, they have done it and I hope they will do it again. Group content challenge does not have to stop at some magic number. It should encompass players at all levels of progression. The best deal would be to retain significant RVR value so lower progression players would later utilize the same content as higher progression players.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>I'd want to see a long term quality case study on that Lu. Generally, warrior gear is itemized to give good ac returns on high hp stuff and the primary decision comes in augging. The amount of times that warriors get overhealed especially in the days of spam healing is incredible. The more they can gain from that healing the better. the parses I've seen show very little predictable return on high AC past a certain point for a given mob in a particular set of content. Even on someone like Draygun with a couple shadows in him hehe. You do not want to be short on AC for the content in question. Below a certain point it has much stronger relative effect. Above a certain point the gains you make seem small and hard to parse relaibly. I'm all for a balanced approach, although, i've always though AC is more kewl hehe. Imo, too much focus on AC though and you short change your club as a MT. Not that i really care even as a GL, so long as folks are having fun.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>I just want to highlight one point- "&lt;i&gt;The amount of times that warriors get overhealed especially in the days&#xD;
of spam healing is incredible. The more they can gain from that healing&#xD;
the better. the parses I've seen show very little predictable return on&#xD;
high AC past a certain point for a given mob in a particular set of&#xD;
content.&lt;/i&gt;"&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Firstly, well, opinions may differ about this, but as a heal leader,&#xD;
when I design healing strats, especially when I am designing a CH chain&#xD;
(omg we use CH), I make it so that it snugly fits the generic DPS&#xD;
output of the mob for all the tanks (its silly to make a specific chain&#xD;
per tank ofc), but in doing so, with the goal of having the AHpM of&#xD;
each CH, or rather, the average heal of CH to be always over 5-6k (and&#xD;
minimising Duds), which is very efficient for what youre asking for, in&#xD;
the realistic world no mob does perfect damage so that CH lands for the&#xD;
same value each time, if they were that predictable, this would be very&#xD;
boring :)&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
When it comes to spam healing, overhealing is easily minimised by&#xD;
having healers who pay attention to heal messages in channels / other&#xD;
places. Whilst it is virtually inevitable, and happens the more healers&#xD;
you have present, it is still possible to do, such that inefficiency&#xD;
with heals landing is reduced to near non-existant status, if people&#xD;
are overhealing then they need to be more reliant on letting others&#xD;
cast to get efficient heals in also, its not a race, unless the tank is&#xD;
at dangerously low HP of course. Ditto with DI's, fastest finger helps&#xD;
there, but if multiple cast then a team can adjust so that whoever is&#xD;
acknowledged as the first caster remains casting, whilst the others&#xD;
announce themselves ducking, with the caster saying "held". Thats how&#xD;
we do it at least. Anyways, heal approaches and mechanics aside :p&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
I can see if I can gather more parses with him tanking, and collate&#xD;
them into statistically viable logs (of over 60 mins per mob, lets say)&#xD;
just to compare his ac, hes an interesting Case is our troll, because&#xD;
no one else can see the results personally that he can. I've always&#xD;
asked if people wanted more info but no one has said anything... until&#xD;
now :) as part of the case study what would you like to see shown?&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
I'll still say I'm all for an adequate balance, I know which tanks tank what better :)&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;I'll eat up anything you offer here, or, on TSW. That doesn't mean I will break down any complicated math past a point of general understanding hehe. It's pretty tough since our content and sta values are ever changing. However, i'm totally up for seeing the "results" of controlled studies on the effects of AC vs HP on moderate to hard hitting raid mobs in what is current content for the tanks in question. We have some high AC tanks as well, although, perhaps not to the same contrast. I have seen nothing which leads me to believe their survivability is the better for the extra AC. I know that their is a survivability factor increase, it's just been too small to judge in my perception on raid mobs. I have long noticed that tanks with appropiate minimum AC levels and equally greater HP d by contrast do tend to be more reliable. Of course neither matter anywhere near what folks like you do!&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If you decide to slack&amp;nbsp; we have room... cough&lt;span&gt;:smileywink:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We do and have had some fantastic clerics though. I have never seen any that do not overheal either in chain, or, in spam hehe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Well as I said, overheal is inevitable no matter how you slice it, its&#xD;
just how one manages how often the overheal occurs :) there are many&#xD;
handy things I've learned from soloing, it really is funny but those&#xD;
principles tie into raiding extremely well- the timing and frequency of&#xD;
the heals, where you need to be efficient and not overheal else you&#xD;
will go oom and fail and where you can't be the opposite else you/the&#xD;
tank dies. When soloing its my deaths, when raiding its the tanks and&#xD;
possibly more people, when all healers are oom, a raid wipes thats&#xD;
inevitable. I try to teach the values I've learned, and they really do&#xD;
help to minimise inefficiency and over healing, you can't make it&#xD;
obsolete, but you can just reduce the chance of it happening, the drive&#xD;
to be rigorously efficient is what makes the best healers imo.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
While I keep on preaching how his AC helps, I will say again that&#xD;
whilst there are fights he is more suited for, there are many that the&#xD;
hp warrior(s) that we have are suited for better, and the more balanced&#xD;
ones (who tend to be more ac than hp) are the ones who I'd consider MT&#xD;
certain things more than anything.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Raids may be a bit skewed however, as unless I magically gain the dev's&#xD;
eye to see what debuffs certain mobs have on them permanently, it will&#xD;
be hard to say if a mob say Hatchet has attack debuffs permanently on&#xD;
him, although knowing our druids they are good enough to make sure that&#xD;
they never fade. But the data we have is the best we can give ) I'll ask&#xD;
our ac freaks today in a few hours.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;Well actually AC is in fact eassier to achieve than higher HP. Basis, you can recieve 5 25AC/25hp augments , 4 flameshield stones . A 30 ac aug in the blessed shard and the 30AC 30hp aug from group content dodh.&amp;nbsp;and another 20ac aug from blindhunter&amp;nbsp;I do concur there are moments in a raid enviroment that AC will bring about a more desired result I just have not found them to outweigh the ammount of encounters where hp adds more benefit.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;Yes I got the context, the response was basically in the respect that Many have made comments well the Wars should focus more on AC. This is also merely opinion really,&amp;nbsp; As i stated earlier, in times past the warrior gear did in fact give an ac advantage we no longer posses really in current content. So I partially agree'd with the ops original statmement, but that really most HP tanks are gearing for spike damage which is just a different way to gear and covers I belive more encounters than a pure ac tank would. Its just the group content is better served by AC generally.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;You said "well actually" as if something i said was incorrect. If you understood the context why did you feel the need to correct me hehe? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS. I think this is how unintended arguments begin on these boards!&lt;span&gt;:smileywink:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's a very old topic and one that is worked over much more thoroughly on TSW where I've been active since the old boards. Obviously, if the only augs I had available to me were the grouping ones I'd be loaded up on AC augs. especially given that i duo with a shammy a lot, total hp are somewhat marginalized as a concern there anyhoos. However,&amp;nbsp; raiding is&amp;nbsp; a different environemnt with very different healing impact. I'm not being kept up by an occasional HOT and a fast heal when i run low hehe. My hp bar is being filled concurrently by many fast heals, or, by use of a ch chain. I have never, ever tanked under such heals without losing some healing value for lack of HP. Unless, i died on incoming!&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Grizzlesnozz on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;08-06-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;11:18 AM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

      <description>In fact one could effectively camp more than 5 25/25s (Stonewarden and&#xD;
shard, I haven't counted the slots they can go in), as well as the 30&#xD;
aug from Valdoon (which is dead easy to do) things like that on top of&#xD;
whats already mentioned, its true AC is far easier to achieve than&#xD;
getting all the super high hp raid augs, of which are subject to your&#xD;
guilds distribution system and not exp group rules.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
There is a point where extra may seem pointless, you've already&#xD;
achieved the basic level of survivability, but I know it can and does&#xD;
help, its just tradition that when this happens you should focus on HP&#xD;
more, and thats where being balanced comes into play. But since this is&#xD;
a thread about mitigation, I thought I'd stick to the AC side /shrug.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I don't believe Warirors need any special dispensation with something like a Heavy Armor AA ability that grants us 500AC nor "-5 DI".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our unmatched ability to &lt;u&gt;survive&lt;/u&gt; has always been:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. Brief invunerability to melee damage while still being able to tank and hold aggro - something hybrid Knights should &lt;u&gt;never&lt;/u&gt; receive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. Dramatic but finite endurance fueled disciplines - something that &lt;u&gt;never&lt;/u&gt; should have been shared with hybrid Knights.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3. A modest (all things concidered) passive tank superiority with little ability to improve it other than by using the disciplines noted above that Knights can equal - by spending mana that they would otherwise be spending on "utility".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's intentionally &lt;u&gt;un&lt;/u&gt;balanced.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yes, as long as there's a range of content "brutality" there will be Warriors that "take the lead" in successfully beating it. We're supposed to.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yes, spellbook versatility allows Knights to completely trivialize lesser content that Warriors still find somewhat challanging. It's inevitable. Where Knights are tanking content they can handle they provide utility.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's what we chose - bitter and sweet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But it the intended gap can never be closed sufficiently that a Knight would dream of aggroing and trying to tank a raid boss mob while a Tank still lives. Warriors don't res, cleric buff, nor heal with a Paladin present. Warriors don't pull where an SK is available.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nor can challanging content be so absent from the raid or group environment that the Central Distinguishing Warrior Class Characteristic - unmatched survivability exists no where. Survivability isn't parsing for an hour to see who needed less healing, it's counting bodies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nor can Knight superiority in lesser group content be so great Warriors don't bother logging on except for raids and non-raiding players are stupid to play a Warrior.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Knight intended tanking inferiority does not equal lack of viability. A host of players don't tank as well a Headboss and the other longtime top tanks - yet they are perfectly viable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Battleblade-Xegony on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;08-06-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;05:16 AM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

why this is).&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
"&lt;i&gt;But it the intended gap can never be closed sufficiently that a&#xD;
Knight would dream of aggroing and trying to tank a raid boss mob while&#xD;
a Tank still lives. Warriors don't res, cleric buff, nor heal with a&#xD;
Paladin present. Warriors don't pull where an SK is available&lt;/i&gt;." &lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
/rolleyes, and you were doing so well. Good healers can make that gap&#xD;
seem non-existant, nothing to do with the tank's skills and quality,&#xD;
but merely those of the healers. Why else can knights survive certain&#xD;
raid mobs, such that warriors are ok with knights still tanking if&#xD;
aggro is locked? Paladins dont cleric buff heal nor rez when a cleric&#xD;
is present, SK's don't pull when a monk/bard is available, your analogy&#xD;
works there also.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
"Survivability isn't parsing for an hour to see who needed less healing, it's counting bodies."&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/i&gt;And if an amazing healer lets an undergeared person never die, does&#xD;
that mean they have great survivability? Its never just the tank, man,&#xD;
belittle our value why don't you.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Why are non-raiding players stupid to play a warrior? What do you have&#xD;
so against non-raiders or people who may be at a lesser gear&#xD;
progression than yourself?&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&#xD;
   For once alot of what you have written I agree with, but...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Darn, you started out so well too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;because it is just laughable to liken a 30s ubervie to your discs...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I posted many times that speelbooks and mana are what Knights received as compensation for lesser tanking and it's spellbooks and mana that should improve Knight tanking as much as SoE deems appropriate [keeping in mind that at the end of the day Warirors are STILL supposed to tank better than pallies and SK's.]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In any content Knights can manage without copious expenditure of mana they have Tank Parity (And Spellbook Superiority). That's just the way things are. An endurance fueled discipline allows them to spend a resource (End) which does not limit their other current and future at -will capabilities. So, when playing a Paladin with a bigger mob than usual incoming, I drink a HoT potion, equip a Hopebringer (with a lifetap aug), and demi-Defensive for Knights but not Warirors - a shield, click Knight Defensive, hit my stun macro, and hover over my LoH macro, ....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;and STILL (concidering I've spent next to 0 mana to turtle up extensively) can group heal after the Cleric DArbs (thanks for a potentially bigger CH than Warirors get - btw, don't you get &lt;u&gt;two&lt;/u&gt; such "saves" Cleric?), can still spot heal, still root that add, still GRC, still etc., etc., etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks for that 30 second Vie you laugh at, 3 potential HUGE CH's (LoH, 2 group heals by me after the Cleric DArbs. We'll pretend I don't carry a Soulfire and have FIVE more &lt;u&gt;instant&lt;/u&gt; CH's), and a 15-18% mitigation/avoidance combined improvement due to shield use (I HOPE the heck you are begining to realize what a HUGE advantage that is.).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh, when the fight's over I can res the Cleric if he died (saves him an often VERY nasty run back to the camp), toss some heals to save him mana so we can get started again quickly, etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Good healers can make that gap&#xD;
seem non-existant, nothing to do with the tank's skills and quality,&#xD;
but merely those of the healers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Good healers can make that gap seem non-existant late in an expansion. But when first encountered, I've seen server top 5 Knights drop like flies vs. both group and raid content. Who you trying to kid?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&#xD;
Why are non-raiding players stupid to play a warrior?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;If Knights can tank everything a Wariorr can and have fun, versatile, and powerful spellbooks why play a Warrior?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Those that campaigned for "Tank Parity" in group content willfully and maliciously cheated them out of the "unmatched ability to survive the most brutal battles" they have EVERY right to expect. Knight after knight has posted Warriors have that - in raids. In raids excludes non-raiding Warriors - Git-it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My mostly non-raiding Pally sure has his "step back and heal", "once a day save someone with LoH", nice big Cleanses. &lt;u&gt;Only&lt;/u&gt; Warirors get cheated out of their birthright in group content.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;What do you have&#xD;
so against non-raiders or people who may be at a lesser gear&#xD;
progression than yourself?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;I have no patiance with the Knight Wah Wah Brigade that campaigned for two years that "Defensiv is teh barooken. It must be removed from the game or shared or it's applicability in group content must be eliminated." I light a little candle of thanksgiving each time one leaves EQ.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the other hand, I'm VERY sympathetic to all players that try to improve their aggro by acquiring SoTP/Atens gloves, aggro augs, aggro weapons, and aggro multiplier effects - all tanks should need to acquire such things or have inadequate aggro (or none should have that need).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm also VERY sympathiethis to non-raiding Wariorrs in general. ANY Knight can match them in the ability to tank and exceed them by LIGHTYEARS in valuable utility.&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Sure we get 2 DvA's, but depending on them makes us skill-less, we&#xD;
master its use, but we don't ever depend on them. Just as I don't&#xD;
depend on a paladin group healing after an arbitration, I do that&#xD;
myself without any qualms. Any more you care to list of what you envy&#xD;
about paladins? GRC yet again... gomf, has it not sunk into your head&#xD;
already. Has it not sunk into your head just how MR certain trash can&#xD;
be with roots? Do you really not understand the practicality and&#xD;
situational use of the spells you are envying?&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
I laugh at the uber vie because vie's are whilst in principle nice, are&#xD;
crap because of their HP caps that make them artificial (how long is&#xD;
def/evasive, how long is 30s with a hp cap restriction, compare, how&#xD;
much hp is saved from the use of either? Oh wait Math isn't your forte&#xD;
so maybe thats a bad question to ask), and god the advantage isn't&#xD;
15-18% it is less, but I guess theres no changing you with mathematical&#xD;
fact. In fact, just for you, I'll do some parsing with a knight, no&#xD;
shield, shield, shield block 1 2 and 3, and Ill show you just how large&#xD;
that advantage is. A fair, sterile parse under test conditions- if it&#xD;
shows 15-18% advantage fine, you've been right all along and everyone&#xD;
else should acknowledge it. If you're wrong, you have to admit it and&#xD;
accept what the real % difference is. Fair?&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Any cleric who can't run back to a place unless swarming with see&#xD;
invis, deserves not to be there in the first place imo, I have to be&#xD;
frank on that, if they die and can't run back well enough to avoid&#xD;
nasty cr's... then they need to learn zones more before considering a&#xD;
grind that may be so perilous to slay them. A cleric should also be&#xD;
good enough to not get heal aggro... these are the essentials they have&#xD;
to learn, what to use where, to not die. If they die from a bad pull&#xD;
and the paladin lives, then lol the paladin was doing a piss poor job&#xD;
at keeping the mobs off the cleric now wasn't he, but if the paladin&#xD;
died then the cleric, thats a more realistic scenario don't you think?&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
"&lt;i&gt;Good healers can make that gap seem non-existant late in an expansion.&#xD;
But when first encountered, I've seen server top 5 Knights drop like&#xD;
flies vs. both group and raid content. Who you trying to kid?&lt;/i&gt;"&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
No one. I've done harsh content with some of our knights off the bat,&#xD;
and have made sure they have *never* died. Just because you see one&#xD;
thing, doesn't mean the other doesn't happen mkay? I'm trying to kid no&#xD;
one~ I have personal experience with making sure people don't drop like&#xD;
flies against newer content, both raid and group, but perhaps you do&#xD;
not realise why certain healers insist on a good reputation in that&#xD;
they never let any tanks die /shrug&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
I find this line funny though- "&lt;i&gt;On the other hand, I'm VERY sympathetic to all players that try to&#xD;
improve their aggro by acquiring SoTP/Atens gloves, aggro augs, aggro&#xD;
weapons, and aggro multiplier effects - all tanks should need to&#xD;
acquire such things or have inadequate aggro (or none should have that&#xD;
need)&lt;/i&gt;."&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
I thought all knight aggro was so good, that you felt they didn't need&#xD;
aggro foci, that all knights let them rot, and you felt that should be&#xD;
how it is. Now you cheer them on to loot them?&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

Lluianae wrote:&lt;BR&gt;In fact one could effectively camp more than 5 25/25s (Stonewarden and shard, I haven't counted the slots they can go in), as well as the 30 aug from Valdoon (which is dead easy to do) things like that on top of whats already mentioned, its true AC is far easier to achieve than getting all the super high hp raid augs, of which are subject to your guilds distribution system and not exp group rules.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;There is a point where extra may seem pointless, you've already achieved the basic level of survivability, but I know it can and does help, its just tradition that when this happens you should focus on HP more, and thats where being balanced comes into play. But since this is a thread about mitigation, I thought I'd stick to the AC side /shrug.&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Understandable, but as many knights have said, WAR should focus or have the opurtunity to focus on AC directly. Well as you say its all balance, really once you factor Gear AC you can go well beyond what is really usefull. HP is HP is HP, there are many modifers we have in the War class that greatly increase the return we have off this componet, yet there is also as the op mentioned a reduction in items that were war only that had more AC in fact than the ratio in which they have today in relation to the other tank lines. The proposal he had made was a way to achieve a balance we had as a class previously which has diminished greatly do to poor itemization. Im not saying your wrong lass, im saying the point of this discussion has blurred a great deal back to the original premise for it.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Aswell as the pure pursuit of hp, you lose other valued modifers War use for the basis of control which is our dps, swing rate and hate based off these principles, either way you can imbalance a situation the balance is the thing everyone seeks to perfect and most of it is personal preferance.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
