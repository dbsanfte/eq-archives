&lt;DIV&gt;First off, there are basically two ways to sell things in the game, one is the NPC Vendors. The other is to players. The most popular way to sell to players is to set yourself up in Trader Mode in the Bazaar, another way is to auction items in various zones.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Where is the Bazaar: It is on Luclin and you must have the Luclin Expansion to go there. It is a zone just off the Nexus and Connects to Shadowhaven. You can take the Nexus Stone from Plane of Knowledge (PoP expansion), or you can take the Spires located on each continent (Luclin expansion), or you can get a teleport, or the hardest way is to run there from Shar Vahl, usually through Paludal Caverns to Shadowhaven.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Whichever way you come in, whether Shadowhaven or the Nexus, there is a bank right at the entrance. In between the two banks is a large building that has a number of NPC vendors in it.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The Bazaar is a special zone it is designed for one main purpose, to buy and sell (there are tradeskill containers and an arena to duel in but those are secondary). For one thing, although you may get a message that you are encumbered, it does not affect you WHILE you are in the Bazaar. Leave too heavy and you might have problems getting back.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;How do I buy Stuff: If you are looking for things to buy you will get a prompt to bring up the /bazaar window. That window will probably need to be resized (they added some things) but allows you to search for what you are looking for in a number of ways. You can search by race, class, slot (like head, primary, etc.), and even price. When you find something you want to buy, you click on the trader's name and then click on find and a glowing yellow path will open for you to follow.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;How Do I Sell Stuff: First, you must have an empty inventory/pack slot. Then you go to the Merchant Tekrama, he is in the building between the two banks, first merchant to the right as you enter. You buy a Trader Satchel for about 1 plat. This is a bag that is HEAVY (weighs 10 stone) so you don't want to take it out of the bazaar) and has 10 slots for you to put things into. You can have multiple Trader Satchels, depending on how much stuff you have to sell. A lot of people use all trader satchels for their bank storage as well since they do have 10 slots and basically everything can fit in them. However, trader satchels CAN NOT be put in the shared bank slots.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When you have your Satchel and the things you want to sell, you go to an empty space under an awning (this will make some sense when you are in the bazaar). There are rows of spots under a tent top that can be used for trader mode. When you are in position, bring up your trader window by /trader . If you are not in a proper place you will get a message. If you are, a trader window will open. Everything you have put in a trader satchel to sell will pop up in the window.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Now you might want to compare what you have to sell with what other people are selling so you can price it. Also bring up the /bazaar window.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Say you have Spiderling Silk, do a search in the bazaar window with the word Spiderling to find that spiderling silks are selling for between 5 and 10 plat each on your server. You decide to put yours up for sell at 7 plat. So on your /trader window you can click on the item Spiderling Silk and at the bottom you can put 7 in the plat spot. Then (and this is important) you hit the Accept button. You will get a text line that the price has been set AND the outline around the picture of the silks will turn green. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Price things per each. That is, set a price for ONE silk or bone chip or whatever.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Do this for everything you have to sell. Don't forget to enter both a price AND hit accept. When you are done, everything should have a green line around it, and you can then hit the Begin Trader mode button. If you want to double-check the prices you set, you can hit the List Items button and it will show you the items and the prices you have set.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;How can I sell/buy bags?: There is a new NPC named Caerlyna, she is a Barb outside the middle building, near the Nexus bank. You can give a weight reducing bag to her (like a handmade backpack or one that you have looted) and she will give you a Token. Bags cannot go into trader satchels but tokens can. If you want to buy a bag, search on the word Token. To get a bag from a token, just take the token to Caerlyna and give it to her. Make sure you have an open slot for a bag. Caerlyna costs nothing and you don't even have to talk to her, just hand her bags or tokens.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;What do I do now?: Best thing is to walk away from your computer and do other things for awhile -- like a couple hours, give it some time. While in trader mode you have basically turned into an NPC. You can talk through /tells or /ooc or /auction but you can't move, you can't cast spells. You don't need to be there to sell things. If your items aren't selling there are a couple of possibilities. One is that there is no demand for the item (such as a low quality lion skin that isn't used for anything and should be sold to a NPC vendor), or perhaps that your price is set too high, or maybe your price is fine but no one has wanted your item yet.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Hopefully you will come back to find an empty bag and money in your pockets and you are ready to play. You can hit the End Trader Button and REMEMBER to go to the Bank and put your trader satchel(s) away before leaving the bazaar.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
