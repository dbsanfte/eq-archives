				<DIV>Raider have more plat in their bank accounts because? Well it is true they don’t need to go to the bazaar to upgrade, but any cash coming in during a raid goes directly to the guild bank. But the raider does have expenses, some classes may have the guild supply them with gems used in spells, but in my guild and I’m sure this is common practice in other raid guilds too, I have to supply my own food and drink, my own lobby stone for summoning my corpse when called to by the raid leader and of course my own invis potions, IVU potions, heal potions, cure potions and anything else I don’t have a clicky for. Truth of the matter is, if I only raided my character would go bankrupt in a very short time. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>However, being a long time player, I’ve invested in trade skills to make my own stat food and drink cutting my expenses down. My raid equipment allows me to box better, or in sometimes solo in zones, for items to sell in the bazaar or to a vender sell fast cash drops I get. But this has to be done outside of raiding time, an advantage which I am fortunate to have. So yes I can have more money in the bank then some non raiders, but I would not say this is true of all raiding the raiding community, any more that all non raiders have more cash than raiders, because as I mentioned previously a non raider might need to buy from the bazaar more of the extra equipment upgrades they want from raiders and non raider bazaar mules. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I had my original VP key well before the change, and being at the time in a casual guild, I found getting the new upgraded key extremely difficult. The day I got the upgraded key I believe there was at least 100 players in the zone zerging Suled Dar's Shade, and I had to do this at 4am my time as there were no Euro pick up raids going on. Yes it was a very hard fight indeed, perhaps far too difficult for the intended raiders? But once inside the available quests were nearly all one group, so with a bit of help from my friends I got a few nice upgrades from that revamp. There was one quest involving Hoshkar, that had no reward for either Bards, Monks Beastlords or Berzerkers, so in that Shik I believe you won your titled argument even though you never made it in your post. <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0><BR></DIV>
