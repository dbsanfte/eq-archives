    <description>That's why they DO have lesser tanking.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Group content for tanks is now so trivial that warriors dont need mitigation discs, knights wielding epic 2.0s dont use shields and healing is trival for any of the 3 main healers that any excess helpful ways of helping them out on heals i.e discs, spells potions are not required.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now as I see it grouping falls in to 3 categories. The 3 categories I see as grouping are:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;a) Progressional (content and disc/spell obtaining)&lt;br&gt;b) Gear enhancement grouping e.g in recent times augs&lt;br&gt;c) XP grinding&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I would like to see progressional grouping utilise tank, healers and the individual qualities of each class within the group be useful and worthwhile and the content to be structured in such a way that discs,heals etc... are of practical use and are actually used - from pally perspective to use self heals going shield use is pretty much having to be used as warriors are using their evasive defensive and other discs to ensure a success is something that I would look forward to. The reward for this type of grouping whould be the progression it's self e.g flag or spell but the XP shouldn't be great.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Should the above be the appropriate way of acquiring spells and flags?&lt;br&gt;Should XP be great in this type of setting?&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gear enhancement groupings -&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Should these be behind flaged zones or unflagged?&lt;br&gt;How good an enhancement should the gear be in terms of current raid gear?&lt;br&gt;Should this type of setting require the use of discs and spells etc... i.e as tough as I have described for progressional groupings?&lt;br&gt;If harder hitting more use of discs spells etc... are required and rewarded by excellent XP rewards too - then how is this balanced around the ease of getting new abilities via the AA system&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Grinding XP Groups&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If content exists whereby the risk of getting good XP is substantially easier than the latest hard hitting zones why should anyone bother going to&amp;nbsp; zones or missions that provide equipment or spells that they already have or equipment that is of no use to them. How does SOE provide greater AAs etc... that is easily acquirable via trivial content that provides great XP?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The way I see it on current terms as a high end maxxed out AA player that after I have done each progressional mission once , got any equipment/ aug upgrades (doubt if there will be any unless I adopt a min/max attitude) then I doubt if I will set foot in to those zones again until such time my twink needs to go do them otherwise I will be grinding out easy AAs for twink in trivial content.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is this the plan of SOE to get a toon to such a level that character enhancements are completed and for the player to start building other toons to a level that makes them become boxable 3 boxing 6 boxing etc...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I feel that group content is now at a stage whereby people discuss how group content is for other classes rather than having the will to go out and do the groupings it's self i.e. in the traditional way the game was meant to be played. Perhaps it's not classes that need fixing and re-jigging but the format of the game via groupings needs to sorted out - think Naubi said that perhaps there should be more 12 person content needed and BB agreed that under such a method then tanks might actually start to group with each other and their ancillary skills (be it pulling, curing grp heals or dps) are allowed to become worthwhile again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway - I value your contributions and hope that the discussion doesn't evolve into a bickering place and we can see how we would like to see groupings in EQ to evolve so that we can help designers listen to our requirements of the game as outside of raids there comes a point where a player sees no reason to group for groupings sake.&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;I saw a level 70 druid kill a bunch of HG's, they were tanking them and everything.....Good lord..druids are soooo overpowered.&amp;nbsp; Heck my pet can solo HG's, it must be overpowered too.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;BB, I have soloed several places, I just get bored with it quickly. However, for your amuzement, NC, WoS,&amp;nbsp; every PoP zone except Time,&amp;nbsp;Undershore, Stoneroot, MpG, Ruined city of Dranik, Veksar, Velks, Seb, Kael, Dread&amp;nbsp;lands, OT, &amp;nbsp;Umbral plaines, and several other luclin zones. I even took on three mobs in Kotaz with just a beastlord healing/slowing..but that really isn't solo. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Hmmmm, I have taken on 4 mobs in undershore solo with out needing a healer at all, cleric or paladin. The only real Issue&amp;nbsp;I have is keeping my pet alive, since his dps is actually useful in those typs of fights.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;BB that you could do that with 7 is cool, but doesn't mean you were a tank acting like a cleric. It was simply a dramatic revalation of downward scaleing,&amp;nbsp;something knights are able to do in adundance. &amp;nbsp;You couldn't do that with 7 mobs in RSS or any other current zone set for higher end progression. So while your example is an excellent one for downward scaleing and it's effects in game,&amp;nbsp;it doesn't prove your cleric with a sword misrepesentation either. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I fought one of those missions in PoR, and had the cleric die, the beast lord kept me up. That doesn't say anything about the class, it only says this particular beastlord knew how to play the class really well. Same could be said for you and 7 orcs, you know how to play a palaldin well, that doesn't mean the class is a sword waveing cleric. You mistake a team of players playing well as a team, useing downward scaleing tools, as some sort of unbalanceing class ability. With that type of reasoning it's obvious the Yankees are overpowering because they have so many world titles.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Honestly, while it was cool the hero's in Lord of the Rings took on all them gimp orcs in Moria, it was far more impressive a fight when they took on all those elite Uruk Hai at the end of the movie. I also remember a story&amp;nbsp;based on the claim&amp;nbsp;" I killed 7 with one blow" about a taylor who killed 7 flies, people thought he ment giants. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;We can talk the merits of sword waveing clerics. When you can make that same type of claim after your cleric dies in current up to date content, fit for the progression level your in.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Nod, it was indeed Stoneroot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;You couldn't do that with 7 mobs in RSS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;after your cleric dies in current up to date content, fit for the progression level your in.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Interesting, I would have thought Stoneroot was more current then RSS, not less. And more suitable for the level I'm at, 67, then RSS which I can not yet enter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;I have taken on 4 mobs in undershore solo&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Excellent! Do you solo RSS too? Do you solo Arcstone, DS, the Nest? Vindi, Cursed, Seru? Tell us more about what you solo Sharbreena. Provide some detail.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's merely a little story - the kind of thing that happens some regularity when I play a 67 pally twink.

&lt;DIV&gt;If you're going to claim telling the truth, then tell the whole truth.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;At least provide detail of the gear those other 2 tanks were in.&amp;nbsp; What is their HP, AC, Avoidance, shielding, AAs, and so forth.&amp;nbsp; It makes a HUGE difference.&amp;nbsp;All you said was they were twinks, but there are many levels of twinks...especially for someone who has a main in top 5 guild as you have mentioned before.&amp;nbsp; What gear was the bard in, I can't remember what class the 6th was but information on them as well is pertinent.&amp;nbsp; Unless you can provide detailed information on gear, AA and level of those "twinks" your annectodal story holds very little value and doesn't prove a single thing.&amp;nbsp; Since your paladin isn't 69 please try that in MPG, or do you still refuse the challenge I've laid out for you so long ago?&amp;nbsp; Remember you can only offer healing, buffing, rezzing, rooting and dispelling as your toolset.&amp;nbsp; No tanking allowed, and it must be a pickup group.&amp;nbsp;Then you can come back and talk about the impact of paladin spells in the group game...where the GROUP determines the value of those skills, not an individual warrior that doesn't even try to play his warrior in group content, because frankly what can a max levelled, max AA'd warrior that raids in a top 5 guild gain from group content....the answer is nothing.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>RSS does 450 dps to me from 1 warrior pyrilen, maybe slightly less now&#xD;
but it did before. Stoneroot orcs are around 200 each unslowed, thats&#xD;
not current dps levels like RSS, and I have crap evasion and no shield&#xD;
block, I am a worse tank overal than some twinks purely because of the&#xD;
evasion difference, even with levels factored in. Wru logs with the&#xD;
info in them... /rude 20+ 300mb big log files :/, dps values may be&#xD;
off, but it was hardly stellar if I can do 4 at a time.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
You just can't compare them heh, they are worlds apart. But Sharbreena&#xD;
is correct, its a mathematical impossibility to heal 7 rss mobs in the&#xD;
same way especially with that group setup (even I have difficulty with&#xD;
7 rss mobs in my raid gear if none are slowed and none are locked...&#xD;
you're going to tell me if you can you're a better healer?)&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;I use a shield all the time cause damge not taken is damage not taken. Telling me to use a twohander over sword and shield because&amp;nbsp; you only get shot two more times useing a twohander, so whats the difference?..Like ...hello? Not getting shot is the difference.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Besides, I&amp;nbsp;don't have my 2.0, 1.5 or 1.0. They are quests and&amp;nbsp;I have the attention span of a gerble, so it really isn't something&amp;nbsp;I can spend more than 10 mins trying to do. It's a personality flaw I know, but them's the breaks.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;In omens, there isn't much difference between Charged Magnetic and OoWT1.&amp;nbsp; Sure, it's tradeskill armor, however, how many groupable suits of armor are there at that level.&amp;nbsp; There aren't even really many groupable drops that are much better.&amp;nbsp; Mixing and matching is generally how casuals survive.&amp;nbsp; The problem is... you are pulling DoN crystal gear/DoN GM armor into the mix.... that is going beyond what I had stated.&amp;nbsp; DoN helped close the gap a bit for casuals similar to how LDoN did.&amp;nbsp; Omens alone, it was not nice for RvR.&amp;nbsp; I expect to see similar in TSS just because that is about how all the level caps have went.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Going into RSS the first time, I had everything groupable that was an upgrade pre RSS.&amp;nbsp; It was not pretty, it took a double healer set up to keep me alive throughout the fights using and shield and shield block... even then, I went down hard if slow was resisted.&amp;nbsp; It was managable, but it wasn't pretty.&amp;nbsp; Once I managed to farm a set of flameshields and DoN came out with GM armor, the major increase to AC was noticable and made my life considerably easier in RSS.&amp;nbsp; From there, continued farming OoSS and now the place has become a joke with some of the raid gear I have picked up from Time/GoD/DoN.&amp;nbsp; RVR has gotten considerably better, though I do disagree with some of the rewards from various mission arcs throughout DoD... they are considerably harder than any of the rewards are worth... some are too easy.&amp;nbsp; In a way, it balances out.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I did not say that Knight's must use a two hander when tanking, however, if mitigation is unnecessary as content is trivial, I personally do see it as detrimental/lazy to use a 1hander and not a 2hander.&amp;nbsp; That is my opinion, and I did not represent that as fact.&amp;nbsp; You might take a hit or two less, but in most circumstances when I am mitigating things into oblivion anyway... I do as much dps as possible back to the mob for the same reason that I point at warrior's higher level of dps as something beneficial to their class they ignore.&amp;nbsp; I do not like, nor try not to be a hypocrit about pointing at Warrior dps and screaming They have way higher dps than me when I am in my defensive set up.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Enough warriors already are hypocrits pointing at us closing a gap when we are in a defensive set up vs their offensive set up and it bothers me.&amp;nbsp; They may want to play that game, but I stand by my belief... more dps the better.&amp;nbsp; It may&amp;nbsp;not directly assist in tanking, but faster kills = more exp.&amp;nbsp; At the end of a day, I don't care how well I mitigated, just that the group as a whole got as much exp as possible in the time we had.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;But like you point out... to some, taking 1-3 less hits a fight is more important.&amp;nbsp; To me, I'll take my 1 - 3 less hits by killing the mob faster.&amp;nbsp; Same goal, different approach.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I think raid gear can show why the curve in group content is getting weaker and weaker. In velious the best gear was what? 50 ac bp with 50 hps? Then Luclin had&amp;nbsp;70 ac with 100 hp items, Time has 180 hps, Tacvi has 100 ac with 280 hp items, Anguish has 300 hp Items, Demi 350 to what? 400 hp items? I fully expect the new exsapnsion to have some 500 hp items. You throw in shielding, avoidance, ac augs, aa's, new spells and the like and really we are 10 times better geared than velious.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The causuals are not, while they are better than during that period they are at least 50% below higher end raiders if not more so. So even if they made mobs 5 times more powerful to be a challange for casuals they are still half of what they used to be when raiders where in velious. This is a exponential increase, the bigger raiders get the smaller group contet ends up being because they can't modify large area's of the group game for high end raiders.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;What's easy to me is not easy to a casual player, I can solo zones they need a group for. Now if I can solo group mobs how much more trivial would it be if a whole group of raiders decided to group there? I have dinked around in wos with one of the monks from our guild and 4 casuals. We ran the casters out of mana from nukeing and mezzing, they couldn't keep up with how fast I and the monk where chewing through critters.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I do not think they will build many group zones that pose a real challange to higher end raiders precisely because it would lock half the player base out of several zones. People won't pay 30 bucks for a 20 zone exspansion if they can only play in 10 of them. Higher end raiders miss that on group content, what we may think is trivial really isn't for casuals players, it's&amp;nbsp;rather imposeing.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>Mmm, some of our knights use shields in group content often /shrug. Though they are mostly only COA with some dp gear.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Groupable content doesn't need to have 50 percent of a new expansion devoted to current top end raid level folks hehe. The levels&amp;nbsp; of available group content should at least reflect the levels of the playerbase. Group content shouldn't stop at some undetermined non raider level of progression. If the content is designed to last and&amp;nbsp; balanced with future rvr, folks can work through it as they get there. This is the basic standard for the rest of the game. When i hit Luclin, groups in UP were relatively scarce. When I hit POP groups in BOT were relatively scarce (BOT was open then too!), when I hit EP's groups there were relatively scarce, when I hit KT groups were relatively scarce. Same with MPG and RSS. People worked up to them though and they eventually became very busy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unless they decide to put newer, or, lower progression players on even a faster catchup train a game with a lot of progression content will have players at many different levels of progression. That's a antural part of the game I valued. That doesn't mean relatively appropiate group content shouldn't be available for all players.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Unless you hit BoT after they opened it to level 62 characters... it was not an open zone.&amp;nbsp; Yes, it had a relatively easy quest, but at the time the mini's were still a 3-5 group kill.&amp;nbsp; The only zones that were open were PoDisease, Innovation, Justice and Nightmare.&amp;nbsp; The rest all had flag requirements, wether group or raid.&amp;nbsp; Even PoJustice trials were difficult unless you either A) got together a full group of lvl 65 characters, heavily raided VT, or had solid AA going into PoP and a few levels from pop under your belt.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Some Knights are lazy and stick with a 1hand/shield combo.&amp;nbsp; Given BoFF and Eulogy, if they lack their 2.0, it's probably their best option for DPS.&amp;nbsp; If they are using a 1hand vs their 2.0, they are seriously doing themselves and the group a disservice.&amp;nbsp; I have yet to crack into CoA yet and there are only two places where I have to crutch on a shield to survive... DK and Rage.&amp;nbsp; Everything else is easily managable with a two hand set up... minus bad pulls.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;RvR for most group content, however, is very poor.&amp;nbsp; If you attempted to go into RSS wearing nothing but MPG drops (Magnetic Armor for a tank), you'd get flat out decimated as a Knight.&amp;nbsp; A warrior may be able to handle it, but the gear obtainable to that point is sadly lacking.&amp;nbsp; A good deal of the 70.x mission difficulties required gearing up though RSS and DoN, which worked out well for a mid cap expansion, but generally speaking some zones like RSS are hard as heck unless properly geared for them.&amp;nbsp; I do not disagree with that, it adds some challenge to the game.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Groupable gear does need to come more inline with progression difficulty of the zones as you try to progress through them.&amp;nbsp; However, the issue is that most will not, or do not need to get gear to progress as they raid.&amp;nbsp; Downside for casuals is that they need those kinds of drops.&amp;nbsp; However, if there are 1-2 zones like RSS again, along with some filler for the high end similar to dod, I think things will work out fine through the next expansion as well.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;Magnetic isn't what I'd consider MPG level gear it's tradeskill gear that was mostly meant to be farmed/crafted and sold by those running MPG. Charged Magnetic on the other hand is quite nice and with a mixture of Charged/tier1 OoW/DoN crystal gear and decent augage, a knight can manage RSS fine. It may be difficult but it should be as you are progressing through it. After you have farmed out the augs available in RSS it should be quite simple.&lt;BR&gt;</description>

His server is Stromm which opened summer 2003. It was clearly a desirable zone early server, but, it went through normal progression content flux.&amp;nbsp; When i was there, pre LDON, warriors with enough progressionwere valued to tank the wing named. Knights were valued as grouping tanks and the majority of players in POP hung out in other , easier zones. As time passed, BOT filled up and knights who previously tanked for groups, tanked the wing named.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Some Knights are lazy and stick with a 1hand/shield combo.&amp;nbsp; Given BoFF and Eulogy, if they lack their 2.0, it's probably their best option for DPS.&amp;nbsp; If they are using a 1hand vs their 2.0, they are seriously doing themselves and the group a disservice.&amp;nbsp; I have yet to crack into CoA yet and there are only two places where I have to crutch on a shield to survive... DK and Rage.&amp;nbsp; Everything else is easily managable with a two hand set up... minus bad pulls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;font color="#ccff00"&gt;The people I play with for the most part are in DPOB.&amp;nbsp; The knights often use shields, although, we do tend to multipull and play in places like Sverag and DSK.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;RvR for most group content, however, is very poor.&amp;nbsp; If you attempted to go into RSS wearing nothing but MPG drops (Magnetic Armor for a tank), you'd get flat out decimated as a Knight.&amp;nbsp; A warrior may be able to handle it, but the gear obtainable to that point is sadly lacking.&amp;nbsp; A good deal of the 70.x mission difficulties required gearing up though RSS and DoN, which worked out well for a mid cap expansion, but generally speaking some zones like RSS are hard as heck unless properly geared for them.&amp;nbsp; I do not disagree with that, it adds some challenge to the game.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#ccff00"&gt;RVR seems better than i can ever remember it for group content since kunark, or, earlier. There were some exceptions in group loot throughout earlier expansions, but, in general the gap seems to have closed a lot. Our knights worked through those progression zones while they were current, but, they were raiding for much of their gear. For most of us, there were always some groupable upgrades in those zones as well. Non raiding players didn't for the most part progress through those zones (including warriors) as soon as we did on our server. However, they did given newer expansions to work with. Lots of non raiders progressed through GOD group trials (exceptionally tough groupable content for it's time) at level 70.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Groupable gear does need to come more inline with progression difficulty of the zones as you try to progress through them.&amp;nbsp; However, the issue is that most will not, or do not need to get gear to progress as they raid.&amp;nbsp; Downside for casuals is that they need those kinds of drops.&amp;nbsp; However, if there are 1-2 zones like RSS again, along with some filler for the high end similar to dod, I think things will work out fine through the next expansion as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ccff00"&gt;Aye, not all players need to beable to progress to the end of an expansion's group content before the next expansion. In fact, given that there should be wide variance in progression levels these days with so much progression behind us, the majority should not. They should find valuable progression content still in older expansions for some time. If the difference in progression is that small that the majority at level 70 can finsish all of the group content in the current expansion then there's a problem hehe. Atm, the problem is a lack of depth of group content. Also problematic IMO is the way newer content tends to give better rewards for the same amount of risk / effort and devalues older areas.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In general, knights get about 1/3 the value of AC post-softcap, making shield AC worth about 3 times as much. I'm pretty sure that was figured out between Brael, Window ((Who's just as reliable for parsing and just as vitriolic as Brael)), and Joshad.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Thats kinda what I was thinking Golgolath.&amp;nbsp; I think that, since most of us posting here are raiders, we lose sight of the fact that our situation is not typical, and there are a whole lot of Creator/WoS/PG/Acrstone level tanks out there, for whom the content is anything but trivial.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
