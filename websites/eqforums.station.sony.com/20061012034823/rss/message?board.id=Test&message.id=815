    <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;To follow up on what Tadenea said,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I didnt reply to that individual as it is clear who it is, one only needs to look at the name and the theme.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now to add to Tadenea statement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Many people are concerned with "What is Test Server?&amp;nbsp; What is its Status?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Test Server is a Workplace for the SoE employee's that design, code, quatily assurance etc.&amp;nbsp; It is not for GM's, Guides etc, in short it is not a CS:Live server.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Harsh Part&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One needs to keep in mind that means they can do anything they darn well want, any time, any way with out asking our permissio, approval, likes, dislikes etc.&amp;nbsp; It is thier work place, they are there to work, NOT play with us, NOT baby sit us, NOT cater to our every whim and need.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Harsh part is done now. :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;In the year 2001, for reason that were totaly justified, SoE did wipe the server clean.&amp;nbsp; They tlaked to us, they talked amongest themselves, they decided to resotre our characters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We accpeted the premise that the MOST CARDINAL SIN is to exploit bugs etc on Test Server for gain.&amp;nbsp; They accepted that there are alternate means to rectify / deal with, hands full of people that care nothing about Test Server, just thier personal ego's.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They have more or less made sever statements indicating they will not wipe the server again.&amp;nbsp; Thier statements are more concrete than what I said, but I allow them the latitude to make decisions based on information that may not be knowable now or forseeable now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, in my opinion, you wont experience a wipe unless you have been naughty :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yes, this is thier work place.&amp;nbsp; Yes, they are working.&amp;nbsp; And that is one of the best aspects of Test Server.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Were else would you see a system wide message (was it Rashier?)

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Was wondering if there was a FAQ around for making the test server a permanent home?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;(i.e. things that players should be aware of before making the decision to stay on test)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I've poked around the official site a bit and saw nothing.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I recently came back to EQ in a much more casual manner after roughly two years and plan to make the Test server my new home.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Thanks!&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Superstar sounds bitter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If i wanted to get back in to the raiding habit i'd have not decided on test in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've been there done that as far as the raiding guild is concerned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Not bitter just letting you there are downsides to this server.It has alot of great features but the reason it has them is to lure people to play here because as of now hardly anyone does.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;2 other good ones.. .&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;1:  There is double exp on the test server! &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;2:  Raid and exp groups only require one person to be flagged for a locked zone for the entire raid/group to enter!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>
