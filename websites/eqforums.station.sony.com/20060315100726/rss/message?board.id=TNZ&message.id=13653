    <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;You list some issues which are being worked on and should be fixed soon.&amp;nbsp; I have posted that secondary forte should not be granting 200 to your secondary spec.&amp;nbsp; I will find out about the pet call AA and call of the ancients and let you know.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;As far as what shaman want, I read the huge thread on the old Newbie Zone, as did others on the team and there were no conclusions.&amp;nbsp; I also read many of the threads on the Shamans Crucible.&amp;nbsp; What I saw was a lot of ,the grass is greener, and class envy.&amp;nbsp; One email, from a prominent shaman even stated, we don't know what we want, we just want something.&amp;nbsp; That's not much information to go on.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Even here in this thread, I see division among shaman players, where what some perceive to be broken, others think is just fine.&amp;nbsp; You ask for statements and communication, while it is hard to comment when the message you are receiving is not unified and for the record the "What's a shaman" comment was meant as a joke. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As I stated when I started this position, I will listen, but that does not mean your ideas will be implemented. &amp;nbsp;It may be that nothing is changed with shaman in the near future but if you provide a comprehensive list of what exactly&amp;nbsp;shaman think does not work, I will pass it along.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I have been listening and will continue to do so.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Hey again, guys.&amp;nbsp; I figured I'd post another status check for (most) of the shaman.&amp;nbsp; Turtle_Pet probably still disagrees, but, ironically,&amp;nbsp;he's changing classes to something guilds want.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Pretty much the only reason I'm bothering to post here is that we had a lot of people that I know weren't members of the Crucible come out and post in support, so I figured I'd give you guys a status update!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;GoD has been out for a while now, as you well know.&amp;nbsp; People are getting to explore a few of the other zones.&amp;nbsp; Right now, most of the emphasis appears to be on the trials.&amp;nbsp; Sewer trials are 1-4, vexd trial is 5, tipt trial is 5.&amp;nbsp; I forget all the various names of 7-9, but they get harder.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;As the beta folks noted when the&amp;nbsp;confidentiality agreement&amp;nbsp;was over, mobs in GoD hit extremely hard and have low HP.&amp;nbsp; Trial mobs (the yard trash) in 5 and up hit for 1200s or so and double or triple.&amp;nbsp; The named in Trial 6 hits for 1800s and appears to be slowable by about 20%.&amp;nbsp; The nameds in trials 7+ aren't slowable at all, and hit 2200s or so.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Enter the shaman!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;As you may recall, higher end shaman were already talking about a major lack of healing.&amp;nbsp; Elemental planes mobs and hard LDoNs, let alone LDoN raids make shaman deficiencies painfully clear.&amp;nbsp; Noting the severe LACK of healing upgrades in GoD, we tried to get a little attention from SoE.&amp;nbsp; Our prayers have been answered.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Clearly, even the developers have noticed that healing isn't sufficient for GoD.&amp;nbsp; As a patch that went in a couple of days ago on the test server, heals have been increased for healing classes across the board.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The&amp;nbsp;numbers following the spells are&amp;nbsp;hp/mana.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Light of Order (pal) 935/440 1.0 cast time&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Changes on test:&amp;nbsp; 1000/430 1.0 cast time&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Holy Light (clr) 3050/660 3.75 cast time&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Changes on test:&amp;nbsp; 3275/650 3.75 cast time&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Sylvan Infusion (dru)&amp;nbsp;1925/550 3.5 cast time&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Changes on test:&amp;nbsp; 2100/550 3.5 cast time&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Sylvan Light (rng) 470/195 3.0 cast time&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Changes on test:&amp;nbsp; 525/195 3.0 cast time&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Tnarg's Mending (shm from PoP--no new heal in GoD)&amp;nbsp; 1300/450 3.75 cast time&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Changes on test: none&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Two classes got a new Heal Over Time (HoT) spell with GoD--shaman and clerics&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Holy Elixer (clr) 550/tic for 440 mana.&amp;nbsp; 4 tics. cast time 4.0&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Changes on test:&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Breath of Trushar (shm) 360/tic for 220 mana.&amp;nbsp; 4 tics.&amp;nbsp; cast time 6.0&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Changes on test: &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I must admit--I'm a bit stunned.&amp;nbsp; I wasn't really expecting a response.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I've erased this response twice.&amp;nbsp; I don't want to start bitching again.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Brenlo, bottom line, the shaman recognize that we're a utility class.&amp;nbsp; We comprise a huge number of different play styles.&amp;nbsp; We made that open letter detailing problems within the shaman community, but I think it was a bit of a mistake.&amp;nbsp; It has two major problems.&amp;nbsp; First, as a summary argument, it lacks all the detailed statistical proof that we had spread out across various other threads.&amp;nbsp; That means that a casual reader who wanders over and reads it will be thinking, "My god, what a bunch of whiny bastiges!"&amp;nbsp; Second, since we recognized that shaman is&amp;nbsp;a utility class, we offered potential solutions to just about every deficit category.&amp;nbsp; Perhaps we didn't make the introduction clear enough or emphasized it enough.&amp;nbsp; ALL of those changes would be vastly overpowered and unbalancing.&amp;nbsp; None of us want an EQ god--what would be the point?&amp;nbsp; No challange, no fun.&amp;nbsp; We categorically stated that changes in one or two areas would make the other suggestions moot.&amp;nbsp; We (perhaps mistakenly) assumed that SoE had some vision for shaman and would (hopefully) select those suggestions that (a) were not overpowering (b) were in line with SoE's vision of the class, but (c) had some marginal utility effect.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;As several of the other posters have noted, the vast majority of our frustration stems from a complete lack of communication.&amp;nbsp; There were some excellent suggestions in that thread.&amp;nbsp; Some very novel.&amp;nbsp; Some were, in my opinion, silly.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;One thing I requested in a number of feedbacks, emails, and posts (all of which were ignored), was that SOMEONE from SoE simply open up a line of communication with the shaman.&amp;nbsp; I honestly think the single best thing that can be done at the moment, especially since SoE doesn't appear to have any kind of vision for the shaman class, is to have a moderated chat of some kind.&amp;nbsp; As I noted, for maybe an hour or something, having a Customer Service Rep and a Developer in a live chat with the shaman is not a huge investment of time.&amp;nbsp; Not even all of the shaman--just a few representational shaman so you don't get spammed with tells.&amp;nbsp; I think the Crucible represents one of the largest, if not the largest, online shaman communties in the game.&amp;nbsp; If you honestly want to hear what we have to say, have an online chat with 3 or 4 of us from the Crucible.&amp;nbsp; We'll elect a couple of people to represent us and explain what's been going wrong.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Just please don't go radio silent on us for months again and leave us hanging in the wind.&amp;nbsp; I honestly was not kidding hearing from about 14 long-time high level shaman who've retired from this last expansion.&amp;nbsp; It's THAT bad for shaman right now.&amp;nbsp; We can't heal.&amp;nbsp; We can't provide half-way decent dps in short fights, and we can't really buff.&amp;nbsp; Our most effective use right now is to stand outside and focus groups going into trials.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;P&gt;Its ironic as hell that for 6 months we posted eloquently, reasonably, well thought out, without any passion, cold, mathmaticaly.... and got the response of :&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;"whats a shaman"&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;One post here blowing it out and using passion to call out certain SOE people that have otherwise ignored the shaman problem altogether .... gets a actual answer and some attention..&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;You may not agree with going off like I did but it sure got more attention and response&amp;nbsp;than everyones months of posting nicely.....&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;" If all else fails..... Use fresh tactics"&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>Brenlo,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It has been stated by SoE that you have people on the development team that play all classes.&lt;br&gt;Then you stated that there has been no consenus over what the Shaman need if anything.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ok well first what did those Shaman tell you?&lt;br&gt;Second what level of play at they at?&lt;br&gt;Have they done GoD trials?&lt;br&gt;What was their reaction to that?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our proposal was pretty clear and consise about what we could use.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I will try to simplify that into how I feel at this time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am a PRIEST class. First foremost this is what a Shaman is or at least WAS.&lt;br&gt;What do priests do? Well we heal mainly.&lt;br&gt;Whether some like that or not it is what the Shaman is and what the orignal design of us was.&lt;br&gt;Can a Shaman function as even a patch healer effectively in GoD? No.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No class envy no comparisons to muddle things. Simply we can not fufil the role of a Priest class in GoD.&lt;br&gt;We do not have DPS for short fights. Every expansion fights have become shorter.&lt;br&gt;We have basically in GoD have become a one trick pony.&lt;br&gt;We slow. Problem is the further you progress the less slow benfits you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We offer almost nothing to a group past a certain point but useless slows and inadequate heals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well you have two real solutions.&lt;br&gt;Increase Shaman's ability to heal.&lt;br&gt;Or completely remove slow immunity and remove mitagation from all but boss encounters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since the latter is not very likely to happen we have been requesting the former.&lt;br&gt;I think where you might get muddled is where we have offered suggestions on other areas we could stand improvements.&lt;br&gt;Areas that would give us more versitility and utility and thus making the needed healing changes less of an issue.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We don't all quite agree on how much of a healing change is needed or at what point it is needed.&lt;br&gt;We do agree it is needed though.&lt;br&gt;We have tried to offer suggestions but in the end we have to rely on you to fairly conduct game balance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Talking to us is a good start.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here is my opinion of what we need.&lt;br&gt;A heal over time that is a TRUE upgrade in GoD.&lt;br&gt;Breathe of Trusher is pretty much an insult for a heal with mobs quadding for 1000+&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some form of group heal spell.&lt;br&gt;It doesn't have to be killer just something that we can use even once in awhile.&lt;br&gt;Could be a direct heal, heal over time, it could even have a long 30-60 recast and use a decent amount of mana.&lt;br&gt;Personally I would like to see group forms of our heal over time spells.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We need an upgraded fast heal.&lt;br&gt;Tnarg does not cut it at 1300 when a mob is likely doing 3000+ a round either unslowed or mitagating.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We need a better cheal.&lt;br&gt;Ours is level 58 and never upgraded.&lt;br&gt;Completely ineffective at level 65 in GoD.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some will not agree with me on that. Maybe not all that is needed. It is however what I personally would like to see.&lt;br&gt;What I consider balance though is if there is going to be immune and mitagating mobs my healing needs to adequate enough for me to fuction as a healer under these conditions.&lt;br&gt;I don't have to be the "best" at that just ABLE to do it REASONABLY well if I HAVE to.&lt;br&gt;There you have it without a single class comparison.&lt;br&gt;I just want my abilities to balance with each other in current game content.&lt;br&gt;Which at this time they do not do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sorry if we have not been EXACT with what we want.&lt;br&gt;And sorry here for being a bit frustrated and insulting but you have a highly trained, highly paid (paid by us), developement and research staff.&lt;br&gt;We have informed you that there is a problem.&lt;br&gt;Offered our suggestions as best we can and in as reasonable a manner as we can.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are simply asking for a few things that should not be unreasonable.&lt;br&gt;1) You talk with us regarding the issue&lt;br&gt;2) You work with your research people to confirm or deny our results&lt;br&gt;3) Produce a fix based on the results of the above&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I will also add your humor has not been well appreciated.&lt;br&gt;Your witty comment of "What is a Shaman?" was pretty insulting even when you knew it was supposed to be humor.&lt;br&gt;There is also other nice little pokes at us which we have not found all that funny.&lt;br&gt;Shaman spell vendor in GoD (AS zone) named Hatem.&lt;br&gt;You see we are a bit frustrated and poking fun at our frustration just isnt that funny to us.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We will ask of you in good faith to at least discuss the matter with us openly and help us come to an equitable solution.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Thank you for at least responding, Brenlo.&amp;nbsp; I don't know that I appreciate the insults of using soul binders and the new tradeskill UI as examples of actively listening to the community.&amp;nbsp; I think we all have quite a bit hope of these things changing and even just simply responding in this thread shows you are heading in the right direction.&amp;nbsp; But in the long run you'll need to do more.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;While I'm sure the shaman spells in GoD were made with the best intentions they don't at all address shaman concerns.&amp;nbsp; A 2.1 minute dot that does roughly 25 dps on mobs that live for 30 seconds is worthless.&amp;nbsp; A 60 hp per tick upgrade to a spell that only healed 300 a tick to start with on trash mobs that hit for 1200+ did nothing for our healing ability.&amp;nbsp; Breath of Trushar is similar to what regrowth was when it was introduced and trash mobs hit for 80-100.&amp;nbsp; The new cannibalize spell is really a tremendous idea but making it our ancient in GoD seems to defy logic.&amp;nbsp; This is a much needed spell for every shaman where most classes get their slightly upgraded nukes as their ancient which is obviously less critical.&amp;nbsp; I think everyone, let alone shaman, can agree with the above.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;In order to stay a relevant class in the semi-high to high end game we need upgrades in our healing and dps departments.&amp;nbsp; We aren't requesting massive or even large upgrades here.&amp;nbsp; Breath of Trushar needs to be changed to 500 a tick in order to be considered a heal over time.&amp;nbsp; 350 mana seems fair as this still leaves shaman slightly behind clerics in heal per tick and slightly ahead in HoT effeciency.&amp;nbsp; While this would certainly be helpful we still need a fast heal that is capable of keeping a rampage tank or even the main tank alive for one mob if the cleric/druid goes down.&amp;nbsp; A 1750 heal for 525 mana would still leave us well behind druids and clerics but would at least slightly fill the ever growing gap.&amp;nbsp; Replace Plague of Deluda with an 1100 nuke that casts in 6 seconds for 375 mana.&amp;nbsp; This still leaves us the worst nuker of any casting class but again slightly fills the gap in dps.&amp;nbsp; Make the nuke our ancient and make the new cannibalize accessible to more shaman.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Some shaman might ask for more, some less but I think this is a good medium.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; These aren't huge upgrades.&amp;nbsp; Shaman would still be a distant 3rd in healing power and at the bottom of the dps chain.&amp;nbsp; I've heard concern that upgrades would possibly unbalance the lower end&amp;nbsp;game but GoD spells only drop in GoD and are no drop so they will really only benefit the higher end shaman who desperately need help.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;Brenlo, I am a tad embarrassed for you and by association SOE. In a page of logical discussion about the limitations affecting shaman atm in THE current game progression path (Gates of Discord) your only reply lashes out and touts the implementation of &lt;EM&gt;wonderful changes&lt;/EM&gt; that (1) either no one cares about, (2) have been asked about since game creation and finally added, albeit rather flawed, and (3) in no way, shape or form makes an attempt to discuss or answer the questions, comments raised in this thread. This from the SOE representative. I am not sure what you were attempting to "diffuse" by finally commenting, but your style and comments just exponentially raised the level of belief by shaman that SOE has (1) no clue about shaman class problems, (2) doesn't care what&amp;nbsp;shaman class problems are, and, (3) have no intention of taking the day-to-day experience and knowledge of their shaman player base into account in defining what those&amp;nbsp;problems are. Frankly, if all you have to say is indicated by your post to this thread, you should not post.&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The shaman players fully understand the difficulties in keeping a game progressing that provides challenging content for players. What we do not understand is why that progression has focused on limiting to the point of extinction a single class of the game. Clerics complained about only being able to heal and have been given tools that make them a viable dps class. Druids complained about groupability and have been given enhanced tools that allow them to fill the role of primary healer/strong secondary healer. Paladins complained about limitiations of their class and have become significant tanks, buffers and healers. The list goes on until we get to shaman.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The&amp;nbsp;core ability we bring to the show is offset by new game mechanics (slow mitigation) and an increased number of totally unslowable mob encounters. This doesn't even take into account the abysmal resist rates of slow on ALL mobs. Frankly that is fine and I don't know many shaman who are against the idea of encounter changes as long as (1) we still have a role to play and (2) that role is as effective in a group as anyone else. To be clear on this, shaman are not complaining about the changes to the game. Shaman are complaining because these changes nullify our class existance.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Our buffs are moot at this level as melee stats are either maxxed or close to maximum. Our heals are sub-par in relation to damage intake. Unslowable mobs take away our class defining role. Mitigating mobs severely marginalize our class defining ability&amp;nbsp;allowing shaman&amp;nbsp;to be&amp;nbsp;replaced by other classes that can handle the slowing while contributing more effective tools to the group. Our dps contribution is non-existant for all pratical purposes. Shaman have tons of high damage spells - on paper. None of those spells are reasonably contributive in the events/groups due to long cast times, marginal direct damage, length of time for full damage effect and aggro on the caster.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Here is an irony embedded in all the shaman arguments for improvements: while pointing out the current uselessness of our heal spells to keep up with incoming damage, every serious comment/recommendation has pointed out we do not want to supplant druids as the 2ndary healing class. Inherently, shaman understand the need by SOE to find valid roles for each class. Druids needed the upgrades they received to find a spot as a desired grouping class. We do not contest that. Shaman were glad to see it happen. That said, this ironic position may be confusing yall on the seriousness of our complaints. That we understand and welcome and, perhaps even, commend the changes other classes have received to help them and can view changes to our class that would negate those benefits to other classes ... it does not mean we are conceding anything. On the one hand we are pointing out the obvious: SOE changed other classes significantly to increase their effectiveness while, either through lack of change or minimalized token additions, reducing the effectiveness of shaman as a class and as a contribution to game progression. Lot of words there to point out that since PoP, excluding LDoN, shaman have been severely NERFED.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Given that the planners/developers at SOE are not idiots we get back to the unanswered questions that are frustrating shaman: what is the vision of the shaman by SOE? What changes can we expect to either the game or the class to give us a viable contributory role? That is all we want to know. If that answer is that shaman are being phased out by the developing content then fine, tell us that so we know. If that answer is these questions are being looked at in development meetings and a plan is being worked out then, fine, tell us that so we know. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;In short, Brenlo,&amp;nbsp;to make a single post and not even address the topic, but rather tell us the world is perfect because there are portals in PoK and a new tradeskill UI is an insult to us and, should be, an embarrassment to you.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;---------------------------&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;While I was writing the above you posted again, Brenlo. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;If, as you have stated, you are following key shaman threads and have discussed these and come to the point of "no conclusions" then I have to ask what are you missing? Is your deciding factor a single email from "a prominent shaman"? The threads on this topic are numerous and many of them give statistical/comparitive analysis of the exact problems shaman are facing. Not seeing does not make it non-conclusive.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Shaman are not whining about the grass being greener or class envy. As posted above, shaman recognize roles each class plays. Considering shaman were a definite group role class for much of EQ we know, better than most, what that means. There is no desire to take anything away from classes that have been changed to finally have a group role. But, that those changes have resulted in our role being taken away from us is a major concern.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Making sure secondary forte does not cap at 200 is a fix to code that should of not existed in the first place and once fixed will not grant shaman any benefit. Promising to look into something that you previously promised to look into is not confidence building to shaman. It either means you lied about looking into it previously or that the question you raised previously has not been addressed which further convinces us that shaman are not just on the back burner ... we are completely off the stove!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Application is the benchmark you need to view regarding what is perceived&amp;nbsp;as broken and not broken. GoD being the topic this thread addresses means that GoD is the benchmark. Those shaman who are hitting 65 and completely happy soloing named in Crushbone saying their abilities are awesome are not even on the same topic as the point of this thread: GoD and shaman niche in the expanison. Those not in GoD facing these problems cannot have an opinion with any validity. It really is that simple.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Your claim that "What's a shaman?" was a joke really drives the point home. That question, "What's a shaman?" is THE question we are asking at this point in the game. As pointed out, (1) are we a buffer? No, buffs are marginal at the high end of game as most melee stats are maxxed out with gear. (2) are we a healer? No, a healer repairs damage at a higher rate than sustained - we can not do that. (3) are we THE slower? No, mitigation and unslowable mobs prevent shaman from being THE slower. For mitigating mobs other classes bring more utility to a group that realistically requires the group to prefer the other class to the shaman. (4) are we dps? No, our damage output vs length of fight is laughable. Cleric summoned pets outdamage shaman in an effort expended/results obtained scenario.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;No one expects complete implementaton of all our ideas. Shaman were a diverse class of numerous tools that could be played various ways to acheive the same end result. That utility has evaporated. Suggestions on what specifically needs to be changed varies based on how the individual played their shaman. But here is the key: each and every shaman in GoD, while not on the same page about what should change, are equally serious about changes being needed. There is universal agreement that shaman in GoD have no role that consistantly contributes or that cannot be&amp;nbsp;accomplished better by other classes&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;succeed&amp;nbsp;in GoD&amp;nbsp;trial events.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;As for providing a comprehensive list .. HELLO!! How many more lists do you need? How comprehensive does it have to be? You have them or access to them if, as you said, you are visiting the crucible.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Brenlo, I highly suggest you take the time and effort to communicate frequently with the shaman community on the crucible. You will deal with apathy, frustration and anger initially, but that will be short lived once the community recognized you are actually interested in determining if/what problems exist. Shaman are faced with extinction as an effective contributory class in GoD. Key word here is contributory. We want our role in this expansion. We want to contribute. If you want the answers to the&amp;nbsp;problems, take the time to come to us and work with us on those problems. Posting ocassionally that PoK portal stones have balanced the game and shows the depth and scope of SOE's commitment to making major changes to the game is not convincing us.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#3399ff&gt;Well said, Brenlo.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#3399ff&gt;Reading these posts, I hear Shamans saying things like 'No one cares about BoT'.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#3399ff&gt;Well, I hate to burst your bubble, but the vast majority of Shamans do, because they NEVER PROGRESS PAST IT.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#3399ff&gt;Most players aren't in EP. They aren't in Time. They aren't in GoD.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#3399ff&gt;ALL healing classes need GoD level upgrades. But there is NO reason to unbalance a larger portion of the game just to make a few dozen of a particular class feel 'needed'. (Not that spam heals aren't needed in things like the Ikkinz trials, from what I hear. Or that the best slow in the game isn't useful on stuff that quads for 1300+.)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;That was almost exactly my point back during the first Shammy cry for upgrades.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;But GoD is a bit different, and because of spells being handled differently, I think they could actually drop a few beneficial spells that will benefit the hundreds that are in that part of the game and have little to no affect on the thousands who really don't need it.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;If the choice was to just upgrade Tnargs or something like that, I'd still defy it, but if another spell dropped deep in a GoD zone that most folks like me would never see... I think that would be a good change.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

(Maybe a little beefed up) What are shamans up through the "middle" (we'll say) of Discord using... a Kunark era heal... and it's over time. Taking that out and using Tnarg's... against anything unslowed (and even more than 1 slowed) in Tier 2 PoP or later, a shaman has to chain cast it for it to be even remotely effective.  It's basically "Malo, Slow, chain Tnarg's"... there is no time to regen mana in there at all because shaman mana regen is active (unlike druid/cleric passive mana regen) and the shaman cannot cast ANYTHING else while they do that.  With 1 mob in BoT, I can heal semi-well, depends on the tank, but with ANY adds... not a chance, it's just too pitiful to do anything worthwhile.</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Brenlo,&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Yes SoE/Verant/Red eye entertainment/989 has listened and adapted to player ideas. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Sadly you have had the companies name changed/bought out more times and with greater speed than your implimentations of player feedback have taken place.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Ever hurt yourself and had to go to the ER/ Paitent first?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;You remember the waiting. While in pain. Watching as the next person then the next then the next go ahead of you because they were more serious or important?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Welcome to the shamans point of view. The last thing we heard from you was. "Whats a shaman"&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The last thing we have seen was our upgraded change on Lucy. Went from 360 heal to 370. With a&amp;nbsp; 60 mana increase. Then had that 10 hit points healed taken away and the mana cost remained at the new higher rate. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The last time shaman got all thier Ducks in a row and actually were united enough to form a well thought out and reasonable petition/post. We were soundly ignored.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The last Dev that popped by the shaman board aknowledged something was messed up with our Pet call AA in GoD. And It has not been fixed yet. Nor was there any real explination of what it was even supposed to do. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Our in game description of Call of the aincients says it is a stamina regen. But it is a hit point regen in useage. Which is correct?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The secondary forte AA says that it will be capped at 100. Yet people have said that it has gone to 200.. So what it broken?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I will let you in on a little clue here sparky. The people who actually play shaman. (please not not the bots, or the uber powergamers who use the shaman class as a means to an end) are some of the most supportive people who play this game. We have to be to play a game and a class that is a support role, with so many attention and time consuming details that entail the class to shine. We have clicked the canna button 5 billion times. and slowed and healed and done anything we could have to make the game fun for ourselves and hundreads of thousands of other people. We the shaman of this little virtual world of big boobs and critters and creatures and DPS and Cheal chains, are sick and **bleep** tired of being marginalized, ignored, patted on the head and told be a good kid and go play in traffic.&amp;nbsp; We are pissed, and lots of the folks that are pissed don't bother to type out all this stuff they just stop logging on. And the people left behind have less fun with thier friends gone. And the community of EQ dies a little more each day. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Get some **bleep** work done and start talking to the communities. Not holding court with a bunch of yes men or suckups. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;You list some issues which are being worked on and should be fixed soon.&amp;nbsp; I have posted that secondary forte should not be granting 200 to your secondary spec.&amp;nbsp; I will find out about the pet call AA and call of the ancients and let you know.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;As far as what shaman want, I read the huge thread on the old Newbie Zone, as did others on the team and there were no conclusions.&amp;nbsp; I also read many of the threads on the Shamans Crucible.&amp;nbsp; What I saw was a lot of ,the grass is greener, and class envy.&amp;nbsp; One email, from a prominent shaman even stated, we don't know what we want, we just want something.&amp;nbsp; That's not much information to go on.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Even here in this thread, I see division among shaman players, where what some perceive to be broken, others think is just fine.&amp;nbsp; You ask for statements and communication, while it is hard to comment when the message you are receiving is not unified and for the record the "What's a shaman" comment was meant as a joke. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As I stated when I started this position, I will listen, but that does not mean your ideas will be implemented. &amp;nbsp;It may be that nothing is changed with shaman in the near future but if you provide a comprehensive list of what exactly&amp;nbsp;shaman think does not work, I will pass it along.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I have been listening and will continue to do so.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Brenlo,&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Thank you for replying.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;You see divison amongst shaman players. This is certainly true. When shaman are spread across the gamut of all EQ has to offer we might appear to be fine. I mean. If I as a level 65 shaman with 378 aa's and bazzar level gear head to seblis. I am fine. More than fine actually. But if I head to GoD and the trials. Or Hard missions in LDON. Well.. That is a different story.&amp;nbsp; There shaman are not at all fine.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Shamans greatest strength all throughout EQ's history has been one thing. Over time. Heals over time. Damage mitagation over time (Through slows) And Damage to monsters over time. By way of dots. All of this has a common component. Duration of fights. A cleric can heal a standard fight with a big C heal and maybe a smaller heal if things go awry. They can mitagate a little by way of nukes and or stuns. If stuff goes wrong they can res. A druid can ensure singles pulled and speed up fights with superior nukes and a get out of death free card if something goes wrong by way of an evvac. The strength tho is in the heals of both classes. Shaman can keep up with heals if slows land off the bat, and the tank doesnt take too much damage or lose aggro.&amp;nbsp;But the strength is based not off the heals. But the slows. And Slows are resisted.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;In a nutshell. I feel that shaman need a couple of things. A better blast heal found in GoD. In the first set of trials. Or purchased or quested for. In content that shaman can resonably be able to attempt with the spells we have now. These numbers have been tossed around on the shamans crucible all over the place. But I would feel a fair asking would be a 1750 hp heal For 525 mana or so. And a 3 second cast time and 200 range. A upgrade to Tnarqs. But not even close to what a druid and cleric get due to the ability of a shaman to mitagate so much damage through slow.&amp;nbsp; The second is to allow shaman to get back into the healing over time role that we first had before clerics. Breath of trushar is a good idea not taken far enough. 475 hit points healed per tick, for 6 ticks base for 280 mana or so. 100 range. That would give shaman a good longer term heal that they can apply before we get into the Tnarqs chain. With those two things and yourself or others coming to talk with shaman. We would shut the heck up. While people would continue to grumble about the addition of a disease dot that takes 2.1 minutes to run it's full course. Or the making of our canna upgrade the aincent spell. they would be grumbles. Not people yelling and screaming. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;First and foremost shaman are supposed to be the healers of the less civilized races. Let us do our job properly, please&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;With the current playstyle and leanings that the game has developed into. The game has been sped up beyond our tools that SoE has given us to cope. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;When a monster is pulled into camp, shaman are expected to do what one major thing. Slow the monster. Every monster. As fast as aggro allows. Why is this? Because once slowed a monster is much less of a threat. It makes the monsters damage slow to a crawl. that Enables shaman to heal the much lesser output of damage with thier heals over time (Both regen and Torpor/Quesance line) And if we have spiked damage a quick blast heal by way of Tnarqs. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Against a fully slowed monster. shaman can keep up. Even in GoD. But in GoD. It is very very hard to do so. Because much of the time we get stuck in a tnarq chain. We get a resist on slow. and the tank is in Ahhhhh crap range. So we spam a Tnarqs. And it just doesnt do enough.So we spam another praying that we get a crit so we have time to try another slow. Once in that chain.&amp;nbsp;If we get lucky. The monster dies. Before the tank dies. If we are unlucky the tank dies. Despite shaman spamming thier best heal spell for the situation.&amp;nbsp; This risk is what hurts shaman. We don't want to be the reason 5 other people are not having fun.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Bring slow mitagation into the equation and shaman are just not good enough healers. for the new content. So people start looking for someone who can slow and offer more to the makeup in the group since we have limited group slots, they only make do if none of the other classes are around. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Do shaman have to be in every group? No. But if I am in a group I want to be able to contribute like I used to. By being effective.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Bleh this is all over the place. I am not the best to be bringing all this to the table. I am passionate about the class. But my organazation stinks. Please Brenlo. head over to the shamans crucible. read the one voice post again. Stickied at the top of the general page. And then talk to the shaman there. They are good people. And they deserve much more than being left feeling like they are twisting in the wind. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Brenlo,&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Let me help you understand why there is so much confusion.The shaman class is a complex class, we have many tools we can use, we have many duties we can perform and we have many options.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;This results in the fact that some shamans like our solo power, some like to duo and some like to group or raid.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Our current situation is different for these 4 types of shaman.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Solo'ers and players who duo are fine, they have what they need and in fact a shaman is one of the better classes for this kind of playstyle.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The raiding shaman is also fine until you happen to be the third (or higher) shaman on a raid, we do not stack well in a raid and I think you know this. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;However the major frustration you see here, on the shaman boards and even in game is from the grouping situation at the high end level of the game.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The average casual shaman is ok (not fine but ok as he is somewhere in the middle of the pack of the various classes) but at the high end things change.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The high end shaman finds himself facing mobs that mitigate slow or who are even slow imune, this shaman groups with players who all have maxed stats, this shaman encounters high DPS mob that have low HP (a mob type that does not allow our main source of damage (DoT's)&amp;nbsp;to work to the full extend) and this shaman now encounters missions and tasks where we are no longer able to perform as a healer.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;What we asked was that someone from the live team freed up some time to look into this, THAT is why we stated that WE do not know what we want to change (as we believed it was better to state what we felt was wrong and leave the correction in the hands of the devs) and that is also why you will see people stating that THEY are doing fine.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Because they are doing fine, they just do not encounter the problems the high end shamans face (not yet I should say).&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;If the live team needs our input we are more then willing to give this to them, if they want our opinion we are more then willing to tell them what we think and even if they want idea's we can provide them. However WE can not solve this, in the end the live team and the devs have to decide what they want to change.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;And&amp;nbsp;WHEN (as I hope you guys can at least free up some time to post at the crucible about what you want from us) you look into this feel free to come over, after all we do not cry this hard because we are against you (even when that seems hard at times when you ignore us or joke about us) but because we feel a lot for the little toons we use in this online world. Why else would I have invested so much time into a character that atm is no fun to play and would I ask for a change instead of just canceling my accounts (I have&amp;nbsp;5 and&amp;nbsp;on them I have most classes at level 65) and move to the next game.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;hr&gt;Brenlo wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;You list some issues which are being worked on and should be fixed soon.  I have posted that secondary forte should not be granting 200 to your secondary spec.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The problem is, despite my lack of having it, or even caring about it. If secondary forte only allows the second specialize to go to 100, I don't know about people that gain 45-60 minute AAs, but it seems a bit expensive (15AA) for the second specialize to only go to 100. Which brings up another question though, what about the people that managed to get it over 100? Will they get reverted? If so, will they (and everyone) be refunded the 15AA for the relatively useless ability if it only goes to 100?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;During beta, it cost 10, and only going to 100, seemed rather fair. When it went live, the cost was raised to 15, the cap was bugged (now fixed apparently), but is now 15aa for 100 in a second specialize? I feel sorry for anyone who wasted the time (see: gaining the AA) to get it now unless they somehow managed to get it over 100 and it's still there now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Experience may come faster for those in the elemental planes and further, but for those of us that find raiding boring, the same 5 LDoN zones (with 4 possible variations) incredibly dull, and are stuck in some of the "unlocked by level PoP zones", it comes MUCH slower (and painfully slow in adventures, more danger should mean higher experience gains, no? Unfortunately, sitting in a safe spot in [insert PoP zone here] nets higher experience than moving around inside an LDoN zone, and with all the traps, boxes, etc... the danger level is much higher, but for about 1/4th the reward).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While dungeons are a great way to break the monotony to a point, even those get insanely monotonous, and they have been for me since the end of September 2003. I've hit a proverbial glass ceiling and was hoping Discord might hold something to hold my interest for a little bit... unfortunately that's not true. At this stage, either I grind out LDoN (/yawn), go solo (/yawn, multiplayer game, going solo, no, boring), go raid (/snore), , get a bunch of friends together and do something fun (95% of the time, if they're on, it's for a raid, and they're gone again, yeah, that's fun /snore), or do something fun outside EQ.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I felt like responding on one more thing, I would do this on the site but I cannot.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I can understand that some of the folks from the Crucible think they are representing the majority of Shamans, and that somehow, the majority is always right.&amp;nbsp; Unfortunately, some posters there have also shown great immaturity when it comes to dealing with those who disagree, myself included.&amp;nbsp; I think that these kind of attitudes have.. well, kept opposition from posting on their site.&amp;nbsp; I've looked at some of the messages there and think one of the most productive things the folks on the Crucible could do is promote a more open minded discussion on these issues.&amp;nbsp; I respect many of the folks there, but when they turn into children because they don't get their way, it sure doesn't make anyone want to help them.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;One person, on a post about this thread, was talking about how they were in such a rage they couldn't possibly respond constructively...&amp;nbsp; What in hell do&amp;nbsp;they have to be enraged about?&amp;nbsp; It is a game, and I think&amp;nbsp;every *faction* of the shaman dispute might need to come together, both educated naysayers (moreso than myself)&amp;nbsp;and pro-upgrade, to work on something.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;In the last shaman thread, I went and presented my own arguments, from my point of view.&amp;nbsp; When corrected, I acknowledged that, but when I wouldn't back down... the "children" began flinging insults (not just at myself) and lost their ability to logically reason why I was wrong.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Many stayed above it and kudos to them.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I'm going to tell you though, unless you can get the reins on the community (listen to Litgruv, he's got the right ideas on how to encourage change) and can make a steady argument for why things need to change, you're not likely to get much attention from anyone but other posters.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Here is what honestly needs to change:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;1. Stop talking about Beastlords, or any other class... Focus on our class.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;2. Don't turn into toddlers when people disagree... convince them otherwise or just walk away.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;3. Don't use arguments that&amp;nbsp;you can tell the Dev team doesn't care about.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;"We haven't had many upgrades since Kunark." "Yeah, so?"&amp;nbsp; Prove you need the upgrades!&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;"We haven't had a new, good slow, since 51." "Well, you can tell we think slow is overpowering considering we made so many mitigating mobs... next?"&amp;nbsp;Look to new solutions there, slow isn't likely to get better or more powerful. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;"We want to do more damage!"&amp;nbsp; "Exactly how much more damage do you think you need?"&amp;nbsp; Define it, prove that is what is holding us back, without comparing to others but not stepping on their toes.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;"We need better heals!" "Nah, we've got other healing classes, we think you're where you belong."&amp;nbsp; Prove them wrong.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;4. Don't complain, don't attack,&amp;nbsp;and put a leash&amp;nbsp;on those who do.&amp;nbsp; You'll show stronger ability to reason and think and you'll do better at proving your points.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I remember the letter that was put together by the Shaman community... and, I do have to say it was not that convincing, because it lacked the arguments and the support that went into making the document.&amp;nbsp; A whole page full of notes and thoughts would be condensed into one little line, and it was too broad reaching for the folks up there to grasp it.&amp;nbsp; It was a good effort, but someone needed to stand up and say "This is the unanimous direction that the Shaman community wants to go in, and this is how we shall try to accomplish it."&amp;nbsp; The document before was more of "We know we need something, this is what we think we need, you guys figure out what is best" and that wasn't likely to work.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So go back to the Crucible, find some direction, let some people come in and tell you where you're making mistakes or that they think it is bad ideas and find a logical way to counter every argument they bring.&amp;nbsp; It was not me or the few who disagreed on TNZ who prevented a single thing from happening, it is a remainingly divided Shaman community that could not become focused on a single direction.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Honestly?&amp;nbsp; The shaman class, as listed in its own description, is supposed to be the ultimate support class.&amp;nbsp; The situation as the game has progressed has nullified that in some situations... buffs are useless, slow is mitigated, and so on... so, considering that and the fact that in mine and others opinions that a 65, non raiding shaman, regular LDoN/BoT etc, remains a balanced and desired&amp;nbsp;entity, find some solutions for the consideration for those who are at a disadvantage.&amp;nbsp; And find some focus, take that original letter and vote on one of the topics in that... and let that mark the new direction for the class.&amp;nbsp; More dps, better heals, better buffs... whatever, and then enforce it and prove the need and application of it.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I just want to note, I am not saying the original letter was bad... it wasn't and I commend the efforts of those who made it, but it did turn out to be unconvincing for those who do not read every other post on the Crucible.&amp;nbsp; There was lots of thoughts and theories and expectations and hopes for change, but not really that much evidence or real solutions and speculation on application of those solutions.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Good luck.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;And yes, I am still playing my shaman =)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;When trying to make a point about the lack of maturity the "other side"&amp;nbsp; displays it might be a good idea to not repeatedly call them children and, in essence, display the same lack by taking shots at people who disagreed with you. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The only way to show your maturity in such matters is to not acknowledge their lack of it at all. Be the bigger person, drop it and walk away. Dwelling makes you just as guilty.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;I gotta agree with Litgruv on this one inspite of my irritation.&amp;nbsp; Calling them stupid and other insults don't really help.&amp;nbsp; (sorry if I went off in my first couple of posts!)&amp;nbsp; Just class balance on macro terms is complicated as hell.&amp;nbsp; Throw in the coding difficulties of patching a program that's grown exponentially over several years?&amp;nbsp; /shudder.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The folks coding and designing aren't stupid.&amp;nbsp; God, they'd have to be fricking geniuses to keep up.&amp;nbsp; That's probably where the problem is.&amp;nbsp; The game has gotten so complex that they CAN'T keep it all in mind--thus you get some substantial inequities.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;What does suck&amp;nbsp;is that SoE completely ignores their playerbase and keeps&amp;nbsp;along chugging with blinders on--they don't respond to, communicate with, or acknowledge player communications not directly involved with, "I'm stuck and I can't move".&amp;nbsp; They only fix what they know about (eventually), but they keep the blinders firmly in place so they don't have to know about too much.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
