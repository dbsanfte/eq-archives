<P>Thanks for posting Prathun.&nbsp; It is nice to see a response now and again.&nbsp; Sounds good though&nbsp; =P&nbsp; JOKING.</P>
<P>Since you are obviously reading a bit, please look through our other posts.&nbsp; This class needs SOMETHING.</P>
<P>I can see your point on this one, but maybe 5 minutes would work if not 15, since it is single cast, that could not get in the way, however this spell is not my main focus, although i would have liked to see a bit longer duration, and a bit more damage. Anyway, been awhile since I thought about this not so useful spell (usuable situationally when mhing a good group in moderate or less zone where the extra 300 mana per cast is not going to drain the mana pool.</P>
<P>Panther can be applied to an entire raid and increase dps by how much?&nbsp;&nbsp; Why did druids not get such a spell like this, since already we coudl not buff as well, debuff as well, heal about the same, now dps as well as.&nbsp; Anyway, hope you read through the other posts.&nbsp;&nbsp; You will see some infighting, but I think there are enough stats tied in throughout that the frustration of all druids at this point should be apparent (even those couple who disagree with or dislike others).</P>
<P>As it is, most druids have not gotten a group over a shammy or other dps class in eons.&nbsp; As it is, now high end melee dps now leave raid groups with only a druid in it if they can get in one iwth a bard and/or shammy.&nbsp; Anyway, the whole picture, healing (ours particularly) , our utility, our dps, debuffs, buffs, what we offer a group is way below par. </P>
<P>I can't tell you how many druids I know (and they dont' even see this "face" from me), are frustrated to the point the rarely get on anymore, are switching mains, get on but dread it and logged depressed because they cannot even get a guild group. One druid in my whole guild at this point doesn't have problems getting groups, and that is cause that druid is&nbsp; 3/4 boxed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, the wide open zones of tss helped a bit and when the expansion first came out, was easier, but now that people can see that other classes dps is so far above ours, shammies can heal just as well (which is fine imo), dps a heck of alot better, debuff better (in addition slow), buff better (in addition can haste), who in thier right mind is going to take a druid over a shammy?</P>
<P>I don't say these things in game, cause if I tell people and let them know the true situation, I would never get a group for dpsing or my utility, only potentially last choice for a healer when none other available.</P>
<P>Anyway, hope something is being done fast.&nbsp; As it is, am having trouble trying to keep a couple very sweet 5-6 year playing druids from quitting right now.</P>
<P>I don't expect a response to this, so no need to post.</P>
<P>Again, just wanted to thank you though for actually reading one/some of the posts.&nbsp; That right there gives some hope to a few of us.</P>
