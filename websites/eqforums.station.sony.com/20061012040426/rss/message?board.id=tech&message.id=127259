    <description>&lt;DIV&gt;i keep having this problem when i train mobs, or run thru and area getting aggro messages or some other messages my hard drive writes and i lag for about .5 second. i remember there being a post about this a month or so back. i didnt have the problem then so i paid it no mind. But now i have it and it seems worse since 9.0c. does anyone remember this or have similar issue? this all started about 2 months ago. since 9.0c patch its really noticable mobs never used to catch me , now they are killing me. if anyone can point me to that thread or knows about this please post&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>That's likely the Personal Journal writing the text that the creature says/emotes to a document on your harddrive.  You can disable this by pressing Alt-J (if I recall correctly) and uncheck the box on the upper left corner of that window.</description>
