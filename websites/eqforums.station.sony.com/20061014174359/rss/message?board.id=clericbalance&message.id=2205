      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal 0in auto? mso-margin-top-alt: mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; 0pt; **Zowie**?MARGIN: justify; TEXT-ALIGN:&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Cleric &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;1. Fix&amp;nbsp;our DoD AA and spells &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;a. Gift of Mana and Abundant Healing seem to interfere with each other, resulting in some clerics never getting&amp;nbsp;GoM or AH to trigger. Also, Abundant Healing could use a different icon since it's a heal over time. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(The issue between GoM and AH is being looked into.&amp;nbsp; As per the HoC Dev Chat in October: "The stacking problems are due to some pretty core mechanics within the spell system and are taking some time to unravel.")&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;b. Ward of Purity could be on a separate timer (currently on the same timer as healing wards), should cure every ticks and not every other two ticks, and could use a different icon too. Probably overpriced for what it does.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;c. The description of Desperate Renewal is wrong, or the spell is bugged and doesn't cure. If it was not intented to cure, its mana cost probably deserve to be tuned down a bit.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;2. Please reevaluate a cleric non-healing skills and abilities.&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt; (Currently being discussed) - Most likely this will be considered as part of the class re-envisioning&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Most classes offer more than a single role to a group, or even if limited to DPS only, can fill several group slots and stack. Clerics lack this flexibility, due to the lack of healing being able to stack (there is no value to over healing).&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;a. Give clerics some capability to stop runners. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Ward spells allow cleric to solo content (albeit inefficiently) when waiting for a group. However our dps drops dramatically when a mob begins to run. Suggestions include a strong but short root, lower the chance our procs have to break root, or a spell to make mobs not wanting to run.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;b. Cleric melee was an addition to replace lost value in being the sole healer for a great deal of content. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Please make sure this ability scales as well as the role we lost. While the proc is a unique concept, it is static. Either itemization needs to be much better, or code written to replace the summoned hammers with a castable proc that will work with any weapon/item and scale with levels. The second part of this is the base melee skill has never been reviewed since the original game release. There is no valid reason for non-melee classes to continue to be punished with non-existent melee skills. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;c. Our undead DoTs were originally added via expansions. Many clerics question the reason for this since they are not as efficient as out DD spells of similar levels, however ALL other classes with both DoT and DD spells show a clear pattern of the DoTs exceeding the DD efficiency, even for DDs of higher spell levels. Why aren’t cleric DoTs similar in this regard? Also, why is our DoT spell range reduced? Suggestions for improvement include normalizing the above, and/or consideration of changing the basic nature of undead spells to be more of an «anti evil», including both undead and demonic/summoned/corrupted model types (and removing the anti summoned spells of clerics and other classes and replacing them with this new single spell set as well)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;d. Please give clerics some clear ability to perform a non-healing group role. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Clerics in a group setting that does not require healing are a clear hindrance if another healing class of similar level and equipment is available. The above changes would affect this greatly, or some other idea, such as a CC related role, or new spells/abilities to assist the group as a whole (chant style spells similar to bardic magic, that would require the cleric to focus on one task, but aid the group)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;e. Cleric (as well as all caster) skills have not risen at all since Kunark until OoW (with the exception of adding bash to the class). &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Please re-evaluate the use of skills for clerics, and the relative value of skills compared to other classes (why does a cleric with the same skills hit less often and for less damage than a melee class?)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;3. Please evaluate the defensive skills and abilities of clerics. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(Currently being discussed) - Most likely this will be considered as part of the class re-envisioning&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Due to data that we as players cannot see, a similarly equipped cleric/knight will have varying results on actual damage taken (not hit rate, which is controlled by secondary skills, but actual damage per hit) It is our belief that clerics have enough real penalties due to lack of secondary skills (riposte, parry, AA), that also having soft caps and tables that lead to different results with the same skills is excessive and detrimental. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;4. Please add group versions of our buffs at all levels. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(Currently being discussed)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Our AC buffs and Vie spell lines still don't have a group version. Also the AC buffs could use a little upgrade.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;5. Make AotZ Stack with Focus. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The paladin self buff is quite similar to the cleric self buff. As the paladin buff stacks with focus it seems reasonable that the cleric buff should likewise stack with focus.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;If clerics are asked to perform a more melee centric role to solo/add to a group, then this extra survivability will benefit us as well as it does both paladins and Shadow knights in current content. Both classes self buff now stack with the Focus line. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;6. Improve stun line, increase level caps. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The main problem here being that lower level stuns in the 50s do not work post 55 (as paladin stuns do), also the secondary effects (DD + pushback) make using these spells undesirable in much content. Finally, the excessive recast delays (that other classes with stuns do not have as severely as clerics) again reduce the use of these spells. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=time_text&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;7. Add more lore and quests related to religion &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0066ff&gt;(NEW)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=time_text&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;At lower level clerics can&amp;nbsp;see how their chosen race and religion impact their EQ life. They can complete specific quests (symbol), and must take faction into account. As they level up, religion no longer make any difference. We would like to see&amp;nbsp;religion matter again in the game, with new deity-specific quests and items for instance.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;8. Please increase the range of our group heals. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(Currently being discussed)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;There is an inconsistency between range of our Divine Arbitration abilities (AA and on epic) and the range of group heals that are used after arbitrating to heal the group. Also, the short range is really annoying, in particular with recent encounters that involve huge models and AoE rampage. Finally, it would be a step toward reducing the number of healers required in raid.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;9. Upgrade our group elixir spell. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Ethereal Elixir is our only groups heal over time spell. It is more and more in dire need of an upgrade, as average hitpoints in a group has more than doubled since it was introduced. An upgrade to our Celestial Regeneration AA line would also be a noticeable help.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;10. Make healing power of clerics scale more with gear. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Cleric is one of the classes that relies the less on gear to perform its role in a group. There isn’t much incentive for clerics to acquire gear, particularly at the high-end, other than to increase HP and mana. These are indeed a bonus to the well-geared cleric, but don’t make a big difference in a group. Worse geared clerics can often perform equally well, which diminishes the accomplishment of acquiring gear.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

Suggestions include a strong but short root, lower the chance our procs have to break root, or a spell to make mobs not wanting to run.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;b. Cleric melee was an addition to replace lost value in being the sole healer for a great deal of content. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Please make sure this ability scales as well as the role we lost. While the proc is a unique concept, it is static. Either itemization needs to be much better, or code written to replace the summoned hammers with a castable proc that will work with any weapon/item and scale with levels. The second part of this is the base melee skill has never been reviewed since the original game release. There is no valid reason for non-melee classes to continue to be punished with non-existent melee skills. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;c. Our undead DoTs were originally added via expansions. Many clerics question the reason for this since they are not as efficient as out DD spells of similar levels, however ALL other classes with both DoT and DD spells show a clear pattern of the DoTs exceeding the DD efficiency, even for DDs of higher spell levels. Why aren’t cleric DoTs similar in this regard? Also, why is our DoT spell range reduced? Suggestions for improvement include normalizing the above, and/or consideration of changing the basic nature of undead spells to be more of an «anti evil», including both undead and demonic/summoned/corrupted model types (and removing the anti summoned spells of clerics and other classes and replacing them with this new single spell set as well)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;d. Please give clerics some clear ability to perform a non-healing group role. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Clerics in a group setting that does not require healing are a clear hindrance if another healing class of similar level and equipment is available. The above changes would affect this greatly, or some other idea, such as a CC related role, or new spells/abilities to assist the group as a whole (chant style spells similar to bardic magic, that would require the cleric to focus on one task, but aid the group)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;e. Cleric (as well as all caster) skills have not risen at all since Kunark until OoW (with the exception of adding bash to the class). &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Please re-evaluate the use of skills for clerics, and the relative value of skills compared to other classes (why does a cleric with the same skills hit less often and for less damage than a melee class?)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;3. Please evaluate the defensive skills and abilities of clerics. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(Currently being discussed) - Most likely this will be considered as part of the class re-envisioning&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Due to data that we as players cannot see, a similarly equipped cleric/knight will have varying results on actual damage taken (not hit rate, which is controlled by secondary skills, but actual damage per hit) It is our belief that clerics have enough real penalties due to lack of secondary skills (riposte, parry, AA), that also having soft caps and tables that lead to different results with the same skills is excessive and detrimental. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;4. Please add group versions of our buffs at all levels. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(Currently being discussed)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Our AC buffs and Vie spell lines still don't have a group version. Also the AC buffs could use a little upgrade.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;5. Make AotZ Stack with Focus. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The paladin self buff is quite similar to the cleric self buff. As the paladin buff stacks with focus it seems reasonable that the cleric buff should likewise stack with focus.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;If clerics are asked to perform a more melee centric role to solo/add to a group, then this extra survivability will benefit us as well as it does both paladins and Shadow knights in current content. Both classes self buff now stack with the Focus line. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;6. Improve stun line, increase level caps. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The main problem here being that lower level stuns in the 50s do not work post 55 (as paladin stuns do), also the secondary effects (DD + pushback) make using these spells undesirable in much content. Finally, the excessive recast delays (that other classes with stuns do not have as severely as clerics) again reduce the use of these spells. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;7. Please re-evaluate cleric options for normal invisibility. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(No plan to implement a spell form of invis for clerics at this time.)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Suggestions include: A self only invis spell, a self only improved invis spell; Improved invis potions, stackable invis potions, soulbound invis items, more unlimited clicky invis items, finally a minimum duration for cloudy potions (2 minutes). &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The goal is to find some tool or way to assist clerics with both travel, and specifically CR. Clerics are perhaps in the worst possible situation in that we are needed to CR most groups, but completely lack utility to do so. Sanctuary was a possibility, but it doesn’t stop mobs from attacking you. Even though it is desirable to have clerics work with others to mitigate this problem, it too often simply falls on the cleric to figure it out without assistance. This is a major downtime/deadtime penalty that clerics face (and is more frustrating than difficult, so simply detracts from the game)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;8. Please increase the range of our group heals. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(Currently being discussed)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;There is an inconsistency between range of our Divine Arbitration abilities (AA and on epic) and the range of group heals that are used after arbitrating to heal the group. Also, the short range is really annoying, in particular with recent encounters that involve huge models and AoE rampage. Finally, it would be a step toward reducing the number of healers required in raid.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;9. Upgrade our group elixir spell. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Ethereal Elixir is our only groups heal over time spell. It is more and more in dire need of an upgrade, as average hitpoints in a group has more than doubled since it was introduced. An upgrade to our Celestial Regeneration AA line would also be a noticeable help.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;10. Make healing power of clerics scale more with gear. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Cleric is one of the classes that relies the less on gear to perform its role in a group. There isn’t much incentive for clerics to acquire gear, particularly at the high-end, other than to increase HP and mana. These are indeed a bonus to the well-geared cleric, but don’t make a big difference in a group. Worse geared clerics can often perform equally well, which diminishes the accomplishment of acquiring gear.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;1. Fix&amp;nbsp;our DoD AA and spells &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0066ff&gt;(NEW)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;a. Gift of Mana and Abundant Healing seem to interfere with each other, resulting in some clerics never getting&amp;nbsp;GoM or AH to trigger. Also, Abundant Healing could use a different icon since it's a heal over time.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;b. Ward of Purity could be on a separate timer (currently on the same timer as healing wards), should cure every ticks and not every other two ticks, and could use a different icon too. Probably overpriced for what it does.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;c. The description of Desperate Renewal is wrong, or the spell is bugged and doesn't cure. If it was not intented to cure, its mana cost probably deserve to be tuned down a bit.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;2. Please reevaluate a cleric non-healing skills and abilities.&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt; (Currently being discussed) - Most likely this will be considered as part of the class re-envisioning&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Most classes offer more than a single role to a group, or even if limited to DPS only, can fill several group slots and stack. Clerics lack this flexibility, due to the lack of healing being able to stack (there is no value to over healing).&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;a. Give clerics some capability to stop runners. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Ward spells allow cleric to solo content (albeit inefficiently) when waiting for a group. However our dps drops dramatically when a mob begins to run.

&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This is a level 59 class specific AA that does not work on level 55+ mobs. Suggestions: replace fear with some other debilitating effect. Or... completely alter what it is and turn it into a focus effect for undead nukes/dots, or something similar (like a melee undead focus/bane). &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

Also, the short range is really annoying, in particular with recent encounters that involve huge models and AoE rampage. Finally, it would be a step toward reducing the number of healers required in raid.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;9. Upgrade our group elixir spell. &lt;FONT color=#0033ff&gt;(New)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Ethereal Elixir is our only groups heal over time spell. It is more and more in dire need of an upgrade, as average hitpoints in a group has more than doubled since it was introduced. An upgrade to our Celestial Regeneration AA line would also be a noticeable help.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;10. Make healing power of clerics scale more with gear. &lt;FONT color=#0033ff&gt;(New)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Cleric is one of the classes that relies the less on gear to perform its role in a group. There isn’t much incentive for clerics to acquire gear, particularly at the high-end, other than to increase HP and mana. These are indeed a bonus to the well-geared cleric, but don’t make a big difference in a group. Worse geared clerics can often perform equally well, which diminishes the accomplishment of acquiring gear.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

Finally, it would be a step toward reducing the number of healers required in raid.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;a. Turn Undead – a level 59 class specific AA that does not work on level 55+ mobs. Suggestions: Remove the fear, fix the cast time to not scale up with level of the AA. The excessive cast time at level 3 makes it less useful than at level 1. Or... completely alter what it is (like what was done to CR) and turn it into a focus effect for undead nukes/dots, or something similar&lt;FONT color=#33cc00&gt; (&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana&gt;like a melee undead focus/bane).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#33cc00&gt;&lt;SPAN **Oompa-Loompa**?COLOR: red?&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66cc00&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana&gt;(Part of the proposed first pass with class re-envisioning posted on EQLive on 3/14/2005)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman"&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;2. Move short duration buffs to the song window, i.e. Yaulp, HOTs, Mind Wrack&amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt; (No change planned at this time)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;This still an issue due to the abundance of hybrid buffs added to the game post 50. New suggestions: either lower the Omens AA to a level 51 buy in, or add some buff slots for lower level characters. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman"&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN #cccccc? **Oompa-Loompa**?COLOR:&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;3. Please reevaluate a clerics non-healing skills and abilities. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(Currently being discussed) &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;- Most likely this will be considered as part of the class re-envisioning&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Most classes offer more than a single role to a group, or even if limited to DPS only, can fill several group slots and stack. Clerics lack this flexibility, due to the lack of healing being able to stack. (there is no value to over healing) &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;a. Please give clerics some capability to solo efficiently. &lt;FONT color=#0033ff&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;(Revised)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;Introduce lower version of our wards in the game (they are on Lucy but not in game yet). Clerics also need a way to stop runners, since we can't seriously damage them. Suggestions include a strong but short root, lower the chance our procs have to break root, or a spell to make mobs not wanting to run.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;b. Cleric melee was an addition to replace lost value in being the sole healer for a great deal of content. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Please make sure this ability scales as well as the role we lost. While the proc is a unique concept, it is static. Either itemization needs to be much better, or code written to replace the summoned hammers with a castable proc that will work with any weapon/item and scale with levels. The second part of this is the base melee skill has never been reviewed since the original game release. There is no valid reason for non-melee classes to continue to be punished with non-existent melee skills. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;c. Cleric offensive spells have not kept up vs. other casters through the levels.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&amp;nbsp;While we expect specialist classes (wizards, mages) to be the clear best, no class should face stagnation to the point of valuelessness. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Level 49 Clr: 42.64dps, 2.15dpm, level 69 Clr: 112.07dps, 3.32dpm &lt;BR&gt;Level 49 Dru: 71.63dps, 2.45dpm, level 69 Dru: 220.11dps, 4.35dpm &lt;BR&gt;Level 49 Shm: 71.88dps, 2.00dpm, Level 69 Shm: 123.50dps, 3.39dpm &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;d. Our specialist spells have similarly suffered; at 49 we were equal to wizards using our undead nukes, now we fall far short, both in DPS and efficiency.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Suggestions include review of DPM ratios, and consider converting anti-undead spells to an Alteration skill base. (for specialization value). &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Our undead DoTs were originally added via expansions. Many clerics question the reason for this since they are not as efficient as out DD spells of similar levels, however ALL other classes with both DoT and DD spells show a clear pattern of the DoTs exceeding the DD effciantcy, even for DDs of higher spell levels. Why aren’t cleric DoTs similer in this regard? Also, why is our DoT spell range reduced? Suggestions for improvement include normalizing the above,&amp;nbsp;and/or consideration of changing the basic nature of undead spells to be more of an “anti evil”, including both undead and demonic/summoned/corrupted model types (and removing the anti summoned spells of clerics and other classes and replacing them with this new single spell set as well) &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;e. Please give clerics some clear ability to perform a non-healing group role. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Clerics in a group setting that does not require healing are a clear hindrance if another healing class of similar level and equipment is available. The above changes would affect this greatly, or some other idea, such as a CC related role, or new spells/abilities to assist the group as a whole (chant style spells similar to bardic magic, that would require the cleric to focus on one task, but aid the group)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;f. Cleric (as well as all caster) skills have not risen at all since Kunark until OoW. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;(with the exception of adding bash to the class). &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Please re-evaluate the use of skills for clerics, and the relative value of skills compared to other classes. (why does a cleric with the same skills hit less often and for less damage than a melee class?) &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;4. Please evaluate the defensive skills and abilities of clerics. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(Currently being discussed)&amp;nbsp; &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;- Most likely this will be considered as part of the class re-envisioning&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Due to data that we as players cannot see, a similarly equipped cleric/knight will have varying results on actual damage taken (not hit rate, which is controlled by secondary skills, but actual damage per hit) It is our belief that clerics have enough real penalties due to lack of secondary skills (repost, parry, aa), that also having softcaps and tables that lead to different results with the same skills is excessive and detrimental. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman"&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT color=#33cc00&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN #cccccc? **Oompa-Loompa**?COLOR:&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;5. Please add group versions of our buffs at all levels. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(Currently being discussed)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;This was something done for druids, but never for other classes. our AC buffs are generally seen as weak except late game so not used, one other possibility is to combine the ac into the symbol (hp type 2) line, now that they do not have a gem cost (this would also make room for group type 1 spells or group symbol spells at all levels)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman"&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;6. Make AotZ Stack with Focus. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;The paladin self buff is quite similar to the cleric self buff. As the paladin buff stacks with focus it seems reasonable that the cleric buff should likewise stack with focus &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated)&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;If clerics are asked to perform a more melee centric role to solo/add to a group, then this extra survivability will benefit us as well as it does both paladins and Shadow knights in current content. Both classes self buff now stack with the Focus line. The DS component is considered generally wish list, and a possible solution to solo balance, as such it is not appropriate for this item and was removed.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman"&gt;&lt;FONT color=#33cc00 size=2&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;7. Improve stun line – increase level caps&amp;nbsp; &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated)&lt;/FONT&gt; &#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;The main problem here being that lower level stuns in the 50s do not work post 55 (as paladin stuns do), also the secondary effects (DD + pushback) make using these spells undesirable in much content. Finally, the excessive recast delays (that other classes with stuns do not have as severely as clerics) and unexplained timer setup on OoW stuns again reduce the use of these spells. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;8. Please re-evaluate cleric options for normal invisibility.&amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt; &lt;SPAN **Oompa-Loompa**?COLOR: red?&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66cc00&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana&gt;(Part of the proposed first pass with class re-envisioning posted on EQLive on 3/14/2005) - improved invis potions&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Suggestions include: A self only invis spell, a self only improved invis spell; Improved invis potions, stackable invis potions, soulbound invis items, more unlimited clickie invis items, finally a minimum duration for cloudy potions (2 minutes). &lt;BR&gt;The goal is to find some tool or way to assist clerics with both travel, and specifically CR. Clerics are perhaps in the worst possible situation in that we are needed to CR most groups, but completely lack utility to do so. Sanctuary was a possibility, but it doesn’t stop mobs from attacking you. Even though it is desirable to have clerics work with others to mitigate this problem, it too often simply falls on the cleric to figure it out without assistance. This is a major downtime/deadtime penalty that clerics face (and is more frustrating than difficult, so simply detracts from the game)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;9. Combine the Symbol and AC lines of buffs &lt;FONT color=#ff0000 size=2&gt;(No change planned at this time)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;This would kill several birds with one stone: there is no group version of our AC buff line, it would free a buff slot, and it would reduce the annoyance of casting many spells, when Conviction is not the buff of choice.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;10.&amp;nbsp; TBA&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;This is defined as an elemental level cleric being able to solo an AA point of EXP in 2 hours or less. This is approximately twice as long as it takes for a similarly equipped “solo” class to earn the same AA. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Possible suggestion is the inclusion of a self only damage shield either as part of our self buffs or the yaulp spells.

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;e. Please give clerics some clear ability to perform a non-healing group role. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Clerics in a group setting that does not require healing are a clear hindrance if another healing class of similar level and equipment is available.

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Please re-evaluate the use of skills for clerics, and the relative value of skills compared to other classes. (why does a cleric with the same skills hit less often and for less damage than a melee class?) &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Due to data that we as players cannot see, a similarly equipped cleric/knight will have varying results on actual damage taken (not hit rate, which is controlled by secondary skills, but actual damage per hit) It is our belief that clerics have enough real penalties due to lack of secondary skills (repost, parry, aa), that also having softcaps and tables that lead to different results with the same skills is excessive and detrimental. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman"&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;This was something done for druids, but never for other classes. our AC buffs are generally seen as weak except late game so not used, one other possibility is to combine the ac into the symbol (hp type 2) line, now that they do not have a gem cost (this would also make room for group type 1 spells or group symbol spells at all levels)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman"&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;6. Make AotZ Stack with Focus. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;The paladin self buff is quite similar to the cleric self buff. As the paladin buff stacks with focus it seems reasonable that the cleric buff should likewise stack with focus &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated)&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;If clerics are asked to perform a more melee centric role to solo/add to a group, then this extra survivability will benefit us as well as it does both paladins and Shadow knights in current content. Both classes self buff now stack with the Focus line. The DS component is considered generally wish list, and a possible solution to solo balance, as such it is not appropriate for this item and was removed.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman"&gt;&lt;FONT color=#33cc00 size=2&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;7. Improve stun line – increase level caps&amp;nbsp; &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated)&lt;/FONT&gt; &#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;The main problem here being that lower level stuns in the 50s do not work post 55 (as paladin stuns do), also the secondary effects (DD + pushback) make using these spells undesirable in much content. Finally, the excessive recast delays (that other classes with stuns do not have as severely as clerics) and unexplained timer setup on OoW stuns again reduce the use of these spells. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;8. Please re-evaluate cleric options for normal invisibility.&amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt; &lt;SPAN **Oompa-Loompa**?COLOR: red?&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66cc00&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana&gt;(Part of the proposed first pass with class re-envisioning posted on EQLive on 3/14/2005) - improved invis potions&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Suggestions include: A self only invis spell, a self only improved invis spell; Improved invis potions, stackable invis potions, soulbound invis items, more unlimited clickie invis items, finally a minimum duration for cloudy potions (2 minutes). &lt;BR&gt;The goal is to find some tool or way to assist clerics with both travel, and specifically CR. Clerics are perhaps in the worst possible situation in that we are needed to CR most groups, but completely lack utility to do so. Sanctuary was a possibility, but it doesn’t stop mobs from attacking you. Even though it is desirable to have clerics work with others to mitigate this problem, it too often simply falls on the cleric to figure it out without assistance. This is a major downtime/deadtime penalty that clerics face (and is more frustrating than difficult, so simply detracts from the game)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;9. Combine the Symbol and AC lines of buffs &lt;FONT color=#ff0000 size=2&gt;(No change planned at this time)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;This would kill several birds with one stone: there is no group version of our AC buff line, it would free a buff slot, and it would reduce the annoyance of casting many spells, when Conviction is not the buff of choice.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;10. Add new messages related to heal-over-time spells. Players use them as part of their healing style, but the wear-off message is displayed only when cast on self. Also, there is no indication that the HoT spell is a critical heal, for clerics that have Healing Boon. &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0033ff&gt;&lt;SPAN **Oompa-Loompa**?COLOR: red?&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66cc00&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana size=2&gt;(Messaging added for HoTs but this is still being worked on)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;We would need:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;a. A message for when a single target HoT fades on a target other than self.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;b. A message for when a HoT spell is a critical heal.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Kytherea on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;05-06-2005&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;05:35 PM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman"&gt;&lt;SPAN **Oompa-Loompa**?COLOR: #cccccc?&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;1. Please fix our broken and/or overpriced AA's &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;a. Turn Undead – a level 59 class specific AA that does not work on level 55+ mobs. Suggestions: Remove the fear, fix the cast time to not scale up with level of the AA. The excessive cast time at level 3 makes it less useful than at level 1. Or... completely alter what it is (like what was done to CR) and turn it into a focus effect for undead nukes/dots, or something similar&lt;FONT color=#33cc00&gt; (&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana&gt;like a melee undead focus/bane).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#33cc00&gt;&lt;SPAN red? **Oompa-Loompa**?COLOR:&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66cc00&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana&gt;(Part of the proposed first pass with class re-envisioning posted on EQLive on 3/14/2005)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman"&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman"&gt;&lt;FONT color=#33cc00 size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT color=#33cc00&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;2. Move short duration buffs to the song window, i.e. Yaulp, HOTs, Mind Wrack&amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt; (No change planned at this time)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Between Rangers spamming their attack buffs and SK/necros using their recourse taps, "buff management" means clicking off 5 crap buffs every other minute. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;This still an issue due to the abundance of hybrid buffs added to the game post 50. New suggestions: either lower the Omens AA to a level 51 buy in, or add some buff slots for lower level characters. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman"&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN **Oompa-Loompa**?COLOR: #cccccc?&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;3. Please reevaluate a clerics non-healing skills and abilities. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(Currently being discussed) &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;- Most likely this will be considered as part of the class re-envisioning&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Most classes offer more than a single role to a group, or even if limited to DPS only, can fill several group slots and stack. Clerics lack this flexibility, due to the lack of healing being able to stack. (there is no value to over healing) &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;a. Please give clerics some capability to solo efficiently. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;This is defined as an elemental level cleric being able to solo an AA point of EXP in 2 hours or less. This is approximately twice as long as it takes for a similarly equipped “solo” class to earn the same AA. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Possible suggestion is the inclusion of a self only damage shield either as part of our self buffs or the yaulp spells. This would add DPS that would not easily stack with a group’s DPS, thus be more controllable for its effect as a purely solo tool. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;b. Cleric melee was an addition to replace lost value in being the sole healer for a great deal of content. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Please make sure this ability scales as well as the role we lost. While the proc is a unique concept, it is static. Either itemization needs to be much better, or code written to replace the summoned hammers with a castable proc that will work with any weapon/item and scale with levels. The second part of this is the base melee skill has never been reviewed since the original game release. There is no valid reason for non-melee classes to continue to be punished with non-existent melee skills. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;c. Cleric offensive spells have not kept up vs. other casters through the levels.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&amp;nbsp;While we expect specialist classes (wizards, mages) to be the clear best, no class should face stagnation to the point of valuelessness. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Suggestions include: A self only invis spell, a self only improved invis spell; Improved invis potions, stackable invis potions, soulbound invis items, more unlimited clickie invis items, finally a minimum duration for cloudy potions (2 minutes). &lt;BR&gt;The goal is to find some tool or way to assist clerics with both travel, and specifically CR. Clerics are perhaps in the worst possible situation in that we are needed to CR most groups, but completely lack utility to do so. Sanctuary was a possibility, but it doesn’t stop mobs from attacking you. Even though it is desirable to have clerics work with others to mitigate this problem, it too often simply falls on the cleric to figure it out without assistance. This is a major downtime/deadtime penalty that clerics face (and is more frustrating than difficult, so simply detracts from the game)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;9. Combine the Symbol and AC lines of buffs &lt;FONT color=#ff0000 size=2&gt;(No change planned at this time)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;This would kill several birds with one stone: there is no group version of our AC buff line, it would free a buff slot, and it would reduce the annoyance of casting many spells, when Conviction is not the buff of choice.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;10. Add new messages related to heal-over-time spells. Players use them as part of their healing style, but the wear-off message is displayed only when cast on self. Also, there is no indication that the HoT spell is a critical heal, for clerics that have Healing Boon. &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0033ff&gt;&lt;SPAN red? **Oompa-Loompa**?COLOR:&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66cc00&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana size=2&gt;(Part of the proposed first pass with class re-envisioning posted on EQLive on 3/14/2005)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;We would need:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;a. A message for when a single target HoT fades on a target other than self.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;b. A message for when a HoT spell is a critical heal.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;a. Turn Undead – a level 59 class specific AA that does not work on level 55+ mobs. Suggestions: Remove the fear, fix the cast time to not scale up with level of the AA. The excessive cast time at level 3 makes it less useful than at level 1. Or... completely alter what it is (like what was done to CR) and turn it into a focus effect for undead nukes/dots, or something similar&lt;FONT color=#33cc00&gt; (&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;like a melee undead focus/bane).&amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT color=#33cc00&gt;(&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#33cc00&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman"&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Rashere has mentioned that&amp;nbsp;this AA is on his list for a revamp.&amp;nbsp; He did not give a time frame for when it&amp;nbsp;MAY be done, but it is planned at this time.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman"&gt;&lt;FONT color=#33cc00 size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT color=#33cc00&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;2. Move short duration buffs to the song window, i.e. Yaulp, HOTs, Mind Wrack&amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt; (No change planned at this time)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Between Rangers spamming their attack buffs and SK/necros using their recourse taps, "buff management" means clicking off 5 crap buffs every other minute. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;This still an issue due to the abundance of hybrid buffs added to the game post 50. New suggestions: either lower the Omens AA to a level 51 buy in, or add some buff slots for lower level characters. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman"&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN **Oompa-Loompa**?COLOR: #cccccc?&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;3. Please reevaluate a clerics non-healing skills and abilities. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(Currently being discussed) &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;- Most likely this will be considered as part of the class re-envisioning&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Most classes offer more than a single role to a group, or even if limited to DPS only, can fill several group slots and stack. Clerics lack this flexibility, due to the lack of healing being able to stack. (there is no value to over healing) &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;a. Please give clerics some capability to solo efficiently. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;This is defined as an elemental level cleric being able to solo an AA point of EXP in 2 hours or less. This is approximately twice as long as it takes for a similarly equipped “solo” class to earn the same AA. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Possible suggestion is the inclusion of a self only damage shield either as part of our self buffs or the yaulp spells. This would add DPS that would not easily stack with a group’s DPS, thus be more controllable for its effect as a purely solo tool. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;b. Cleric melee was an addition to replace lost value in being the sole healer for a great deal of content. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Please make sure this ability scales as well as the role we lost. While the proc is a unique concept, it is static. Either itemization needs to be much better, or code written to replace the summoned hammers with a castable proc that will work with any weapon/item and scale with levels. The second part of this is the base melee skill has never been reviewed since the original game release. There is no valid reason for non-melee classes to continue to be punished with non-existent melee skills. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;c. Cleric offensive spells have not kept up vs. other casters through the levels.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&amp;nbsp;While we expect specialist classes (wizards, mages) to be the clear best, no class should face stagnation to the point of valuelessness. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Level 49 Clr: 42.64dps, 2.15dpm, level 69 Clr: 112.07dps, 3.32dpm &lt;BR&gt;Level 49 Dru: 71.63dps, 2.45dpm, level 69 Dru: 220.11dps, 4.35dpm &lt;BR&gt;Level 49 Shm: 71.88dps, 2.00dpm, Level 69 Shm: 123.50dps, 3.39dpm &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;d. Our specialist spells have similarly suffered; at 49 we were equal to wizards using our undead nukes, now we fall far short, both in DPS and efficiency.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Suggestions include review of DPM ratios, and consider converting anti-undead spells to an Alteration skill base. (for specialization value). &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Our undead DoTs were originally added via expansions. Many clerics question the reason for this since they are not as efficient as out DD spells of similar levels, however ALL other classes with both DoT and DD spells show a clear pattern of the DoTs exceeding the DD effciantcy, even for DDs of higher spell levels. Why aren’t cleric DoTs similer in this regard? Also, why is our DoT spell range reduced? Suggestions for improvement include normalizing the above,&amp;nbsp;and/or consideration of changing the basic nature of undead spells to be more of an “anti evil”, including both undead and demonic/summoned/corrupted model types (and removing the anti summoned spells of clerics and other classes and replacing them with this new single spell set as well) &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;e. Please give clerics some clear ability to perform a non-healing group role. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Clerics in a group setting that does not require healing are a clear hindrance if another healing class of similar level and equipment is available. The above changes would affect this greatly, or some other idea, such as a CC related role, or new spells/abilities to assist the group as a whole (chant style spells similar to bardic magic, that would require the cleric to focus on one task, but aid the group)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;f. Cleric (as well as all caster) skills have not risen at all since Kunark until OoW. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;(with the exception of adding bash to the class). &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Please re-evaluate the use of skills for clerics, and the relative value of skills compared to other classes. (why does a cleric with the same skills hit less often and for less damage than a melee class?) &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;4. Please evaluate the defensive skills and abilities of clerics. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(Currently being discussed)&amp;nbsp; &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;- Most likely this will be considered as part of the class re-envisioning&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Due to data that we as players cannot see, a similarly equipped cleric/knight will have varying results on actual damage taken (not hit rate, which is controlled by secondary skills, but actual damage per hit) It is our belief that clerics have enough real penalties due to lack of secondary skills (repost, parry, aa), that also having softcaps and tables that lead to different results with the same skills is excessive and detrimental. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman"&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT color=#33cc00&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN **Oompa-Loompa**?COLOR: #cccccc?&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;5. Please add group versions of our buffs at all levels. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(Currently being discussed)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;This was something done for druids, but never for other classes. our AC buffs are generally seen as weak except late game so not used, one other possibility is to combine the ac into the symbol (hp type 2) line, now that they do not have a gem cost (this would also make room for group type 1 spells or group symbol spells at all levels)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman"&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;6. Make AotZ Stack with Focus. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;The paladin self buff is quite similar to the cleric self buff. As the paladin buff stacks with focus it seems reasonable that the cleric buff should likewise stack with focus &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated)&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;If clerics are asked to perform a more melee centric role to solo/add to a group, then this extra survivability will benefit us as well as it does both paladins and Shadow knights in current content. Both classes self buff now stack with the Focus line. The DS component is considered generally wish list, and a possible solution to solo balance, as such it is not appropriate for this item and was removed.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman"&gt;&lt;FONT color=#33cc00 size=2&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;7. Improve stun line – increase level caps&amp;nbsp; &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated)&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;The main problem here being that lower level stuns in the 50s do not work post 55 (as paladin stuns do), also the secondary effects (DD + pushback) make using these spells undesirable in much content. Finally, the excessive recast delays (that other classes with stuns do not have as severely as clerics) and unexplained timer setup on OoW stuns again reduce the use of these spells. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;8. Please re-evaluate cleric options for normal invisibility.&amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt; (No change planned at this time to include self-invis spell for clerics)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Suggestions include: A self only invis spell, a self only improved invis spell; Improved invis potions, stackable invis potions, soulbound invis items, more unlimited clickie invis items, finally a minimum duration for cloudy potions (2 minutes). &lt;BR&gt;The goal is to find some tool or way to assist clerics with both travel, and specifically CR. Clerics are perhaps in the worst possible situation in that we are needed to CR most groups, but completely lack utility to do so. Sanctuary was a possibility, but it doesn’t stop mobs from attacking you. Even though it is desirable to have clerics work with others to mitigate this problem, it too often simply falls on the cleric to figure it out without assistance. This is a major downtime/deadtime penalty that clerics face (and is more frustrating than difficult, so simply detracts from the game)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Please make sure this ability scales as well as the role we lost. While the proc is a unique concept, it is static.

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;d. Our specialist spells have similarly suffered; at 49 we were equal to wizards using our undead nukes, now we fall far short, both in DPS and efficiency.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Suggestions include review of DPM ratios, and consider converting anti-undead spells to an Alteration skill base. (for specialization value). &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Our undead DoTs were originally added via expansions. Many clerics question the reason for this since they are not as efficient as out DD spells of similar levels, however ALL other classes with both DoT and DD spells show a clear pattern of the DoTs exceeding the DD effciantcy, even for DDs of higher spell levels. Why aren’t cleric DoTs similer in this regard? Also, why is our DoT spell range reduced? Suggestions for improvement include normalizing the above,&amp;nbsp;and/or consideration of changing the basic nature of undead spells to be more of an “anti evil”, including both undead and demonic/summoned/corrupted model types (and removing the anti summoned spells of clerics and other classes and replacing them with this new single spell set as well) &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;e. Please give clerics some clear ability to perform a non-healing group role. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Clerics in a group setting that does not require healing are a clear hindrance if another healing class of similar level and equipment is available. The above changes would affect this greatly, or some other idea, such as a CC related role, or new spells/abilities to assist the group as a whole (chant style spells similar to bardic magic, that would require the cleric to focus on one task, but aid the group)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;f. Cleric (as well as all caster) skills have not risen at all since Kunark until OoW. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;(with the exception of adding bash to the class). &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Please re-evaluate the use of skills for clerics, and the relative value of skills compared to other classes. (why does a cleric with the same skills hit less often and for less damage than a melee class?) &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;4. Please evaluate the defensive skills and abilities of clerics. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(Currently being discussed)&amp;nbsp; &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;- Most likely this will be considered as part of the class re-envisioning&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Due to data that we as players cannot see, a similarly equipped cleric/knight will have varying results on actual damage taken (not hit rate, which is controlled by secondary skills, but actual damage per hit) It is our belief that clerics have enough real penalties due to lack of secondary skills (repost, parry, aa), that also having softcaps and tables that lead to different results with the same skills is excessive and detrimental. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman"&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT color=#33cc00&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN **Oompa-Loompa**?COLOR: #cccccc?&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;5. Please make epic 1.0 usable from inventory. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(Currently being discussed)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;This was supposedly discussed on the summit boards, but no results have been seen. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Please change the type 4 slot on the cleric epic 1.5 to a type 7 slot.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;I understand we were not supposed to have a second slot at all, but we are unfairly penalized in this regard due to having very few choices that actually work in this slot (and yes, many clerics still slot proc items thinking they work with bash) &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;6. Please add group versions of our buffs at all levels. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(Currently being discussed)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;This was something done for druids, but never for other classes. our AC buffs are generally seen as weak except late game so not used, one other possibility is to combine the ac into the symbol (hp type 2) line, now that they do not have a gem cost (this would also make room for group type 1 spells or group symbol spells at all levels)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman"&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;7. Make AotZ Stack with Focus. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;The paladin self buff is quite similar to the cleric self buff. As the paladin buff stacks with focus it seems reasonable that the cleric buff should likewise stack with focus &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated)&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;If clerics are asked to perform a more melee centric role to solo/add to a group, then this extra survivability will benefit us as well as it does both paladins and Shadow knights in current content. Both classes self buff now stack with the Focus line. The DS component is considered generally wish list, and a possible solution to solo balance, as such it is not appropriate for this item and was removed.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman"&gt;&lt;FONT color=#33cc00 size=2&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;8. Improve stun line – increase level caps&amp;nbsp; &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated)&lt;/FONT&gt; &#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;The main problem here being that lower level stuns in the 50s do not work post 55 (as paladin stuns do), also the secondary effects (DD + pushback) make using these spells undesirable in much content. Finally, the excessive recast delays (that other classes with stuns do not have as severely as clerics) and unexplained timer setup on OoW stuns again reduce the use of these spells. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;9. Please re-evaluate cleric options for normal invisibility.&amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt; (No change planned at this time to include self-invis spell for clerics)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Suggestions include: A self only invis spell, a self only improved invis spell; Improved invis potions, stackable invis potions, soulbound invis items, more unlimited clickie invis items, finally a minimum duration for cloudy potions (2 minutes). &lt;BR&gt;The goal is to find some tool or way to assist clerics with both travel, and specifically CR. Clerics are perhaps in the worst possible situation in that we are needed to CR most groups, but completely lack utility to do so. Sanctuary was a possibility, but it doesn’t stop mobs from attacking you. Even though it is desirable to have clerics work with others to mitigate this problem, it too often simply falls on the cleric to figure it out without assistance. This is a major downtime/deadtime penalty that clerics face (and is more frustrating than difficult, so simply detracts from the game)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;10. Combine the Symbol and AC lines of buffs &lt;FONT color=#0033ff&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;(NEW)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;This would kill several birds with one stone: there is no group version of our AC buff line, it would free a buff slot, and it would reduce the annoyance of casting many spells, when Conviction is not the buff of choice.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;a. Turn Undead – a level 59 class specific AA that does not work on level 55+ mobs. Suggestions: Remove the fear, fix the cast time to not scale up with level of the AA. The excessive cast time at level 3 makes it less useful than at level 1. Or... completely alter what it is (like what was done to CR) and turn it into a focus effect for undead nukes/dots, or something similar&lt;FONT color=#33cc00&gt; (&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;like a melee undead focus/bane).&amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT color=#33cc00&gt;(&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#33cc00 size=2&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman"&gt;Rashere has mentioned that&amp;nbsp;this AA is on his list for a revamp.&amp;nbsp; He did not give a time frame for when it&amp;nbsp;MAY be done, but it is planned at this time.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;2. Move short duration buffs to the song window, i.e. Yaulp, HOTs, Mind Wrack &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(Currently being discussed)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Between Rangers spamming their attack buffs and SK/necros using their recourse taps, "buff management" means clicking off 5 crap buffs every other minute. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;This still an issue due to the abundance of hybrid buffs added to the game post 50. New suggestions: either lower the Omens AA to a level 51 buy in, or add some buff slots for lower level characters. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman"&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Most classes offer more than a single role to a group, or even if limited to DPS only, can fill several group slots and stack. Clerics lack this flexibility, due to the lack of healing being able to stack. (there is no value to over healing) &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;a. Please give clerics some capability to solo efficiently. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;7. Make AotZ Stack with Focus. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;The paladin self buff is quite similar to the cleric self buff. As the paladin buff stacks with focus it seems reasonable that the cleric buff should likewise stack with focus &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated)&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;If clerics are asked to perform a more melee centric role to solo/add to a group, then this extra survivability will benefit us as well as it does both paladins and Shadow knights in current content. Both classes self buff now stack with the Focus line. The DS component is considered generally wish list, and a possible solution to solo balance, as such it is not appropriate for this item and was removed.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman"&gt;&lt;FONT color=#33cc00 size=2&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;8. Improve stun line – increase level caps &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated)&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;The main problem here being that lower level stuns in the 50s do not work post 55 (as paladin stuns do), also the secondary effects (DD + pushback) make using these spells undesirable in much content. Finally, the excessive recast delays (that other classes with stuns do not have as severely as clerics) again reduce the use of these spells. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;9. Please re-evaluate cleric options for normal invisibility.&amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt; (No change planned at this time to include self-invis spell for clerics, LDoN invis potion should be fixed duration, if not it can be changed to be fixed duration)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Suggestions include: A self only invis spell, a self only improved invis spell; Improved invis potions, stackable invis potions, soulbound invis items, more unlimited clickie invis items, finally a minimum duration for cloudy potions (2 minutes). &lt;BR&gt;The goal is to find some tool or way to assist clerics with both travel, and specifically CR. Clerics are perhaps in the worst possible situation in that we are needed to CR most groups, but completely lack utility to do so. Sanctuary was a possibility, but it doesn’t stop mobs from attacking you. Even though it is desirable to have clerics work with others to mitigate this problem, it too often simply falls on the cleric to figure it out without assistance. This is a major downtime/deadtime penalty that clerics face (and is more frustrating than difficult, so simply detracts from the game)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

Lets run the numbers on that. Take an 18 delay weapon to get an upper limit with nothing lost to rounding. Thats 3 hp per hit. With 100% haste this swings every 0.9 sec. For the sake of the argument lets even assume perfect accuracy and double attack getting 2 hits per round. Thus we get 6 hp per 0.9 sec which totals 40 hp/tick. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Read that again please - 40 hp/tick as the upper limit. Thats the same as the druid/shaman regen spells - but MoK only works for melee, only when fighting, can be resisted and has to be cast on every single mob.

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;1. Please fix our broken and/or overpriced AA's &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;a. Turn Undead – a level 59 class specific AA that does not work on level 55+ mobs. Suggestions: Remove the fear, fix the cast time to not scale up with level of the AA. The excessive cast time at level 3 makes it less useful than at level 1. Or... completely alter what it is (like what was done to CR) and turn it into a focus effect for undead nukes/dots, or something similar&lt;FONT color=#33cc00&gt; (&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;like a melee undead focus/bane).&amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT color=#33cc00&gt;(&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#33cc00 size=2&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman"&gt;Rashere has mentioned that&amp;nbsp;this AA is on his list for a revamp.&amp;nbsp; He did not give a time frame for when it&amp;nbsp;MAY be done, but it is planned at this time.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;b. Divine Avatar - Either overpriced or underpowered. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana size=2&gt;Compare to melee AA to get a concept of desired effects (true-shot, aggressive, etc. The root problem being our non-existant real melee DPS that is the base of this ability)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman"&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000 size=2&gt;&lt;FONT color=#33cc00&gt;( aa point reduction and refund scheduled for patch on the 15th - DA should be included.)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;c. Touch of the Divine. Still considered too expensive for its worth and/or fire rate is too low. Also we would like to know what we are getting (please add percent chance to fire to description)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman"&gt;&lt;FONT color=#33cc00 size=2&gt; ( aa point reduction and refund scheduled for patch on the 15th - TotD should be included)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman"&gt;&lt;FONT color=#33cc00 size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT color=#33cc00&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;2. Move short duration buffs to the song window, i.e. Yaulp, HOTs, Mind Wrack &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(Currently being discussed)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;This still an issue due to the abundance of hybrid buffs added to the game post 50. New suggestions: either lower the Omens AA to a level 51 buy in, or add some buff slots for lower level characters. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman"&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66cc00&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;3. Combine MoK/MoR into one spell leaving the DS in place and adding some noticeable healing effects. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(Currently being evaluated) &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;There are two issues really. &lt;BR&gt;a. Only slot 1 DS are removed - which means that you cannot be certain to have the mobs DS removed even if MoK lands. Further, if a DS is important you will almost always recant/annul the mob instead as you cannot risk the resists on MoK. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;b. To the best of our knowledge the healing part from MoK is roughly 1 hp per 6 delay for main hand hits only (rounded down). Let’s run the numbers on that. Take an 18 delay weapon to get an upper limit with nothing lost to rounding. Thats 3 hp per hit. With 100% haste this swings every 0.9 sec. For the sake of the argument let’s even assume perfect accuracy and double attack getting 2 hits per round.

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana size=2&gt;This is still an issue. The main reason for this request is the relative low value of each spell. With spell&amp;nbsp;gems at a premium, these spells are often the first to go. If they could independently be re-evaluated for worth, or combined, the total value would be worth using again. This could help develop a second role for a cleric as well. Also note that more of these spells for lower level clerics would be a nice addition, and add value to lower level clerics (were grouping suffers the most), consider adding these spells starting in the 20s level range. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT color=#33cc00&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN #cccccc? **Oompa-Loompa**?COLOR:&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;4. Please reevaluate a clerics non-healing skills and abilities. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(Currently being discussed)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Most classes offer more than a single role to a group, or even if limited to DPS only, can fill several group slots and stack. Clerics lack this flexibility, due to the lack of healing being able to stack. (there is no value to over healing) &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;a. Please give clerics some capability to solo efficiently. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;This is defined as an elemental level cleric being able to solo an AA point of EXP in 2 hours or less. This is approximately twice as long as it takes for a similarly equipped “solo” class to earn the same AA. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Possible suggestion is the inclusion of a self only damage shield either as part of our self buffs or the yaulp spells. This would add DPS that would not easily stack with a group’s DPS, thus be more controllable for its effect as a purely solo tool. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;b. Cleric melee was an addition to replace lost value in being the sole healer for a great deal of content. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Please make sure this ability scales as well as the role we lost. While the proc is a unique concept, it is static. Either itemization needs to be much better, or code written to replace the summoned hammers with a castable proc that will work with any weapon/item and scale with levels. The second part of this is the base melee skill has never been reviewed since the original game release. There is no valid reason for non-melee classes to continue to be punished with non-existent melee skills. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;c. Cleric offensive spells have not kept up vs. other casters through the levels.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&amp;nbsp;While we expect specialist classes (wizards, mages) to be the clear best, no class should face stagnation to the point of valuelessness. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Level 49 Clr: 42.64dps, 2.15dpm, level 69 Clr: 112.07dps, 3.32dpm &lt;BR&gt;Level 49 Dru: 71.63dps, 2.45dpm, level 69 Dru: 220.11dps, 4.35dpm &lt;BR&gt;Level 49 Shm: 71.88dps, 2.00dpm, Level 69 Shm: 123.50dps, 3.39dpm &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;d. Our specialist spells have similarly suffered; at 49 we were equal to wizards using our undead nukes, now we fall far short, both in DPS and efficiency.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Suggestions include review of DPM ratios, and consider converting anti-undead spells to an Alteration skill base. (for specialization value). &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Our undead DoTs were originally added via expansions. Many clerics question the reason for this since they are not as efficient as out DD spells of similar levels, however ALL other classes with both DoT and DD spells show a clear pattern of the DoTs exceeding the DD effciantcy, even for DDs of higher spell levels. Why aren’t cleric DoTs similer in this regard? Also, why is our DoT spell range reduced? Suggestions for improvement include normalizing the above,&amp;nbsp;and/or consideration of changing the basic nature of undead spells to be more of an “anti evil”, including both undead and demonic/summoned/corrupted model types (and removing the anti summoned spells of clerics and other classes and replacing them with this new single spell set as well) &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;The paladin self buff is quite similar to the cleric self buff.

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;a. Turn Undead – a level 59 class specific AA that does not work on level 55+ mobs. Suggestions: Remove the fear, fix the cast time to not scale up with level of the AA. The excessive cast time at level 3 makes it less useful than at level 1. Or... completely alter what it is (like what was done to CR) and turn it into a focus effect for undead nukes/dots, or something similar&lt;FONT color=#33cc00&gt; (&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;like a melee undead focus/bane).&amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT color=#33cc00&gt;(&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#33cc00 size=2&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman"&gt;Rashere has mentioned that&amp;nbsp;this AA is on his list for a revamp.&amp;nbsp; He did not give a time frame for when it&amp;nbsp;MAY be done, but it is planned at this time.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman"&gt;&lt;FONT color=#33cc00 size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT color=#33cc00&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;2. Move short duration buffs to the song window, i.e. Yaulp, HOTs, Mind Wrack &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(Currently being discussed)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Between Rangers spamming their attack buffs and SK/necros using their recourse taps, "buff management" means clicking off 5 crap buffs every other minute. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;This still an issue due to the abundance of hybrid buffs added to the game post 50. New suggestions: either lower the Omens AA to a level 51 buy in, or add some buff slots for lower level characters. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman"&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66cc00&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;3. Combine MoK/MoR into one spell leaving the DS in place and adding some noticeable healing effects. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(Currently being evaluated) &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;There are two issues really. &lt;BR&gt;a. Only slot 1 DS are removed - which means that you cannot be certain to have the mobs DS removed even if MoK lands. Further, if a DS is important you will almost always recant/annul the mob instead as you cannot risk the resists on MoK. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;b. To the best of our knowledge the healing part from MoK is roughly 1 hp per 6 delay for main hand hits only (rounded down). Let’s run the numbers on that. Take an 18 delay weapon to get an upper limit with nothing lost to rounding. Thats 3 hp per hit. With 100% haste this swings every 0.9 sec. For the sake of the argument let’s even assume perfect accuracy and double attack getting 2 hits per round. Thus we get 6 hp per 0.9 sec which totals 40 hp/tick. &lt;BR&gt;Read that again please - 40 hp/tick as the upper limit. That’s the same as the druid/shaman regen spells - but MoK only works for melee, only when fighting, can be resisted and has to be cast on every single mob. This all combines to make the healing part of MoK so small as to be ignorable. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana size=2&gt;This is still an issue. The main reason for this request is the relative low value of each spell. With spell&amp;nbsp;gems at a premium, these spells are often the first to go. If they could independently be re-evaluated for worth, or combined, the total value would be worth using again. This could help develop a second role for a cleric as well. Also note that more of these spells for lower level clerics would be a nice addition, and add value to lower level clerics (were grouping suffers the most), consider adding these spells starting in the 20s level range. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT color=#33cc00&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN **Oompa-Loompa**?COLOR: #cccccc?&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;4. Please reevaluate a clerics non-healing skills and abilities. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(Currently being discussed)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Most classes offer more than a single role to a group, or even if limited to DPS only, can fill several group slots and stack. Clerics lack this flexibility, due to the lack of healing being able to stack. (there is no value to over healing) &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;a. Please give clerics some capability to solo efficiently. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;This is defined as an elemental level cleric being able to solo an AA point of EXP in 2 hours or less. This is approximately twice as long as it takes for a similarly equipped “solo” class to earn the same AA. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Possible suggestion is the inclusion of a self only damage shield either as part of our self buffs or the yaulp spells. This would add DPS that would not easily stack with a group’s DPS, thus be more controllable for its effect as a purely solo tool. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;b. Cleric melee was an addition to replace lost value in being the sole healer for a great deal of content. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Please make sure this ability scales as well as the role we lost. While the proc is a unique concept, it is static. Either itemization needs to be much better, or code written to replace the summoned hammers with a castable proc that will work with any weapon/item and scale with levels. The second part of this is the base melee skill has never been reviewed since the original game release. There is no valid reason for non-melee classes to continue to be punished with non-existent melee skills. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;c. Cleric offensive spells have not kept up vs. other casters through the levels.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&amp;nbsp;While we expect specialist classes (wizards, mages) to be the clear best, no class should face stagnation to the point of valuelessness. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Level 49 Clr: 42.64dps, 2.15dpm, level 69 Clr: 112.07dps, 3.32dpm &lt;BR&gt;Level 49 Dru: 71.63dps, 2.45dpm, level 69 Dru: 220.11dps, 4.35dpm &lt;BR&gt;Level 49 Shm: 71.88dps, 2.00dpm, Level 69 Shm: 123.50dps, 3.39dpm &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;d. Our specialist spells have similarly suffered; at 49 we were equal to wizards using our undead nukes, now we fall far short, both in DPS and efficiency.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Suggestions include review of DPM ratios, and consider converting anti-undead spells to an Alteration skill base. (for specialization value). &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Our undead DoTs were originally added via expansions. Many clerics question the reason for this since they are not as efficient as out DD spells of similar levels, however ALL other classes with both DoT and DD spells show a clear pattern of the DoTs exceeding the DD effciantcy, even for DDs of higher spell levels. Why aren’t cleric DoTs similer in this regard? Also, why is our DoT spell range reduced? Suggestions for improvement include normalizing the above,&amp;nbsp;and/or consideration of changing the basic nature of undead spells to be more of an “anti evil”, including both undead and demonic/summoned/corrupted model types (and removing the anti summoned spells of clerics and other classes and replacing them with this new single spell set as well) &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;e. Please give clerics some clear ability to perform a non-healing group role. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Clerics in a group setting that does not require healing are a clear hindrance if another healing class of similar level and equipment is available. The above changes would affect this greatly, or some other idea, such as a CC related role, or new spells/abilities to assist the group as a whole (chant style spells similar to bardic magic, that would require the cleric to focus on one task, but aid the group)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
