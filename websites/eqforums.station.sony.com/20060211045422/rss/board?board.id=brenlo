      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;There are times when we gamers forget the world around us .&amp;nbsp; We log into our internet worlds and play with our friends.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; We have no regard for borders, ethnicity, religious differences, we interact as gamers.&amp;nbsp; We play together and form lasting friendships and bonds that, in general, have no regard for real world bias or separation.&amp;nbsp; We are each and everyone, a Hero in our worlds.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Rarely do real world events touch us all, we gamers.&amp;nbsp; While each of us has our own personal issues to deal with, rarely does something so egregious occur that it affects the entirety of our online communities, our internet families.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Yesterday our friends, family members and fellow gamers in London were wounded deeply.&amp;nbsp; The occasional ugliness of the real world has again reared it's head and caused pain.&amp;nbsp; Our friends were hurt in a manner that, unfortunately, has left scars on many of us the last half decade. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Let us, as gamers of the world, stand together with our friends and family in the United Kingdom.&amp;nbsp; Let us show our support for those among us, who are the latest victims of the world and its politics.&amp;nbsp; Whatever our beliefs, our credo, our country of origin, let us unite as a community of gamers and support those who are grieving.&amp;nbsp; Let us remember those we may have lost, remember them as the Hero's they were in our worlds, where we befriended them.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;To my friends and fellow gamers in the UK and elsewhere that were affected by this latest act, my thoughts, prayers and sympathies are with you.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Sincerely,&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Brenlo on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;07-08-2005&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;10:40 AM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;Travel is the word of the day!&amp;nbsp; Been traveling quite a bit.&amp;nbsp; Austin, Vegas, Seattle, Anaheim.&amp;nbsp; All fun stuff but it makes for a very busy halfling.&amp;nbsp; Went to SWG Fan Fest and had a good time.&amp;nbsp; The folks there are just as friendly and fun as you are, not to mention passionate.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I spent Monday and Tuesday of this week in the Emerald city, visiting our Seattle office and meeting some of the team from the Matrix Online.&amp;nbsp; A fine bunch of smart folks up there.&amp;nbsp; I also got the chance to see my favorite ball team, the Mariners and that was a great time as well.&amp;nbsp; Although the M's lost, I was able to enjoy Safeco field and the yummy garlic fries.&amp;nbsp; Mmmm them's good eats.&amp;nbsp; For those you not in the know, they are fries tossed in olive oil and minced garlic.&amp;nbsp; Damn they are tasty.&amp;nbsp; I had forgotten how pretty the skyline was up there in the Pacific Northwest.&amp;nbsp; Seeing Mt. Rainier in the distance has always been one of my favorite sights (when you can see it through the rain).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I did have a blast at Fan Faire this year!&amp;nbsp; To those of you who came by, thank you very much for the great time.&amp;nbsp; It is always a pleasure to meet and interact with you.&amp;nbsp; To those of you who did not make this one, perhaps we can meet next time.&amp;nbsp; Fan Faire is a great event as it is all about you, the Community.&amp;nbsp; Yeah we have seminar's and panels and demo's. We show off our new stuff and have fun but at its heart, it is about gamers getting together and talking about games.&amp;nbsp; It's about you and your friends sharing your experiences.&amp;nbsp; It's even about us at SOE getting to know you and vice-versa.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;3 days of Fan Faire fun and I did not lose my voice.&amp;nbsp; Some naysayers (Ashlanne, Kytherea, Jenebel and others) had a pool going as to which day I would no longer be able to bore you all with my high pitched nasally mono-tone, well I beat the odds and made it the whole weekend.&amp;nbsp; Not sure if that is a good thing for those of you who attended.&amp;nbsp; I did misplace my coffee mug and I have seen some incriminating screen shots of various infamous board posters with said mug.&amp;nbsp; I think some halflings have some splaining to do.&amp;nbsp; This Fan Faire was bigger than ever with more to do and see.&amp;nbsp; We plan to continue that with the next one (no announcement yet, sorry folks) and add more panels and such to make sure that there is something to do (along with sitting with your in-game friends and chatting) the entire weekend.&amp;nbsp; Who knows, maybe next time we can have a dunking booth and you can all take turns dunking me and other SOE folks.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Until next time, make mine Mocha.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Howdy,&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Bunches of us are up here at E3 and what a day we had.&amp;nbsp; There is lots to see and lots for us to show you.&amp;nbsp; I took lots of pictures of our booth, our demos and the people giving them that I will be posting and talking about tomorrow or Friday (depending on when we can get them uploaded and hosted).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Walking, standing and talking all day is really difficult with no coffee.&amp;nbsp; The line at the Starbucks stand wrapped around the booth.&amp;nbsp; It was a nightmare.&amp;nbsp; I had a red bull (sugar free as I am watching my petite figure . . .MUAHAHAHAHA) and that just didn't do the trick.&amp;nbsp; Tomorrow I will settle for the hotel coffee just to make sure I am properly prepared.&amp;nbsp; E3=Great, E3 without Coffee=horror story.&amp;nbsp; I think Stephen King may have done a short story on a trade show with no coffee once, or maybe that was Cujo.&amp;nbsp; A rabid dog terrorizing a small town is a lot like me on no caffeine, only I have less energy.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;For those of you who have never been to E3, it is quite the show.&amp;nbsp; You nearly suffer sensory overload with all of the pounding music, flashing lights and scantily clad women and occasionally men.&amp;nbsp; All the major game companies are there showing what they have to offer and there are some pretty neat ones to see.&amp;nbsp; I also got to see Gary Coleman although I did not get to talk with him at all.&amp;nbsp; He was much smalled than I imagined but very polite to all the folk stopping to take his picture.&amp;nbsp; He took time out of his tour of the show to great each person that stopped to chat with him and was very gracious.&amp;nbsp; I was tempted to utter,"What you talking about Willis" but I feared I would receive a good smacking.&amp;nbsp; If not from Gary then from Ashlanne.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Our booth is the best it has ever been (thanks to Jen Belfield who is also planning our next Fan Faire), it has a castle facade with demo stations for some of the PSP titles we have as well as a 20' video display showing footage from all of SOE's products including your favorite, EverQuest.&amp;nbsp; Those Dragons from DoN look great on that screen in HD.&amp;nbsp; I&amp;nbsp;will try and get the EQ&amp;nbsp;portion of the video&amp;nbsp;up on the site after E3.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Inside we hosted a small cocktail reception where I ran into Jeweljumper and he tormented me with his thoughts on how Wizards should be the best class ever (yeah right Gemdiver).&amp;nbsp; Sylvene from Stratics stopped by and said hello as well.&amp;nbsp; It always good to see some of my old friends and I met plenty of new ones too.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Rashere and Chris Lena (Project Manager for EQ, He is too COOL for a board name) hung out for a bit and also made it clear to Jeweljumper that Wizards are not going to be the master class.&amp;nbsp; I am pretty sure they will have to tell him again tomorrow.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; They also told him about EQs plans for the next few months including hints at an announcement at Fan Faire.&amp;nbsp; I will prod them for more information as well as making sure I insult Jeweljumper for all of you that do not get to do so in person.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I will post another update tomorrow, hopefully with pictures!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Take care and if your feet are as weary as mine, please rest them.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;A black cat crossed my car path this morning as I was pulling out of the driveway.&amp;nbsp; Not a good omen for a Friday the 13th.&amp;nbsp; Mind you I am not a superstitious halfling but that did give me pause.&amp;nbsp; Fortunately the rest of the day has been event free.&amp;nbsp; There is still much day to go though.&amp;nbsp; Did I just jinx myself?&amp;nbsp; ARGH!&amp;nbsp; How do all of these rules work?&amp;nbsp; Do I throw salt over my shoulder?&amp;nbsp; I think I just won't leave my office until after midnight.&amp;nbsp; The only thing that could happen in here is some sort of freak air conditioning mishap.&amp;nbsp; Maybe something with the computers . . .&amp;nbsp; Hmm this could be bad.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Disneyland tomorrow ought to remove any bad mojo right?&amp;nbsp; Mickey is the cure for everything I have found.&amp;nbsp; It really is the happiest place on Earth, just as long as you are not the one in line, next to the woman with the cranky infant.&amp;nbsp; They are all ready for the Disneyland 50th anniversary and I plan to enjoy every bit of it.&amp;nbsp; Unfortunately the re-vamped Space Mountain is not ready just yet.&amp;nbsp; That will be fun.&amp;nbsp; The ride has been closed for 3 years now as they prepared it for the 50th Anniversary.&amp;nbsp; Rumor has it that there is all new track and it is basically an all new ride.&amp;nbsp; I will anxiously await it's July 15th opening.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Next week is the week our industry lives for, well okay that is not entirely true.&amp;nbsp; But it is the week we spend tons of time and effort getting ready for.&amp;nbsp; E3.&amp;nbsp; E3 is a lot like Disneyland, only with booth babes.&amp;nbsp; Alright you caught me again, it is nothing like Disneyland.&amp;nbsp; There will be lots to see and do for the exciting week and even more going on at the SOE booth.&amp;nbsp; We have lots of fun stuff to show and the Community Teams will have updates for you from the show floor.&amp;nbsp; We plan to post pictures of our booth and some of the happenings therein.&amp;nbsp; Make sure you watch the forums and webpages next Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Okay I now return to my regularly scheduled lucky rabbit's foot rubbing and mirror avoidance.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Have fun!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Ashlanne is cranky.&amp;nbsp; Hard to believe isn't it?&amp;nbsp; A cranky halfling is almost like a bad pie and as we all know, there is no bad pie.&amp;nbsp; Send her a PM Hug if you get the chance.&amp;nbsp; Send Kytherea a hug too. They need it.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Believe it or not, some of the folks on this forum can be a bit testy at times and those two poor halflings take the brunt of it.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; They are good people who care about this game and you fine folks.&amp;nbsp; They deserve any appreciation you can give them.&amp;nbsp; Unless your name is Sissl the Necromancer.&amp;nbsp; Then you had probably best avoid them, to contact them would be taking your life into your own hands.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Busy, busy, busy has been my power chant lately.&amp;nbsp; I went out to Austin last week to meet our SWG community team.&amp;nbsp; A fine bunch of folks out there.&amp;nbsp; They will be a delight to work with.&amp;nbsp; This week I am here in not so sunny lately, San Diego waiting to move offices.&amp;nbsp; Ashlanne and Kytherea are excited that they will finally be free from my oppression.&amp;nbsp; I will be free from the giggling.&amp;nbsp; Sometimes I think that this is less of an office and more of a slumber party without the pillow fights.&amp;nbsp; They throw Koosh Balls at me instead.&amp;nbsp; I am not sure which I would prefer.&amp;nbsp; Koosh balls have less kinetic energy behind them generally, but a pillow you know is coming.&amp;nbsp; At least it's not my coffee mug.&amp;nbsp; While I am often accused of having a thick head, that would hurt even my stone-like skull.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;My new office will be downstairs near some of the artists.&amp;nbsp; Why do artists shun natural light?&amp;nbsp; The place is lit like a tomb.&amp;nbsp; I keep expecting Buffy or Angel to bust in and start driving stakes through the artists hearts.&amp;nbsp; Maybe Willow will come by too and hang out and have coffee with me.&amp;nbsp; Then perhaps I could open the blinds and allow some real light in!&amp;nbsp; Perhaps I can just invest in some cheap, dark sunglasses for the lot of them and open the blinds anyway.&amp;nbsp; =)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I have to run for now, I have a Reckoning to attend.&amp;nbsp; Should be fun as I just polished my 6 shooters.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;What a difference two weeks makes . . .&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Okay so I know I have neglected this little corner of Norrath and for that I apologize.&amp;nbsp; For some odd reason I have been more busy than usual and not the normal, sort of "leave me alone I am busy" but honest to goodness busy.&amp;nbsp; If anyone knows where my extra time has gone can you please drop me a PM.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Poor poor Ashlanne and Kytherea.&amp;nbsp; They rejoiced when they found they were rid of me, as I am sure some of you have (yeah I mean you Sissl) boy were they shocked when they found out that they still work for me. MUAHAHAHAHA&amp;nbsp; And you think Mongoose's or is it Mongeese (Mongoosi?) are devious, they have nothing on this hairy footed trickster.&amp;nbsp; Yes their indentured servitude will continue for some time to come.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So for the 8 of you that actually read this drivel, I am sure you are curious as to whether it will continue, Fear not!&amp;nbsp; It Will!&amp;nbsp; At least as much as my time now allows.&amp;nbsp; Days have gotten shorter for me, just as the sun is out more.&amp;nbsp; A wierd paradox is it not?&amp;nbsp; For the time being, my time is taken up coordinating and organizing.&amp;nbsp; I am spending time on all of our forums, getting familiar with them, so if you frequent any other boards drop me a PM and say hello.&amp;nbsp; I am on as Brenlo for EQ and EQ2 and as Bixiebopper for our other forums (Brenlo was taken for some reason, who in their right mind would want to be that guy)&amp;nbsp; I am also in lots of meetings.&amp;nbsp; Why are they called meetings?&amp;nbsp; I am not meeting anyone in particular and I know all the people there?&amp;nbsp; Meeting implies finding new friends or aquaintances, these are more Discussings . . . We sit around and discuss things.&amp;nbsp; I hereby formally move to change the term meetings to discussings or even something simpler like Ugh.&amp;nbsp; Then when your reminder pops up you can just go UGH.&amp;nbsp; And everyone knows you have a meeting, er a discussing to attend.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So plan to still see me around here (Foiled you again you mongooseseseses) just not as often.&amp;nbsp; And I will still be at Fan Faire, Gen Con and other events for you to taunt in person.&amp;nbsp; In the meantime, I am back to taunting Ashlanne and Kytherea.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Brenlo on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;04-14-2005&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;12:51 PM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;A sad day indeed.&amp;nbsp; No more will the sweey bliss of creamy latte's soothe my savage morning wrath.&amp;nbsp; I will miss most the way it would calm me as yet another Mercedes driver would swerve into my lane with no regard for my safety or distance between our cars.&amp;nbsp; I will miss the way it lent me that extra skip to my step and allowed me to face the boards with vigor and energy.&amp;nbsp; I will miss the coffee moments that Ky, Ash and I would share oas our brown brew flowed through our weary and stagnant corpses resurrecting us with 96% experience for yet another onslaught against the wave of mogrel hordes&amp;nbsp;that is the EQ forums.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I know that Ky and Ash are delighting over this as they hold there mugs high and "accidently" spill the magic elixir about me and on me.&amp;nbsp; Finally something they can hold over me and taunt me with.&amp;nbsp; They are evil by nature these halfling women and I fear that desctruction will be my only saviour from their vicious ways.&amp;nbsp; I will begin my plotting now along with the &lt;A href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=OT&amp;amp;message.id=115146" target=_blank&gt;cats&lt;/A&gt; .&amp;nbsp; I am generally a dog person but at the moment I need to borrow a cats mentality.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;It should be an interesting couple of weeks as my body acclimatizes to its new routine of non-caffeinated existance.&amp;nbsp; I am sure that it will be a struggle but I know that I have the help and support of all the Brenlo's World readers to pull me through this trying time, well except for the one guy that called it useless drivel, you know who you are . . . I am watching you *glares menacingly*.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So I have given up coffee. . .&amp;nbsp; Dark days are indeed ahead.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>The Coffee Diaries 3/30/2005</title>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;So there is one hot topic out there in the community today and it's not "Is Brenlo feeling better"&amp;nbsp; (I am thanks for asking).&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Server Merges.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;While I would say that I am shocked at some of the reaction to this announcement but you folks rarely shock me anymore.&amp;nbsp; I guess befuddled would be a better word.&amp;nbsp; One of our board posters expressed it well when he stated that in engineering they had a term for this, NIMBY (Not in my back yard) which seems to be the case.&amp;nbsp; Folks wanted merges, couldn't find groups, guilds were falling apart and the only way to save EQ, according to the many posters on this topic, was to merge servers NOW!&amp;nbsp; Well we watched and waited and decided that this was the time, some 4 months later and now the reaction is "HEY!&amp;nbsp; No one wanted this" which is far from true.&amp;nbsp; You may not have wanted it but many did.&amp;nbsp; Many on this forum and in emails, petitions etc . . . wanted servers merged.&amp;nbsp; I kind of liken this to a home that the owner claims is on fire.&amp;nbsp; He has called and called and called the fire department to put the fire out and when they arrived and whipped out the fire hoses, he is upset that they are spraying water on his furniture.&amp;nbsp; (Yes I know this analogy can be torn apart just as any other&amp;nbsp;but the analogy is not the point).&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Server merges are necessary for the health of the game overall.&amp;nbsp; They are inevitable my friends.&amp;nbsp; They are going to happen.&amp;nbsp; Our goal is to make sure everyone has a healthy server population to play with.&amp;nbsp; A good solid community to interact with.&amp;nbsp; Some servers were doing okay and to those servers we are adding the smallest influx of people from servers that were not okay.&amp;nbsp; Some servers were sort of inbetween and those servers we are putting together to bolster the community, add new guilds and more importantly potential new guild members.&amp;nbsp; More people to group with, more people to buy and sell, more people to tradeskill all of which you have been telling us you wanted and needed and we agree,&amp;nbsp;it is needed. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So now I will talk a little about legacy and heritage, which is the other argument that keeps popping up.&amp;nbsp; The legacy and heritage of EQ are not on some hardware that happened to have a name to make it easier to choose when logging in.&amp;nbsp; The servers could just as easily been numbered.&amp;nbsp; They are just hardware.&amp;nbsp; The legacy and the heritage of EQ resides in you and in me, in our guilds and groups and friends, no matter which box we log into.&amp;nbsp; The server name of Veeshan going away does not take away that FOH was the first guild to conquer Naggy and Vox, it does not diminish what Cestus Dei recently accomplished.&amp;nbsp; Those live on in each of us.&amp;nbsp; Those stories will continue as long as EQ is around and even longer, as long as we continue to tell them.&amp;nbsp; FOH could have been on any server and they would have still taken down those dragons and many other mobs first.&amp;nbsp; It was not the server, it was and is the people.&amp;nbsp; It is all of us that make the EQ community and not the hardware that hosts it.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Yes, I do agree that this can be upsetting.&amp;nbsp; The server I was first a GM on, Innoruuk, is going away.&amp;nbsp; The server I first played on, Veeshan, is going away but my characters, my friends and my stories are still here.&amp;nbsp; No matter which server I log onto tomorrow.&amp;nbsp; The same is true for you my friends.&amp;nbsp; The same is true for you.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I am off to get some coffee now.&amp;nbsp; Have a good day.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;For your perusal I offer the first editiion of Ask Brenlo.&amp;nbsp; Yes, many of these are fun, softball questions and will continue to be so.&amp;nbsp; I will answer legitimate serious questions as well, when I can and when they are presented well.&amp;nbsp; Additionally, while I will offer my opinion on general gameplay and other issues, I will avoid most class specific questions.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;"Yes, Brenlo..um..I was wondering if you can confirm or deny the rumors that next year for the aniversary event, The Fabled Moss Snake will be making an appearance. Can you tell us anything about this?"&lt;xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" &gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Yes there very well may possibly be a Fabled Moss Snake in next year's anniversary events, although any confirmation or denial of the existence of such a creature would be something that would not be revealed until a future anniversary event and is currently being evaluated.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;What's your favorite flavor Skittle?&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Lime, however they did away with them in favor of Sour Apple, yet another anti-Brenlo conspiracy.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Appearance is very important to me in a RPG. Since Luclin I consider all of the male models except Half Elves and Barbarians to be over-muscled. It means enough to me that were I playing a human male of any class other than a Warrior when Luclin came out I would have abandoned the character regardless of level. Even my wood elf seems too beefy to me, although it's bearable if he wears nothing but chain armor.&lt;BR&gt;I think it would be awesome if we had more than one body type per race to choose from or at least had more choices when it comes to the appearance of our attire. (I dread the day I ever get a really great BP with the plate or leather graphic)&lt;SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;Are there any plans to make character appearance any more customizable in this manner?&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Thank you for your long winded and oft asked question.&lt;SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;At this time there are no plans to make changes to character models.&lt;SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;While it is something we would like to do, it is just not feasible right now.&lt;SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;In the meantime, should you wish to be less beefy, I recommend you spend some time on the couch with potato chips.&lt;SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Have you ever 'bumped into' a player who posts on the forums while you were playing?&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Yes I have.&lt;SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;In fact I have bumped into several of you wascally wabbits.&lt;SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;For fear of a lynching however, I do not reveal my identity.&lt;SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Do you ever click on any links in anyones signatures?&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Only when they have pictures.&lt;SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;Words confuse me.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; COLOR: windowtext; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Hi Brenlo. I am curious, are the devs aware of the pathing/spawn issues in Muramite proving grounds (mobs spawning randomly and pathing through camps) and possibly other zones since DoN came out, and is there a fix being worked on? &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;We are indeed aware of the current issues with the proving grounds and we are trying to figure out the reason for this bizarre behavior.&lt;SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;Xenaida has been trying to track the problem down from the design side of things but could not find the issue, so it has been turned over to our able programmers.&lt;SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;Watch for updates from Xenaida on this issue on the On Live forum.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Why do you hate wizards?&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;As mentioned before, I do not hate Wizards although I did mention that I hated 3 specific wizards (not really).&lt;SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;Can you guess which of them submitted this question?&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;The big question in my mind is are you guys gonna solve the problem with racnar hides in the new cultural? &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Will there be more server merges?&lt;SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;(compiled from many submitted PMs)&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;We are watching the servers that have merged, checking their population and feedback, before we decide to proceed with more mergers.&lt;SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;If we do continue to merge servers, the toughest challenge we face is which server to stick with Povar.&lt;SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;You know how those people from Povar are. . .&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Currently, I am engrossed in EQ 2 where I play a Halfling Troubador (we need halfling Bards in EQ)&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp; I do still enjoy EQ and play occasionally.&amp;nbsp; I will let you all know that I actually never played a halfling in EQ. &amp;nbsp; I did play SWG for some time and had a great time there although it did not hold my attention nearly as long as EQ.&amp;nbsp; In fact no MMO to date has kept me attached as long as EQ did and does.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;What do you think is the most sadly-neglected aspect of the game? (For me - the integration of faction with storyline. Majorly underplayed in the last few expansions.)&lt;SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;From a development point of view?&lt;SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;Clearly we could do more for solo and small group play.&lt;SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;It is and will continue to be true that EQ is a group oriented game, that does not mean that we cannot have options for small groups and solo play.&lt;SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;I think you will see some positive changes in that respect soon.&lt;SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;From a player perspective?&lt;SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;So much of the content is neglected by we players.&lt;SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;When we find new people or get new friends into the game, we send them to 10 or 15 specific zones to level up and they often do not get the chance to explore like we once did.&lt;SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;EQ has over 300 zones and many players never even see half of them.&lt;SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;We discourage people not to do quests because the rewards stink, but what about the story and the adventure?&lt;SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;I guess we all get hung up on leveling so fast that we forget to stop and smell the pie.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;So here is round one.&lt;SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;I will post a few more questions and answers tomorrow.&lt;SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;Have a good night and remember to stop and smell the pie.&lt;FONT color=#000000&gt;&lt;I style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Yes I am still sick although I am in the office and being tortured by my other 2 favorite halflings.&amp;nbsp; They are good at torture.&amp;nbsp; I think they live for it.&amp;nbsp; I am sure their husbands never get any abuse cause they take it all out on me.&amp;nbsp; So it is good that I allow their husbands to have a better quality of life by suffering for them.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;See, I am a giving person.&amp;nbsp; Currently I am giving everyone the flu, I hope they enjoy it cause I have slaved away at preparing it for them.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;At least&amp;nbsp;Ash and Ky&amp;nbsp;let me have coffee today.&amp;nbsp; Ash even washed my mug for me.&amp;nbsp; She must want something. . .&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So a big day for all us gamer geeks today.&amp;nbsp; PSP launched WOo Hoo!&amp;nbsp; I do not yet have my hands on one of those beauties, but I will.&amp;nbsp; I may hunt one of you down and take yours.&amp;nbsp; You hear that Loral!&amp;nbsp; I am coming to take away your PSP, if you have one anyway.&amp;nbsp; Maybe that's what Ashlanne wants, Loral's PSP?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I recieved many PMs for Ask Brenlo.&amp;nbsp; Thanks to all of you who submitted questions.&amp;nbsp; I will have that post up tonight, even if I have to finish it from home.&amp;nbsp; To all of you, and there were many, that inquired about DPS changes, Sorry we just aren't ready to release that information yet.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;I am again ill (this is unusual for me.&amp;nbsp; I think I have been the recipient of some sort of influenza attack). So I got up to come into the office today, even though I knew I was ill.&amp;nbsp; It was one of those, "I just took a 4 day weekend and can't possibly call in sick after that" things, you know where you guilt yourself into going into the office even though you have nearly passed a lung?&amp;nbsp; Yeah that.&amp;nbsp; So I knew it would be a good day when, as I finished my morning "get ready" ritual, I grabbed my toothbrush and proceeded to put hair gel on it.&amp;nbsp; Hair gel, on my toothbrush.&amp;nbsp; Yay me.&amp;nbsp; No I did not actually put it in my mouth thank goodness, although some of you might have rejoiced had it sealed my lips shut.&amp;nbsp; Wouldn't have stopped me from typing though.&amp;nbsp; MUAHAHAHAHA.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So how does&amp;nbsp;being sick and nearly brushing my teeth with gooey yellow hair care products relate&amp;nbsp;to EQ?&amp;nbsp; Well it doesn't.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I didn't even have coffee today. Ashlanne and Kytherea would only let me have tea.&amp;nbsp; Poo on them.&amp;nbsp; Double poo.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;On Wednesday or Thursday I would like to do an "Ask Brenlo" Segment here so please PM me with your questions.&amp;nbsp; Now please keep your questions civil.&amp;nbsp; Also understand that questions such as,"Why do youy hate Wizards?" Will not make my post as I don't hate wizards, I only hate Qaman, well okay Qaman and Cinexa, but that's it.&amp;nbsp; Okay Gemdiver too.&amp;nbsp; Err I mean JewelJumper.&amp;nbsp; Okay Jeweljumper, Qaman and Cinexa.&amp;nbsp; That's it.&amp;nbsp; And this chair. . .&amp;nbsp; (I don't really hate any of them they are actually fine people and Jeweljumper sent me cheesecake and coffee)&amp;nbsp; So send in those questions and I will get some answers and some posts.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Thanks gang and keep up the great discussions you have going on class re-envisionment.&amp;nbsp; (That is a tough word to spit out)&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Brenlo on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;03-21-2005&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;09:14 PM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I would like to share an original Haiku I composed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Ashlanne does not share&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Starbucks coffee bought today&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;None for poor Brenlo&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So no coffee for me.&amp;nbsp; No peace either. Gosh you guys are all aflutter with conversation, thoughts and opinions.&amp;nbsp; Some great feedback is out there and I am sure there is more to come.&amp;nbsp; Sure there are also some gems like," Thanks for nothing SOE."&amp;nbsp; Which does not help this process one bit, but perhaps the poster feels a little better now.&amp;nbsp; There is some great stuff in this first pass on class re-envisionment, reflections, redefinition (even I get confused). Yes some classes got less than others.&amp;nbsp; Yes some classes got better stuff than others.&amp;nbsp; Let me again remind you of three important facts;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;1.&amp;nbsp; This is just the beginning.&amp;nbsp; There is more to come.&amp;nbsp; This is not the end of the changes.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;2. None of this is final, we would like to have good discussion and gather good feedback on these changes.&amp;nbsp; If they don't make sense, we won't make the change. These are our first ideas and impressions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;3. I like Pie.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Now you may wonder what pie has to do with any of this.&amp;nbsp; Well nothing really.&amp;nbsp; I just like it.&amp;nbsp; Especially with Cool Whip.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Oh wait.&amp;nbsp; Yeah that's it.&amp;nbsp; Everyone is getting a piece of this new pie.&amp;nbsp; Some of you need less pie to fill you up than others, so you got a smaller slice.&amp;nbsp; Some of you may only get small slices of this scrumptious cherry pie while others get a fat piece with whipped topping.&amp;nbsp; Don't fret though my friends, fans and flamers.&amp;nbsp; There is more pie to come.&amp;nbsp; After this nice cherry pie, we may serve up some apple ( Mmm hot apple pie with vanilla ice cream) and some of you may get a bigger slice of that pie.&amp;nbsp; This is not the only pie coming.&amp;nbsp; There are more in the oven, auntie SOE is baking quite a few for you right now.&amp;nbsp; Wait to see all the pies and how much you get and more importantly, how satisfied you are after you gobble yours up.&amp;nbsp; You may find that you liked your helping just fine, even if Billy the Beastlord got more.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I really like pie.&amp;nbsp; You can send contributions to my Piepal account.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Sometimes things just don't go as you plan.&amp;nbsp; Today for example, I had hoped to post two big things.&amp;nbsp; Well it's just about the end of the day and unfortunately I won't be getting them out the door today.&amp;nbsp; One is delayed as it goes through the approval process, which depending on the schedules of folks here can sometimes take longer than expected.&amp;nbsp; It can be even longer on a week where members of the company are traveling, like this week with folks at GDC (Game Developers Conference).&amp;nbsp; The other is delayed because of last minute changes (positive changes, but changes that are not so final at this moment that I can post them).&amp;nbsp; So the class changes will wait until Monday, but they will be up Monday.&amp;nbsp; There is some good stuff in there.&amp;nbsp; Some changes we want to make (wait until Monday before you ask Loral) and some for you to discuss with us.&amp;nbsp; Monday should be a pretty exciting day for all of us, provided I can actually drag myself our of bed after a rip roaring weekend of yardwork and gaming.&amp;nbsp; I finally picked up GTA San Andreas and plan to play that a little this weekend (maybe a lot if I can get the kids to do the yardwork).&amp;nbsp; I have to wait and play that one after kiddies go to bed though (or while they are mowing).&amp;nbsp; Darn rated M games.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Next&amp;nbsp;week EQ turns 6 years old.&amp;nbsp; Wow.&amp;nbsp; It is hard to believe that this game has been a part of my life for so long.&amp;nbsp; This game and you ornery curs (just kidding you are not all ornery) Hehe.&amp;nbsp; 6 years that I would not trade except for maybe 2 millions dollars and someone to do my yardwork this weekend.&amp;nbsp; I also have to paint the bathroom. Can I do that with MS Paint?&amp;nbsp; Anyhow, I think that while many of you feel anger and frustration, I think it is safe to say that it has not kept you around for 6 years.&amp;nbsp; So take a look back and reflect on what has.&amp;nbsp; This game, this hobby, this phenomenon has been a part of our lives for a while now, and that's pretty special.&amp;nbsp; While I have other games that I have not finished after 6 years ( I will beat you yet Mario Bros!) none has entertained us in the way that this one has.&amp;nbsp; That's what it all boils down to in the end, entertainment.&amp;nbsp; Yes, our friends and our characters play a part in it, but friends are around to share the entertainment with (movies are always better shared with friends unless they talk the whole time or give away the end, like someone who shall remain nameless that said to me as "&lt;EM&gt;A movie which shall remain nameless so as not to spoil it for others" &lt;/EM&gt;started, "You know, I bet he is dead") and characters are the vehicle for that entertainment.&amp;nbsp; The strong lead character that we get attached to.&amp;nbsp; Like one of my favorites, Han Solo, you have to love that guy, although some of you might be more attached to Obi Wan, or Luke and that's okay.&amp;nbsp; Just like our classes there is something for everyone.&amp;nbsp; While we may get a little ticked when someone messes with the characters&amp;nbsp;we love so much (Han Solo should shoot first Darn It!) it does not change the fact that it is still entertaining and even that change, liked or disliked, keeps us talking and enjoying the movie, tv show or game.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Something to think about over the weekend while you flame me for not having the post up today, and some of you will.&amp;nbsp; But sometimes, things are out of my control.&amp;nbsp; Although the stop at Starbucks on the way home is well within my control, well maybe not.&amp;nbsp; I am carpooling with Ashlanne.&amp;nbsp; Hey Ash, Can we stop at Starbucks?&amp;nbsp; What?&amp;nbsp; No I don't have a Mercedes!&amp;nbsp; Why?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Yesterday, in an attempt to keep you on your toes, I slipped a note about the Class Re-Envisioning into my daily "drivel" as one kind board poster refered to these posts ( he has been banned).&amp;nbsp; Before I continue, I would like to mention that often the purpose of these posts will be to entertain you or share my thoughts and opinions.&amp;nbsp; Other times they will be on the game, as it is today's topic.&amp;nbsp; So that said, onto the meat of this post.&amp;nbsp; The slight mention of the class changes&amp;nbsp;has already started a furious chain of posting, some in anticipation, some already starting with what I like to call "Woe is My Class" and others worried about the state of the boards for the next few weeks as we sort through this with you.&amp;nbsp; For those of you who are curious, I should (let me add some definition to that for you, should means I most likely will provided nothing goes wrong or plans don't change and does not in any way make this a promise) have a post up for you tomorrow with our first round of proposed changes.&amp;nbsp; We will then discuss those changes with you and see what reasonable people think and see how that meshes with our thoughts.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So, the grass is not always greener and your yard is just fine.&amp;nbsp; What do I mean by that?&amp;nbsp; Well, to put it quite simply, don't worry about what other classes get out of this.&amp;nbsp; Look at your own and see if this makes your class anymore fun.&amp;nbsp; Peeking over the fence into the Wizard yard, if you are an Enchanter and lamenting that they have a Bansai tree, while you have a ficus, does not make your ficus any less a nice tree.&amp;nbsp; They have a different landscaping scheme and for them, the Bansai worked.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Someone else might have a palm tree and while you might enjoy having a palm tree, your landscaper thinks it is a bad fit for your yard and in this case the landscaper has all authority on what happens in your yard.&amp;nbsp; You can make suggestions, you can lodge your complaints and the landscapers will listen, but ultimately it is up to us, your landscapers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;I know that many of you will find fault with this metaphor and I admit it is not perfect but the sentiment and idea is there.&amp;nbsp; We want to work with you on this.&amp;nbsp; We want all of your yards to be unique and fun.&amp;nbsp; Not the same.&amp;nbsp; All of the yards exactly the same would be balance, we don't want that.&amp;nbsp; We want Flavah, sort of like Flavah Flav but without the gold teeth and large clock around our necks.&amp;nbsp; That would cause back pain.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;When we start the discussion on these changes, the goal (from our perspective and focus) is to make sure each class can find groups and have fun.&amp;nbsp; Not to make sure you do an equivalent amount of damage as every other class or tank, or mezz, or heal.&amp;nbsp; Please keep your focus on how this affects your class.&amp;nbsp; You will find that you just might be a little happier that way.&amp;nbsp; No really, you might.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;See not a single mention of coffee.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;I have discovered that the environment encased in foreign sheet metal and fiberglass, that is my car, is not only the world's best acoustical sound studio (at least to me in that sort my flatulence does not smell that bad but yours is horrid kind of way), it is also home to a great many revelations and epiphanies.&amp;nbsp; I liken my car to the great think tanks of the world, such as the Cato Institute (how that guy from the OJ trial got his own institute is beyond me), The Heritage&amp;nbsp;Foundation and the Earth Policy Institute.&amp;nbsp; When in my auto, (Henceforth known as Brenlo's Renowned Education and Neo-Logic Organization or BRENLO for short) during my commute to work (empty cup on the coffee index this morning) I have the time and mental&amp;nbsp;agility to make&amp;nbsp;world changing&amp;nbsp;discoveries and not just the small ones like, "OOH!&amp;nbsp; So that's what makes the windshield wipers work" or "even with tinted windows the next car can still see you picking your nose".&amp;nbsp; No I mean Earth changing stuff like the solution to war&amp;nbsp;and death&amp;nbsp;(I could tell you but then I would have to kill you).&amp;nbsp; Today I made the realization that Mercedes owners follow a different set of driving rules.&amp;nbsp; IN fact, I surmise that should you peek into the luscious leather interior of a new Mercedes you would see a note to the effect of, &lt;EM&gt;Congratulations on your purchase of this fine, German engineered, driving machine.&amp;nbsp; Let the rules of the road no longer apply to you&amp;nbsp;as you now begin your carefree driving existence.&amp;nbsp; Blinkers?&amp;nbsp; Those simple utilities are for the hungry masses who yearn to own one of our driving machines.&amp;nbsp; Common courtesy!&amp;nbsp; BWAHAHAHA!&amp;nbsp; You own a Mercedes.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Let no lesser automoblie have sway over your true dominion over the road!&amp;nbsp; Welcome to Mercedes!&lt;/EM&gt;&amp;nbsp; I bet there is even a secret handshake.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;Now I will mention that I have not seen this note, but I know it exists.&amp;nbsp; Just as many of you have not seen me, yet you know I am here plotting against the Rangers of the World.&amp;nbsp; I know this to be fact as not a day goes by that a new Mercedes owner doesn't whip into my lane with inches to spare, cutting me off and forcing my poor Hyundai to lurch as the brakes are applied and I once again see my short life flash before my eyesand again relive the horror that was the 4th grade (don't ask), while the Mercedes merrily continues on his way with a cell phone attached to his ear and simultaneously pointing, laughing and making rude hand gestures.&amp;nbsp; Perhaps&amp;nbsp;I will visit a Mercedes dealership under the ruse of purchasing one and see if the tag is there, where I have an air bag warning and take a picture.&amp;nbsp; If any of you have evidence of this tag, please send me a picture.&amp;nbsp; Let's uncover this mystery.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So yesterday I was stumbling about the office, with my hand clutched to my chest doing my best Fred Sanford impersonation as I swore, yet again, that this was the big one.&amp;nbsp; What do you think caused this declination in the health of the one and only Bixiebopper?&amp;nbsp; No it was not the sudden appearance of the fabled Jalapeno bagel, nor was it a generous portion of coffee gifted to me by mythical beings from beyond.&amp;nbsp; No it was neither of those things.&amp;nbsp; I saw the first pass of the class re-evaluation list.&amp;nbsp; I know that many of you were ready to hire poor Indiana Jones to come out of retirement and hunt it down like some religious artifact.&amp;nbsp; No need.&amp;nbsp; It has been unearthed and after some cleaning and prepping will be on display soon.&amp;nbsp; Yes this is one of the good things I have been teasing you about and no I am not going to reveal more just yet.&amp;nbsp; Scream at me all you want, I am used to it.&amp;nbsp; You can't hurt my feelings *sniff*.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I think now Kytherea needs to make me coffee, "Oh Kytherea.&amp;nbsp; Coffee now!"&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Hey!&amp;nbsp; She smacked&amp;nbsp;me as she&amp;nbsp;yelled,"Yeah Right, you don't own a Mercedes!"&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;No this is not an ad, and you can't type /starbucks and order a drink, although I wish I could.&amp;nbsp; This is the new drink for the month of March at Starbucks.&amp;nbsp; At least here in CA and Oh My is this good.&amp;nbsp; It is sweet chocolatey, caffeinated decadence.&amp;nbsp; The synergy (a fun word to use when you want to sound more businesslike) of the caramel, the chocolate and the coffee is best described as a soothingly sweet taste that lulls your taste buds into a state of serenity that even the Dali Lama would envy.&amp;nbsp; If you are partial to coffee with more than a spoonful of sugar (which by the way does not make the medicine go down any easier, believe me) then I suggest you try this drink.&amp;nbsp; Even in my partially influenzed (new word, I just made it up.&amp;nbsp; I want 10 cents anytime one of you uses it) state I can still savor its yummy goodness.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;I am going to make you wait for 2 and 1, so don't ask.&amp;nbsp; :smileytongue:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I left for work 15 minutes earlier than normal this morning.&amp;nbsp; Traffic has been a little heavier and I like to try and get in a little early.&amp;nbsp; I have been lurching into our parking lot at exactly the presbribed start time each.&amp;nbsp; So merrily I leap into my car and make haste to the freeway to get a little earlier start to the day.&amp;nbsp; I lurched into my parking place at exactly the prescribed start time. . .&amp;nbsp; I didn't stop for Starbucks or an Egg McMuffin.&amp;nbsp; Straight to work.&amp;nbsp; Same time.&amp;nbsp; I do have another method of telling just how long it takes to get into the office, I call it the coffee index.&amp;nbsp; I leave the house with a full cop of coffee each day.&amp;nbsp; When there is little to no traffic, I end up at work with nearly a full cup of coffee.&amp;nbsp; On heavy traffic days, I end up at work with an empty cup.&amp;nbsp; Today I could have used two.&amp;nbsp; I did rock out to the Goo Goo Dolls though which is fun when no one else knows what you are singing as you wail away at full volume in the confines of your personal sound studio.&amp;nbsp; My car has pretty decent acoustics.&amp;nbsp; So I will try and avoid talking about how bad traffic was and just refer to my coffee index.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;There is lots of good stuff coming that I am bursting at the seams to talk with you about but it is going to have to wait a little longer.&amp;nbsp; This is going to be an exciting time for us EQ folk and we hope for you as well.&amp;nbsp; Look for details soon.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <title>Top 10 Reasons I don't have the best job in the world</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=brenlo&amp;message.id=34#M34</link>

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So my last post really got folks talking (some are yelling) and that's a good thing.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Getting folks discussing things is one of the goals I have for this little section.&amp;nbsp; To any who took offense, I apologize as that was most certainly not my intention.&amp;nbsp; Rather it was to stir up some discussion and for many of you it did just that.&amp;nbsp; To clarify one little point, I do understand immersion and I love a truly immersive world.&amp;nbsp; However, immersion should never come at the expense of fun.&amp;nbsp; The first few times you run across an expansive virtual world is a wondrous experience.&amp;nbsp; By the 5th, 6th or 7th time, it starts to become tedium.&amp;nbsp; We have to avoid tedium in a game such as this.&amp;nbsp; People have to be able to get to the fun fast.&amp;nbsp; We also have to maintain that immersion for those folks who do enjoy running across the world, and in most cases we have.&amp;nbsp; The boats are gone for now, and yes even I miss them at times.&amp;nbsp; I remember riding them and exchanging languages or just socializing but when new transport methods were added, I gladly moved on to those and left our old friend the boats behind.&amp;nbsp; Would it be nice to occasionally jump on one and take a trip through the Ocean of Tears?&amp;nbsp; Possibly, on occasion, but that choice is gone and maybe that is why there has been so much talk over some of the changes.&amp;nbsp; That the choice was removed.&amp;nbsp; Like the arena in the bazaar.&amp;nbsp; I think we can all admit that it was seldom used, but the choice was there to use it if you wanted.&amp;nbsp; Something else to discuss I guess.&amp;nbsp; So have at it!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So on to the real topic Du Jour.&amp;nbsp; When commuting to work (no not another bad analogy so put down the pitchforks) I have a lot of time to think.&amp;nbsp; This morning while driving in, which only took 25 minutes Yay!, I thought back to all the times over the last 5 years that I have met you folks in person and in particular over this last year that I have been the Community Manager (or in the words of one member&amp;nbsp;of our community, the Court Jester) and many of you fine folk tell me how I must have the best job in the world.&amp;nbsp; While I do have a great job and I enjoy what I do immensely, there are times that it is not so great.&amp;nbsp; They are small things and do not take wholly diminish the overall joy I take in this position, however they deserved mention none the less.&amp;nbsp; So I now present to you the top 10 reasons why being the EQ Community Manager is not the best job in the world.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;#10 - Sharing an office with overly caffeinated Halflings:&amp;nbsp; The Brenlettes (as Lord Pfister calls Ashlanne and Kytherea) are a great asset to the team.&amp;nbsp; They are hard working, dedicated, fun and fond of coffee.&amp;nbsp; It is this fondness that leads to the 10th reason I do not have the best job in the world.&amp;nbsp; When caffeinated these two become a force of nature filled with silliness and creating rampant havoc in my normal daily routine.&amp;nbsp; Whether it be Ashlanne dancing with my chair or Kytherea throwing candy at me, it creates an atmosphere non-conducive to my routine of normality.&amp;nbsp; Now I am certain that these two will now tell that I am far from normal and that I too have a goofy streak but do not believe it for it is just the coffee talking.&amp;nbsp; By the way, Kytherea just made more coffee.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;#9 - Free Donuts and Bagels on Friday:&amp;nbsp; I know, I know you are thinking what the heck is wrong with Brenlo (and not just because of this list) Donuts, or Doughnuts should be seen as a&amp;nbsp;boon.&amp;nbsp; An enjoyment.&amp;nbsp; A pleasant perk to brighten your day.&amp;nbsp; Each Friday should be relished, even cherished for the grandeur that these pastries bring your morning.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Chocolate covered, jelly filled, maple bars the list goes on and on.&amp;nbsp; Sprinkled, covered in peanuts, old fashioned glazed, how I love the doughnut.&amp;nbsp; However . . . I am on a low carb diet and viewing these tempting and tasty tidbits of carb filled passion and tenderness makes Fridays a&amp;nbsp;little less bright.&amp;nbsp; In a moment of weakness I will even succumb to the sultry and tasty call of the bagel but alas, the Jalapeno bagel is already taken.&amp;nbsp; ARGH!!!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Look for the countdown to continue tomorrow.&amp;nbsp; And you mongoose conspirators, I am slowly unraveling your secrets.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
