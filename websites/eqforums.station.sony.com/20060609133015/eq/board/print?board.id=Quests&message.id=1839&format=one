				I know the devs already know of the Zanivar quest triggers in befallen where Zanivar wont move. However the triggers themselves seem to be working fine. If you go further in the zone going back and forth to answer the text, eventually he will head down to his final spot next to the Urn. Which by the way, the main urn and like 3 out of the 5 urn spawns are human models. So anyway, you get through all the Urns and it looks like finally it triggers Zanivar to attack. Kill him and you can loot the map. Well from there your stuck, unless you have gate. There is no NPC to zone you out like some of the other instances. Ive had the same problem with under the field of bone quest. Once you get done you best have gate or your stuck.
