				There is for sure some huge differences in the ease of master level
armor drops between races.&nbsp; Like huge as in, on one hand nearly
trivial, on the other, so ridiculous its not worth it. <br>
<br>
However, I'm not sure that asking for revamps of old zone content is
the answer to fix things.&nbsp; More likely it should either be,
A)&nbsp; change the required drops for certain racial armor or B) allow
the items to drop off similar mobs in different zones. <br>
<br>
Like Pile of Gravel:<br>
<b>Plane of Nightmare</b> a weathered gargoyle (Level: 57)<br>
<b>Ruins of Old Paineel</b> (The Hole) a broken gargoyle (Levels: 56 -
58) a crumbling gargoyle (Levels: 46 - 48) a destroyed gargoyle
(Levels: 46 - 47)a ruined gargoyle (Levels: 48 - 53)a stone ward
(Levels: 55 - 58) an ancient gargoyle (Level: 55) an old gargoyle
(Level: 49)<br>
<b>The Ruined City of Dranik</b> a malfunctioning stoneworker (Level: 66) a transmuted stoneworker (Ruined City of Dranik) (Levels: 64 - 68)<br>
<br>
Vs my troll armor<br>
<b>Plane of Nightmare</b> a tar`dak hunter (Level: 54)<br>
<b>Veeshan's Peak</b> a lava basilisk (Veeshan's Peak) (Levels: 60 - 64) Magma Basilisk (Level: 65)<br>
<b>Vegarlson, the Earthen Badlands</b>A Needlescale Basilisk (Levels: 63 - 64)<br>
<br>
PoN is common between the two.&nbsp; But the drop rate for teeth is
just absurd.&nbsp; I heard someone above say something about a stack(s)
of piles of gravel... I don't think I've ever been able to stomach
farming more than 3 teeth at a time in PoN.&nbsp; Thats quite a few
hours for a few teeth.&nbsp; For loot that is not sold that often, and
for skillups that are much easier to get via Shadowscream.<br>
<br>
The remaining zones, lets compare:<br>
VP and PoEarth...vs... the Hole and Rcod.<br>
<br>
See any problems there? The plane of earth vs the hole hehe.&nbsp; Or
VP vs the hole.&nbsp; Its not even on the same playing field in terms
of difficulty.&nbsp; And two very difficult keyed zones vs one easy key
zone?&nbsp; What gives?<br>
