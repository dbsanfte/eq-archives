				<DIV>Hello Everyone,</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Before I get too far along, I thought I'd ask for some feedback from players on how they view different stats with respect to the class(es) they play.&nbsp; Obviously, I have my own view on things, but I'd like to know how any why people have their own views.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>What I'd like, is for you to&nbsp;take a look at this list of the basic item stats (feel free to include any others that I left out), and let me know how and why they think they are, or aren't, important to your class.&nbsp; All comments are useful, and feel free to use current items as examples to illustrate your points if you feel the need.&nbsp; Be sure to INCLUDE THE CLASS name, so I can put your feedback in context.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Hopefully, I'll gain some new insights that will help me do my job better.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Thanks.</DIV>

				<P><STRONG>Being a paladin when ever I consider a new item ( i.e. an possible upgrade) I&nbsp; first see how they improve my HP and AC. I go by the ratio of 4 HP == 1 AC.&nbsp; I next look to see if it has shielding or avoidance ( as I am not maxxed out on those yet). &nbsp;After that I check the resistances.&nbsp; My stats are all maxxed so I do not look to those, but a lower levels I checked STR, STA, WIS, DEX, AGI ( in that order).. Special focus goodies I see if I have them on another item. Always looking for those that will allow me to tank that much longer, or heal that much better.. </STRONG></P>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Attack: Wish we (as a class) werent capped at the same level other classes were... but as long as its not required (much) to sacrifice other worn mods to reach the cap its not a big deal.<br><br>Delay: Doesnt matter, tho low is good.<br>Damage: High <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0><br>Range: Really need something long range for pulling.&nbsp; Could be 0 damage, 10 delay... as long as it has a good range.<br> </div>
<div>Haste: Heck, 32% haste is fine since any class that can cast haste can cap that at 100. (maybe not bards, but meh)<br> </div>

				Class: Cleric<br>Progress point: High end Qvic/Txecvu<br><br>This is just my own personal rules of thumbs I generally follow when I look at gear for upgrades and such. I know it isn't ideal but it works for me mostly <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0><br><br>When I look at items being linked, the first three things I generally check out are:<br><br>HP: More HP I have, the better. If it's less HP than the item I'm replacing I don't really look much beyond that.<br>Mana: Same as HP basically.<br>AC: I'm willing to take an AC drop if other factors make it nice, but generally I only look for more AC.<br><br>As for the rest of the stats.<br><br>Basic stats (STA/WIS/INT/etc...), I don't usually give a second glance to, as long as the item appears to have a lot of  them I don't look into specifics. The high end stats, other than the minimum to keep at/near the caps, don't really play much of a factor in my equipment choices. <br><br>Resists: I look closer to than basic stats but I still only skim them. Generally I try to make sure the resists are still going up (I'm not capped yet) but I don't specifically look for them in a piece.<br><br>ManaRegen/HP Regen: It's nice if the item has it, but I don't specifically look for it. If the piece I'm replacing has a high +regen modifier I might look closr but generally I skip it. It would be nice if those totals were visible somewhere in game so we could tell how far over the cap we are, and that might make me pay more attention to those values. <br><br>For combat effects, I do try and get them when I can, but it's not a priority for me yet. They are more of a "That'd be nice to have" for me at this stage. Still, it would be nice to see current totals in game somehow for those +modifiers, so I can tell "Oh I'm near my cap" or "Man I should work on that if I can find the upgrades."<br><br>Same applies for SKill mods.<br><br>In case you missed one of the themes, one of the big things that may make SKill mods and Combat effects more noticeable is to make them more visible. It's outside your domain I know, but if you (generic you) can come up with a way that we can see what skill mods, combat effects and regen rates we have on us in total, it would help greatly. With that information they would probably become a bigger factor in my equipment choices and equipment desires. Without it, I may put in for something that has Extended Range, without realizing I've already got 2 Extended Range items already.<br><br>Oh almost forgot meelee weapon stats. With my Epic 1.5, I don't even look at shields nor 2HB's so that just leaves 1HB's. There, I tend to look and see if the damage/delay is better than my summoned hammer, and then I check procs on it. I'd love some more hammer choices to meelee with (soloing) that would rival my summoned hammer. In situations when I'm not fighting though, most of the time I keep Epic 1.0 equipped out of habit. (I've gotten into the habit of using the bandoler to switch to mod rod, click rod, switch back to rez stick)<p>Message Edited by Saroc_Luclin on <span class=date_text>07-06-2006</span> <span class=time_text>04:15 PM</span>

				CLASS:&nbsp; Shadowknight
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>HP: Unimportant.&nbsp; A byproduct of gear with high AC<br>Mana: Same as HP<br>Endurance: Completely useless<br>AC:&nbsp;
Most important stat in the game for an SK.&nbsp; All of my gear choices
are based on this number, plus the type 2 mods(e.g. shielding) and
focus effects.<br>
 </div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>HP Regen: Unimportant<br>Mana Regen: Only important if you are not capped.&nbsp; Very easy to cap.<br>Endurance Regen:&nbsp; unimportant<br>
 </div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Strength: not considered when making gear choices<br>Stamina: not considered when making gear choices<br>Agility: not considered when making gear choices<br>Dexterity: not considered when making gear choices<br>Charisma: not considered when making gear choices<br>Intelligence: not considered when making gear choices<br>Wisdom:
not considered when making gear choices.&nbsp; Why does the
shadowknight planar armor from plane of fear have wisdom on it instead
of intelligence?<br>
<br>
 </div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Cold Resist: Generally not important as the high ac gear typically
has decent resists.&nbsp; Resist buff clickies are a whole other story.<br>Disease Resist: Ditto<br>Poison Resist: Ditto<br>Magic Resist: Ditto<br>Fire Resist<img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-very-happy.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0>itto </div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Attack: Not important<br>Delay: Not important<br>Damage: Not important<br>Range: Not important </div>

<div>Haste: Not important can be tributed.&nbsp; I'm having&nbsp; a
hard time optimizing my tranking gear and finding an affordable haste
item.&nbsp; This is at the qvic level </div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Combat Effects: Unimportant<br>Shielding: The second most important stat.&nbsp; This and AC are how i choose my gear<br>Stun Resist: not something i try to find on gear.<br>Strikethrough: unimportant.<br>Spell Shield: Something that i should focus on but it is very hard to find on gear with high ac and shielding<br>Avoidance: the third most important tank stat.&nbsp; <br>Accuracy: unimportant<br>DOT Shielding: Something that i should focus on but it is very hard to find on gear with high ac and shielding </div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

Skill Mods: generally considered useless.&nbsp; <br>
Click Effects: One of the real joys of EQ.&nbsp; I have 17 click effect items that i have collected for this toon.&nbsp; <br>
Proc Effects: Not all that important.&nbsp; Happy with the generic
lifetap effects for SK weapons but would like to see more rune proc
effects for the SK class<br>
Worn Effects: improved dodge, improved parry and similar worn effects
have been shown through parsing to have such a minimal effect on
tanking that it could be nothing more than the RNG playing games.&nbsp;
Completely unimportant.&nbsp; <br>
Focus Effects:&nbsp; Very important at all times to have a magic damage
focus for lifetaps, a distance focus for pulling, a focus for extended
DOTs, mana preservation focus, and for HT we need a generic damage
focus.&nbsp; The generic damage focus is very hard to find.&nbsp;
Almost everything is magic.<br>
<br>
<br>
My gear goals for my SK are to cap shielding and avoidance, put the
highest AC aug i can find in every slot, and pick the highest AC gear
for my content while maintaining the needed focus effects.&nbsp; I
would like to get more spell shielding and dot shielding but the
choices are very limited.<br>

<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>HP: Lack of hitpoints causes death, so definately important. However, having more hitpoints doesnt allow me to tank better. Not as important as AC/Avoid/Shielding and other things that reduce damage taken.<BR>Mana: I definately need mana because I depend on my spells.<BR>Endurance:&nbsp;I have never seen my endurance bard drop... So&nbsp;I dont know.&nbsp;<BR>AC: This is absolutely critical.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>HP Regen: Nice to have.<BR>Mana Regen: We dont get a chance to sit and med, so definately important.<BR>Endurance Regen: Not important.&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Strength: I find str, sta, agi, dex, and wisdom to be very important... However my stats have been above the hard cap for the last several expansions, so I take them for granted.<BR>Stamina: <BR>Agility: <BR>Dexterity: <BR>Charisma: <BR>Intelligence: <BR>Wisdom: </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Attack: Never really noticed a difference, I dont have a whole lot of input as my damage output isnt that great and my role is really a tank who can toss out nice heals.<BR>Delay: <BR>Damage: <BR>Range: </DIV>
<DIV>Haste: </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Combat Effects: <BR>Shielding: I have picked some up, but I dont really notice a difference in my tanking ability. My understanding is it that it is more noticable against NPC that hit really hard.<BR>Stun Resist: I want to max this as nothing is worse than pulling an NPC and being stunned while it gets to take cheap shots.<BR>Strikethrough: This helps me do more damage since I usually attack monsters from the front.<BR>Spell Shield: Dont pay much attention to it.<BR>Avoidance: I notice a big difference in tanking with this.<BR>Accuracy: Dont pay much attention to it.<BR>DOT Shielding: Dont pay much attention to it.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Skill Mods: I have never had a skill mod item.<BR>Click Effects: I like clicky ac/mana regen/resists. <BR>Proc Effects: I like heal procs on my weapons.<BR>Worn Effects: I used to dread giving up my faerune item, but now that it is an AA it isnt so bad.<BR>Focus Effects: Improved Dodge, Parry are awesome. I want to get cleave and ferocity eventually.<BR></DIV></DIV>

I'm getting heals right?<br>Mana Regen: N/A<br>Endurance Regen: *blink**Did you actually just say Endurance Regen? It's the single most deficient part of the entire game and it needs to be addressed, End Regen should be about on par with Mana Regen for casters.<br><br>Strength, Stamina etc: Nothing wrong with the way they are now, no need for more unless the caps get raised again<br><br>Resists: Could use a bit more on these, for example I'm way over the cap on all my physical stuff but I have a hard time getting enough resists. Then again, anything I really need to resist is probably unresistable.<br><br>Attack: meh it adds dps but doesn't really help me do my job as a tank, easily maxxed though.<br>Delay: I want to avoid ripostes and damage shields so higher delay weapons are where it's at for warriors in my opinion, lower delays for offhanders i suppose but I'm really more concerned with aggro than anything else where weapons are concerned.<br>Damage: I want high damage to go with that higher delay<br>Range: Wouldn;t mind having a ranged attack that I don't have to swap aout with my "good" range item. I know bandolier helps but I still don't have enough bandoliers.<br>Haste: Important but there's nothing wrong with the way it's done now except maybe put it on some more items so it's not such a dkp hog.<br><br>Combat Effects: Need more items with it that also have stats like Avoidance, Shielding and AC, I need more CE but I can;t really sacrifice other things for it like i'd like to.<br>Shielding: Big time need for this on items, augs or whatever, we can't sacrifife it.<br>Stun Resist: need more<br>Strikethrough: meh.get rid of ALL the spam though please.<br>Spell Shield: big<br>Avoidance: see shielding<br>Accuracy: meh<br>DoT Shielding: i never notice it but I guess so<br><br>Skill mods: Defensive stuff I like<br>Click effects: I love them, from the useful stuff to illusions or whatever, just need more buff slots to go with them<br>Proc Effects: Static Blow please, better augs weapons with proc rates etc, did I mention Static Blow?<br>Worn effects: defensive stuff<br>Focus effects: give me enough EoA to keep up with other classes' aggro output.<br>Shields: Yes glad you asked we need more good shields and better ways to use them, say a warrior useable weapon similar to what knights get that can only be used with a shield?<br><br><div></div>

<DIV>CLASS:&nbsp; Enchanter&nbsp; (Played Chanter main for a long time and was first Class Correspondent so I will add my Chanter perspective as well)</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>HP: Moderately important.&nbsp; Helps becuase Chanters tend teo get beat on more than any other caster<BR>Mana:&nbsp; Very Important.&nbsp; Determines ability to cast throughout a fight.&nbsp; Meaningful for long fights.<BR>Endurance:&nbsp; No impact at all<BR>AC: Helpful if you get hit.&nbsp; Mitigates incoming damage and helps you survive a couple rounds.&nbsp; Important for Chanters who must survive some hits to regain CC</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>HP Regen: Barely helpful.&nbsp; Numbers are not very high.&nbsp; Helps a little when solo-ing but healing potions made it somewhat unimportant.<BR>Mana Regen: Used to be important.&nbsp; Now with 10000 mana pool the norm.&nbsp; 15 vs 25 mana regen doesn't mean anything.<BR>Endurance Regen:&nbsp; No use whatsoever</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Strength: If you can walk with everything you carry thats all that matters.<BR>Stamina: Tiny HP increase.&nbsp; Basically negligible.<BR>Agility: Very important to help avoid incoming melee.&nbsp; Chanters take more melee than any caster and need to survive and cast through it.<BR>Dexterity: Very important for Critical DD nukes<BR>Charisma: Critical for charming, mezzing and pacifying effectiveness<BR>Intelligence: Important for spellcasting and mana pool<BR>Wisdom: Unused by Mages</DIV>

				Merloc thanks for asking!<br>
<blockquote><div>-------<br>CLASS: Monk<br>
</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>HP: Important up to a point, less important after it becomes
acceptable to take several rounds from mobs you run into (but never not
important)<br>Mana: Not important<br>Endurance: Not terribly important
past a point (I have nothing to spend end on if burning after a point -
on plows regen is the issue, not pool size)<br>AC:Important up to a
point - Once you're above the soft cap its not terribly important, the
rate of return isnt optimal for a leather class, so its a hard stat to
focus on imo.&nbsp; I'd like more, but I just don't see SoE ever
getting away from the armor archtype blinders.<br>
 </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>HP Regen: Not really important- I'm capped, but 45 regen doesnt do much against the 1k-10k hitters I run into, even in exp grps<br>Mana Regen: Not important<br>Endurance
Regen: Important to a point, it takes about 30-40minutes in an exp
group with constant use to go through an end bar, unfortunatly it takes
even longer to refill.&nbsp; We just don't have much to use end on, so
unless that changes, its only marginally useful.<br>
 </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Strength: I'm capped, its not terribly useful.&nbsp; I also have
an archiac weight penalty, what good does it do me besides a few atk
and end?<br>Stamina: Likewise capped , not useful except for some hp, some end.<br>Agility: Likewise capped, only useful for a few pitiful (very few) avoidance ac and some end.<br>Dexterity: Likewise capped, only useful for minor proc gains and some end.<br>Charisma: Likewise capped- not useful, im LONG passed the merchant cap, and likewise its only minorly beneficial on DI fires.<br>Intelligence: Not capped - only useful in tradeskills.<br>Wisdom:Capped
- only useful in tradeskills...its rather hard to come by at lower
levels, meaning melee have an inherrant tradeskill disadvantage.<br>
 </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Cold Resist: Almost capped - the resist system has its problems,
but I enjoy having 600 vs all self buffed, semi-useful on some aes
(mostly older content)<br>Disease Resist: See above<br>Poison Resist: See above<br>Magic Resist: See above<br>Fire Resist:See above<br>
 </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Attack: Useful, unfortunatly its easy to cap....not useful after that<br>Delay: I'm beginning to see rounding errors on monk weapons at low delay, I'm still gathering concrete evidence though<br>Damage: Useful duh~<br>Range:250 or so on throwing is useful, under that sorta sucks.<br>
 </div>
<div>Haste: I've been capped at 40-45% on items for about 6yrs
now.....but nice to have a decent selection available for moving gear
around (its currently on like 3 items I have- or will be soon)<br>
 </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Combat Effects: Pretty much useful only for dps procs...which don't exist in abundance anymore due to dmg augs being more dps<br>Shielding: Useful, but not my major focus - i prefer to not take hits<br>Stun
Resist: Not really useful as a monk at all, although I think i may end
up near cap just because it works out that way eventually<br>Strikethrough: Very useful, sorta hard to get, I want to be sure im at 35% if possible at all times.<br>Spell
Shield: Very useful, harder to get until DK, I aim for 35%.&nbsp;
Harder to raise due to rareness on melee gear until DK - casters in
guild are at like 50% easily - no monk serverwide has 35% I believe.<br>Avoidance: Useful, unfortunatly everyone and their brother has 100 and its on all sorts of gear.<br>Accuracy:
Very useful, unfortunatly the cap needs to be raised imo.&nbsp;
Probably on the short list of most-desired mods for any dps class. <br>DOT
Shielding:Moderatly useful, depends alot on amount of DoT AE
itemization (currently not tons in game), harder to raise, needs to be
on more melee gear. Ditto as spell shielding.<br>
 </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Skill Mods: +Block% fairly useful (and too **SMURF** rare, 1 weapon in
luclin, time tunic, anguish legs...thats it), +Dodge% not so much, the
rest are....there are no others in game for monks really =/<br>Click
Effects: More needed!&nbsp; Lots of stacking issues though - especially
more overhaste, too **SMURF** rare.&nbsp; Other clickies like monk class
items (anguish tunic, vish cloak) are rather lame imo - especially the
vish cloak, why put in a 1200dd clicky that takes away from your dps
when clicking? not a large upgrade at all....<br>Proc Effects:
Zzzzzzzzzzzzz...boring for awhile now.&nbsp; Fiery Strike V, VII,
VIIII, IX, XI, XIXIXIXVIIIIVIVIOSDUIDOMGIMSOBORED.....oh and bring back
Serpents Bite - and upgrade it...seriously a proc that is missing from
monk weapons!<br>Worn Effects: You need more +FK dmg mods, um, I can't
really think of anything else in this category.&nbsp; Too bad that 10
fk is only worth about 2-2.5dps though.<br>Focus Effects: Yaay~....look down<br>
  <br>
Improved Block = very useful, too rare on items though (IB4 is only on
2 items, my class only items, and a rare bracer from a zone not
condusive to farming), its also very rare on lower lvl items vs
say....Parry items that pop up all over.<br>
Improved Dodge = semi useful, but not nearly as much as block, decent itemization currently.<br>
Ferocity = not too useful for a monk, going from 5 to 6 added about
5dps....its a very lame focus for monsk, we need alternatives...<br>
Cleave = pretty useful, not a huge dps increase but still seeing decent gains, itemization for monk is nice.<br>
Other mods = Um, at one point or another a few other mods have appeared
on gear...unfortunatly, theyre not very useful (ie anguish tunic's
focus only adds about 2-3dps at most), melee need serious help.<br>-------</div></blockquote><br><div></div>

Most of the things Chanters do, there is not much scaling as gear progresses.&nbsp; Slows are the same percentage. Mezz only varies in duration by 1 tick on a high end gear chanter over a naked one.&nbsp; No foci effects debuffs or buffs other than duration which REALLY doesn't matter all that much.&nbsp; But adding a Foci that effects runes by X% would start to make so gear difference between chanters, in my humble opinion anyway.</P><p>Message Edited by Breez_Bayou on <span class=date_text>07-06-2006</span> <span class=time_text>12:44 PM</span>

One of the reasons I quit playing so much was the feeling of being overwhelmed at having to replace ALL my focus effects and the domino effect it would have as I lost functionality to replace gear.<BR></DIV><p>Message Edited by Gloriana-EM on <span class=date_text>07-06-2006</span> <span class=time_text>12:49 PM</span>

Also, proc rate mods on weapons are a very handy thing.<BR><STRONG>Worn Effects:</STRONG> I personally don't put much value in worn effects like Faerune anymore, due to AA's to replace the entire effect.

<DIV>As a note, I didn't give anything a 10 because so many of the listed statistics have caps, so a balance with fairly great amounts of everything, but not excessive, still adds up quickly.</DIV><p>Message Edited by Haliken-Innoruuk on <span class=date_text>07-06-2006</span> <span class=time_text>01:02 PM</span>

				<DIV>CLASS:&nbsp; Ranger</DIV>
<DIV>Raiding Experience : Guild recently got into Txevu, we've killed a couple named in there but have yet to make a serious drive towards the boss of the zone (and Tacvi access)</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>HP:&nbsp;&nbsp; Very Important<BR>Mana:&nbsp; Middle importance.&nbsp; Recast on our nukes puts me low only if I don't have a mana regen buff, or if I'm burning Hail of Arrows as fast as I can<BR>Endurance:&nbsp; Zero Importance<BR>AC:&nbsp;&nbsp; Important.&nbsp; It helps when soloing if not bow kiting, and also helps when assisting as a Tank Mezzer</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>HP Regen:&nbsp; Unimportant<BR>Mana Regen:&nbsp; Middle importance.&nbsp; Not that hard to cap, but recast on most nukes make it harder to run out of mana<BR>Endurance Regen:&nbsp; Zero Importance</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Strength:&nbsp; Middle importance until capped; afterwords, only importance is in keeping capped.<BR>Stamina:&nbsp; Very Important.&nbsp; More Sta = more HP.&nbsp; One of three most important stats to try to keep capped, or to get capped.&nbsp; After capped, only importance on gear is in keeping it capped.<BR>Agility:&nbsp; Unimportant.&nbsp; Little impact upon defensive abilities that I've noticed.</DIV>
<DIV>Dexterity:&nbsp; Very Important.&nbsp; One of three most important stats to try to keep capped, or to get capped.&nbsp; After capped, only importance on gear is in keeping it capped.<BR>Charisma:&nbsp; Unimportant.<BR>Intelligence: Zero Importance<BR>Wisdom: Very Important.&nbsp; One of three most important stats to try to keep capped, or to get capped.&nbsp; Third of these character stats after Sta and Dex.&nbsp; After capped, only importance on gear is in keeping it capped.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Cold Resist: <BR>Disease Resist: <BR>Poison Resist: <BR>Magic Resist: <BR>Fire Resist: </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>All resists are equally important.&nbsp; I don't look at these Very Important statistics when looking at gear however, because for the most part resists tend to go upwards as one acquires more and better gear from raids.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Attack:&nbsp; Very Important until one exceeds the cap, then only importance is in keeping at or near the cap<BR>Delay:&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>Damage: <BR>Range: </DIV>
<DIV>Haste:&nbsp; Important.&nbsp; Melee need to keep one (or two, or maybe even three) haste items on them to allow all but one to be upgraded with a non-haste item, but so long as there is at least one worn haste item, the presence of haste on any other potential upgrade is moot (especially with Enchanter haste spells being as high haste as they are).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The other stats in this grouping seem to be intended for weapons.&nbsp; Obviously, a high Range for a ranged attack is desireable - it helps to have a greater pulling range, especially with mob runspeeds nowadays, and the potential to avoid some mob AE's by using ranged instead of melee combat can permit the healers to concentrate more on those who cannot avoid the AE's thusly.&nbsp; Weapon Damage is Important in and of itself.&nbsp; Weapon Delay is also Important in and of itself (high delays on 2 handers reduce the number of ripostes taken and increase the Damage Bonus per hit, and low delays on one handers increase both the number of ripostes taken and the number of times per minute that the Damage Bonus is applied).&nbsp; Taken together, however, you get the Very Important Damage/Delay ratio.&nbsp; The ratio is of more importance than either the damage or the delay is, on their own.&nbsp; As a note, for archery attacks, the Damage on the arrow is Very Important (as opposed to just Important) because it is added to the damage of the bow when the game determines how hard that particular attack hit.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Combat Effects: More procs.&nbsp; 'nuff said.<BR>Shielding: Helps tanks more than it does me.&nbsp; I'll take it, but its Unimportant.<BR>Stun Resist: Helps tanks more than it does me.&nbsp; I'll take it, but its Unimportant.<BR>Strikethrough: Important.&nbsp; Worth keeping between the 25% and 35% marks if possible to do so without augs, especially as I don't get any Strikethrough AA's.<BR>Spell Shield:&nbsp;Important.&nbsp; Reduces the damage from AE nukes that I cannot avoid while raiding.&nbsp; Outside of raids, Unimportant because mobs don't tend to nuke that badly.<BR>Avoidance: Important.&nbsp; see AC.<BR>Accuracy: Important.&nbsp; Fewer misses means more damage dealt in the same amount of time.<BR>DOT Shielding: Important, but only for raiding, as few mobs outside of raids seem to bother with dots, and those that do can typically be cureed by the group in short order (unlike raids where the healers are busy concentrating on the tanks).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Skill Mods: Not sure if weapon skill mods do much of anything.&nbsp; Other skill mods, such as Dodge, Parry, Riposte, and tradeskill mods, can be useful depending on the skill being modified and how often it is used.&nbsp; The Parry +4% mod on my arms that I got in Time, for example, only help when I'm being attacked.<BR>Click Effects: Depends on the effect.<BR>Proc Effects: Depends on the effect.&nbsp; I'm partial to lifetaps, personally, as are many rangers and beastlords in my guild.&nbsp; Most tanks I know prefer stun or other aggro procs though.<BR>Worn Effects: Faerune is an important worn effect, for both the vision and the Enduring Breath component, but only one (or two, for freedom of upgrade purposes) is needed.&nbsp; Most other worn effects have since been changed over to stats (worn ATK, worn Regen, mana regen, etc.) so not too sure what you're looking for here.<BR>Focus Effects: Important.&nbsp; I've even given up an aug slot for Improved Heal V.&nbsp; Improved Damage foci are very useful for nukes, and Burning Affliction foci are very useful for dots (not that I've got many of those heh).&nbsp; The Omens change from ID and BA to elemental-specific nuke and dot combined foci makes it harder to find the appropriate foci for some casters, though the ranger 1.5 and 2.0 have made this a lot easer for me personally.&nbsp; The melee foci are also Important.&nbsp; However, I will sacrifice a melee or spell focus on a piece of gear if the new piece of gear is a clear AC and HP upgrade, especially if the new piece has more HP unaugged than my old piece did augged.&nbsp; The AAAA crafted augs are a very nice method of obtaining foci.</DIV>

<DIV>HP: (nice, but don't bother, we aren't really used as a tank class so we don't need tons of HP to stand around with a mob and wait on a heal)<BR>Mana: (don't have any so don't bother)<BR>Endurance: 250 (Need Upped quite a bit as that we have no time to med and regain since we are pulling)<BR>AC: 70 (Need Upped quite a bit to prevent being hit as often while pulling)</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>HP Regen: (nice, but don't bother, we need healed in spurts and sitting around waiting on HP isn't something we are really wanting to do or going to do when we have healer watching over us, give it to necros who are trying to counter a side affect)<BR>Mana Regen: (umm... don't bother, again don't have any, don't want any)<BR>Endurance Regen: +4 or +5 (need serious attention in monks who spend our days serving up mobs to people sitting on their butts)</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Strength: 15 (nice for hitting mobs, not so nice for equipment weight, maybe add in a calculation to add a little tolerance to a monks weight restrictions)<BR>Stamina: (Same as HP)<BR>Agility: 20 (the higher the better, need items that concentrate primarily here and Dex)<BR>Dexterity: 20 (the higher the better, need items that concentrate primarily here and Agi)<BR>Charisma: (nice, but don't bother, isn't it part of a class description to be a hermit and not be good with people, vow of poverty, etc...)<BR>Intelligence: (don't bother)<BR>Wisdom: (don't bother)</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Cold Resist: +20 (Higher the better nothing sucks worse then being nuked in the back by a mob)<BR>Disease Resist: +20 (Higher the better nothing sucks worse then being nuked in the back by a mob)<BR>Poison Resist: +20 (Higher the better nothing sucks worse then being nuked in the back by a mob)<BR>Magic Resist: +20 (Higher the better nothing sucks worse then being nuked in the back by a mob)<BR>Fire Resist: +20 (Higher the better nothing sucks worse then being nuked in the back by a mob)<BR></DIV>
<DIV>Attack: +25 (we don't get as much time to DPS as everyone else a lot of the time so might as well make our hits count)<BR>Delay: 5 (need to lower this for the same reasons as above, not to mention we were always suppose to be fast)<BR>Damage: 55 (might be good to give us a bit more to give us more bang for our buck for when we do get a chance to DPS)<BR>Range: 250 is good, gives me a good head start as it always seems that the mobs are faster than me</DIV>
<DIV>Haste: 60% (have you ever thought about letting this stack for a monk)</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Combat Effects: +25 (nice, as I have stated it would be nice to do the same amount of damage as everyone else, since I get so little time)<BR>Shielding: +25 (not nice getting smacked in the back of the head while looking for your group during a pull)<BR>Stun Resist: +25 (nice and great for pulling)<BR>Strikethrough: +25 (I think this ability was made for a monk)<BR>Spell Shield: +25 (not nice getting nuked in the back by a mob)<BR>Avoidance: +25 (yup, I'm not meant to take a hit, I'm just not suppose to get hit at all)<BR>Accuracy: +25 (sure, but I swear all these new abilities are so low in how many points we can get off a piece of armor then why bother)<BR>DOT Shielding: +25 (yikes, ya, need it, second most likely to be DoTTed (tank first), since we are the first to say high to a mob, just ask the undead in Arcstone... first dot, then follow is their golden rule)</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Skill Mods: (to me this is for lower level equipment only and should be more promenant then say stats on lower level equipment and definitely should be found on all low level monk equipment as we have lots of skills that need to be worked on)<BR>Click Effects: (nope, already have a lot going on)<BR>Proc Effects: (yup, this is the way to go with my busy schedule)<BR>Worn Effects: (yup, always nice to have perma-see invis or perma-breath underwater just incase I FD while pulling through a mud puddle)<BR>Focus Effects: (nope, not a caster)<BR></DIV>

<DIV>CLASS: ROGUE</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>As a rogue that is raiding the end game there are only really&nbsp;two things that I look for in loot.&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>1. dps</DIV>
<DIV>How will it increase my dps?&nbsp; My attack is maxed so untill the cap is increased there isn't really anything I can do there.&nbsp;&nbsp; However over on the rogue boards they have parsed that for ever 10 attack I gain roughly 1dps so the more attack the better.</DIV>
<DIV>Accuracy...yes please</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>And the 1 big thing that is important in this area would be +bs damage.&nbsp; It pains me to have to keep my time bp because I am not yet maxed at 125.&nbsp; It was a great start that you guys added 3 items in demi plane with +bs damage on it thank you very much for that, but I just hope that there will be more options in the future.&nbsp; Having to wear gear that is from pop, god, and anguish because I can't afford to replace them due to the decrease in my dps (which is my main role I might add) is very discouraging.&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>So untill my main hand weapon choice is freed up from my 2.0 I will constantly look for other ways to increase my dps.&nbsp; Stagnation isn't good for water and it isn't good for my gear.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>2. Ways to keep my butt alive.</DIV>
<DIV>This would be via hp, or shielding, avoidance, dot shielding, spell shielding, ect....&nbsp; A dead rogue does no dps so I have to avoid agro first, and secondly I have to live through any ae ramp/spell ae that the mobs put out.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Really my stats are maxed so I don't pay attention to them anymore.&nbsp; My resists are very high and untill the cap is raised I won't bother with them.&nbsp; And ac? HA I don't tank there for I care not.</DIV>

				I've played an Enchanter since November of '99 with some breaks in between. Now I play at the top end raiding, so my perspective will be focused there. Mainly in relation to itemization, Enchanters are expected to do the same job they always have but on a very uneven playing field versus mobs compared to the other caster's jobs.<br><br>CLASS: Enchanter<br> <br>HP: Being one of the most frontline casters HP used to be more important than anything. However, as mob dmg went up exponentially, and gear only raised moderately, this went out of focus.<br>Mana: Now the lifeblood of all I do, mana is obviously the most vital to functioning. However, I rarely find my problems [death, et c.] come from a lack of mana<br>Endurance: No impact <br>AC: The caster cap has remain unchanged so long and the way silk classes mitigate make this almost useless. Perhaps thats an issue that needs to be fixed, rather than gear<br> <br>HP Regen: Downtime reducer, even with max regen its not enough to make it that worthwhile<br>Mana Regen: Obviously most important but hard caps make it overly abundant. <br>Endurance Regen: Not important to me, but its also nonexistant I think<br> <br>Strength: Helps me carry that 100k plat and thats about it<br>Stamina: Its important for me to have max sta because its more hp, thats about it<br>Agility: Not important to me<br>Dexterity: Also not important unless Im soloing with Lilac<br>Charisma: The myth stat of enchanters, I'm at the cap and I'd like to think it affected my mez and charm but I believe its such a small help its not important<br>Intelligence: More mana, more tradeskills help, easily capped<br>Wisdom: No relevance to me <br> <br>Resists: Always important but the way resists seem to work makes it not worth the effort to have them maxed for most new content. For old content though and exp groups, max resists are wondeful<br> <br>Combat Effects: No relevance<br>Shielding: Vital to an Ench, perhaps slightly harder to come by. While I'm sure everyone will scream for shielding, I think it would help enchanter survivability<br>Stun Resist: Vital, shaking off that stun during mez intense moments can be the saving factor. Every moment I'm stunned mobs are killing people<br>Strikethrough: No relevance<br>Spell Shield: Very useful and more easily gotten for casters<br>Avoidance: I loathe Avoidance; I'm so far past the cap and it seems they think if they throw an Avoid mod on something, they can leave off something actually useful.<br>Accuracy: No relevance<br>DOT Shielding: Like SS but rarer<br> <br>Skill Mods: Not enough, and the ones that exist don't do anything unless it raises your skill a certain amount. That 8% mod on Time robe is completely useless. The 12% mod on DP back actually does something though since it raises the skill enough points. <br>Click Effects: The few ench specific clickies have been nice, it would be nice to see some more in the future but we've been told they're too unbalancing<br>Proc Effects: No relevance, although I think any caster proc weapons should have a better mod since we suck, but then we might be meleeing all the time<br>Worn Effects: Can't think of any ench specific atm<br>Focus Effects: Probably one of the most frustrating factors of gear planning<br><br>Innoruuk's Irony: the tash focus, is on 2 items. One is from Anguish gloves and the other is an aug from a LDON raid that you can only con people into doing once because its so boring. See, this focus would have been great on DP class item... or you know, any other item option. <br><br>Reagent Conservation: Last seen on an anguish mask, and there was really nothing in between there and reagent conservation V or whatever it was, makes this a useful but almost nonexistant focus. You could always take away the peridots from our rune and alendar line,... but I figure this is a more viable option <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-wink.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0><br><br>Spell Specific mana pres: Seen on almost every DP class item... the 25% Mana preservation. I'm sorry but this is just ridiculous when almost everyone running around in these zones already is going to have 20% Mana pres. That 5% for ONE spell doesn't make it worthwhile. I pray this never shows up again and I'll leave it at that.<br><br>Since they seem set on keeping some focus' capped, perhaps in the higher end the focus range could be decreased. If you want to keep Detrimental Mana Pres at 20%, then say the focus in Demi could be 3-20%, DK could be 5-20%.<br><br>Really, looking back over the past 3 expansions items they are boring, unoriginal and provide very few options for some essential focus' [altho I will say Last Bloods helped this issue to an extent but also caused a bunch of other problems]. Obviously not every item can be a "WOW, I just HAVE to have that" but they are currently nonexistant. And a final note, cookie cutter items are NOT okay, and everyone notices it. It makes item design look lazy and like they don't really care about their job.

<P>Doh... Forgot about the Melee Focus Effects like Cleave and such... guess they need to be more promenant since I forgot they even existed refer to Wycca's post as he is got it down... mainly made this post so that you had a Lower End Monk example too... not everyone finds it easy to max all stats as a monk without getting penalties for weight.</P>
<P>And you missed that in your list of things to look at</P>
<P><FONT color=#ff0099 size=7>WEIGHT </FONT>is crucial to a monk, so on all those items you have labeled "Beast, Druid, Monk" make them light as that Beasts and Druids don't care how much they way... but I got to maintain my girlish figure.</P>
