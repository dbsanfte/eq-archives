				While epic armor is interesting, nothing really compares to a weapon "all your own". That points out to me the problem really with epics - they aren't very epic-like.<br><br>They don't have reserved for them and only them cool names. Instead of simple descriptors for most weapons they have names like Ghoulbane, Dispair, etc. What's left to distinguish an epic? Krejnok's Sword of Eternal Power?!!?? Whoopsie.<br><br>It would be somewhat nice to be able to choose from a looong list of reserved for epics only names for a name that pleases you.<br><br>They don't always look the coolest. I'll take the look of Gaudralek to the Wariror Epic 1.5. On the other hand the SK 1.0 is absolutely stunning. We can't really expect to pick from a list of possible appearances reserved for epics, but it would be nice.<br><br>They are all pretty much the same. The Wariror Epic has a EB aug on it, guaranteed. It's "possible" to have a Type 4, 7, 8, 9(?), and 35 slot - that's enough slots to allow users to choose EoA or Cleave or Mana Preservation AND an offensive or defensive proc or a mob debuff, etc. AND DMG+3 or DMG+1 and 150 fire lure dd or snare or ....<br><br>Now why is it that Soulfire blazes up a storm and the Paladin Epic 2.0 is somewhat muted? Much better imo to have the particle effect consistant with a damage aug type selected. Cold blue flames, fiery red ones, green pulsing for a debuff or lifetap, etc.<br>
<br>If SoE could provide multiple aug slots and a wide variety of augs, then maybe players would be able to create a weapon "all their own"<br><div></div>that could be updated as they progressed. I know that if I had Excalibur, Sting, Mjolliner, etc. I wouldn't expect to put in in a trophy case and weild a more ordinary weapon.<br><br>I guess players have to concider epics like chapters in a long saga - I was a hero once and had a sword named Soul Cleaver. But that time has passed.
