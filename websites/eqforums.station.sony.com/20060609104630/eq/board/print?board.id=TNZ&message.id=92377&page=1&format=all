				<DIV>flagging doesnt hurt the game at all.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I just hit 65 with my first char and havent seen most upper tier zones but thats ok.I will eventually see them...or...I may not.Either way what other players are seeing doesnt effect me in any way.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; Why does everyone think they should have the BEST items in the game if they aren't willing to push the envelope and try the hardest zones?</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;I don't have even close to the best items......does that bother me?....not in the least.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;When and if I get a&nbsp;raid able to tackle the best mobs I will get the best gear...untill then i wont get **Zowie** envy over those who are in the best zones</DIV>

				<DIV>As a KT/Time flagged player,&nbsp; a tank class you are utterly totally dependant on gear to do your job, the most skilled player with 1200ac is not going to do anything but die in Tipt, and is going to be a mana spongue in groups, non hardcore players should not have the same gear as the hard core, but the gap is too wide.</DIV>

<P>There need to be other paths to glory. </P>
<P>Upgrade old world etc zones to provide the challenge and gear drops of the lower EP's, reduce the spawn times of Luclin boss/miniboss mobs. Mave meduim difficulty LDON's and scale LDON raids to numbers and sub VT gear. Even if everybody got VT keys the spawn timers would make the chance of getting anything remote. </P>
<P>Large guilds have the ability to raid massively and fast on targets that have just popped, we are left with the crumbs. Was it EQ's intention to force everybody into large guilds?</P>
<P>Veksar and CoM were well done, lets have higher level versions of these.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
