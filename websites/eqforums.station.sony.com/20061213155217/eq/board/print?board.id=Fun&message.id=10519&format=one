<DIV>December is a big holiday month for many cultures and religions.&nbsp; In light of this the forum challenge for December is to rewrite "The Night Before Christmas", "The Twelve Days of Christmas" or "I Have a Little Dreidel" using EQ as the theme.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>The Holiday Challenge will start today as of this post and run through Monday, December 18th at noon PST.&nbsp; You may submit your poem or song to <A href="mailto:cdelzer@soe.sony.com" target=_blank>cdelzer@soe.sony.com</A>.&nbsp; Please include your forum handle along with the poem or song you write.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>On Monday, December 18th sometimes after noon PST, I will post the peoms and songs here and start a poll for each one so the community can vote on their favorite.&nbsp; One challenge winner from each poem and song will receive a special forum title and an in-game prize for one character of their choice.&nbsp; You may submit one entry for each category, but you can only win one prize.&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>For those not familiar with the poem or songs here they are:</DIV>
<DIV><BR><STRONG><FONT color=#ff0000>THE NIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS</FONT><BR></STRONG><BR>'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house<BR>Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,<BR>In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The children were nestled all snug in their beds,<BR>While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>And mamma in her 'kerchief, and I in my cap,<BR>Had just settled down for a long winter's nap,</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,<BR>I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Away to the window I flew like a flash,<BR>Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow<BR>Gave the lustre of mid-day to objects below,</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>When, what to my wondering eyes should appear,<BR>But a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny reindeer,</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>With a little old driver, so lively and quick,<BR>I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,<BR>And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>"Now, Dasher! now, Dancer! now, Prancer and Vixen!<BR>On, Comet! on Cupid! on, Donder and Blitzen!</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall!<BR>Now dash away! dash away! dash away all!"</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,<BR>When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky,</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>So up to the house-top the coursers they flew,<BR>With the sleigh full of toys, and St. Nicholas too.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof<BR>The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>As I drew in my hand, and was turning around,<BR>Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot,<BR>And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>A bundle of toys he had flung on his back,<BR>And he looked like a peddler just opening his pack.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>His eyes -- how they twinkled! his dimples how merry!<BR>His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,<BR>And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,<BR>And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>He had a broad face and a little round belly,<BR>That shook, when he laughed like a bowlful of jelly.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,<BR>And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>A wink of his eye and a twist of his head,<BR>Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,<BR>And filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk,</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>And laying his finger aside of his nose,<BR>And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,<BR>And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight,<BR>"Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good-night."</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><BR><STRONG><FONT color=#33cc00>The Twelve Days of Christmas</FONT></STRONG> (you do not have to go through the entire song for each day, just the Twelfth day will be sufficient)</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>On the twelfth day of Christmas, <BR>my true love sent to me <BR>Twelve drummers drumming, <BR>Eleven pipers piping, <BR>Ten lords a-leaping, <BR>Nine ladies dancing, <BR>Eight maids a-milking, <BR>Seven swans a-swimming, <BR>Six geese a-laying, <BR>Five golden rings, <BR>Four calling birds, <BR>Three French hens, <BR>Two turtle doves, <BR>And a partridge in a pear tree! </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><BR><STRONG><FONT color=#0033ff>I Have a Little Dreidel</FONT></STRONG></DIV>
<DIV><BR>I have a little dreidel<BR>I made it out of clay<BR>And when it's dry and ready<BR>Then dreidel I shall play!</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>(Chorus)<BR></DIV>
<DIV>Oh dreidel, dreidel, dreidel<BR>I made it out of clay<BR>And when it's dry and ready<BR>Then dreidel I shall play!</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>It has a lovely body<BR>With legs so short and thin<BR>And when my dreidel’s tired<BR>It drops and then I win!</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>(Chorus)</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>My dreidel’s always playful<BR>It loves to dance and spin<BR>A happy game of dreidel<BR>Come play now, let’s begin!</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>(Chorus)</DIV>
