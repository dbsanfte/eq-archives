&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Devlin is *supposed* to flurry in dagger mode, rampage in whip mode, and AE rampage in axe mode.&amp;nbsp; If he's not, then something is wrong.&amp;nbsp; I'll have to look into this tomorrow, along with any other Demi-Plane encounter that's misbehaving.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Hey, so our guild went on our anguish run and we got to keldo and he is Now AE ramping for 5k..and you cant get OOR of it for melee. I heard the same for AMV now. I hardly think this was an intentional change, can we get this fixed please?&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>OK tacvi balancer mob is now single target RTing, i realize this has been said before but i MUST say this again, my guild has just entered this area a few weeks ago and nearly killed this mob today and yesterday , after several attempts getting the mob to 20% we were lookign at a RT that killed off 50% of our cleric chain before we had really even begun to fight.&amp;nbsp; a Single target RT for Quad 2-5k seems a BIT much huh?&amp;nbsp; Now realizing they are aware of this bug ... when are get getting a fix?&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;That your clerics&amp;nbsp;were&amp;nbsp;were on rampage is a lack&amp;nbsp;of preperation on your part. The balancers are&amp;nbsp;active for exactly one minute. Get someone to count that down for you. We have warnings at&amp;nbsp;20, 10 and 5. Your rampage tanks (we always assign at least two) and your tanks&amp;nbsp;(all of them) need to be right there on top of that snake the moment he activates. We use Fort to take aggro the last two rounds.&amp;nbsp; No excuse for your clerics to be on ramp. Whoever gets it needs to call it out and have a dedicated ramp healer.</description>

&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;We haven't been in Tacvi that long... he has always single traget rampaged for us. We don't have four tanks on the balancers. We have one SK MA who runs around the circle. They don't hit that hard. He only needs one healer. We only use fort to take aggro the last two rounds (the 40 and 30% rounds) because we don't have the dps to have balanced all four then. So setting rampage and not getting spiked right off the bat is more important on those rounds. Sometimes we don't get them all down on the 50% round either, but it doesn't seem to be as bad.&lt;BR&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I am actually enjoying the 'new' Hanvar. This fight went from being stupidly long and boring to alot shorter. We do what it seems alot are doing..kill the adds and DPS Hanvar between. Normally he is dead before all the adds pop. We don't even try to keep the adds separated anymore, just let em run to hanvar and kill them there. &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I think the mini giant for the 3 amulets in desert PoS was AE rampaging tonite.&amp;nbsp; I saw ramps on my cleric and the person I was with said they were getting ramped too.&amp;nbsp; We both saw ramp messages with no damage when we backed away but really I was kind of meh about investigating it.&amp;nbsp; Didnt picture myself posting to this thread.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;All the named mobs in Rage are AE ramp now, Prexak, Razorclaw, Ruingtor, Shelizard, Jyrta, Aryer, and whoever else spawns there.&amp;nbsp; Are these mobs going to be addressed as well?&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Thank You Rashere!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I havent looked here at the EQfourms for a while, but now that my guild is at the doorstep to Anguish I thought I would take a look around.&amp;nbsp; The name of this thread was nearly enough to make me log off and seriously think about EQ.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Some history here, my wife and I use EQ as our relax time.&amp;nbsp; We have never pushed to be in a uber raiding guild, but felt we could just advance with a guild, see the sights, new stuff (old for everyone eles) and not skip content.&amp;nbsp; The price we have paid many times is to just get to new content right after it is "tweaked".&amp;nbsp; You name it we have done the harder version of all the raid encounters/zones.&amp;nbsp; Trak right after they &lt;EM&gt;fixed &lt;/EM&gt;him, ToV right after more flurries and such were add, VT right after the mobs were boosted, time and again getting there right after it was &lt;EM&gt;tweaked&lt;/EM&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I am too excited about seeing Anguish to handle knowing we will be fighting a harder version than all previous guilds had to face.&amp;nbsp; Then I was relieved to see your quick and decisive responses to this thread, what a change.&amp;nbsp; Normal SoE customer service policy in the past can be covered by "Working as intented".&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Not what I wanted to see when started reading this thread to say the least.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Thank you again for your attention and hard work.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>not sure if all these were mentioned before, but from the listing in the post patch bug thread,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Zun`Muram Kvxe Pirik in Tacvi is rampaging independent of balancing his assistants (still rampaged with all 4 properly balanced) and rampage hits land with high frequency for large damage (6500+ on occasion).&amp;nbsp; Ramp not AE but also not following normal ramp list progression.&lt;br&gt;- The final mob in Ikky 4 is now AoE ramping....so add that to the list of others who starting actually doing that. It was somewhat a surpise I tell you, but over all with it AoE&amp;nbsp; ramping now it might be a bit much for that particualr fight.&lt;br&gt;- AE rampage on many mobs (Grokui in God, and many others in newer zones, like Anguish, and others)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;Those hits are for like 100 damage or so to a shaman.&amp;nbsp; This occurs when Yar'Lir is in hurricane form and make sense.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;I hope that the changes to Warden Hanvar's adds will be removed.&amp;nbsp; There is absolutely NO reason to make an already long and boring fight even longer and more boring.&amp;nbsp; I feel like going afk for 45 min when ever we get to his area.</description>
