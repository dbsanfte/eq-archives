      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This idea may work for stationary containers but what about player carried containers, such as mixing bowl, fletching kit and JC kit? How would you share the common window between two players?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taushar&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I would encourage NOT making a change to the inventory containers, as this would promote decentraliztion.&lt;br&gt;I would rather see players visit the tradeskill quarters of a zone (such as the bazaar special area), or visit the tradeskill quarters in the city zones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Centralization allows people to interact with multiple tradeskillers.&lt;br&gt;Unlike the bazaar - tradeskillers have to be at their keyboard.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The create button needs to be locked out until both parties have agreed - preventing a tradeskiller from making a junk item whether intentional or accidental (agree / disagree toggles?).&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Also I realize that some recipes return mutliple items; however, the returned item can be checked against the recipe ingredients of the tradeskiller and recipe ingredients of the recipient.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Recipient Provides:&lt;br&gt;Woven Dire Wolf Fur&lt;br&gt;Woven Dire Wolf Fur&lt;br&gt;Infused Platinum Thread&lt;br&gt;Infused Platinum Thread&lt;br&gt;Infused Platinum Thread&lt;br&gt;1500pp&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tradeskiller Provides:&lt;br&gt;Acorn Oil&lt;br&gt;Woven Dire Wolf Fur&lt;br&gt;Woven Dire Wolf Fur&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Item Fails, and tradeskiller gets some saves on items)&lt;br&gt;---------------------------&lt;br&gt;Recipient failure check:&lt;br&gt;Woven Dire Wolf Fur (Saved)&lt;br&gt;Woven Dire Wolf Fur (Failed)&lt;br&gt;Infused Platinum Thread (Saved)&lt;br&gt;Infused Platinum Thread (Failed)&lt;br&gt;Infused Platinum Thread (Failed)&lt;br&gt;1500pp&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tradeskiller failure check:&lt;br&gt;Acorn Oil (Saved)&lt;br&gt;Woven Dire Wolf Fur (Failed)&lt;br&gt;Woven Dire Wolf Fur (Failed)&lt;br&gt;------------------------------&lt;br&gt;Recipient gets:&lt;br&gt;Woven Dire Wolf Fur (Saved)&lt;br&gt;Infused Platinum Thread (Saved)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tradeskiller gets:&lt;br&gt;1500pp&lt;br&gt;Acorn Oil (Saved)&lt;br&gt;(... and don't forget a chance to skillup)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Upon a second try, the recipient still has plenty of the platinum threads but it out of Woven Dire Wolf Threads; therefore, he ups his platinum offer to 2000pp&lt;br&gt;The combine is successful...&lt;br&gt;--------------------------------&lt;br&gt;Recipient gets:&lt;br&gt;Leatherfoot Haversack (Different from other ingredients)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tradeskiller gets:&lt;br&gt;2000pp&lt;br&gt;-------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;ok im confused as to what this would be used for.. like someone asks you to do a combine .. and then this interface pops up they put the items in .. all you do is hit combine? and toggle who get the finished product/salavaged failed item parts?</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;A "secure tradeskill" interface is a Major Code change, so a coder would have to be included in the discussion of&amp;nbsp;"how Easy"&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;And realistically this would not be a near term thing.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>It sounds similar to a mechanism in place in World of Warcraft.  You have a &amp;quot;do not trade&amp;quot; portion of the trade window, wherein the object placed there is not traded but is instead manipulated by the person performing the tradeskill on it (enchanting the object, attaching a counterweight, spurs, etc.).  Money can be exchanged for the service, and reagents are taken from the person doing the work.  Of course there's also no failure mechanism in WoW so...  All things considered I don't think it's too big of an issue in EQ.  If you get cheated on a combine the community will eventually out that tradeskiller and at least one cheat will be shut down.  If it's a really super high level combine then you need to find someone you can trust (guildy, good friend, whatever).  If you don't know any high end tradeskillers make some more friends! &lt;span&gt;:smileyvery-happy:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
