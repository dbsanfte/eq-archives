    <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Hello all....I am a returning player to EQ.&amp;nbsp; I played EQ from the beginning up to 2004.&amp;nbsp; I currently have a lvl 16 berserker on this server and would like to find a guild that has some low level players for me to group with.&amp;nbsp; I would love to find a guild that liked to do LDoN adventures...I always loved doing those adventures.&amp;nbsp; If there are any guilds that sound like I would fit into please send me a tell in game to Gukagak.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Thanks in advance for any advice.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>A couple of us just started a guild with a focus on Trolls - Strong Nayshun of Trollz&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We're brand new and are lower levels right now - low to mid teens - there are a few higher level alts that might make the occaisonal appearance though. :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The goal of the guild is to explore and have fun being a troll. Bashing &amp;amp; smashing things. LDoN's are a definite. In the interests of getting going, and realizing not a ton of people play trolls, we also will consider troll friendly races and possibly troll friendly characters of traditional troll &lt;strike&gt;edible&lt;/strike&gt; unfriendly races. :) We're open to roleplayers/trollplayers but it's not required. Just respect those that wish to play that way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Send a tell to Greendul or Brukab. If they're not online try Saibbo (but he's troll edible and not in the guild), he can get Greendul pretty quickly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
