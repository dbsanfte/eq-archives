    <description>Well they replied to our mage and told her that they have no record of her gear.  They said they can't see her gear from saturday or before and roll her back.  Still no word back on the others.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Here is a real good test of soe ability to provide customer service. If only 1 server went down for over 4 hours on eq2 what do ya think they would do to keep their new customer base happy? What do ya think they are gonna do for us?&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>Well it took about a week and lots of emails, and some personal connectinos inside sony but we were finally able to get everyone's stuff restored. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I do feel though there should have been a server MOTD to say they had problem and maybe email a special place for naked toons to go to.  It was also interesting to find out that the high end guild on the server had their people restored within hours, the lower guilds ran into days.</description>

      <description>Well so far here is what I know.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have 3 people in our guild who lost their bodies durning the crashes.  2 have not heard anything from the GMs and one was told that she had looted her body (which isn't true.) and the case was closed.  She asked to have her toon rolled back to sat morning.  She reopened the case to try and get a GM to look at the logs and fix this.  (she is elemetal and all her gear is no drop so its not like she is trying to dupe the system and has no gear on her.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One of the people who didn't hear from a GM went to the chat room and got a hold of one.  He was told that he is probably out of luck and the GM's probably won't do anything.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I know of 2 others in differnt guilds that have the same problem.  They had bodies and when the servers kept going up and down it made a hell of a mess.  the responces they got from the GMs were you are out of luck and are going to just have to regear.  They also are resubmiting the petitions to get someone to look at their bodies (they also said they had looted their bodies when they haven't.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have taked to another person on another server and they said they have been having people losing gear.  (povar server).  Seems to me though if they are going to have this problem they should atleast post about it and say there is a problem and they will try and fix all of this as soon as they can.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I would also say with all of this mess they should just start fixing toons and not worry so much that in this one instance assume eveyone is just trying to cheat the system and just make things right.  Better to have one person make a dupe or exploit in this case than screw over one person who really did lose all of their gear but didn't get it back because the GM didn't want to look into the situation and just stamp finished on the ticket so he can get up his number of cases per hour.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I will post if they ever do give things back or if they are just going to say. "to bad you are out of luck, regear."</description>
