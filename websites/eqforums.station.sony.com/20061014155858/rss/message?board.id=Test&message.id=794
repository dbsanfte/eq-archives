    <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;That is the first thing i noticed after moving to test and upgrading to the new DirectX builds: Massive black patches on certain textures, namely on the ground. It seems however that if you turn off Advanced lighting it removes the black patches.</description>

      <title>DirectX 9c bugs and comments</title>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;The first thing I learned after patching Test is that you really do have to go to Microsoft's DirectX site and download the updates. I had presumed that simply by keeping my computer up to date using Windows Update would be enough to keep DirectX up to date as well. It turned out that my computer needed all the updates to DirectX 9 since January 2005.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;On getting to the character select screen, I noticed that the shading of the character select environment was all wrong. I clicked explore and ran around. Objects would start out dark and then suddenly pop brighter as I got close to them. In the game itself, Plane of Knowledge looked positively gloomy. I suspect that the same lighting problems were occuring there too. I have not tried to debug this yet by adjusting my graphics settings. This could be caused by having dynamic lighting on or off.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;One positive note is that it seemed like the frame rate was a lot higher in PoK. I am not 100% certain of that and I did not see any other players moving around at the time so that could explain it. The game just felt smoother somehow. Perhaps the graphics engine is more efficient now with DX9c.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Anyway, keep up the good work, devs!&lt;/div&gt;</description>
