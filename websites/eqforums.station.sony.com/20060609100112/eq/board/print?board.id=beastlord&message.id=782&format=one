				<DIV>Since October 2003 patch which fixed Warders it has in reality broken our ability to shrink our Warders 3 times.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>It tooks us months (if not at least 1 year) to get our Guilds to realize the awesome functionality of our Warders during raids.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Since October 2003's patch all that which we worked so hard to instill in our Raid Leaders has been almost completely shattered due this "Gigantic Warder" problem.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Brenlo has stated time and again that this is being looked in to and is recognized as an issue, but one which is not yet a high priorty due to other more pressing issues.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>That is fine, but cant we get a Date when this will be fixed? This has now gone on for 6 Months with no repair in site.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>We, the Beastlord Community, are simply begging our esteemed Developers to PLEASE fix this as soon as possible. We want to regain our respect we earned the hard way.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Thank you for your time and patience in this seemingly small yet gigantic issue! (pun intended --hehe)</DIV>
