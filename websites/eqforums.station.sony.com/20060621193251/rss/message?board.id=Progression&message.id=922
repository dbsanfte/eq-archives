    <description>Everything I have seen from &amp;quot;official&amp;quot; people has leaned towards specific encounters being defeated as to how the next expansion will open.  That is the point of the server.  When it matures enough so the best guild on the server can take on the top current content and win, then you move to the next phase.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Flag Progression to expansions = exposed content.</title>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;I was wondering if anything offical has been mentioned about how to open the expansion. I had read a post about it being timed based but it was a support post and I didnt want to support it. Anyways, they already tested this with th PoP expansion where an encounter could flag a character to enter a more advanced zone. Seems logical they would use the same system as a way of progression. Perhaps every Boss mob per expansion could be used as a flagstep. This will tie in and expose players to the content of the game by directing them to different content and areas. Maybe with alittle luck they could even write an entire quest to take each class on its own journy to the game content. Imgine following a story that can bring you character from level 1-70 and direct them to every major encounter in the game? I think thats progression.&lt;/div&gt;</description>
