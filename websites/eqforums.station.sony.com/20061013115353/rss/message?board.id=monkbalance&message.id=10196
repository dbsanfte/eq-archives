    <title>monk lull and its degradation in dodh -- intentional?</title>
    <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=monkbalance&amp;message.id=10196</link>
    <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Lull was given to monks to enable them to compete as pullers. We were told the new 'phantom cry' differed from previous lulls so we could not 'bypass' content. So this was ok mostly for oow expansion I think, since lulling 1 mob was sufficient. In fact pullers were not even needed so much overall for this expansion. So overall lull limited to 1 mob, and 70 level limit on mob worked sufficiently well.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;DoDh I read was supposed to be 'monk friendly' in that you would need pullers for indoor missions etc....&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Since the release of DoDH I have struggled to get mission groups. Particularly in later missions, and on hard settings. Having done some now I can see the problem. In these missions, the vast majority of mobs are yellow so unlullable for monks, and having to FD split huge amounts of them makes monks less desirable. In addition, the placement of mobs is such that even if you are lucky enough to find a even-con mob to lull, you are still likely to get an add or 2 -- so back to FD splits. These missions can be fairly long in any case and FD splitting and losing dps for 2 mins for mem wipe between every pull is a little tedious. Even imitate death does not significantly make a difference.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Should monks be so disadvantaged in this expansion as pullers? 1 mob and 70 limit does not work well for this -- others pullers can lull multiple mobs past lvl 70.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So my question is, was this intended? &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;*shrug*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dunno, I've done a ton of DoD missions and find that the zones are very monk friendly.  As for staying down for 2 minutes, I find I rarely have to do it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sure, you can have a roamer running around where it's wiser to stay down until mem reset, but most of the mobs are statics.  And any mob that's static will usually memblur once it resets (~95%).  It's not difficult getting singles, you just have to pay close attention to the pathing points, zone geometry, and bind point reset timings.  No worse than pulling in the days of Guk and Sebillis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I actually find the inability to lull in some places to be a good thing.  And it's not nearly so prevalent as you imply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can't lull the spiders, but they're not even 1/2 the missions.  The shilliskins, zombies, werewolves, witheran and alot of other mobs are easily lulled on normal missions.  As for the hard missions, well they're supposed to be hard aren't they?  Not to mention, they mobs are nearly all over level 70.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for the points regarding Fading Memories, it's not nearly as powerful in DoD as it would seem.  Yes, certain missions they may have some advantage like 69.1 or Shadowwalker 1 where there's alot of space to move around, however alot of missions take place in confined areas.  Try using a bard to pull Sabotage, or 70.1 Pre-emptive strike.  70.2 Praetorian Guard will slaughter most bards who try to pull it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I think the pulling balance is fairly correct.  Bards should be able to do pulling under specific circumstances, just like rangers, druids, clerics, etc.  However, in alot of instances the preference is clearly that of FD classes.  I have little problem getting groups in DoD, and usually they ask me to pull.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, I may be biased.  I don't use lull all that often except on the occassional DoN mission.  Makes pulling so easy it almost feels like cheating.  Of course, that could just be the bias of a really old school monk...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LaotzuQigong&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;70 Transcendent&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legendary Companions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Tribunal&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;When I was looking for a class to play I looked up each Class in Sony’s literature.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Bards were classified as “Jack of all Trades-Master of none.”&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Monks were described as massive DPS and designated pullers.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;When Monk mitigation caused them to step into the tanking business the Warriors screamed bloody murder and Sony nerfed Monks almost into non-existence.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Every time a Monk complains about how easy it is for a FM Bard to pull a Bard pops up and says, “It isn’t easy, it takes mad skills!”&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Yet Bards, have totally stepped all over the Monks turf here just like Monks stepped all over the Warriors.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Truth is a Necromancer can do a better job single pulling then either by using a pet, but they have the good sense to keep quiet about it.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;The original post indicates that the Monks are concerned that their roll as puller is continuing to disintegrate.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;This is the Class that got kicked to the curb with multiple nurfbat applications to the teabag for stepping on the warriors.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;They have every right to complain.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;SOE would do everyone a favor by raising the level of pacify for Monk pullers to about 73.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;That one change would keep Monks as the default pullers, and the Bards could go back to generally keeping their groups uber with their incredible music just like God intended them to do.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;The Bard could pull when the Monk was busy moving his augs.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Just like it’s better to have an Enchanter then a Bard for CC, and it’s better to have a Rogue then a Bard for DPS, and it’s better to have a Cleric then a Bard for healing, and so on and so forth.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;No amount of nick picking or semantics or word games will ever change the basic reality of the Monks true predicament here.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;font color="#66ccff" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS"&gt;I highly doubt that the monk lull was used much for passing content since we can only luill 1 mob at a time and it really dont last for long. So since our lull is different from others it might as well work up to higher lvls.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;font color="#66ccff" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS"&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;font color="#66ccff" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS"&gt;As a side note for some smarta... Using lull is not a question of beeing able to pull without it or not, and it never was. Its just a question of how fast you can pull and kill stuff.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;font color="#66ccff" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS"&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;font color="#66ccff" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS"&gt;Sky&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by SkyKungfu_GoD on &lt;span class="date_text"&gt;01-23-2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;09:09 AM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by SkyKungfu_GoD on &lt;span class="date_text"&gt;01-23-2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;09:15 AM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>We asked for more pulling, and I think they delivered.  Alot of content in DoD...is very puller-friendly.  Bards and monks are in fairly high demand in the tougher content, no we don't pull as fast as bards, but I also think that having a *1* button pulling solution isn't the answer.  FDpulling works fine and *most* missions I've seen mobs path back pretty fast.  Could it be improved?  Yes.  Will we ever be as fast as bards?  Doubt it.  Will a new lull help?  Doubt it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&amp;quot;Alot of content in DoD...is very puller-friendly.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;Pullable yes of course it is. If thats what you mean by puller friendly.....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;but I also think that having a *1* button pulling solution isn't the answer.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;Well there is no 1 button solution, but bards get a 2-3 button solution.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;FDpulling works fine and *most* missions I've seen mobs path back pretty fast.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;I guess it depends which missions you have done, and what you mean by pretty fast. Of course if you were a bard, you would not need to clarify these points any further, since they are all equally pullable at high speed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Will a new lull help?  Doubt it.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;How do you figure this? Unless you mean they should just upgrade our last lull, and/or make dod mobs susceptible to it?&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;By puller-friendly, I meant that it does usually require a puller, compared to prior expansions, which didn't always need one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I've done every mission, I've not had many instances where I was stuck FD for the entire bar of mob's health.  You just have to watch the roamers.  And yes, bards pull better.  /shrug  probably unlikely to change.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A new lull will not likely help, there is no special monk lull code vs all the others.  The only thing that will help is drastically revamping the entire lull concept, and planning monk pullable content around it.  The issue is 2 things- level, and immunity to lull.  My guess is that most of the time, even if we had a higher lvl lull, that the mobs would be immune to it.  I really don't think it would help us at all....we still could only lull 1 mob, and my guess is that we would still be stuck using FD to split in those situations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don't believe that a major pulling revamp is in the plans anytime soon, and I believe the current dev mindset is that - nothing is majorly wrong with class balance, and that change is incremental and best done via small tweaks.  None of which fits with a major pulling revamp atm.  Do I wish we had an end based fade, a higher lvl lull than other classes, and the ability to lull more than 1 target?  Yes of course, but I just don't see any of it happening.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by -Wycca on &lt;span class="date_text"&gt;01-25-2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;02:04 PM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of what Darkpoet wrote the facts are.. Bards can break a room faster than a monk can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DoDH just like LDoN has many packed rooms. Mana regen is a moot point since you are only Fading the first couple of mobs just to clear assits and then regular pulls, just like monks don't spend the whole mission waiting on 2 min FD agro wipes, just on the initial room breaks. That being said, bards do it faster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I have done almost every mission on both Hard and Normal and continually get asked to pull them. That doesn't change the fact that bards still can do it Much Easier than we can. And despite all the things that can go wrong, I watched a Bard pull the Illslain Mission that I have pulled at least 20 times (the one with the pit at the bottem of the ramp and has at least 3 missions in it) much, no..... MUCH easier than I could do and I do have all the tricks, snakefingers, bio orb (though I would be hesitant to try a fear split in a DoDH mission), stalking probes(to target certain mobs in full rooms), snare potions (with thier built in DoTs) use all the pathing/reset tricks. The fact is, all take time that the bard just ran in tagetted mez/snared ran out invised then faded then tagged and back to group solo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I am not saying this does not take skill. I am not saying that other bards could do the same anymore than I am saying all monks can pull the same. But to hear a bard say we are the same in the pulling department is rather funny. LDoN is why monks have a Lull. when we could not get a group because it was to slow to beat a mission with a monk pulling over 5 other classes being better at it, we got a lull. Is DoDH as big a problem, I don't believe it is. there is still only 4 classes that can pull it, and only 2 that can pull it consistantly. Add to that, DoDH missions are not near the blow thru or repeatability that LDoN was (which will be the down fall of DoDH once everyone has all the loot they want from the missions).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So should something be changed due to pulling as it relates to DoDH, I don't think so. Bards are still in short supply and I am not threatened by them. Should SOE look at the unbalanced nature of monk to bards in regards to pulling in general? You can ask, but doubt anything happens along those lines. Could ID be changed so that it could be used as a pulling tool wether it be endurance based (just what I don't need is another endurance drain) or an AA adjustment with real merit not just a small percentage change? I don't know, becuase whatever they do, we will exploit it to whatever advantage we can (and yes we use to setup lull rotations to get around mobs, a luxury we could afford when we had 8 monks in the raid). The bottem line is Bards have been given tools and found ways to use them that makes encounters trivial (I do know the mission referred to earlier about invising to the Boss pulling everthing and fading it where any normal group will take 2 hours to clear to. But also know we can do that too, Invis potion/Sneak to the boss, throw a javelin at max range, pop voidance, invis, run back to main room,  stand in open area and wait for boss to get to you with 30 other mobs ID right before voidance wears off, boss does not path and you got him single at zone in. We all exploit what we can do when we learn how to do things in unconvetional ways. So the question is, since it is so much easier for bards to do it than us, should they be nerfed? I definatly think Fading Memories should have some kind of timer associated with it, the mana argument used to hold water early PoP era and did keep them in check on continual pull groups, but that no longer is the case with itemezation the way it is, and since we were heavily nerfed due to itemisation in Velious, it is not unheard of for the developers to rethink how a class may be adjusted regardless of the outcry of the masses. Me personally? Unless the bard population changes drastically, let em alone. Give me something of value, make me the best mellee DPS in the game, nerf the rouges LOL ..........&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soulfyst&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Man....and I thought the bard forums were just full of whining...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Well there's my insult :smileytongue: here's just some info.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Monks wont get a fade like tool(asside from ID if you consider it just a long reuse tool), this is because that would give them two forms of memory wiping. FD for when you have time, or need endurance, FMthing for quick splits. This, while an interesting idea would be too over powered, because then you could pull and FD, wait for mobs to move a little, then just pop up  FMthing and tag.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;As to who can pull better its really situation dependent. Bards pull in burst, monks pull continuously. I have a 70 bard with Time/Qvic gear, bout 8k or 8.1k unbuffed mana, 13-15(haven't checked recently) of FT. Depending on the mission I can stay above half mana the whole time, other missions I have to med 1-2 times over the 1-2 hours. With 27FT it's 3min 20sec per 900mana as stated. Post rezz thats alot slower than your 2min reset. But that is not the usual issue. What I find to be the issue more often is either just fade gone bad, where the small DoDh fighting spaces has see-invis reagroing therefore another 900mana. As to snare/mezz, I use this occasionally just because sometimes it's useful. But the issue is that first, you need LoS, which in small spaces usually means agro, then you have the 3.5 sec cast time which hurts pulling close to the group, then a probably 40% resist rate. The mezz(better than snare imo) is then useless on hard missions because you cant mezz reds.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Monks have their own tools. The best one I learned about from the monk leader of Quiet Solitude(he didnt invent just first i saw use =P ). You get a snare, and earthwalk if needed for seperating a room with 4+ or so. Pull the mobs, snare front one where its not with in agro range of spawn, FD, have a group member tag. The last part is where I think monks have the biggest issue. Bards can self tag due to instant memory wipe, monks cannot enless you get a lucky timer on hate reset. This does not need to change since that is your penalty, like 900mana for a bard, with the memwipe. Monks need to learn how to set up pulls for the tank to finish, yes it hurts dps, but you have to use what you're given. As to the resists on the AA, personally have not used them since my monk bot(bard+monkbot = win pulls) is only 55, but i have had Wonglow(the monk stated above) bot me once or twice, and he said he understood why bards hate their snare, its honestly worse except for range. If you're worried about range, throw a snaring concoction in ammo, then you sacrifice having to pull further for safety of self.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In DoDh....really anyone can pull 1/2 the zone. Certain missions have large clumps(witherans in Leviathan missions especially) but they require patiance in any mission. Even on normal setting I usually don't mem lull untill needed. Enough mobs path that if you wait 45sec or so, you can have a single pull just because of potitioning + pathing.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Over all, bards and monks each have major disadvantages, but its learning to get used to having these and working around them that makes an exceptional puller. If you cant learn to do that...may as well reroll a rogue so you can dps, but dont have to pull, and we dont have to listen to your whining.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;-Tanwedar&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;There is a difference between whining and a legitamate complaint. Personally, my complaint, which is legitamate, is that the &amp;quot;core&amp;quot; ability of a Monk has a failure rate, while the &amp;quot;core&amp;quot; ability of a Bard does not. Fade should have a failure rate just like FD fails. You should be forced to make a decision--just like Monks are--of whether to train your group because of a failure or take the punishment yourself. That's called balance. If you don't like that kind of balance I would call you a whiner since it simply is an equalizer in terms of &amp;quot;core&amp;quot; abilities.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Should Monks get a better Lull than Bards? Absolutly. Or, Bards should not be able to mezz things over level 70--that's a Chanter's core ability anyway and should be left to the Chanters. If you don't think it's fair that Bards cannot mezz over level 70 you are a whiner since you have no legitamate complaint. Monks cannot Lull over 70 and Bards should not be able to Lull or mezz over 70. It's called balance. You don't get to whine about it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Bards are not meant to be masters of all trades--only jacks of all trades.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>I severely doubt the code behind Monk lull differs at all from the other lulls. A different level cap, however, wouldn't be a change in code, it would be a change in spell data. Which, incidentally, doesn't really differ &amp;quot;greatly&amp;quot; right now.</description>

      <description>"Now you're complaining that we actually have to pull? He He"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No I think the point is our lull tools are useless, bards however still have no problem mezzing, snaring and FM'ing to pull alot faster, without the group losing dps while a monk spends the majority of their time on their asses.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;others pullers can lull multiple mobs past lvl 70.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Wrong. No class can lull mobs above level 70. Classes do get their lulls at different levels (ie, bards get &lt;A href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5370" target=_blank&gt;Luvwen's Aria of Serenity&lt;/A&gt; at level 66), and all other classes can use it more (ie, cast on &amp;gt; 1 mob at once), but &lt;STRONG&gt;all&lt;/STRONG&gt; have a level 70 mob cap.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Bards however have a huge advantage in DoDH pulling because of mez, snare and mostly Fading Memories. The cap on their mez is 73, and there is no cap on snare (except mobs which are immune).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So they can pull a whole room, snare/mez one, FM off (all whilst running), and then re-tag the snared/mezzed one. But they do not use Lull because of the level cap.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
