I didn't think about that and honestly can't remember if I stole them invis or uninvis the first time. Thanks again.</div>

				<div></div>Petitioned and GM said to post here on boards if his simple solution didnt work, So here goes, Arena event, started it way back when it came out. Got to about level 24 and charm looking good.  Came back recently with same group and beat a few more waves and Charm no longer updates.  Tried destroying charm in hopes to even restart, but the guy in mission always gives back charm with same stats.  Even tried to put someone new in mission and started at about level 20 and went to 28ish and the different guy's charm is now better then the other 5 people.  Have tried restarting from level 1 all they way to 28 and charm still does not upgrade.  I hope I'm posting in the correct area, any help would be appreciated because it is a nice item once maxed.  Thank you in advance...
