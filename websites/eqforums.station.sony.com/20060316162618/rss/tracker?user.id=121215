      <description>from everything i understand, EQ doesnt have to support x2core. as i understand it, any program should run fine on it. it will just run on 1 of the cores instead of 2&lt;br&gt;check yer IRQ assignments and make sure windows doesnt have any overlapping. also do you have the BIOS updated? grafix drivers up to date?&lt;br&gt;that IRQ issue is very common on XP boxes.&lt;br&gt;i'm no pc guru, but ive been reading about the latest amd processor in anticipation of building my new rig. from all that ive read i just cant imagine that EQ wouldnt run on it. everything should run on it fine. it just wont take advantage of both cores splitting the work. all will be done on one. like if you had a single core processor. that's how i understand them to work anyway. check out that IRQ issue. go into system information under system tools. look for resources in there and somewhere youll find an IRQ assignment list. ideally you wont have ANY duplicates. everything should be on it's own IRQ&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;now as i understand it, if you do have overlapping IRQ assignments, one of 2 things. either you get an updated BIOS from the MB/bios manufacturer. (or a third-party bios update mfg - or... you can reinstall windows and manually assign IRQs. you cant do this without reinstalling tho. on the initial boot you enter bios and select BIOS Select IRQs. something to that effect.&lt;br&gt;dont know if that's yer problem or not. hate to see you having trouble with that fine new machine tho 8(&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;did you check the AMD forums? do a search on google. overclockers is another good source for good solutions. im new to the forums too so i cant think of all of them. they are great resources tho. those guys have tried about everything you can imagine. if there's a fix they know about em.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;good luck and hope you get yer rig runnin EQ for ya 8)&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Stromm missed out on most of the double xp?&lt;br&gt;let's see... perhaps hundreds? of people had their crap deleted due to no fault of their own. hundres possibly? lost corpses with all their gear on them as well. these people got to sit for what? 2 days? while the double xp was going on waiting for their corpses to be fixed. which means they got screwed out of the XP on the tune/corpse that is pending for probably MOST of the double xp. if not all of it in some cases. (find it hard to believe they had that mess cleaned up by monday) and then after all that they forgot to give the double xp to Stromm?????&lt;br&gt;/sigh&lt;br&gt;/shaking head&lt;br&gt;/wants to cry&lt;br&gt;hope you guys - and all the people that lost their bodies(hope all of them got their bodies back too) - got at least SOME of the XP that the rest of us got.&lt;br&gt;sorta lame to give a prize out when the people hosed in the first place cant take advantage of the double xp in many cases. unless you want to do monster missions. what if they dont have DoD? guess they were out of luck again. /sigh&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>/chuckle&lt;br&gt;i shouldnt laugh really. it's kind of sad.&lt;br&gt;you young people now have such skewed and distorted perceptions of american history.  8(&lt;br&gt;it's no surprise that christianity is &amp;quot;favored&amp;quot; in this country when you consider that the founding&lt;br&gt;fathers were overwhelmingly christian. this &amp;quot;freedom of religion&amp;quot; you speak of wasn't freedom&lt;br&gt;FROM religion, but freedom OF religion. they weren't trying to escape it. they came here to be&lt;br&gt;able to freely practice it. one of them went so far as to say that our constitution was wholly inadequate&lt;br&gt;for an unreligious people. consider the implications of that statement. another said that if we cannot&lt;br&gt;live by moral restraint that we would be ruled by tyrrants. the first thing modern tyrrants do is bury&lt;br&gt;and/or make illegal any knowledge of religious freedom or the spiritual nature of mankind.&lt;br&gt;your forefathers did not die to give you the right to remove religion from public view, but to keep the state&lt;br&gt;from removing your right to practice religion freely. at the time of the revolution it is estimated that over 98%&lt;br&gt;of the colonials were of the christian persuasion. nothing has been forced on you ladies and gentlemen,&lt;br&gt;but MUCH has been stolen. much has been distorted and maligned by evil men who would have you&lt;br&gt;ignorant of this country's heritage. that is sad indeed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>i think it's obvious that the developers at SoE have no regard for any suggestions their customers might make regardless of their merit. simple fix:&lt;br&gt;stop giving them your money. i do this all the time. i get bad service from a waitress i ask for the manager. if the manager treats me like the waitress does i get up and leave and never go back. send all those SoE punks packing. make them go find a job. and all this &amp;quot;how can you hope someone gets fired over a GAME?&amp;quot; crap... this GAME is why they HAVE A JOB! take it seriously. this isn't welfare or some government-subsidized program. you are RESPONSIBLE to the consumers that give you their money. in spite of the BS you present with your EULA threats, YOU are the vendor. WE are the consumers. you know... those people with money to spend? so print out your EULA over and over again on your little printer at home and after all of your customers have left take them to Krogers and see how many packages of hamburger they give you in trade 8)&lt;br&gt;no worries. the day Vanguard releases is the last day SoE ever gets any money from me. thank you SoE for twisting all of our arms. you don't appreciate your customers. perhaps you'll find looking for customers more satisfying than respecting the ones you have? /shrug&lt;br&gt;i don't care if you have customers or not. eventually YOUR jobs will also be farmed out to India. after the way you have treated us why should we care?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;i don't generally get this worked up about problems in game. i actually want to apologize to veryone for the posts i've made over the last 2 days. but ya know, you made the mistake SoE. YOU screwed-up. not us. how come it's always your customers that pay for your incompetence? well i say enough is enough. it's time to find a new game provider that either appreciates it's customers more, or, one that has devs and programmers that dont keep repeating the same silly indiscretions over and over. maybe your people should be... flipping hamburgers, or driving a taxi, or any number of other things. personally, i think it's the suits. the morons with degrees in higher education running the show that are to blame. but then again i'm a truck driver. what would i know, right? my 145 IQ means nothing without a pedigree from a center of higher learning. i know one thing. if i do my job like you people at SoE do, i get fired. so i don't have the luxery of doing my job the way you people do yours. /shrug&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;you people have had Everquest for what? 4 years? it's obvious that you don't want it and that you wish we would all just cancel our subscriptions. well you don't have to ask me 63 times. 62 will work.&lt;br&gt;funny... i never got to play Everquest in it's early days. i've spent the last 3 years watching my game devolve into a circus sideshow. dumbed down to the point that it's no fun anymore and splintered into so many pieces that you can never find anyone to group with anymore. but inspite all of that, the original game was so good that people are STILL playing it. hanging on to what it used to be. i know i have. you must be proud SoE team. /cheer&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

ROFL&lt;br&gt;see what i'm saying? this is not a mistake.&lt;br&gt;we have all been witness to the cyber crime of the century! 8P&lt;br&gt;we are all victims of FRAUD. SoE has conspired to conduct business out of good faith. this is their answer to our devotion to a game that has run for nearly 8 years now. theyve tried and tried to run us off with no success. they finally figured out how to get us all to quit playing EQ and switch to EQ2. the game they really want us playing anyway.&lt;br&gt;this is the only thing that makes any sense. you can't tell me that this is a mistake.&lt;br&gt;sorry but i just had to say something. i cant believe the stuff i'm seeing posted here tonight. this is just too much to be coincidence. nobody could be this f****** STUPID! nobody&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>I am so ticked off right now i'm ready to knock the glass out of this monitor!!!!!&lt;br&gt;Of all the incompetent and MORONIC crap i've watched you people do over the last 3 1/2 years this takes the cake.&lt;br&gt;We give you our money. we buy your expansions year after year. some of us buy gear from the store even i'm sure.&lt;br&gt;and how do you repay us?&lt;br&gt;YOU put a ******* NPC vendor on the live servers that isn't supposed to be there.&lt;br&gt;and then you MORONS decide to &amp;quot;fix&amp;quot; YOUR screw-up by STEALING OUR TIME AND EFFORT over the past few days!!!&lt;br&gt;the same people that PAY YOUR SALARIES. oh that's right. you all have stock now. you dont really need our money anymore do ya?&lt;br&gt;you all really want us to switch to SWG or EQ2 right? like that is going to happen&lt;br&gt;i didnt' have anything to do with your ******* NPC in pok. and even if i did, WHO PUT IT THERE??????????????????????????&lt;br&gt;i didnt do any tradeskilling in the last 3 days outside of vendors ive used many, many times before.&lt;br&gt;and yet i have plat missing and i lost 2 days work on DoN cultural quests for smithing. i HATE what EQ has become to begin with. but i finally give in and decide &amp;quot;okay. i'm gonna start doing this don smithing&amp;quot;. and LOOK WHAT IT GETS ME!!!&lt;br&gt;just when i start to give over a little toward you idiots and the recent xpansions you guys come along and STAB US IN THE BACK AGAIN!!!!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;i think every one of you people at SoE should be fired. if not fired, sued. sued for every dime that SoE can call an asset. i hope someone starts a class-action lawsuit against you people. your incompetence has ravaged this once-fine game for over 3 years now. enough is enough. i'm 42 years old and i dont believe i have ever seen incompetence displayed so boldly as i have witnessed from SoE over the last 3 years. what are you people going to do when Vanguard releases? i know what a lot of you are going to do. yer gonna be looking for a job.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;well... ATTABOY!!! you guys have outdone yourselves no doubt&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;thank you for all of the headaches. lost time. lost friends who left over you past BS. stress from sorry programming resulting in connection failures and breaks in game progress. did all the programmers leave with Verant? i would have thought that even a grade-school student would be smart enough to keep SOME of the help around. obviously you didn't.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;this post is to let you know how P****D OFF I AM, and to let you know that both of my accounts will be cancelled the very day that Vanguard releases. if not before. this is the last straw for me. i will not buy your moronic new expansion. i will not pay a years dues in advance again. i will not help my friends pay for their accounts when times are tough. i will recruit every single person i know in EQ to join me playing Vanguard, and if they dont want to come to Vanguard with me i'll send them a copy of WoW.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;in fact, i can promise you this - i will NEVER BUY ANOTHER GAME FROM SOE AGAIN AS LONG AS I LIVE&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;my apoligies to all of the EQ players reading this. i rarely go off like this. i'm going to miss the game and all friends ive made over the last 3 1/2 years. it makes me sad. i refuse to keep giving my money to a corporate drug dealer tho. i wont do it anymore. these people have screwed us long enough. 8(&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>1 more follow-up for you guys having this problem...&lt;br&gt;i SEEM to have it fixed.&lt;br&gt;i deleted the eqgame.exe, eqclient.ini, and the ***dx9.dll files. downloaded virgin versions.&lt;br&gt;this seems to have fixed it. have my system resolution set back to 1024x768 and now have EQ loading up in 1600x1200. didn't try to run it at 1024x768 again tho. i'm thinking it should run that fine too as it wouldnt load at anything but 800x600 before.&lt;br&gt;hope this works for you guys too 8D</description>

      <description>hey guys&lt;br&gt;MIGHT have a fix for you&lt;br&gt;it's a hack i think, but it's working for me&lt;br&gt;change your system resolution to 1600x1200&lt;br&gt;ive done that and eq is now loading up at 1024x768&lt;br&gt;it's not a REAL fix obviously, but it's enough for now until SOE figures out what they've screwed up&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;soe: you have changed something deep within the game i think? this all started 2 or 3 patches ago. the new UI just cemented it it seems&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;i hope this works for you guys too</description>

      <description>i tried this. they already had the correct resolution&lt;br&gt;so now what? this is not good for me. if i can't get my 1024x768 resolution back i'm probably done with SOE and the HACK they call everquest.&lt;br&gt;i see one of 2 things going on here:&lt;br&gt;either SOE programmers are truly incompetent, OR, they are trying to herd all of us to switch to EQ2&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;NEWSFLASH for you guys at SOE:&lt;br&gt;if i quit playing EQ, i'll be switching to VANGUARD&lt;br&gt;i can only guess, but i would say there are a LOT of your current subscribers giving Vanguard a long, hard look.&lt;br&gt;you remember the guys from Verant right? :)</description>

      <description>Grumbuk...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;here's my problem:&lt;br&gt;like 3 or 4 weeks ago you guys did a patch and my ingame resolution got hosed. i have been using 1024.768 for like 2 years. all of a sudden the 1024.768 SETTING was actually like 800x600. got that fixed. just changed ingame resolution to 1280x1024? something like that. that put me back to the same look as 1024x768.&lt;br&gt;now... downloaded the UI patch. game loads up at 800x600(guessing... everything is HUGE is all i know). i change it to 1024x768. nadda&lt;br&gt;change it to 1280x1024... nadda&lt;br&gt;change my system resolution to 1280x1024... nadda again 8(&lt;br&gt;i looked at my ini files. well a few of them anyway. they appear to all be in ANSI&lt;br&gt;what do i do to get my old resolution back?&lt;br&gt;i even changed back to the old UI and reset the resolution again. NADDA 8(&lt;br&gt;if i can't fix this i'm prolly done playing EQ. i can't go back to 800x600. i have too many chat windows to do that and i'm NOT going back to 1 or 2 windows. people miss way too much info doing that.&lt;br&gt;hope you can help me out here 8)</description>
