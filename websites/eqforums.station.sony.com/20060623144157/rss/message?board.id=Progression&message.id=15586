&lt;P&gt;One more post. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I am not a classic server purest, a hardcore player that will be pushing progression, and I am not a PvPer. I just want to restart EQ and be able to progress the the older content without feeling like I am so far behind it is impossible to catch up (I started playing 2004). I made this post not because I really want to change the idea of the progression server but a little tired of all of the different types of players flaming and arguing in the forums about what the server should be (and in my opinion making many wonder if this server is going to be ruined by that fighting). Rather than get involved in the arguments and flaming I figured I would try to offer&amp;nbsp;some type of&amp;nbsp;compromise. Seems more productive than what I see going on in most of the&amp;nbsp;threads I read.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <title>Progression Idea</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Progression&amp;message.id=15554#M15554</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Personally, I am fine with the idea of the server as it is. But when I read the forums it is easy to see&amp;nbsp;that people want different things from this server. One thing I see that may be a potential problem with the combine is there is going to be extreme competition for some of the good gear and higher end zones. This isn't always a bad thing but because people are going to level pretty fast and the population of the server is going to be pretty high this will leave many players&amp;nbsp;with no access to that content, which for&amp;nbsp;a lot of&amp;nbsp;people is the whole reason they&amp;nbsp;want to play this server to experience older content. I think there is a way to make the game more fun for more people.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Let the Combine server go as normal until Planes of Power is unlocked (since I see a lot of posts that seem to think this is where the game became unfun for them). At that point have a quest or something that allows people to do a turn in that transports them to PoK but moves them to a different server. The second server can then continue the progression, while progression then stays static on the Combine. This may satisfy many of the Classic server people as well as the slower casual players who where restricted from much of the content because they could not compete the big guilds. The big guilds still get to have there competition and they will now have access to old zones if they want to help gear up their guilds without blocking the&amp;nbsp;casual players from experiencing that content. It will also keep the casual crowd from quitting because they can't compete, because they can look forward to the top guilds moving on at some point. The transfer will not only be available to the&amp;nbsp;people&amp;nbsp;who completed the high end luclin content but anybody who wants after it is unlocked. If the Combine&amp;nbsp;struggles because lack of players, who cares, move them all to the second server and close it ( I doubt it will have that problem at least until most people finish the luclin content).&amp;nbsp;Then start a new progression server, a pvp progression server, or whatever you want to do with the hardware. I guess if it needs to be closed that should quit the people calling for a classic server because it would be obvious it is not viable. I don't see any downside except for you need another server, but not until PoP is unlocked which will probably be a while from now and that will give SoE plenty of time to gauge how successful the server. One possible problem I can think of is that when the slower players finally finish Luclin and decide it is time for them to move to the new server, depending on how far behind everyone else is they may have a hard time getting a guild doing PoP progression and may end up in the same position they are in on current servers. But, probably there will be guilds working on PoP progression for quite a long time because there will be a steady stream of people coming from the Combine.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;What do you guys think?&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;I think that if you limit one "instance" of the server to Planes of Power, people there would quickly grow bored.&amp;nbsp; On a regular server, how often do you find people in the PoP expansion nowadays, as opposed to the DoD, DoN, and PoR expansions?</description>

&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Like I said if people get bored there, then the server population will show that and then a decision can be made that there is not enough population to support the server and the can merge it into the second server. The second server will not be limited to PoP it will continue to progress up to the current expansion. So if they do need to merge servers nothing is really lost.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;since I can't edit i will make another post.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Maybe I was not clear based on the replies. What I meant was have 2 servers have one not progress past Luclin, but when people want to move on to PoP they actually transfer to the second server. The second server will have all expansions up to PoP unlocked from the time they transfer and when players move to that server they will pick up progression from there trying to unlock the next expansion and continue up to the current expansion. Only the first server will remain static and not progress past Luclin,&amp;nbsp;the 2nd will continue to progress. If the first server needs to be closed eventually they will just merge into the second server, but that doesn't seem like it would really matter that much since everyone on both servers began the progression at the same time. Some will just be further ahead than others, but that would be the case whether there were 2 servers or just one. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;If you don't like the idea or don't think it will work that's fine, It just didn't seem like you understood what I meant from your replies.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;and how often do you think you would see people in the PoP zones if those expansions didn't exist?&amp;nbsp; Not that I really agree with the original posters idea.&amp;nbsp; But more people would prefer a classic server, or a server restricted up to a certain expansion (pop) than you think.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
