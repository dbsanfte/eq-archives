				<DIV>Well, where to begin.&nbsp; I have had several rather interesting encounter with romance outside of Everquest from meeting fellow gamers.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>My first time I decided to go on a date with this rogue gal, she was quite courteous and insisted that we went to several very public areas while she paid the way. We visited several expensive restarants, drank several bottles of wine and generally had a great time.&nbsp; I was kinda curious where she got what seemed like 20 wallets or so especially since she was not carrying a purse and she had about 30 credit cards.&nbsp; Well, later on that night we ended up going back to my place, one thing led to another and we made our way to my bedroom, she could do some unbelievable things with her hands, but eventually I fell asleep with her in my arms, quite romantic. When I woke up my T.V. and she was gone. If she ever comes back I just might throw in a DVD player as well.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>My next dating exprience from in game was with this cleric gal. She also was quite courteous and generally we spent alot of time together. She always insisted on displays of affection where she would constantly massage me, whether I wanted it or not. Every time I insisted on doing something for her she would get quite upset, so I let it be. She was kinda prudish, so one night I got her to eventually let some of her inhibitions go as she agreed to go with me to this awesome druids grove party at midnight. She was kinda edgy seeing all the nude dancing and stuff but, eventually I managed to get her to sip on some elderberry wine to relax her. About an hour later her clothes were off and she was screaming at the top of her lungs and making out with half of my coven!&nbsp; When she came to the next afternoon she was wondering what the heck happened last night and why was she walking so funny and why was she sore from head to toe.&nbsp; She never called back.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>My next dating exprience was with this ranger chick.&nbsp; She was quite a handful. She was really passionate about lots of things&nbsp;and she liked to hang out by her lonesome alot.&nbsp; She was very aggressive when it came to love making and such and was once saucy little minx. Eventually she stopped coming by, but a year later I received a letter requesting child support. She had been living out in the woods away from everywhere and anything raising a child by herself so, I decided I would do the right thing so I went to visit her. She was in this village filled with wild women, wearing lots of fur bikinis. I think they did not care for men to much as pretty much as soon as I got there they were chasing me flinging spears and firing arrows at me. I barely escaped with my life.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Yet another dating exprience was with this bard chick. She wanted to go be a singer for American Idol. One night she got up and was doing some Karoke.&nbsp; The next thing I remember was a piercing shriek and the neighborhood dogs were howling in pain. I had a sudden urge to put down a horse. Sweet gal, couldn't sing or play an instrument to save her life, last I heard she got in trouble for lip syncing on Saturday Night Live and got booed off the stage from the Orange Bowl.</DIV>
