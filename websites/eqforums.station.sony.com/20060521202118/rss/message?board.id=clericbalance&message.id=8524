    <title>Summit report from a Cleric's perspective</title>
    <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=clericbalance&amp;message.id=8524</link>
    <description>Sorry for the delay, between lost luggage, a busy week at work, and Father's Day, I haven't had time to focus on my notes until now. I'll try to get as much as I can into this report as they pertain to Clerics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Summit and Fan Faire was set up as follows:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On Wednesday, most of us arrived at the Hotel and had free time. We gathered at the bar outside Quarks for a quick introduction and get to know eachother and stuff like that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On Thursday was the Summit. We were separated in Meelee and Caster groups with the Hybrids having their choice as to where they go. There were 4 1 hour sessions through the day 2 in the morning, 2 in the afternoon, with 30 minutes between them and an hour break for lunch. The sessions had general themes to them. For me they ended up being:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Session 1: Live discussion. Discussion of the game in general as it is now; where it is going in the near future, how it is now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Session 2: Class discussion: Issues particular to classes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Session 3: Future discussion: Discussion of the future of the game, where it is going, what's coming up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Session 4: Open forem: Talk about anything that may have been missed in the previous discussions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Between sessions and at the lunch and dinners, there were lots of opportunities to talk with the SOE people about anything.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On Friday, the Fan Faire started. Over Friday and Saturday, there were numerous open forums for anyone to attend and ask related questions. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I attended the following forums:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Customer Service Forum: Talk about the CS situation in general in EQ.&lt;br&gt;- Progressions of Powers forums: Talk about AA's, Disciplines, Spells,Items, etc....&lt;br&gt;- EQ/EQII Community discussion: Talk about the EQLive boards, and with the mods.&lt;br&gt;- Maintaining a living world (I missed a chunk of this one for the Expansion preview)&lt;br&gt;- Everquest Technology Discussion: (Showing off some of the framework of EQ, particularly pathing and lighting)&lt;br&gt;- Everquest Tradeskill Discussion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In my opinion, the Summit discussions tended to dig into a topic deeper, whereas the Fan Faire forums tended to be thouched on lightly and then the next topic was brought up. That meant that the Summit discussions had less overall topics but we got into more details, whereas the Fan Faire forums had more touched on at least.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I will try to keep this to Cleric-related issues only, based on what I heard and could ask. These are mostly going in the order of my notes, and some items may be repeated. I am going to try and give as much detail as I can with them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One question brought up was the issue about the number of clerics on raids. This is a major balancing issue since it is hard to design encounters where more healers does not make the encounter easier. It is an on going issue that will be constantly looked at as encounters are made and rebalanced; but in general they can not beat human nature. And human nature is basically saying "If I bring 2x clerics to this encounter, it becomes 2x easier." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I brought up the issue of cleric DPS in general, no real specifics. The topic itself had to be tabled however until more of the reenvisionning improvements come through. The guy who was crunching all the DPS numbers was not at the summit, and those that were there did not want to say anything that would probably be changed later anyways.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An issue about botting in general was brought up. The Devs are not happy with the KEI/Virtue botting you see in PoK. They brainstormed (Note this is NOT being implemented; it's still very much in the 'well what if we did this?' stage) the idea of buffs fading if the buffer was not in the group. We at the summit really did NOT like that idea; but we did toss out a counter idea. The idea that while grouped, the buff timers are effectively frozen; but if you leave the group the (much reduced) timers start going down; to give a group enough time to find a suitable replacement. A lot of notes were taken, but this won't be something we will see soon, one way or another.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Mage summoned invis stones being lore was brought up. The Devs are against making them un-lore because they do NOT want to see them in the Bazaar. They were very adamant about that issue as well, so I don't feel we'll get much movement on that issue. (I'd love to see those stones non-lore myself)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for invis in general, the Dev's did say that they have finally fixed the underlying coding issues that prevented 1-charge items from stacking. So we will see Cloudy Potions (and similar potions) stackable soon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They are also increasing the drop rates for the components of the Alchemy improved invis potions. I wasn't in that discussion but it may just be that the items will have a higher chance to drop off mobs and/or appear in chests, but they are still limited to Guk LDoN's. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We asked if the short duration buffs could be moved to the short duration window. The Dev laughed and commented about how he gets asked that once a week and said it was a no go. He didn't go into details about WHY it is a no go however.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I managed to corner Rytan briefly, and asked if there was a chance we could lower the chance of procs breaking roots. He told me that it would not be possible due to the way roots and spells are coded at the moment. Later on, I asked if the Strong Root AA that druids and wizards get could be expanded to other classes. There was some nodding of heads from the Dev's and lots of note taking but no firm "yes" or "No" about it coming our way. I suspect it is, at the very least, on their sheets for further discussion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A switch to turn armor helms on and off was asked about. The Dev's said they know how they can do it, and that it would be relatively easy to do (2-3 days of work), it is just low on the priority list. As for adding more visible armor sets in general, that is not likely to happen until they take care of the PC Models. There just isn't much room in general for more armors, or much else. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I did ask about making more robes available, and got a firm "We'll see about it." from the Devs. They seemed surprised that some clerics didn't want to wear plate. They did make clear that if robes were CLR useable, they would have less AC then plate, but that's a given anyways.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I also asked Vahlar and a few other Dev's about the cleric diety quest line. She knew that some of those spells existed, like the Dark Elf snare necklace and the Brell beer necklace, but she wasn't aware that there were many of those. She seemed very open towards expanding those lines and filling in the missing ones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the number crunchers in our midst, the practice test dummies will eventually go live. The Dev's like them, but there are a few minor details holding them back from releasing the dummies live. There is no ETA on this besides "eventually". (One issue mentionned was to make sure that the numbers people gather are right and can not be griefed or confused by other people using the dummies.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the group leaders in our midst, there was discussions about sharing the Leadership abilities in a raid and group among the leaders better. That means that someone other than the leader may earn Leader XP, or someone could be leader to earn the points, but someone else's abilities are in effect. There was a lot of interest from all sides about that in general, so I am very hopeful something will come from that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is going live with the next patch, but the /assist group and /assist raid ranges are being expanded  to use the same range as /assist in general. The devs are also open to increasing the range within reason as well, though I haven't seen much discussion since then as to what the range will be. After the patch next week, the range should be double checked to see what we might want it to be.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The idea of "Health of Target's Target's Target" and Group HoTT Leadership skills were brought up. HoT^3 was laughed at, but there was a lot of interest in them. I suspect seeds have been planted, and I urge people to keep mentionning them if you would like to see them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Loot All" for our own corpses was discussed and turned down. The Devs feel that it is a game philosophy issue (Son of The Vision), and it is extremely unlikely to ever happen. Not that it will never happen; but don't hold your breath waiting for it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the other hand, speaking about corpses, the Dev's mentionned an idea I really liked about PC corpses. They are considering (but this is still in the brainstorming stage, so don't expect it any time soon), a way so that an XP-Rezzable corpse, will not poof  if you loot everything (or loop an empty corpse). They are considering adding a "Destroy corpse" button or something like that which you would have to click to clear the corpse if it could be rezzed. The idea is VERY preliminary, but was very positively received.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Increasing the power of Cleric healing was asked at one point, and it was shot down. The Dev's explained healing in general at that point. Encounters are basically designed around healing power, cleric healing power in particular. The Dev's design the top end encounters of an expansion to push cleric healing to the limits (and even slightly beyond) of the healing available in that expansion (so top Healing AA's, healing augs, healing spells, epics, etc....). Increasing our healing abilities between expansions would mean rebalancing those encounters to match the new abilities. Basically, don't expect any large scale healing changes except when new expansions come out (with new content designed to match the new healing level)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cleric damage mitigation, and damage handling in general was talked about. The large gap between the tank's ability to handle damage and non-tanks to handle damage was acknowledged. The Devs are working on ways to decrease that gap without necessarily letting other classes tank. What those ways are was not mentionned. The eventual goal would be to reduce the bang-you're-dead effect that a lot of classes get if aggro shifts to them for even a moment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wizards brought up this point, but it applies to all of us more or less. The issue with the resist rates on mobs and how they've been more or less constantly going up. The Devs are more or less happy with how things are now, but are open to reducing resists on some mobs, especially the trash-mobs. This will probably be a long term balancing as they tweek with resists over time, and with new content.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Similarly, stuns were also mentionned though not much was said about them. (That discussion dissolved into a brief talk about Lucy instead). But other than resist rates, the Dev's are fairly happy with stuns as they are now. The impression I had, is that Stun is supposed to be more of an interrupter, and not a complete mob stopper, hence why it fades off of mobs in a tick or so.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mana and Endurance regen rates, especially outside of combat, were touched on briefly. The Dev's admitted that with the large pools available today, the downtime waiting for mana and endurance to regen outside of battle is becoming prohibitive. Methods not told to us are being tossed around internally to improve that situation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Talking about Endurance, this may or may not affect us, but it may eventually. When stamina was changed to Endurance, the Devs said that Endurance regen rates were designed with max regen rates already in place. They didn't want Meelee's to be dependant on a buff. With the increased use of Disciplines, and Endurance pools as big as they are now, the Dev's are considering some Endurance regen improvers. There is a slight chance that it will be in the form of spells, but more likely it will be an equivalent to Flowing Thought items.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finally, I managed to catch some Dev's (sadly Rytan was not among them) to talk about the Hammers and Yaulps.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I mentionned how our summoned hammer line has rather large gaps both in availibility and the procs. Those devs were very interested and would be willing to bring it up internally.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I also talked about the mana regen on the Yaulp line. They countered that mana regen rates in the lower levels are fine as far as they are concerned due to the strength of the Meditate skill. I reminded them that yaulp fades while sitting, so meditate doesn't really apply there. They were surprised by that and said they would look into it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well, just as an addendum to that, I checked out the lower yaulps and was surprised. Yaulp 1-4 (the ones without Regen) do NOT fade when sitting. Yaulp's behaviour changes completely between yaulp 4 and 5. I'll be starting a discussion on yaulp later to consider changing those lower level spells to better reflect the upper versions (complete with the fade when sitting). I also noticed that there are some stacking issues among the Yaulps in that they don't always overwrite or block eachother.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finally, Loral and I were talking with someone about Turn Undead. There is one idea that was brought up that looks like a really nice solution to the Turn Undead issues. The Dev is still checking on the feasibility of it, so I can't give any more details about it until it is announced. It should (baring the issue of the lack of undead content in general) make TU useful for us.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Those are, I believe, all the cleric related issues that I wrote down. There was a LOT discussed over those days, for all classes and the game in general. I found the SOE people were very open to the ideas and issues we raised. The attitude of both the SOE people and the players was very positive and hopeful. Everyone involved seemed to feel that there is an exciting future for EQ.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;The simple solution to the "softcaps" is to just remove them completely. A tank who equips a 20 ac item, ALREADY gets more ac from the same item. Then add to that the fact that class items for tanks (Time/GoD/OOW armors) have higher ac than the quivalent items for clerics.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;A cleric in full GoD quest armor, will have lower ac than a Warrior in the equivalent armor set. This is fine, good even. Going by the tanks in my guild, the difference seems to be in the 400-600ac range.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Throw in the softcap, and now, instead of being a cleric with 2100ac protecting me, I am essentially a cleric with about 1600ac. The only&amp;nbsp;clerics who get the full AC advantage of those armor sets, and the even better tacvi/anguish armors, are new apps who throw on a coule Qvic pieces, along with some bazaar gear, and end up able to take about the same damage as me, with 400-500 less ac.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Throw away sofcaps, for everyone. All classes. Robe casters will still only get one ac per worn AC, wheras plate tanks get around 2ish, and clerics get somewhere in between. Clerics still only get Dodge, and a low cap, compared to many defensive/avoidance skills for tanks.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Even with removed softcaps, clerics are not going to threaten knights as group tanks. What will happen is well geared clerics will take melee damage better than poorly geared clerics. Well geared wizards will take damage better than poorly geared wizards. Top geared tanks will get to use all of their ac, probably making an even bigger gap between tanks and clerics, but at least it will improve cleric survivability. And it will make gear matter for all classes more.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>I just want to say, I am 100% for removing softcaps.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hidden soft caps and mitigation "tables" are probably some of the worst ideas I have ever heard in my entire gaming/programming career.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I suspect there is hesitation because eliminating softcaps for the actual tanking classes with the current formulas would trivialize too much content.  However, this re-envisioning process seems like the perfect place to me to get rid of a concept that was never really a good idea in the first place.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the very, very least, if softcaps absolutely must stay in-game, then make the gosh darn displayed AC number be &lt;i&gt;post-softcap&lt;/i&gt;.  Hidden things are BAD BAD BAD!</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;Seems like the current incarnation of EQ has essentially stated that past a certain amount of protection from armor, one's combat&amp;nbsp;experience&amp;nbsp;(as estimated&amp;nbsp;by one's&amp;nbsp;character class) is a more important factor in deciding how much damage one takes from a hit than is one's armor.&amp;nbsp; Several people here disagree with that approach and call it outrageous, or intolerable, or unreasonable, or whatever.&amp;nbsp; But in an abstract sense, it's just as defensible as going the other way and stating that the kind of armor you're wearing should be the dominating factor and that only explicit combat skills like defense/block/parry/dodge should make a distinction between the amount of damage a priest takes versus a tank.&amp;nbsp; Folks may disagree with it (in fact I somewhat disagree with it myself), but I think it's absurd to reference other game systems and try to claim the the current status quo is unreasonable in some way because it doesn't seem "realistic" or in line with some other irrelevent game.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The way things work now is perfectly reasonable, perfectly self consistent, and can be easily justified using a logical set of assumptions.&amp;nbsp; Personally, I think&amp;nbsp;the artifically low class based soft caps&amp;nbsp;screw up game and class balance at the high end the way things are now, so I object to it on those principles.&amp;nbsp; But I think anyone objecting to the current status quo based on analogies to D&amp;amp;D or some "plate should&amp;nbsp;mitigate like&amp;nbsp;plate" nonsense is just looking to justify something they want in entirely the wrong way.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I still think making a request for an increased AC return over the soft cap for everyone would help plate classes the most and move them more toward the mitigation advantage they expect.&amp;nbsp; And it's easily justified by a number of arguments, none of which involve D&amp;amp;D or (imho) incorrect assumptions regarding the nature or plate armor.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I think you and the others in this thread, agree on general principle, but seem to disagree on justification. Bottom line however, is that softcaps don't make any kind of sense. If clerics were not supposed to get to 2500ac, then why not fix the problem by itemizing cleric armor differently, or by giving a smaller bonus to worn ac than they have now.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;If I recall correctly, plate tanks get something like 2.0 actual ac from 1 worn ac on an item. Clerics get something like 1.3 AC per item ac. Robe classes get 1.0? This difference reflects any battle training or experience that might be used as justification for differential effects of armor. Seems perfectly reasonable. Then on TOP of that, they throw in softcaps. Hmm, I upgrade from a 51 ac bp, to a 65 ac bp, and based on my skill and training, get 1.3 times the base ac. Later, I upgrade from a 72ac bp, to a 96ac bp, and get 0.33 worn ac per base ac, just because I have better armor in my other slots. Did I forget how to use a breastplate? &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Basically, IMHO, softcaps are lazy coding. If I am not supposed to have 2100ac buffed, then put less than 96ac on my BP. Or reduce the AC multiplier to 1.1. To have ac work up to a certain point, then stop working, is ridiculous.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I seriously doubt that giving me the full benefit of all my worn ac, would somehow be unbalancing, or make clerics viable tanks. All it might do is let me survive long enough to get my DA spell cast.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Glowing, your missing my point.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;right now the diffrence between a cleric and a paladin on mitigating damage are this:&amp;nbsp; 1. skill caps. 2. ac on the items worn. 3. items to wear choices. 4. innate tables that grant tanks more tanking. 5. softcaps and the return in investment over them.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;from previous dev posts i know the following to be true:&amp;nbsp; clerics and shaman have the same soft cap and return over cap, and are "slightly" above druids.&amp;nbsp; monks were changed from the same as druids to use the knight tables, "roughtly 3 times more return on ac than before".&amp;nbsp; meaning that clerics are exactly the same as a chain class, only slightly better than leather, and that we are more than 3 times LESS ac return tha someone else in leather.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;thus the concept of leather/chain/plate as originally designed is no longer accurate at all.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;my goal is simple... reduce the diffrences to skill caps and ac worn.&amp;nbsp; if that means redoing everyones skill so that casters cap at a 80 defense, then so be it. we have this little title we all gain at 100 skill called "master"&amp;nbsp; master of what exactly?&amp;nbsp; its a sure sign they ment for 100+ skill to be important in some way, but practiclly its meaningless.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;innate tables and softcaps have no place in a game with an obvious skill system... just make the damn skill system work.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>Avrel, since you didnt read my post at all, let me make it brief.  im not asking for clerics to be a tank, im asking for teh removal of tables and softcaps. we have a skill system, its perfectly capable of handling everything that caps and tables do.  im saying remove the things players cannot see, and make the things we can see have the same result.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;that has nothing at all to do with a cleric tanking. now go get enraged somewhere quietly.</description>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#6633ff&gt;Actually to solo we have to right up and tank/dps a mob down, which in turn makes us inherently want better mitigation or avoidance for those of us that choose to do so. Increasing plate return is not going to set the world on fire, quite honestly your point is trife. Understand you play a three dimensional class, and not a single dimension class of "just healer."&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Monks should be able to tank because innately they have all the skills that allow them to do so. My boyfriend is a monk and he tanks better than most warriors.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#6633ff&gt;Why should they? They already can pull and deal out dps, that FD trick is good stuff and gives them an insane Get of Jail Free card. A warrior can do two things, dps and tank. So why should they?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#6633ff&gt;Actually I think this just goes back to your own play style&amp;nbsp;that leads into&amp;nbsp;bias. Simply because you group with your boy friend and have him tank for you while you heal. Understand that quite a few of us solo, and do more than just play a single dimensional class. Not to mention at the end game, caster survivability is somewhat borked on yard trash. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#6633ff&gt;Understand there is a large difference than saying "we want to tank like a knight" and "we'd like to have some better defensive capibility." Your attempt to marginalize the situation is moot. Because it is based off your own ideal of the class as a primary healer and only as a healer. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#6633ff&gt;I am honestly quite sick of this discussion, I wish people would understand that not everyone wants to play a single dimensional class. Sure we should have limitations, but given today's content those limitations are becomming quite absurd. Some of us have AC that would more than likely make your boyfriend's AC look laughible, yet it does next to nothing other than bragging rights. Tell me, why should 2.5k ac or more on a cleric mean next to nothing. Tell me why&amp;nbsp; is being able to have high end gear actually mean more while soloing? Try it&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#6633ff&gt;&amp;nbsp;without using the word "heal", "not",&amp;nbsp; and "Hurk"&amp;nbsp;and for extra credit try not using the letter "e." Also, avoid cross class comparisons that attempt to defraud the original pro-arguement with an obtuse counter statement that warps the conclusion of the post to be precisely like a paladin.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#6633ff&gt;Realistically being equivilent to a paladin in every regard is impossible. Having an aspect such as better skill cap or better AC return is something to be played with that does not equate to the cleric becomming a paladin wanna-be. It is a step to increase caster survivability at the high end and better soloing. Which does not even effect your playing style, so why do you care?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;Apples and oranges, I've already proven that clerics are meant to tank in some situations and you have only countered with opinion on "what is enough." This is a shady territory, because in your example, the monks, had whined relentlessly for years and advocated for a nerf repeal that finally did occur. Which again turns to subjective opinion.&amp;nbsp;Three facts:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;1. We get less avoidance on high end gear compared to other classes&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;2. AC return does not quantify avoidance return&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;3. Cleric AC return equates to Shaman AC return&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Which becomes subjective to opinion and play style bias, the center piece of 90% of the Hurk vs. someone arguements. With both clerics and monks the opinions are what it comes down to, and how the developers interpret the way things "should" be. I believe it is safe to say here, that along the lines of the increased AC returns you are in the minority.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;doesnt wear plate--not meant to be one of the three main tanks&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;tanks better then warriors and is one of the top dps classes---sounds like you are identifying a problem.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; didnt you in another post complain about clerics wanting to do two things?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; sounds like your monk boyfriend is already too good at doing two things.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; may be time for another look at just how well monk mitigation is.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; If they can tank as well as a warior in plate--when that same warrior cant touch thier dps.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;wow I could have went on and been annoying for another 30 posts of that but you should get my point.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; there are only 3 tank classes-monks are not one of them.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; why is one of the top melee dps classes allowed such great tanking skills?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; the three TANK classes wear plate-not leather.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;There are several parts to the Ac equation. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;First, the softcap. Past the softcap, I get very little benefit to ac. I have 2100 ac buffed atm. Other than resists, mana and better focuses, I have no reason to upgrade gear, because I stopped getting a significant benefit from ac a long time ago. My vote would be to remove ALL softcaps on ac, for ALL classes. AC is AC. If Sony doesn't like their own itemization, creating artificial "softcaps" is a poor fix.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Second, there is the return per worn ac. If i recall correctly, cloth classes get 1 point of worn ac, per listed ac on the&amp;nbsp;item, and that scales up, with tanks getting the highest return. This makes sense. A trained warrior should be able to get better use out of a breastplate, due to his superior battle training. Clerics get priest ac returns. Higher than robe casters, but lower than everyone else. This alone should be the penalty we pay, not an additional softacp.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Third, there are the avoidance/mitigation skills. Dodge, block, parry etc. Melees get more of these, as would be expected. They are trained in battle, not magic or healing. Right now, this difference makes a 1200ac warrior take a LOT less damage than a 1200ac cleric. That's below the softcap, and at that level, it works. However, once the softcap is hit, then all the extra ac means diddly. If my 2100 ac all counted, I'd still take a heck of a lot more damage, because my dodge cap is low, and I have no other avoidance techniques, but to treat me like I only had 1500ac, is downright insulting.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I'm a fairly conventional cleric.&amp;nbsp;I don't try to solo very often (although I did have fun soloing those Akheva mobs for my epic 1.5 drop, dark blues at that). I'd just like to have a bit better chance of surviving long enough to back away or get DA off, when the mob decides to summon me. &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I'm starting to think that the issue here is really one of the return over the soft cap moreso than the cap itself.&amp;nbsp; As GlowingRune pointed out, plate armour inherently has more AC than chain, leather or silk.&amp;nbsp; The problem is that since our returns over the soft cap are so crappy, the higher inherent AC is essentially worthless.&amp;nbsp; If the return over the soft cap was increased (and I don't necessarily&amp;nbsp;mean just for clerics) then the fact that we have higher AC, on average, would again have some meaning - i.e. we would mitigate better.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;That's not to say that the soft cap is not important too...&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Eliminating the soft cap entirely would presumably mean that your AC scales as you'd expect.&amp;nbsp; Upping the return&amp;nbsp;on&amp;nbsp;AC over&amp;nbsp;the soft cap would help a bit less, essentially reducing the damping of the curve, but would still help.&amp;nbsp; It might be easier to convince the devs to do the latter change since it would have less impact and presumably less chance of causing unexpected balance shifts.&amp;nbsp; They want to avoid a situation like we had in the past where monks were better tanks than tank classes.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Regarding Hurk's D&amp;amp;D analogy:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;That's all very interesting stuff, but in my opinion has little to no relevance.&amp;nbsp; EQ is only based in the most superficial ways on D&amp;amp;D and in my opinion, it's a real reach to try to make game balance decisions based on how close EQ follows D&amp;amp;D.&amp;nbsp; Based on what's actually in EQ, "plate mitigation" = "higher ac on plate armor".&amp;nbsp; As far as I am aware, there has never been any other special property of plate armor that makes it have hidden mitigation bonuses, nor is there any basis (in EQ)&amp;nbsp;for thinking there should be.&amp;nbsp; Nor should we be adding another hidden property that we have to make guesses about.&amp;nbsp; AC is listed on the armor.&amp;nbsp; Plate armor has higher AC already.&amp;nbsp; If AC worked as we expect, there'd be no discussion about this topic.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;It's not like&amp;nbsp;armor says "plate armor" on its stats (like WoW).&amp;nbsp; In fact, shamans (theoretically a chain class) can wear various armor that looks a whole lot like plate, so even who can wear what kind of armor is more tied to class than some notion of "plate class" versus "chain class".&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The way I read a lot of the demands for plate mitigation is that a few outspoken clerics really wanted to have paladins and have melee envy.&amp;nbsp; If these outspoken clerics phrased their requests properly and stopped asking to migitate damage the same as plate tanks and instead asked that the AC soft cap be raised or the return over it be raised, then that perception would go away and you might actually find some support among end-game players of other classes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by GlowingRune on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;07-07-2005&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;11:54 AM&lt;/span&gt;</description>
