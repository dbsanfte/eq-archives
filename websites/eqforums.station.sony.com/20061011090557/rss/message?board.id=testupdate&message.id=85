    <description>&lt;FONT color=#ffffff size=2&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Described below are most of the changes that have been introduced over the past few weeks on our test server. The information includes a host of new features, changes, and bug fixes.&amp;nbsp; We have not updated you in a few weeks so here it is.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The patcher and login news screens have been updated with this information as well.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;*** Headliners ***&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- A new button has been added to character select: Return Home. If a character has not been played in the past 6 hours, this button is enabled and pressing it will log the character into the game in their starting city.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- If a character is logged out for more than an hour, full health, mana, and endurance will be granted upon logging in. This is still a bit under development. You may not be quite at 100% but very close.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Re-envisioning has begun!&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Over 600 Spell modifications.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- New zone art for the character select screen and character creation. Crossing the bridge while in Explore mode will allow you to enter the world. Note that all characters are in the same area now. There are no longer class specific areas.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- New Hot Spots!&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Estate of Unrest&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Solusek's Eye&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Kurn's Tower&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The Warrens&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Netherbian Lair&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Echo Caverns&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The Scarlet Desert&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The Tower of Frozen Shadow&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The Hole&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The Grey&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Howling Stones&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The Halls of Betrayal (Chardok B)&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- We believe we have corrected the problem with the excessive server lag that has been happening in most raid zones. A guild from one of our live servers was willing to come over to our test server and verify the raid in pofire was working properly without causing the zone to lag out. They were able to complete many of the stages of the raid successfully and even multiple times without issue. There was one instance of a mob warping after getting in a bad location, but we have made vast improvements from its current state. We have also improved our logging code to better detect similar problems should they occur again in the future. Please let us know if you experience any problems related to this.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- There are 2 new keyboard shortcuts in the Command section in the Options menu, Open Inventory Bags and Close Inventory Bags. Setting these, then using them will open/close all your general inventory slot bags (bag1-bag8).&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Added a teleportation stone to Arena in Plane of Knowledge.*&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;*** Re-envisioning Specifics ***&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Many modifications have been made to the cast times, recast times, mana costs, and damage potential of many single target direct damage spells. The largest changes have been in level 1-50 spells, but many 50+ spells have been adjusted as well. These changes have caused the damage-per-second potential and/or the damage-per-mana values of these spells to be increased and should benefit the classes who use these spells in nearly all cases. Note that this also includes special purpose spells such as undead and summoned direct damage spells. Please check the in game descriptions for specific changes.*&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- The 750 cap on mana increase spells has been removed.*&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- The hard-coded level 52 NPC cap on Fear spells has been removed. We will be adding new fear spells in the near future which will allow players to fear higher level NPCs.*&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Assassin’s Feint will now work on NPCs level 60 and higher.*&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Spells with poison counters no longer have innate agro added. The spells themselves still generate aggro based on their other properities, but you will see a reduction in the amount of aggro generated in many cases.*&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- NPC’s innate 20% resistance against rain spells has been removed.*&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- You will now receive messages in your chat window when you are healed by any heal-over-time spell. This includes both short term HOT spells as well as long term regen spells. You will receive the message if the spell actually gave you health back, so will not receive messages when at full health. These messages can be turned off through a new filter in the options window.*&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Ranger, Beastlord, and Paladin heals have been upgraded. See the spell descriptions in game for details.*&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- The AC cap and percentage return on AC over the cap for monks has been increased.*&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Increased the knock back effect on the Warrior AA Press the Attack.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Theft of Thought will no longer return only partial mana from NPCs over level 52. In addition, the spell was changed so that it will only return as much mana as the NPC has if that is less than the amount that the spell is trying to steal. So it will steal 400 mana from an NPC that has 1000 mana, but it will only steal 100 mana from a NPC that has 100 mana.*&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;*** Spells, Skills &amp;amp; AAs ***&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Increased the effectiveness and decreased the casting time of the Ranger AA Auspice of the Hunter.*&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Increased the amount of damage absorbed by the Bard AA Shield of Notes.*&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Increased the damage done while using the Bard AA Dance of Blades.*&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Added a negative resistance mod to the Shaman AA Virulent Paralysis so it is more likely to land on NPCs now.*&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Modified the proc chance on spell Lightning Channeling and Storm Channeling. Both of these spells now have an increased proc chance.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Sound of Divinity and Sound of Might will now use their own separate shared spell timer.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- The spell enhanced learning can no longer have its duration increased by Alternate advancement skills and/or focus effects.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Flames of the Valiant and Flames of Redemption should now proc more often and be resisted much less often.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Protection of the Wild should no longer be overwritten by Strength of the Hunter.*&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Added a 30 second recast time to spirit of the panther and spirit of the leopard. Additionally, the rate at which pets trigger the effect of these spells has been lowered to match the rate at which players trigger effects.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Removed the focus effect limiters from Persuasive Gaze, the focus effect found on the enchanter epic 1.5. It now works on any detrimental spells up to level 70 the same way the focus effect on the enchanter epic 2.0 does.* &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Fixed a problem with focus effects that reduce hate. It was not using the highest effect if more than one focus effect was worn.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;*** Items ***&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Items that have a combat or clickable spell effect that was changed due to the spell changes in this patch have either had their proc rate adjusted to compensate or use a new spell to maintain their damage potential.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- The Anguish chest pieces now have additional worn mods and a new spell focus effect.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- The Anguish wrist pieces now have additional worn mods.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Mirrored Mask will no longer conflict with other recast timer based items such as the Soul Orb.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Hammer of Rancorous Thoughts is now a 39/25 weapon with a 225pt proc.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Dragonkiller is now a 34 (+2 magic)/21 weapon.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Mace of Grim Tidings is a 32/22 weapon.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Broken Mandible of the Broodqueen is now a 12/18 weapon and has a +5% mod to backstab.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Fang of Kessdona now has +12% mod to backstab.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Crescent Palemoon now has the focus Aneuk Glare. It also has +15 avoid, +4 spell rune and +4 regen.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Aegis of the Amber Moon now has +3 shielding, +4 dot rune, +6 regen.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Bladewhisper Chain Gloves of Journeys now has Cleave V as the worn effect.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Bladewhisper Chain Legguards of Journeys now has the focus of Alacrity of the Ikaav.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Summoned: Burning Shank should proc more often.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Eye of Yar`Lir is now called "Oculus of Yar`Lir".&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Bracelet of the Corrupter now has +2 mana regen.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Wristband of Spectral Corruption now has +2 mana regen and +20 attack.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Bracer of Corrupted Souls now has +2 mana regen and +20 attack.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Bracer of the Debauched now has +2 mana regen and +20 attack.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;*** Missions, Quests &amp;amp; Events ***&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Added the following new Dragons of Norrath missions&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;House of the Autumn Rose (Norrath's Keepers Only)&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Plunder the Hoard (Dark Reign Only)&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;A Goblin's Escort&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Halfling's Treasure Map&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Signal Fires&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Sudden Tremors&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;These will show up on the usual mission givers once you have enough faction. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Modified the shards awarded for many of the Dragons of Norrath missions to better reflect how long they are taking to complete.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Changed the adventure "The Gilded Scroll" to fix some situations that could cause players to be unable to finish the mission. Now the Noble Kirin Scholar will not spawn before the real scroll is found. We also fixed a problem that could, in very rare cases, cause the real scroll not to be placed on an NPC.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- The corrupted drake adds in the Vishimtar encounter will now respawn correctly after a failure.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Made a change to Burning Woods that should reduce the number of NPCs that get stuck under the world . This should make the hornets easier to find.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Changes were made to all Muramite Proving Ground trials. The major changes are: Adaptation is slightly easier, the trial of Ingenuity was significantly changed, and NPC resists in all single group trials were lowered.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- In the Citadel of Anguish it's no longer possible to fight Arch Mage Vangl without completing the Keldovan, Jelvan, and Hanvar events first.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- The Warden Hanvar encounter has been made more challenging; you may wish to bring some extra allies with you. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Beware, if you are too close to a wall the swarm adds in the Mata Muram encounter will spawn directly on top of you. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;– Increased the drop rate for the Tongue of the Zun’muram off Zun’Murum Tkarish Zyk in Txevu. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Changed the quest that gives alternative access to Txevu. When you hail the golem at the end of Inktu`ta it will check your items and flags and do the following:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;If you do not yet have a Qvic flag, the golem will give you the Splinter of the High Temple.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;If you do have a Qvic flag, the golem will give you whichever High Temple pieces you are missing.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;If you already have a Txevu flag, the Cipher of Txevu item, or all three fragments of the High Temple, the golem will ignore you.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Likewise, when you complete the Qvic backflag, if you have the Splinter of the High Temple from completing Inktu`ta you will automatically receive whichever High Temple pieces you are missing.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;This change allows the combination of Inktu`ta and the Qvic backflag quest to count for Txevu access and the two can be completed in any order. This change is not retroactive.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- A bug was fixed so that Alkron Wyrmsong will no longer give bards a cloth cap when an error is made during the quest for Epic 2.0&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;*** NPCs ***&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Modified King Xorbb in Beholder. He will now drop Slime Crystal Staff 100% of the time.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Players can no longer attempt to give stacks of items to NPCs. The NPC would treat the stack as one item and you would lose the rest. There is now a check to help with people putting in a stack of items and losing them.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Items given to an NPC by a PC will no longer count as a Task item when looted.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- NPC pathing code has been reviewed and some changes have been made which should prevent NPCs from becoming stuck and eventually becoming invisible. Please let us know if you see this happen any more. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- The Cube Fragments in the Gates of Discord Sewer trials will no longer get stuck in the geometry.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- The Soulbinder at the Firiona Vie outpost is now able to bind you to that area.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;*** Tradeskills ***&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;We have changed the chance to gain a skill up when using tradeskills. Previously there was a large increase in the average number of combines needed for a skill increase for skill values of 160 through 190. This made sense when 200 was the skill cap. We have changed the algorithm to remove the harsh spike in combines required for skill ups from 160 to 190, making it a more reasonable to increase all the way up to 300. For more details please see the post here: http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Trade&amp;amp;message.id=5800&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Alabaster Beak and Ivory Stormrider Canine are now marked as usable in tradeskills.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Dragons of Norrath brewing items now drop off NPCs. They were only available through foraging before.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Added the race name to the Unfired Cookie Cutters. New item names are: Unfired Barbarian Cookie Cutter, Unfired Gnome Cookie Cutter, Unfired Troll Cookie Cutter and Unfired Animal Cookie Cutter.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Added the recipes for four cookie cutters for Luclin beasties. The sketches and molds should be easily found on vendors.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Added the appropriate effects to Dragons of Norrath potions.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- The recipe for dough made from Rock Hopper Egg now uses Rockhopper Egg. It turns out that there were two items with similar names, but the one used in the recipe doesn't drop in game.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Removed the recipe for chain jointing that was used in Planes of Power armor. This recipe was removed because the jointing is no longer used in any recipes.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- You will now only need to collect half the number of items for the level 65+ Vah Shir racial armor pattern book quest.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;*** Server stability ***&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- The memory leak problems that have recently been affecting the world servers has had much progress. Several memory leaks related to the previous update have been corrected, and server stability has improved measurably as a result. We will continue to monitor the servers closely for memory leak issues.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Crashes related to interactive objects in LDoN adventures have been fixed.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Crashes related to interactive objects in LDoN adventures have been fixed.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- A zone crash in Chardokb related to the Korucust encounter has been fixed.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- A zone crash related to guild tribute being toggled while a player was being charmed or feared has been fixed.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;*** Chat filtering ***&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Pet responses to commands (except for /pet leader) are no longer broadcast, but go only to the owner of the pet.*&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Pet responses to commands can now have a selected color and be redirected to any chat window.*&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Pet spell-casting messages can now have a selected color, be redirected to any chat window, and be filtered to not show at all.*&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Assassinate, Deadly Strike, Slay Undead, and Finishing Blow messages will now be displayed in the Melee Critical message color and redirect/filter as other crits.*&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;*** Mail System ***&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- You now have quick access to all of your character mailboxes on the current server from any of your characters.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;*** Title Suffixes ***&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- The title system now supports title suffixes. The first use of this new feature are the server titles.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;*** Guild Hall (Guilds) ***&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Added a guild tribute master to the guild hall.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- The guild bank no longer accepts NORENT items.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Fixed a bug that allowed players with out the proper flags to remove items from the Guild bank.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Using any Eye of Zomm type spells in a guild hall will no longer take the client to server select.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;*** Bazaar/Barter ***&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Added and Augment pool and Augment Solvent Merchant in the Bazaar.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Added new search criteria to the Bazaar search: min level, max level. Any items which match all other search criteria, yet have a rec or req level outside the boundaries set in the new fields will not be returned by the search.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- The barter UI code has been improved. There were some issues related to keeping the client properly synchronized with the server which have been fixed. It now more accurately tracks changes in inventory when multiple players are interacting with a buyer. Also, if a buyer has a LORE item, any buy-lines that require the LORE item will now automatically disable because the buyer would not be able to complete the transaction (because it would result in two lore items on the buyer). Previously this was causing a client-server sync issue that would result in a player being disconnected.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Barter Search Window: Right-clicking on the item sought by Buyers found in a search will display that item. You now have to right click on the Buyer's name to get the search path.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;*** UI ***&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Fixed an issue causing custom UIs to show bad data in unused buff slots. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- The Task display now properly displays tasks with a large number of elements.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- On character select, if you want to go back into the tutorial, just click the tutorial button below the list of characters. It is no longer a toggle button.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;*** Miscellaneous ***&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Increased the maximum level range spread for LDoN adventures from 7 to 10 so you can now group with someone 10 levels above or below you.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Critical heals now produce a message similar to other spells that crit.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Fixed corpse looting bugs for corpses that have been summoned or moved out of dynamic zones.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Closing multiple bags while using the bank no longer causes the client to crash.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- The raid locking system had various bugs which are now fixed. Please let us know if you encounter any problems with the raid tool.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;* Denotes a community request.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;</description>

The information includes a host of new features, changes, and bug fixes.&amp;nbsp; We have not updated you in a few weeks so here it is.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The patcher and login news screens have been updated with this information as well.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;- New zone art for the character select screen and character creation. Crossing the bridge while in Explore mode will allow you to enter the world. Note that all characters are in the same area now. There are no longer class specific areas.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- New Hot Spots!&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Estate of Unrest&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Solusek's Eye&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Kurn's Tower&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The Warrens&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Netherbian Lair&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Echo Caverns&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The Scarlet Desert&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The Tower of Frozen Shadow&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The Hole&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The Grey&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Howling Stones&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The Halls of Betrayal (Chardok B)&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- We believe we have corrected the problem with the excessive server lag that has been happening in most raid zones. A guild from one of our live servers was willing to come over to our test server and verify the raid in pofire was working properly without causing the zone to lag out.

We have also improved our logging code to better detect similar problems should they occur again in the future. Please let us know if you experience any problems related to this.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- There are 2 new keyboard shortcuts in the Command section in the Options menu, Open Inventory Bags and Close Inventory Bags. Setting these, then using them will open/close all your general inventory slot bags (bag1-bag8).&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Added a teleportation stone to Arena in Plane of Knowledge.*&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;*** Re-envisioning Specifics ***&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Many modifications have been made to the cast times, recast times, mana costs, and damage potential of many single target direct damage spells. The largest changes have been in level 1-50 spells, but many 50+ spells have been adjusted as well.

&lt;P&gt;- The 750 cap on mana increase spells has been removed.*&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- The hard-coded level 52 NPC cap on Fear spells has been removed. We will be adding new fear spells in the near future which will allow players to fear higher level NPCs.*&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Assassin’s Feint will now work on NPCs level 60 and higher.*&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Spells with poison counters no longer have innate agro added. The spells themselves still generate aggro based on their other properities, but you will see a reduction in the amount of aggro generated in many cases.*&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- NPC’s innate 20% resistance against rain spells has been removed.*&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- You will now receive messages in your chat window when you are healed by any heal-over-time spell. This includes both short term HOT spells as well as long term regen spells. You will receive the message if the spell actually gave you health back, so will not receive messages when at full health. These messages can be turned off through a new filter in the options window.*&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Ranger, Beastlord, and Paladin heals have been upgraded. See the spell descriptions in game for details.*&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- The AC cap and percentage return on AC over the cap for monks has been increased.*&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Increased the knock back effect on the Warrior AA Press the Attack.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Theft of Thought will no longer return only partial mana from NPCs over level 52. In addition, the spell was changed so that it will only return as much mana as the NPC has if that is less than the amount that the spell is trying to steal. So it will steal 400 mana from an NPC that has 1000 mana, but it will only steal 100 mana from a NPC that has 100 mana.*&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;*** Spells, Skills &amp;amp; AAs ***&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Increased the effectiveness and decreased the casting time of the Ranger AA Auspice of the Hunter.*&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Increased the amount of damage absorbed by the Bard AA Shield of Notes.*&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Increased the damage done while using the Bard AA Dance of Blades.*&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Added a negative resistance mod to the Shaman AA Virulent Paralysis so it is more likely to land on NPCs now.*&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Modified the proc chance on spell Lightning Channeling and Storm Channeling. Both of these spells now have an increased proc chance.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Sound of Divinity and Sound of Might will now use their own separate shared spell timer.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- The spell enhanced learning can no longer have its duration increased by Alternate advancement skills and/or focus effects.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Flames of the Valiant and Flames of Redemption should now proc more often and be resisted much less often.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Protection of the Wild should no longer be overwritten by Strength of the Hunter.*&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Added a 30 second recast time to spirit of the panther and spirit of the leopard. Additionally, the rate at which pets trigger the effect of these spells has been lowered to match the rate at which players trigger effects.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Removed the focus effect limiters from Persuasive Gaze, the focus effect found on the enchanter epic 1.5. It now works on any detrimental spells up to level 70 the same way the focus effect on the enchanter epic 2.0 does.* &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Fixed a problem with focus effects that reduce hate. It was not using the highest effect if more than one focus effect was worn.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;*** Items ***&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Items that have a combat or clickable spell effect that was changed due to the spell changes in this patch have either had their proc rate adjusted to compensate or use a new spell to maintain their damage potential.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- The Anguish chest pieces now have additional worn mods and a new spell focus effect.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- The Anguish wrist pieces now have additional worn mods.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Mirrored Mask will no longer conflict with other recast timer based items such as the Soul Orb.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Hammer of Rancorous Thoughts is now a 39/25 weapon with a 225pt proc.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Dragonkiller is now a 34 (+2 magic)/21 weapon.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Mace of Grim Tidings is a 32/22 weapon.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Broken Mandible of the Broodqueen is now a 12/18 weapon and has a +5% mod to backstab.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Fang of Kessdona now has +12% mod to backstab.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Crescent Palemoon now has the focus Aneuk Glare. It also has +15 avoid, +4 spell rune and +4 regen.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Aegis of the Amber Moon now has +3 shielding, +4 dot rune, +6 regen.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Bladewhisper Chain Gloves of Journeys now has Cleave V as the worn effect.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Bladewhisper Chain Legguards of Journeys now has the focus of Alacrity of the Ikaav.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Summoned: Burning Shank should proc more often.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Eye of Yar`Lir is now called "Oculus of Yar`Lir".&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Bracelet of the Corrupter now has +2 mana regen.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Wristband of Spectral Corruption now has +2 mana regen and +20 attack.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Bracer of Corrupted Souls now has +2 mana regen and +20 attack.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Bracer of the Debauched now has +2 mana regen and +20 attack.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;*** Missions, Quests &amp;amp; Events ***&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Added the following new Dragons of Norrath missions&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;House of the Autumn Rose (Norrath's Keepers Only)&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Plunder the Hoard (Dark Reign Only)&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;A Goblin's Escort&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Halfling's Treasure Map&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Signal Fires&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Sudden Tremors&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;These will show up on the usual mission givers once you have enough faction. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Modified the shards awarded for many of the Dragons of Norrath missions to better reflect how long they are taking to complete.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Changed the adventure "The Gilded Scroll" to fix some situations that could cause players to be unable to finish the mission. Now the Noble Kirin Scholar will not spawn before the real scroll is found. We also fixed a problem that could, in very rare cases, cause the real scroll not to be placed on an NPC.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- The corrupted drake adds in the Vishimtar encounter will now respawn correctly after a failure.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Made a change to Burning Woods that should reduce the number of NPCs that get stuck under the world . This should make the hornets easier to find.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Changes were made to all Muramite Proving Ground trials. The major changes are: Adaptation is slightly easier, the trial of Ingenuity was significantly changed, and NPC resists in all single group trials were lowered.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- In the Citadel of Anguish it's no longer possible to fight Arch Mage Vangl without completing the Keldovan, Jelvan, and Hanvar events first.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- The Warden Hanvar encounter has been made more challenging; you may wish to bring some extra allies with you. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Beware, if you are too close to a wall the swarm adds in the Mata Muram encounter will spawn directly on top of you. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;– Increased the drop rate for the Tongue of the Zun’muram off Zun’Murum Tkarish Zyk in Txevu. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Changed the quest that gives alternative access to Txevu. When you hail the golem at the end of Inktu`ta it will check your items and flags and do the following:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;If you do not yet have a Qvic flag, the golem will give you the Splinter of the High Temple.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;If you do have a Qvic flag, the golem will give you whichever High Temple pieces you are missing.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;If you already have a Txevu flag, the Cipher of Txevu item, or all three fragments of the High Temple, the golem will ignore you.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Likewise, when you complete the Qvic backflag, if you have the Splinter of the High Temple from completing Inktu`ta you will automatically receive whichever High Temple pieces you are missing.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;This change allows the combination of Inktu`ta and the Qvic backflag quest to count for Txevu access and the two can be completed in any order. This change is not retroactive.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- A bug was fixed so that Alkron Wyrmsong will no longer give bards a cloth cap when an error is made during the quest for Epic 2.0&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;*** NPCs ***&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Modified King Xorbb in Beholder. He will now drop Slime Crystal Staff 100% of the time.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Players can no longer attempt to give stacks of items to NPCs. The NPC would treat the stack as one item and you would lose the rest. There is now a check to help with people putting in a stack of items and losing them.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Items given to an NPC by a PC will no longer count as a Task item when looted.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- NPC pathing code has been reviewed and some changes have been made which should prevent NPCs from becoming stuck and eventually becoming invisible. Please let us know if you see this happen any more. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- The Cube Fragments in the Gates of Discord Sewer trials will no longer get stuck in the geometry.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- The Soulbinder at the Firiona Vie outpost is now able to bind you to that area.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;*** Tradeskills ***&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;We have changed the chance to gain a skill up when using tradeskills. Previously there was a large increase in the average number of combines needed for a skill increase for skill values of 160 through 190. This made sense when 200 was the skill cap. We have changed the algorithm to remove the harsh spike in combines required for skill ups from 160 to 190, making it a more reasonable to increase all the way up to 300. For more details please see the post here: http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Trade&amp;amp;message.id=5800&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Alabaster Beak and Ivory Stormrider Canine are now marked as usable in tradeskills.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Dragons of Norrath brewing items now drop off NPCs. They were only available through foraging before.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Added the race name to the Unfired Cookie Cutters. New item names are: Unfired Barbarian Cookie Cutter, Unfired Gnome Cookie Cutter, Unfired Troll Cookie Cutter and Unfired Animal Cookie Cutter.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Added the recipes for four cookie cutters for Luclin beasties. The sketches and molds should be easily found on vendors.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Added the appropriate effects to Dragons of Norrath potions.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- The recipe for dough made from Rock Hopper Egg now uses Rockhopper Egg. It turns out that there were two items with similar names, but the one used in the recipe doesn't drop in game.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Removed the recipe for chain jointing that was used in Planes of Power armor. This recipe was removed because the jointing is no longer used in any recipes.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- You will now only need to collect half the number of items for the level 65+ Vah Shir racial armor pattern book quest.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;*** Server stability ***&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- The memory leak problems that have recently been affecting the world servers has had much progress. Several memory leaks related to the previous update have been corrected, and server stability has improved measurably as a result. We will continue to monitor the servers closely for memory leak issues.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Crashes related to interactive objects in LDoN adventures have been fixed.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Crashes related to interactive objects in LDoN adventures have been fixed.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- A zone crash in Chardokb related to the Korucust encounter has been fixed.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- A zone crash related to guild tribute being toggled while a player was being charmed or feared has been fixed.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;*** Chat filtering ***&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Pet responses to commands (except for /pet leader) are no longer broadcast, but go only to the owner of the pet.*&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Pet responses to commands can now have a selected color and be redirected to any chat window.*&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Pet spell-casting messages can now have a selected color, be redirected to any chat window, and be filtered to not show at all.*&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Assassinate, Deadly Strike, Slay Undead, and Finishing Blow messages will now be displayed in the Melee Critical message color and redirect/filter as other crits.*&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;*** Mail System ***&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- You now have quick access to all of your character mailboxes on the current server from any of your characters.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;*** Title Suffixes ***&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- The title system now supports title suffixes. The first use of this new feature are the server titles.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;*** Guild Hall (Guilds) ***&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Added a guild tribute master to the guild hall.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- The guild bank no longer accepts NORENT items.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Fixed a bug that allowed players with out the proper flags to remove items from the Guild bank.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Using any Eye of Zomm type spells in a guild hall will no longer take the client to server select.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;*** Bazaar/Barter ***&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Added and Augment pool and Augment Solvent Merchant in the Bazaar.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Added new search criteria to the Bazaar search: min level, max level. Any items which match all other search criteria, yet have a rec or req level outside the boundaries set in the new fields will not be returned by the search.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- The barter UI code has been improved. There were some issues related to keeping the client properly synchronized with the server which have been fixed. It now more accurately tracks changes in inventory when multiple players are interacting with a buyer. Also, if a buyer has a LORE item, any buy-lines that require the LORE item will now automatically disable because the buyer would not be able to complete the transaction (because it would result in two lore items on the buyer). Previously this was causing a client-server sync issue that would result in a player being disconnected.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Barter Search Window: Right-clicking on the item sought by Buyers found in a search will display that item. You now have to right click on the Buyer's name to get the search path.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;*** UI ***&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Fixed an issue causing custom UIs to show bad data in unused buff slots. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- The Task display now properly displays tasks with a large number of elements.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- On character select, if you want to go back into the tutorial, just click the tutorial button below the list of characters. It is no longer a toggle button.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;*** Miscellaneous ***&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Increased the maximum level range spread for LDoN adventures from 7 to 10 so you can now group with someone 10 levels above or below you.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Critical heals now produce a message similar to other spells that crit.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Fixed corpse looting bugs for corpses that have been summoned or moved out of dynamic zones.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Closing multiple bags while using the bank no longer causes the client to crash.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- The raid locking system had various bugs which are now fixed. Please let us know if you encounter any problems with the raid tool.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;* Denotes a community request.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Shaman since the birth of the class, and not at all happy with the change.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The spell was fine, yes on pets it was a little strong, but I really don't care what a warrior or a cleric or an enchanter has to say about my spells they don't have to live with them. You think Shamans have such great buffs? Yes I agree while I sit LFG in Lava storm and player after player says can I get this or that buff and none of them say want to group.....&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;How about I put a 6 month delay on my accouint payment you think thats gonna fly? I personally think Sony is making way too much money off me. Unfortunately I can't delete spells above level 50 from my book cuase that just what will happen when they add a 30 second recast to these spells I will want to delete them and start lying to strangers telling them I don't have the spell as its usefullness will be completely gone.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Sombody said shamans are supposed to be behind the pack on DPS... WHAT A HUGE LOAD OF HORSE CRAP. Who wrote this rule? cuase I have never read it, classes are supposed to be balanced.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I aint gonna bother asking them not to put in the delay cuase as I said I have been a shaman since the birth of the class and I am pretty much used to them doing whatever they want to regardless of what we ask for, I will however share the fact that I am not happy about it at all. As a shaman I have gotten used to learning how to play my class, just when I figure out what I do best, they change it again, thank god I do a wide variety of things, and it allows me to change and adapt so much, quite frankly though I am truethfully starting to&amp;nbsp;wonder if the frustration of changing everything I start to like is worth the monthly fee.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I can tell you this much, if they started being more liberal with that recast delay there would be a whole lot less customers, I am convinced they don't want shamans in the game, its only us few die hards that wont go away keeping the class alive.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>Ok my main is a ranger but I have an alt that is a shaman.  The lepoard/panther line of spell was great for them. I would get friends that wanted me to bring my shaman because of this spell.  With the nerf of this spell and every dang class being able to slow where does that leave shamans.  It basic leaves them to sit lfg and if no other class is lfg then they will grab the shaman. Or they get to sit in zone while people ask if they can get buffs for their group.  The pet proc was to much that is fine fixed the problem.  But with the shaman class in general shrinking because peps are playing other classes (beast) why totally kill something that made people want to play the class again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ok time to kill the shaman and play the week dps of a ranger.</description>

      <description>Dear SOE,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please don't nerf shamans.  This is a great spell and already has the penalty of the high mana cost, adding this recast timer of 30 seconds is going to make groups not want us anymore again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You are already screwing SWG over and are about to loose 70% more customers on the CU update there.  Making these type of changes in EQ too will just cause you to loose more customers in this game also.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please just stop trying to tick off your customers since we pay you to play and not the other way around.  If I want this type of treatment I will talk to my wife or my boss.  At least with you I can cancle my 9 accounts and whipe my feet of you.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Sony get a clue to game creation and a thing called fun.&amp;nbsp; I have come to the conclusion&amp;nbsp;what the&amp;nbsp;EQ dev team does best is NERF and screw up what was once good. Shaman are not needed in groups and most can get along just fine without our buffs.&amp;nbsp; A Beast Lord or Chanter are more desirable in most groups. In high level areas the mobs are dead before our slow casteing long refresh dot spells are even casted. Our slows are resisted far to often and&amp;nbsp;casting malo and slows&amp;nbsp;makes doing anything more stupid. Game play should be more than being stuck in the same boreing regiment at every event in every group. Boreing malo then slow "if it sticks" and "if you live after" makes for boreing routines and playes leave the game. With the new changes being made to panther and leopard these spells will go to the crap spells&amp;nbsp;list in my spell book and never used again like FA and most high resisted disease dots.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;The one big thing about the panther nerf that still makes no sense to me is people complaining about the shaman doing to much dps... The shaman, the supposedly best buffing class (in soes description of a shaman) is buffing OTHER classes to do more dps.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Once&amp;nbsp;they fixed the pet procs then the shaman themselves could only add a max of&amp;nbsp;200 dps + there own melee and pets melee. (assuming they cast on themselves and their pets.) Probably less as they have to stop meleeing to cast the spell again, to slow, to debuff, etc... This certainly isn't any massive form of shaman dps - I can do more than that with 2 dots and some nukes.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Now, yes it adds a lot of dps to groups and raids when cast on others but the shaman is not doing that dps - they are BUFFING (definitely in the shaman class role) others to do the damage. So apparently its ok for us to have a hp buff, an avoidance/dodge buff, etc... all kinds of buffs but its out of line for a shaman to have a damage buff? Avatar and might are supposedly damage buffs -panthers just the newest most powerful damage buff. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;What folks are really mad about is that shaman finally got a buff that makes a noticeable difference and they are envious/angry about it. In time I was sure other buffing classes (like enchies) were going to have similar damage buffs added to their lines. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;They did balance the utility of this buff by making it very high mana cost for your typical shaman - maintainable of maybe 2 or 3 people max for an average shaman. The problem I guess is that 1 or 2% of the games shaman have exceptional gear/AA and can as a result hit far more people than your average shaman over a short period of time. This is, I admit, probably unbalanced for short fights (longer fights like say RC or xegony they will be oom and useless to quickly if they employ this strategy). While its nice to be able to burn your mana buffing the raid to do more dps I can see this as an issue for older fights not designed with this in mind.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;______________________________________________________________________&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Bottom line is:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I support making it group only - that prevents the top 1-2% from overly abusing this spell on raids. The increase in damage due to the raid being buffed to deliver it will scale by number of shaman spread about the raid in groups. (makes good sense)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I reluctantly can see the need for the pet fixes otherwise groups with shaman + pet classes will far outdamage other balanced groups... pets proccing almost 2 and a half times as much as PCs is wrong. I do like the idea of pets proccing a *slight* bit more than PCs to make it worth bringing out my dog but not 2 and a half times as much. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The change i do not&amp;nbsp;understand though is to reduce the proc... the first two changes will already scale back the buffing potential and damage delivered by the buff on pets. Why not give that a test run, parse some numbers and see how that works out? If its clearly overpowered still fine reduce it then. but three nerfs all at once seems a bit of an overcorrect for the first step of what you call 'retuning the spell.' Isn't the idea of retuning to adjust some, test, adjust some more if needed, test, repeat until right... In this case I guess retuning means nerf it into oblivion and see what happens... oh and extend the nerfed line down through the levels into a full spell line so all shaman can have extra spells in the back of their books they only situationally use. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;____________________________________________________________________&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Conclusion: The spell line was released in a too powerful form but rather than correct this carefully with&amp;nbsp;a few tweeks here and there&amp;nbsp;it has gone from the most useful shaman buff to a mediocore, situational at best buff... I just hope soe doesn't think this line of spells in its new form&amp;nbsp;constitutes any sort of 'reinvisioning' for the class. I suppose if a mob has super high resists and i happen to group with 4+ melees I might bring this out of the back of my spellbook. *shrug*&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face="Comic Sans MS"&gt;Makes me sad to see guildbank no longer accept no rent items :smileysad: specially for pet toys ... I'd much rather see pet toys go to 1x use only (no longer drop back from DCed or otherwise charmed mobs) and be able to be put in guildbank than be no rent and not be able to be put in guildbank. And on a note .. what will happen to the no rent items currently in guildbank? I mean, will they be removed or just not be able to replaced once taken out? Oh and yes .. please .. consider expanding the guildbank past 200 slots .. my guild is rather small compared to other guilds that raid and such and out guildbank is full most of the time.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face="Comic Sans MS"&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face="Comic Sans MS"&gt;Also ... Theft of Thought change .. so this means I can no longer use theft of thought on mobs in OOW that actually don't have any mana, but so far&amp;nbsp;I was able to use theft of thought on them anyways .. does that mean that Necro's will have Mind Wrack nerved as well? I mean .. fair is fair right? In all honestly I'd rather they leave ToT the way it is unless they intend to nerf all mana theft spells to the extend that they only return as much mana as the mob has. But I am sure it will go unheard once more.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face="Comic Sans MS"&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face="Comic Sans MS"&gt;As for all the Shamies whining ... yes you got *beep* ... join the club ... we meet on fridays. Seriously though... yea it stinks, it really does, but you are not the first class to go through such radical changes and you won't be the last. The spell rocked while it lasted, was able to duo real well with just a shamy + pet and me (enchanter - yea I bet you knew) + pet for actual exp. I am sure there would be a better solution than to nerf it multiple ways .. there were some pretty good suggestions here in some of the posts and they should really be considered on the grounds of .. you'd make more people happy .. even those that want the spell to be nerfed.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face="Comic Sans MS"&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face="Comic Sans MS"&gt;About the pet messages being only shown to the pet owner .. I agree with a previous poster who said that they are opposed to this... I am pulling a lot of the time and I do like to have my group members see me calling my pet off the mob that gives them a certain indication for mob positioning, as I wont let my pet stay on the mob until said mob is where I want to be. So .. make it filterable .. have the option to turn them off .. like you can turn off other people's crits ..&amp;nbsp;makes more sense don't you think?&amp;nbsp;As for displaying status next to pet name ... I'd vote for that if you'd give Chanters 'Pet Hold' abilities&amp;nbsp;:smileywink: now that would be nifty. But before that would actually really be desired by the chanter community there are tons of other issues that would need addressing.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face="Comic Sans MS"&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face="Comic Sans MS"&gt;On&amp;nbsp;a positive note.. some of the changes coming up are good .. of course they don't stay in mind as much as the bad ones so I am unable to mention them right now without going back to read the first post. And I know there was more bad things, but I am just one person, I can only complain so much at a time &amp;gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face="Comic Sans MS"&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;OK just thought of a new spell format for sony. Why not give us a mob summon spell ?.&amp;nbsp; Heck if the mobs can summon us it's only fair play to give us the abality to bring back a runaway mob.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>Once again I repeat The spirit of the panther line of spells is getting nerfed because it is allowing a non-DPS class to do damage that is comparable to the true DPS classes.  If you feel it's just shamans getting singled out your wrong enchanters are also getting nerfed with this upcomming patch.  Charm is getting nerfed AGAIN and for the same purpose panther is getting nerfed.  It allows the enchanters to add DPS that is comparable to true-DPS classes.  In total there are 9 DPS classes and that is probabally more than there should be already by allowing the non-dps classes to make the already under desired and over abundant DPS classes even less desirable you are creating a serious in-game balance problem.  Certainally shamans will probabally become less desired than they are now but they will still be more desired than a magician or a berserker.  I think the real problem of the game is that there are classes that are over desireable in groups such as clerics and warriors.  There really should be some changes made so that all classes are more or less and equal desirability to other classes that fill the same role.  In short a druid should be as desirable as a cleric.  Paladins and shadow knights should be as desirable as warriors.  Berserkers should be as desirable as wizards or rogues.  All classes should be made similarly desirable as other classes but it should be done while keeping all classes unique.  So I do not want to see this being accomplished in the "EverQuest 2" way.  I would like to see it done in a more original way.  Yes I know that class balance and desirability is hard to work but I do believe that more can be done than is being done.  No class should feel worthless or undesirable.  No class should be over desirable and "the best".</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I'm gonna piss off alot of shaman on this one.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;When these spells were first released they were listed as a pet proc. They never said anything about pc's being able to use the spell. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;My suggestion is leave the spell the way it is now on pets (insane proccing power), but make it pet only. This way we can be dps gods when we want, we arent wasting the mana on the group because dog dog procs as much as if you kept it on 3 other group members. Change the recast to 1 min, so you cant have pet abuse, putting it on all 6 of your aa pet =).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;This would make me extremely happy.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Now for reality,&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I used this spell on my pet durring a vt raid last week. My dog procc'd it 823 time up to blob1. That is good for 452k worth of damage, add in his 56k he did melee for a grand total of 506k. The qvic geared wizzard did 565k and he started parcing 10 mobs before me. My dog averaged 16 procs per normal mob, which would have given him 160 more procs if I counted from where the wizard stazrted. That 160 procs= 88k more damage putting my dog at 594k damage--- thus beating the qvic geared wizard.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Panther was overpowered, and everyone knew the nerf was comming. If you actually deleted an account over this. OMG thank you 1 less whiner on the block.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>Concern with the new "copies of old spells for the purposes of procs":&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A proc or a clicky could be focus'd by spell focus items, if it was on your spell list.  Taking a spell and copying it, but removing it from the "spell list", changes the effect.  There are a number of wizard-clickable nuke items for which this applies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You could add them back into the spell lists as 'ghost spells', sort of like "Aura of Quellious" is a ghost L 65 spell for a LDoN clicky item.</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;Please eliminate or increase the cap on worn DS at level 70.&amp;nbsp; The amount of damage shield you could get was appropriate at level 60, perhaps even at 65.&amp;nbsp; But currently it's possible to get a SINGLE ITEM which has a worn DS higher than the cap.&amp;nbsp; And no way to increase the cap, not even through aa's.&amp;nbsp; What this means is that the single item (Tome of New Beginnings aug'd with the 5 ds aug from DoN merchants) doesn't work properly due to hard coded caps in place for which there is no player solution.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I'd propose a two-fold solution for this issue.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;1. Increase the worn damage shield cap across the board for chars over level 65.&amp;nbsp; Let the new worn ds cap be 30 at level 70.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;2. Add some aa's for classes that would allow them to further increase the worn ds cap, similar to the aa's that increase worn flowing thought cap.&amp;nbsp; For example, 5 aa's would increase your worn ds cap an additional 3 points above the 30 at level 70, for a total possible of 45 ds at level 70 if you spent the 25 aa's to increase it.&amp;nbsp; Naturally you'd still have to have the needed gear for this much worn ds.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>Honestly complaining about a change that is currently on "Test" in the forums isn't going to fix anything.  I do personally feel that the 30 second recast timer is a little harsh but I do feel that it is a bit overpowered.  Maybe a 15 recast timer would be a fair compromise?  Far as enchanters outslowing shamans you need to look at the details of the slows.  Shamans and beastlord slows cast twice as fast as enchatners and are harder to resist.  In the current end game enchanters are less desired for mezzing than bards and because charm has been nerfed to oblivion encs are back to being worst DPS in game.  If you think this the end of shamans you should look at the other classes like enchanters, rangers, berserkers, and magicians and tell me that shamans aren't desireable.  I don't know any one who has shaman below 3rd choice for groups.  When I build groups I check lfgs first then move to beastlords, shamans, clerics, then tanks.  Beastlords and shamans might not stack too well together but the extra mana regen helps all around.  With the monks getting unnerfed I suppose I will be looking for monks to fill the tank role again.</description>
