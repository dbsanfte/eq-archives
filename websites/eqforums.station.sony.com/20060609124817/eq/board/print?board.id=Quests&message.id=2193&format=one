				Long involved quests with raids needed get progressively harder to complete as expansions get older. The two biggest ones i can think of are : Breakdown in Communications and Aid Grimel tradeskill quest.<br><br>Breakdown: -- Grand summoner ring (used to be part of progression but now  a standalone target and basicly not raided)<br>           -- Inktu'ta/Txevu are basicly only raided for flagging purposes. The BiC droprate is abysmal compared to the risk/reward issue. Increased droprate/alternative access/drops (maybe rare drop off the Key Tacvi bosses would solve issues)<br>           -- The qinimi group event requires 6 people (u NEED a full group) In current progression this event can be done with less but you still need 6 people IN ZONE to start the event- This can be very annoying as the event is quite easy to beat and quite short. It is rather an inconvenience to drag off a full group<br><br><br>Aid Grimel -- Flagging requirements: With Time being able to be flagged within time thru phase 3 there is less and less need for backflagging the whole pop progression. The same effect on a lower level is achieved with the alternative access quests, Kill God for backflag and level restricted or flagged zones. Basicly the quest looks like dieing out due to flagging which you can;t possibly do with hardly any guilds fully backflagging/flagging. (Maybe tie flags to acces to zone so alternative access quests/entrance flag will automaticly grand you the needed flag for Aid Grimel and/or Time flag flagging you for all phases of aid grimel)<br><br>There are other long involved quests out there but i don;t know which ones of these fall in the same category and might need some tweaking to keep the quests viable/alive
