&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#ffffff size=3&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Dark Devotion &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;is now recruiting...&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#ffffff size=3&gt;Who we are: We are a casual raiding guild on The Combine Server. Most of us are on Pacific Standard Time so raids will be scheduled accordingly. We are a group of mature players who have played MMOs for a long time and are finally returning to where it all began. &lt;STRONG&gt;**Important**: We are a Team Speak Only Guild!&lt;/STRONG&gt; If you don’t have a microphone or are to shy to use it don’t bother applying please. We hardly use guild or raid chat during gameplay and half of the fun for us is chatting with our on-line and real life friends and having a good time. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#ffffff size=3&gt;We will not have a DKP system. We use a modified Loot Council system that will ensure loot is distributed fairly. It has worked extremely well for us in the past and will save members a lot of grief.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#ffffff size=3&gt;What do we mean by “Casual raiding”? We will not be one of the top raiding guilds. I’m going to say that one more time so there is no confusion. We are not going to be one of the top raiding guilds. Most of us have hardcore MMO backgrounds and at some time or another were on the bleeding edge of content (World of Warcraft in my case – top guild and mage on my server for over a year blah blah blah whatever, no one cares). We’re tired of the rat race. This server gives us the unique opportunity to experience the game that started everything for us from the very beginning again. This time we are going to stop and smell the roses. Others can race through the game. We have nothing left to prove and will progress at our own pace. Sure we will do PoP, GoD and all that stuff but all in good time. We’re here for the long run.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#ffffff size=3&gt;Until Kunark we will mostly focus on getting experience groups together and help fellow guild members with quests.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#ffffff size=3&gt;As soon as Kunark opens up our main focus will be on completing epic quests for our members. We believe epics are one of the most fun and challenging events ever implemented and we will try to complete those quests for every single member.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#ffffff size=3&gt;Depending on available content you can expect about 2-3 scheduled raid days per week (usually starting 6pm PST). Of course we will go after targets of opportunity if we have the players to do so. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#ffffff size=3&gt;At this time we are looking for all races/classes. If you are interested please contact us at &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;A href="mailto:benhornig@shaw.ca" target=_blank&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#ffffff size=3&gt;benhornig@shaw.ca&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#ffffff size=3&gt; with your reserved character name, race, class, a little info about yourself and a brief description as to why you would like to join. You will be forwarded our Team Speak Information so we can get things started as soon as the server goes life.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#ffffff size=3&gt;Cheers,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#ffffff size=3&gt;Marroc Skyfire&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
