<DIV>There is not much we can say, not being in the path of Hurricane&nbsp;Katrina and having to face the uncertainty she brings.&nbsp;&nbsp;All we have is&nbsp;the news,&nbsp;brought in from outside and trying to capture&nbsp;this&nbsp;moment as best they can.&nbsp; However, they often forget the people and we know that many people, many of our people, our&nbsp;fans and our friends are&nbsp;there facing nature's wrath.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We offer you our thoughts and prayers as well as all the hope that we can share that this passes leaving little impact on&nbsp;your lives.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>To our friends and gaming family members in New Orleans and the Gulf Coast states; please be safe, take care of yourselves and your families and let us know all is well when you can.</DIV>
