Then the npc merchant can sell the thing higher or distroy the item. This would allow the tradeskiller to recoop some money, make a profit and if someone wants to buy an item their prices would be lower then the npc merchant(assuming the tradeskill item that the npc merchant isn't distoyed) allowing for repeat business. Now the npc merchants can be coded so that you have to be tagged to sell to them it could be tied to someones tradeskill level. For instance if you try and sell that piece banded armor you have to have the skill of say 100 to sell it to the special merchantso not every one could just sell to them.&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Unfortunately, the reality is that there are bots that will make someone millions of plat if we allow any sort of sell back for profit.&amp;nbsp; The only&amp;nbsp;way I see is&amp;nbsp;to only allow a limited number of sells... and at that point, it might as well just be a quest, that is only repeatable once a day/week or some such.&amp;nbsp; Limited sells outside that would be a code change.&amp;nbsp; At this time I have no plans to implement such "tradeskill for profit" quests.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Would you favor for the creation of recipes to make de-evolving items that upon their final stage of evolution went to &lt;b&gt;no rent&lt;/b&gt; status?&lt;br&gt;1) They could have several levels of de-evolution, the first few stages they could be VERY good items.&lt;br&gt;2) Eventually they would lose their useful status, however they could be resold (not made no drop) and useful in another recipe (with the risk of failure to destroy it) to bring their stats back to full power and prolong their use.&lt;br&gt;3) By making tradeskill items that eventually poof or useful to be made whole again, you can get a repeat customer (like the potion vendors).&lt;br&gt;-----&lt;br&gt;Example of an item with 10 Stages of Evolution (De-evolution)&lt;br&gt;As an item is used it gains experience and evolves into a lower state.&lt;br&gt;1st stage is the base.  Item is at it's peak.&lt;br&gt;2nd stage the item has lost some of its lustur. Failure risk of combining to bring it to 1st stage low (low trivial recipe).&lt;br&gt;.&lt;br&gt;.&lt;br&gt;.&lt;br&gt;9th stage the item has lost most of its lustur.  Failure risk of combining to bring it to 1st stage is high (high trivial recipe).&lt;br&gt;10th stage the item has still lost most of its lustur.  The item is now no rent.  Failure risk of combining it to 1st stage is the original difficulty (very high trivial).&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;This just sounds like another thing that would take me away from actually having fun.  I would hate this.  I am thinking of RL things that &amp;quot;decay&amp;quot; and to my mind most things I acquire take years to go bad and cause trouble.  Granted I don't wear armor but I like fantasy to stay fantasy.  Why make things like real life?  Why make it so complicated that people get upset and don't want to play.  I was horrified when friends playing other games told me about this.  I wouldn't want to waste my limited game play time by having to repair a much needed item.  I am sure there are other casual gamers who already don't have time for farming and camping for plat and items and so do not amass copious amounts of plat, and this would just be another way to separate those players from those who have excess amount of time to play.</description>

      <description>I agree with it, but I would like the combines for the items to involve several high level subcombines within the skill (relative to the item) with more common drops/forages. I could never see this working with say Metallic Scales or Drake Bones or Blue Iridescent Troll Teeth as the cost would be out of proportion with the item returned. Now if you spent 2-3K to make an item similar to what you might get from a Monster Mission and it lasted a couple of weeks, that seems fair.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If this kind of tradeskilling were in parallel with items that don't de evolve, it will keep the folks who hate upkeep happy (until they see how nice de evolving items can be or how cheap).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As far as EQ is concerned why not make arrows that are immune to the effect of Endless Quiver? You still have it for most arrows out there, but newer more powerful arrows would be used up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What I really would like is a tradeskill path that uses a tougher standard than RNG to create items of worth, thereby making it easier for EQ to allow worthwhile items.&lt;br&gt;Multiple high level subcombines or some form of skill test(300 range?) means greater numbers of failures, but it the items are not too expensive, it would still be worth it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Flatley Riverdancer</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I would love to see certain combines that could have a 'critical failure' in which not only do you lose the sub items, but you have 'very bad things' happen to you, and or to those in the vacinity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PB AE dd for 2k would be fun, or even a nice 24sec Whirl Till You Hurl proc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course you'd have to flag the combine as only functional outside safe zones where you can't take damage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Heh, how about randomly porting you to some unkeyed zone?  That would be a blast!&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by --------helpme------ on &lt;span class="date_text"&gt;04-18-2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;03:26 PM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

But the current game system just did not allow for it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Well I was thinking, add some ordinarily unagroable mob (to every zone in the game heh).  Give him an unresistable 10,000 range insta proc for 3k dd followed by an insta-self blur, and have him only agroable upon 'critical frailure' of a ts combine just like some npc's are agroed by click events (yxxta riddle for instance).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I mean, if the TS has 2 rolls, 1 to 100, a 1 could be a 'critical failure' even if only on certain items.  That should be suitably infrequent enough to be amusing.  And it doesn't even have to be a nuke, it can be a fun effect like whirl till you hurl, or an fd proc, or a random port to a random zone, or a random spawning of some funny colored flowers on the ground, or a ts result of something completely undesirable.  Oh Norath could discover Wild Magic!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have a dream, toons all over norath that die for no apparent reason to those looking on!&lt;br&gt;Small mushroom cloud effects on critically failed tinkered items optional :)&lt;br&gt;</description>

&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Let me first say, that in no way shape or form do I consider myself a tradeskiller, nor do I ever plan on being one.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;Your comment both excited me and filled me with dread.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;I really don't think a damage to player factor ever needs to be considered for tradeskilling, least-wise I would never consider that "fun". *Maybe* if it never exceeded the threshold similar to the bristlebane pet thingies poison food/drink.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;However, your comment sparked an idea that I can only hope to be considered:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Visual Particle Effects on tradeskill combines.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;Consider the fireworks clickies, or the Priest of Discord port to Dranik's Scar particles... very cool effects.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;I think it would add quite a bit of "fun factor" to tradeskilling if various skills and items had a wide range of particle effects when you combine (success/fails).&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;Of course, this does imply that *someone* has to take the time to make new particle&amp;nbsp;effects and then attach the right skills/items/combine to the right particles.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;Extra work? Yes. Worth it? I think so (from a non-tradeskiller).&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;Obviously this would require code support as well, and no doubt it should have some type of configuration on the display particles options so that people who do not like them or it lags too much can turm them down/off.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I SOOOO wanted the AAAA to explode for say 3k damage... (not enough to be more than an inconvenience for most of the intended audience).&amp;nbsp; But the current game system just did not allow for it.&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Yes! Exploding Gnomes for the win!&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;heheh, sorta like the &lt;A href="http://mboards.eqtraders.com/eq/showthread.php?t=25575" target=_blank&gt;Big Book of Oops stories&lt;/A&gt;....&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>Of course the obvious answer instead of devolving items, (which is a bad idea from the start, if I wanted to play that system I would have been playing WOW and besides who wants to drop 20k on a piece of armor that will eventually decay) is to have npc merchants that will give tradeskillers a small profit for want they make. Then the npc merchant can sell the thing higher or distroy the item. This would allow the tradeskiller to recoop some money, make a profit and if someone wants to buy an item their prices would be lower then the npc merchant(assuming the tradeskill item that the npc merchant isn't distoyed) allowing for repeat business. Now the npc merchants can be coded so that you have to be tagged to sell to them it could be tied to someones tradeskill level. For instance if you try and sell that piece banded armor you have to have the skill of say 100 to sell it to the special merchantso not every one could just sell to them.</description>

&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Unfortunately, the reality is that there are bots that will make someone millions of plat if we allow any sort of sell back for profit.&amp;nbsp; The only&amp;nbsp;way I see is&amp;nbsp;to only allow a limited number of sells... and at that point, it might as well just be a quest, that is only repeatable once a day/week or some such.&amp;nbsp; Limited sells outside that would be a code change.&amp;nbsp; At this time I have no plans to implement such "tradeskill for profit" quests.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I think it is an interesting mechanic that could be used for a few items.  Have 2(ish) states, where the second is a little lower - this could be used as a justification for an item that is a little more powerful as it has an ongoing cost requirement. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Have the tradeskiller make a &amp;quot;whampum&amp;quot;, and the &amp;quot;whampum&amp;quot; is combined with the item in a apropriate tradeskill container to repair it - a toolbox perhaps (mana batteries+invis/shrink devices combines work in this for non-gnomes).  That way the item can be repaired in the field, but tradeskillers combine with it very well. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I personally detest item decay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some applications disrupt the flow of play. In one game I played the group would stop every so often so the tank could field repair armor and weapons while it was still possible to do so with modest skills. If the armor had taken one hit too many the tank would hare off to town to have one of his guildies repair it and sometimes the tank would just log because none of the guild's weaponsmiths and armorers were online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other games it's just a tax by all but name. Rule #1 for entertainment: Don't remind people of taxes or worse do it to them. That particular aggravation is best left to real life. Sure plat sinks are needed but at least make them somewhat fun. I believe EQ has a lot to teach other games in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I'd rather not have devolving items in the game.  There are too many potienal problems like adjusting teibute value for older &amp;quot;degraded&amp;quot; item, bazaar mules who never check their bag and doesn't realize his 50k BoC has rotted away to rusty dagger level.   To add the rot feature, that'd require extra line of codes for each item, more codes for recipies to restore items, and there's always a chance of broken code somewhere or even exploits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;EQ2 handles it fine mostly because the game were designed to have that feature in the first place.  EQ is a 7 years ols spaghetti of codes, of which some are still broken for years (like ships, random 20k death for no reason, etc).&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>I've let several days pass by before rechecking this thread.  My own intention was not to implement this system for current items; however, to suggest it for future expansions/recipes/items.  I've read many posts from devs concerning SoE's outlook on more powerful items, basicly they do not want to put them in.  They want to see the game maintain its healthy growth without becoming too &amp;quot;top heavy&amp;quot; (everyone running around as gods).  Their focus has been to not create items TOO good, despite the players desire to have the BEST of the BEST for their character.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In other words, I think this type of system should be implemented for new items that exhibit the characteristic of the - Best of the Best &amp;amp; VERY High End Tradeskill Level Gear.  This could add to the value of tradeskill type epics and select end game items from each expansion.  With no level requirements, the items exist at their prime values; however, the rate they decay is higher at the lower levels and will decay closer to their useful status.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Oh and 10 levels was just an example, you could easily only have lower evolution levels)&lt;br&gt;EXAMPLE ONLY: For staggered decay rate based upon experience earned at the level breakdowns.&lt;br&gt;10:    70 Good for 20 AA's worth of exp. 50 Good for 5 AA's worth of exp.   25 Good for 5 Levels' worth of exp.&lt;br&gt;9:      70 Good for 40 AA's worth of exp. 50 Good for 10 AA's worth of exp. 25 Good for 6 Levels' worth of exp.&lt;br&gt;8:      70 Good for 60 AA's worth of exp. 50 Good for 15 AA's worth of exp. 25 Good for 4 Levels' worth of exp.&lt;br&gt;7:      70 Good for 30 AA's worth of exp. 50 Good for 25 AA's worth of exp. 25 Good for 3 Levels' worth of exp.&lt;br&gt;6:      70 Good for 15 AA's worth of exp. 50 Good for 20 AA's worth of exp. 25 Good for 2 Levels' worth of exp.&lt;br&gt;5:      70 Good for 7 AA's worth of exp.   50 Good for 10 AA's worth of exp. 25 Good for 6 Levels' worth of exp.&lt;br&gt;4:      70 Good for 3 AA's worth of exp.   50 Good for 8 AA's worth of exp.   25 Good for 15 Levels' worth of exp.&lt;br&gt;3:      70 Good for 2 AA's worth of exp.   50 Good for 3 AA's worth of exp.   25 Good for 25 Level's worth of exp.&lt;br&gt;2:      70 Good for 1 AA's worth of exp.   50 Good for 1 AA's worth of exp.   25 Good for 20 Level's worth of exp.&lt;br&gt;1:      70 (No Rent) 10pp&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am also in disagreement about the price to combine the old items to that of their refurbished appearance.  The idea was not meant to be a platsink, but an alternative tradeskill interaction between players.  To bring an item back to it's old level should be within the 100pp to 900pp range and maintain the risk of it being destroyed where the risk is lower if it is constantly being maintained.  For those wishing new 'clickies' the best levels could easily have an effect that decays in value with the item.  I also realize that with many item slots and augments in existence that it &amp;quot;could&amp;quot; get expensive to maintain gear; however, old content with permanent items will help with these costs (especially if you have to remove an augment before giving it to a tradeskiller).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alternative recipes could still exist so journeyman tradeskillers could also try their hand at making the lower level versions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Thoughts on failure rates, etc.)&lt;br&gt;Level 1 item &amp;amp; 900plat vendor item can bring it back to level 10: Highest risk of combine failure.&lt;br&gt;Level 1 item &amp;amp; 800plat vendor item can bring it back to level 9:   .&lt;br&gt;Level 1 item &amp;amp; 700plat vendor item can bring it back to level 8    .&lt;br&gt;.&lt;br&gt;.&lt;br&gt;.&lt;br&gt;Level 1 item &amp;amp; 100plat vendor item can bring it back to level 2: Lowest risk of combine failure.&lt;br&gt;.&lt;br&gt;Level 2 - Level 10&lt;br&gt;Level 3 - Level 10&lt;br&gt;Level 4 - Level 10&lt;br&gt;.&lt;br&gt;Level 8 item &amp;amp; 200plat vendor item can bring it back to level 10: Moderate risk of combine failure.&lt;br&gt;Level 8 item &amp;amp; 100plat vendor item can bring it back to level 9: Low risk of combine failure.&lt;br&gt;Level 9 item &amp;amp; 100plat vendor item can bring it back to level 10: Low risk of combine failure.&lt;br&gt;-----&lt;br&gt;I personally feel that if implemented properly, de-evolution can permit very nice items that everyone can use and grow people's interest in learning tradeskills.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Again.&amp;nbsp; This is no opinion of mine.&amp;nbsp; Just pointing out that this statement does not mesh with what is being proposed by the original poster&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;What is proposed&amp;nbsp;by the poster&amp;nbsp;is an item that decays as the player gains combat exp.&amp;nbsp; These items would not decay on death, not decay from quests, Monster Missions, nor from "use"&amp;nbsp; (I.E. getting hit more would not make a difference)&amp;nbsp; They "decay" every time a mob dies in a non-monster mission and you are part of the group or are solo&amp;nbsp;and get exp for the mobs death.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Also note.&amp;nbsp; A code change would be required.&amp;nbsp; Currently data does not allow for us to FORCE the item to be "on".&amp;nbsp; A player could just turn of exp for the item and it would not "devolve"&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</description>
