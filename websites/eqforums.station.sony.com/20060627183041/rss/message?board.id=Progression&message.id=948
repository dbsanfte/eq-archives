      <description>Yeah, I was on zek last night, getting people to come on the forums and vote for their pvp progression server, maybe the devs will put an ingame poll in, maybe they'll actually consider pvp a fun option for a seperate pvp progression server or even a discord server of the likes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here's my approach. PvP is a thorn in SoE's side right now, this wasn't the case pre luclin. PvP was being developed, they released a brand new PvP server in 2001 called Sullon Zek because pvp was such a great thing before luclin and PoP came out. I think that SoE should embrace everquest's PvP prime and allow a progressive pvp or a classic pvp server.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I believe it's only fair and to the right of gamers everywhere that SoE release a pvp alternative to the progressive server.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>It's not just 27 people, Zek is filled with hacks, pvp is a joke since the release of PoP and Luclin safe zones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;People have a bad  opinion about pvp because they honestly never even took the time to enjoy it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;People don't like challenges, that's why they don't like pvp.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would be lookin forward to playin EQ longer if they made a progression pvp server. Would love SZ ruleset Maybe if in way its just good and evil (was a nuet but just to make sure things even). Dont want anyone to get left behind or tons of evils lots of goods and a few goods. In a way go back to old coin style on pvp god i hate pvp point system now and so glad i had to wait till zek before i could actually use. As of now Zek has become boring no matter what lvl i have to face a guy that bought plat and made a char almost unkillable. I go from my main down to my lvl 20 just to have, Any rule set would be fine just voting for PvP progression first and with SZ ruleset if possible. Atm dont really see me stickin with EQ to much longer way things are goin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;D Zek&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SZ ftw Honorbound 4 life&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Dear PvP'ers and PvPer's alike.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm sure we'll all excitied about the progression server and what not. I mean, we all should be. It's a blast from the past. Something that we haven't tasted for a long time, something new, that is old. But i want this to be read in a standpoint that maybe the PvEr's can't and don't understand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I grew up playing EQ when i was younger, when i was about, 14 i think...And i started off on a pvp server. It was the hardest thing to learn a MMO on ever. Being my first, and my first game on the computer. But, to understand what pvp is about you need to experience and realize that it's not just about ganking. I Played for years on Tallon Zek and i loved everyone moment of it. Untill expansion after expansion was unleashed and i could never find a person to kill, ever. The early days of EQ was amazingly Fun pvp. And you'll never understand how much fun it was it you've never experienced it. But i do not bash your style of play because that's what you like. What i don't understand is why you REFUSE to comprehend that people want to have and play on a progression server that is pvp.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I myself, after a long time had moved on away from EQ, and went to many other mmo's. I'd never have that 'new' mmo feel that i had from Everquest when i first played it. But i will not play a PvE Progression server. Because i like the competition with other players. It's not just about ganking. There is a competition, really. And it's a lot of fun. I haven't played EQ in years, and when i heard about a old-world progression server i jumped up in excitiement. And if there was a progression server that was pvp, i would drop my WoW and my Eve-online acount to play on that server.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's like you being excitied about the PvE progression server. Why is it so bad for a PvPer to want to have a progression server on his terms? Do you realize how many old eq players will hop back on to play again on that server? Tons. I was told from not just one old everquest friend about the progression server, but several from old servers. But to my demise i found out myself there was no plan for a PvP server. There is no possible way for me to be any happier with a PvP server that is progression. The competition, the old gear, the old leveling fun and the fun pvp that was all with Classic would be there again. This isn't a plea, but more of a want for people to understand what it was like to acutally plan on the pvp servers back in the day. It was a lot of fun, and i'm sorry that you never got to experience it. And if you didn't want to experience it, then you never had to. And that's ok.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But realize, there will be A LOT of people back to play on that server. Don't say all this '10%' stuff out of your own opinion. Yes, the pvp servers were on the lowside of the realms...but, is that fair to descriminate agianst those that loved to play it everyday because your server type was higher on the list? No...it's not.  You don't have to agree with the play type to agree with that people love to play game types their way. I don't care that you like to kill mobs. You shouldn't care that i like to kill mobs and kill players at the same time. If im not affecting you. There should be a progression PVP server. As there is a PVE one.&lt;br&gt;Just because it was an afterthought after the game was made, dosen't mean it shouldn't be played.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyways, thank you for the open ear and i hope this gets across to both PvPers, and PvErs.&lt;br&gt;And maybe some Employees.&lt;br&gt;Good Day.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Devs have mentioned that this server will serve as a test server of sorts for this ruleset.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's very possible that if it is met with great success that they will later try a pvp-progression server.&lt;br&gt;Launching new servers for them now is not something I expect they plan on doing a lot of though.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>I havn't seen any post where a dev mentioned that this is going to be a test for other ruleset servers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I do however hope that SoE trys to please both PvE and PvP crowds alike, seeing that there may be more PvE fans, but there's still a substantial amount of PvP fans also.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Not bloody likely.&amp;nbsp; I don't really care if it happens, but I'm near certain it will not.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
