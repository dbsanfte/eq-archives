&lt;P&gt;Just to be perfectly clear, I said the cap is 90% chance to channel.&amp;nbsp; Unless you're casting lower level spells and have max skill, you're likely not at that cap so your chance would be lower than that.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Normally I don't gripe about patches.&amp;nbsp; This one, however really seems to have done more damage than good in virtually every area.&amp;nbsp; My findings (and understandings from others) are as follows:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;The &amp;nbsp;on-again off-again bug where you can't cast an eyeball while on a mount STILL exists after this.&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Even after being found in beta, auras are invisible on some (all three of my different model) nVidia cards - I've never once seen an aura.&amp;nbsp; DX update did nothing to fix this.&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Character models are grey silhouettes at select screen and sporadically lose their textures in game.&amp;nbsp; Still broken.&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;"Improved Pathing" now has pets following crazy routes (not the shortest path) to their master &lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Some mobs are going off at right angles when pulled.&amp;nbsp; Pathing is worse in some cases.&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Improved corpse targeting is no better and sometimes harder.&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Witheran mobs in DoDH zones are pathing all over land and ghosting.&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Line of Sight "improvements" now make bolt spells poof when a mob is elevated but still in complete sight.&amp;nbsp; Massively worse.&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;I agree the cloak evolved too fast.&amp;nbsp; All mine are maxed and stayed max so I'm not self serving here - I didnt get affected.&amp;nbsp; I think the people who got affected were "adjusted" in a very thoughtless way.&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Adjustments to evolving item math is resulting in some items having nonsensical experience.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Thats just after one day&amp;nbsp; of playing.&amp;nbsp; What a patch :smileymad:.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>God this is a horrid patch. Posted before PoM portals were broken. Well&#xD;
they did finally fix them stealthily (thanks) unfortunatly now the&#xD;
enchanter 1.5 epic mob doesn't seem to be spawning in the hedge, oh and&#xD;
the greenish twig/tree to get you OUT of hedge is busted horridly.&#xD;
Thanks!&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Oh and i got to spend 2 hours today grinding out Belfast 3, just for it&#xD;
to bug when the named runs to the second instance door. Ports to some&#xD;
whacked up Z axis loc where mobs can still kill ya. tried it with 3&#xD;
characters twice each...i must admit the suckiest fun ever. Plus mobs&#xD;
in Belfast #1 were constantly running away from me as well.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
What's next? random DT proc on skeletons? *sigh* bad enough they never&#xD;
got the beta rewards sorted out right (yeah yeah i know send e-mail&#xD;
done that twice and still know a dozen people who got screwed) &lt;br&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;PLEASE LOOK AT THIS. IN DREADSPIRE THERE IS 2 ZONE AE'S&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Mire of Crimson Mists&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Aura of Crimson Mists&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;PLEASE MAKE THIS 1 AE. This zone already has a bunch of mob AE's, with raid buffs i commonly find buffs being overwritten due to 2 zone AEs and 1-3 mob AE's with raid buffs. Before Mire of Crimson mists was cast once when zoning in or ressed and faded now they BOTH get cast at regular intervals. Increase the amount of buffs or lower the number of debuffs please.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I don't think it has anything to do with race or certain NPCs.&amp;nbsp; It has to do with whether you are using FD as a pull tool.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Grumbek described the algorithm that dictates pathing as a series of 3-dimensional cubes that are generated upon aggro, and re-generated if certain things happen, like leaving a certain area (which means the NPC path must be recalculated).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;What I've seen happen is this.&amp;nbsp; You aggro mobs, a path is generated from mob to you -- they start following it, you FD and wait long enough that mobs are starting to walk back to their prior location or roaming path... mobs start walking back to their spawn along a newly generated path to said place... now you stand up.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Mob is now re-aggro&amp;nbsp;so&amp;nbsp;its speed changes from walk to run, but the aggro path is not re-generated.&amp;nbsp; Instead, it follows the path it was on before&amp;nbsp;(back to its spawn) whereupon arriving it turns around and comes back.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>doesnt make sense at all. even if im an sk the times i pulled i did not fd .... and it didnt go back to spawn. it just moved away straight from start. off course i know the few time i can remember are the times where there is no clear path between you and the mob. but when you go over the posts in this thread, you see no one mentioned fd'ing&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;The patch added some new augmentation distillers.&amp;nbsp; But someone forgot how to count in Roman numerals.&amp;nbsp; Previously distillers were numbered 1-18 (I-XVIII), the new ones that were added were 20 (XX) and 21 (XXI).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;I play on the Test server, and I have to say&amp;nbsp;having&lt;SPAN class=postbody&gt; spent about 4 days straight AOE'ing light blue mobs in Dranik's Scar to level my blade of the eclipse to level 7, I think they needed to change the way items leveled but retro-actively popping people who already had that cloak stinks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I never even got the cloak, so it didn't directly effect me.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Some of the "fixes" that run along this line really do irritate me. Not just this item, but you get items or effects that stay in place for years (literally) and then one day they change it and say it was "fixed" because they'd never intended on it working that way. At some point, if you leave it a certain way in the game, it's a cop-out to say we "fixed" it. Just own up and say you nerfed it. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I'm just feeling irritable that at least 2 items that I personally bugged several times went live. And we wonder why the majority of production people think the test server is just a spoiled bunch of elitists who don't test anything. If I were on a production server after this last patch, I'd probably wonder what the&amp;nbsp;**** the Test server does too. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Grrr.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Pagliaci on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;06-15-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;10:26 AM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'll definitely be keeping an eye on things.&amp;nbsp; Once the initial shock&#xD;
wears off and people go back to being more careful about getting into&#xD;
melee as a caster, we can evaluate interrupts in general and see if we&#xD;
want to change the way that they work.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Rashere&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;I'm a caster. A paladin, to be specific. Should I be careful about getting into melee?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I get interrupted stunning. Healing. Group healing. Breathing. Light blue and green mobs interrupt me like crazy now. It was positively maddening. Perhaps it was a bug the way it was, but however we got to the current state of the world, I reeeeeally doubt this is how you want things to stay.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ZsaZsa Vavoom of Drinal&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>The channeling bug must have been a long standing bug, dating back to&#xD;
times when mobs hit a LOT more slowly.&amp;nbsp; I assume a channeling&#xD;
check is made for each successful hit?&amp;nbsp; If so, shouldn't&#xD;
channeling rates be rescaled to account for the low attack delay (and&#xD;
additional attacks per round) that most modern mobs have?&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;"I'll definitely be keeping an eye on things.&amp;nbsp; Once the initial shock wears off and people go back to being more careful about getting into melee as a caster, we can evaluate interrupts in general and see if we want to change the way that they work."&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Phew, as a SK who does a lot of trash tanking on raids I gotta say it scares me to hear something like that. Previously, I was having to chain cast hate spells from the tag until the mob died just to retain aggro (and still often times a Warrior or a Ranger would pop up on hott). I did notice a significant change in channeling last night, especially after 6 attempts to cast a 0.5 spear and 8 attempts to cast the 1.0 Vishi clicky belt, so I checked my log files. Roughly 40% of my spells were interrupted in Demi-plane last night by means other than bash/kick/stun. I hope this can be looked into quickly as SK's live, die, and perform all our raid duties by our channeling skill. I can't even imagine having to channel dread gaze with multiple mobs attacking...&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Ok, I have went thru every post here and not going to spam on the issues that are being hit hard and answered. I have seen 3 post on the cloak of the spirit tracker and yet to see a clear answer on if that was somewhat screwy. I have read elsewhere that if you were borderline level 2 you&amp;nbsp;MAY loose your level, That said, 68% to my knowledge is not borderline, and logging in to see it at 31% level&amp;nbsp;1 made me think this had to be a bug. &amp;nbsp;Losing 140% xp on the cloak is IMO crazy.&amp;nbsp; I have no problem with slowing the evolving down, but do have one that contradicts what was initially said. And far as getting more xp per a kill,, I grinded solo and grouped most of the day yesterday and barely seen the xp move. Please atleast adjust the prepatch settings to a reasonable loss of xp, 140% is nuts.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;thank you in advance and will check for response soon.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;span class="postbody"&gt;Ran into a see invis mob twice in MPG last night&#xD;
died both times. The mob didn't cast anything ever or bash according to&#xD;
the logs and I was interupted 9 times in a row trying to FD, 4 times&#xD;
once and 5 the other. In the logs the interupting was preceeded and&#xD;
followed by so-and-so swings at you and misses and still was&#xD;
interupted. The problem is as I see it since you have to make a saving&#xD;
throw each time now you get hit it's like saying that flipping a coin&#xD;
is a 50-50 chance. While this is true about the coin in a single flip&#xD;
and it seems that your chances are pretty good, try to flip a coin 4+&#xD;
times and have the same side come up all the same, now 8 times. It's&#xD;
swings * mobs = saving throws so the chances of channeling through&#xD;
strikes dwindles significantly as the number of mobs increases to the&#xD;
point of channeling skill irrelevance. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Ok so that didn't work, and I cant seem to edit it to change it, so go ahed and direct yourself to the following link:&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
http://www.necrotalk.com/index.php?showtopic=6120&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
The first topic, look at the pic.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Explain that please.&amp;nbsp; I wasn't moving, I didn't have any levitation.&amp;nbsp; Explain.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
This had never happened before, something is definately broken, or over-nerfed about channeling.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
If you arent going to fix this, then please refund the 184 AA's I spent&#xD;
in defence AA's and channeling AA's.&amp;nbsp; Oh and also take away the&#xD;
necromancers rezz spell too, because it is useless to us if we cant&#xD;
channel a 1 second casting time feign death in order to survive to use&#xD;
the spell.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Thanks in advance,&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
-KK&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
