    <description>&lt;DIV&gt;What a year EverQuest has had.&amp;nbsp; 2004 brought many changes to EverQuest.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; New content, new features, 2 new expansions, hundreds of community requested features, the first Community Summit, a Fan Faire in New Orleans and Las Vegas as well as thousands and thousands of hours of enjoyment for hundreds of thousands of EQ fans.&amp;nbsp; A new Graphics Engine was launched allowing our artists to use new tools when building zones and NPCs.&amp;nbsp; Zones were revamped to add some new life to older areas, new Adventure zones were added to keep small group gameplay fresh. We are quite proud of all that we accomplished but we are not sitting back and resting. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;EverQuest in 2005 will continue to expand with more of what you have come to expect and appreciate from the game we all enjoy.&amp;nbsp; While EverQuest will soon be 6 years young, it is aging well and still setting standards in the industry.&amp;nbsp; A new expansion, EverQuest®: Dragons of Norrath™, has been announced which opens an area that has long been on the maps of Norrath but not yet available.&amp;nbsp; We are adding new tradeskill recipes, new features that ease communication and gameplay.&amp;nbsp; You will see the continued addition of new NPCs and Zones modeled to make use of our New Graphics Engine and will bring a new quality standard to EQ art.&amp;nbsp; In the coming weeks you will see more of the improvements as screenshots and movies are released for the upcoming EverQuest: Dragons of Norrath launch.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;We have announced that we are re-envisioning classes in EverQuest, which in itself is a huge undertaking.&amp;nbsp; We are looking at each class and what roles they fill in groups, followed by raids.&amp;nbsp; Our goal is to make certain that each class has a desirable role to play when grouped and while raiding.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; We will have a series of developer chats to discuss our plans and our findings as we gather and collate all the additional data the servers are currently mining and we will share any conclusions we come to at the appropriate times.&amp;nbsp; There will be ongoing discussion threads on the EQ forums (Eqforums.station.sony.com) and we encourage you to take part in them.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;We are aware that with the recent release of new MMO's that some of our fans have moved on and we wish them the best of luck.&amp;nbsp; We have noted that this has had an impact on some server populations, most noticeably our PVP servers.&amp;nbsp; The PvP community has asked that we further explore the idea of server mergers and to that end, we’ve put a poll for PvP players asking if servers were to be merged, which rule set they would most like to play under.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; More details for you on that soon.&amp;nbsp; Although we are satisfied with the current population of most other servers, we will take a look at each after the release of EverQuest: Dragons of Norrath and identify whether any additional mergers will be needed. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;We do have another Fan Faire planned for June in Las Vegas and again hope to meet many of you there.&amp;nbsp; We enjoy meeting you in person and sharing our mutual passion for this world of Norrath.&amp;nbsp; We also have begun planning for two community summits this year, one in conjunction with the June Fan Faire and one tentatively planned for the fall.&amp;nbsp; We are quite proud of what was accomplished in our first summit and our goal is continue the feedback process with the community leaders.&amp;nbsp; We plan to have representatives for raiding players, non-raiding players and each class in attendance.&amp;nbsp; This will provide a solid cross section of the EQ community to share ideas and discuss concerns with.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Of course this is only what comes to mind now, we have other projects in the works and will continue to expand this little world we share.&amp;nbsp; We want Norrath to be a living vibrant world for years to come and with the team we have here, partnered with your passion and feedback, we are sure we can accomplish that goal. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Thanks for playing! &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Some of us are getting kind of nervous here wondering about what the plans are for EQ now that our spoiled brat baby brother EQ2 has been born and you and Mommy are giving him all the attention.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Are you going to send us off to an orphanage now that he's here?&amp;nbsp; Is he a replacement for us?&amp;nbsp; Did you have him because&amp;nbsp;we've been bad?&amp;nbsp; Do you love him more than you love us?&amp;nbsp; Or are you just goning to send us to our room so we don't bother you while you pay him all the attention and none to us?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Please could you write us a letter like &lt;A href="http://eqiiforums.station.sony.com/eq2/board/message?board.id=news_announcements&amp;amp;message.id=90" target=_blank&gt;this&lt;/A&gt; one and tell us what you are planning for EQ?&amp;nbsp; This is the second letter in a month you've written to our snotty baby brother and you haven't written us a single one!&amp;nbsp; Could you tell us how many people are working on our game and what the plans are for expansions and so forth for us?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Pleeeeeeeeze?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;If "satisfied" with populations means 6 in WoS, 8 in MPG, 0 in Riftseekers (took myself out from the /who count)...I would hate to see bad!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I think most people want a BETTER game, not a BIGGER game.&amp;nbsp; With the popluations a fraction of it's peak, with a game designed to hold that peak number the world is already spread too thin, making it bigger will only add to splitting the remaining people up further.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Myself, I would love to see events, NPC's, maybe a sub zone....from exsisting zones.&amp;nbsp; There is plenty of space and places to tie in content in the old world(s) without having to add new zones for it.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;But that is just me.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;EQ is starting to remind me of someone who has a 100 projects on the go but never finishes a single one of them.&amp;nbsp; Maybe take the $$$ (expansion) team away for a bit and let them work on the unfinished work instead?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Not that I really care if I get it back or not, but HOW long has it been said manaburn is being worked on to be restored?&amp;nbsp; Like 3 weeks after it came out as an AA?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I am sure there is a list a mile long of things like this for all classes/zones/npc's, you name it that could use some TLC first.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;How can you complain that your server is empty and that you can't get a group, then say that releasing an expansion isn't for us?&amp;nbsp; Expansions are everything for the player base.&amp;nbsp; It keeps people progressing and keeps content fresh.&amp;nbsp; It adds features and give opportunity.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;No class in EQ is broken.&amp;nbsp; Some may have more significant issues, but NONE are broken.&amp;nbsp; The OoW expansion actually helped that situation, don't forget.&amp;nbsp; Graphics are pretty stable, bugs are at a significantly lower level than six months ago.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Overall we are ready for a new expansion, and that doesn't preclude the other teams from continueing to work on bugs and balance.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>It is WAY too early to release a new expansion.  They asked us for class issue lists before OoW release, with an undertone that they'll address those issues in some way (even a refusal, accompanied by a reasonable explanation, is better than this permanent 'being evaluated').&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There was a strong drive to boycott OoW, at which point SOE panicked and called this sham of a summit that in the end, meant nothing.  Do they seriously hope that they can con us again with promises of 'class re-envisioning'?  I doubt they'll see strong sales on this new expansion until they deliver on their previous promises.  They probably hope that all those nifty guild features will produce enough peer pressure within the guilds (Hey! if you bought DoN, we could just summon your corpse at guildhall altar, instead of dragging a necro with coffins to the raid zone!)  One problem: pressure works when guilds are holding up well.  When you already have guilds collapsing, pressure will only tear more of them apart.  Players who are already discouraged by SOE's lack of focus, when faced with splurging up on an additional expansion in order to keep up with the guild, will simply quit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh, and it looks like Woody no longer cares, too.</description>

&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;They are releasing so damn early&amp;nbsp;because of WoW release in Europe/RotW&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;What percentage of players are European/RotW? 20-30%? That's a sizeable chunk of the player base&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;What can they do to alleviate a portion of their players leaving?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;1. Nothing.. hoping the release of WoW will pass and not do a lot to the player base.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;2. Something before their competitor does something &amp;lt;~ BINGO.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Get in first before your main competitor gets in.. any sales and marketing department knows that that is the way to do it.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Funny how it's right on the heels of OoW and 10 days before release of WoW in the above places.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;This expansion has 1 specific aim. That is to stop players leaving to go to WoW. Nothing to do with us as players (we are a secondary thought).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;It's called dollars.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;What I meant is.. would you rather have fixes/&lt;FONT size=2&gt;re-envisioning of classes done first or a new expansion?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;I'd rather have re-envisioning of classes as top priority.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;But what will get SoE more $.. yes keeping more players here and minising the effect of another game.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Anyway .. as Brenaux said ;)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;Also I note that we don't agree amongst ourselves over what we want.&amp;nbsp; So it is not possible to please all of us.&amp;nbsp; Some of us want an expansion right now but others really do not want an expansion right now.&amp;nbsp; No way to please both groups.&amp;nbsp; Some of us want to fix the present game before releasing an expansion but others really do not want to wait for an expansion.&amp;nbsp; No way to please both groups.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Sony IS pleasing a group of players by releasing an expansion right now.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;There are some really cool features in the expansion, described &lt;A href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/dragonsofnorrath/features.jsp" target=_blank&gt;here&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;in case you haven't seen it yet.&amp;nbsp;Particularly spiffy are the new guild features and ingame email.&amp;nbsp; Actually this expansion seems geared less toward new zones, etc. and more toward implementing some infrastructure (for lack of a better word).&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;However i will be watching closely and hope that some update will be forthcoming.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Given that every word of the letter is likely to be scrutinized and over analyzed and held up forever after as a "promise" even more than the "let me get a cup of coffee" joke was, let us hope that the letter is well-designed, well-scrutinized internally before release and PACKED WITH INFORMATION. : )&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;release dat feb 15th is that for real?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;my question is what are they doing with these zones for those who dont have expansion&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;is it gonna be the expansion cgraphics come in game and you gotta pay for the features and new zones?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If zone revamps dont require expansion. this is just what soe needs to boost playerbase and bring in a new set of fools&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Releasing a new epxansion without fixing issues with the current game is a bit like Fiddling whilst Rome burns. Any takers for the roel of Nero ?&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>Well no supprise here Brenlo said it. WE HAD TOO MANY BETA issues to look after. Guess guys where most of their effort is going?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Answer: Fix the current problems and sort out some class issues to make our players happier.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;WRONG&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We working on new expansion cause it brings more dollars to us. And guys we promise this expansion will be great and make all the difference to the game. And don't forget all the new goodies you will get.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well if you ask me we still waiting to get what we were promised on past expansions. Anyway lets wait and see what this letter will say but I won;t hold my breath for it.</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;Since you seem to be very much in the loop of how SOE works, I guess you know that there are completely separate teams working on fixing bugs and developing expansions.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

No there is not enouph thinking into the design and release of the new expansion, they hardlly deliver what they promise, and history speaks on itself.  Check all the expansion that came out (LOY omg that was bad expansion, LDON had some nice featured nerfed to death and its a dead expansion ATM, GoD ok don't get me start on this we all know about it). Want me to go on and on and list the things they have promise and never deliver. I will need a few pages to list them all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This has to do that they try to bring expansions as fast as possible cause it brings dollars to them. Nothing wrong with that its their job to earn money otherwise no point, SoE is not charity, but as customers we do expect to get what we were promised and nothing less. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you ask me I stay in this game cause I been playing for the past 5 years. If I quit the game? very possible depents if this game gets better or worst but believe me I will never try EQ2 after GoD. The mentality how to bring expansion out etc. will not change and it will follow EQ2.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And I am not saying these to be negative and all about shaking fist at SoE. I am a customer who speaks how feels about a game I loved and like to play and its shame to see it after 5 years end up like that. I always hope it will get better and fix some of the issues we players have.&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Saerdna_brell on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;01-11-2005&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;03:33 PM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Never is a bit broad, don't you think?&amp;nbsp; GoD had tons of problems, I don't think anyone would argue with you on that.&amp;nbsp; It was more because the expansion was geared for level 70, though, than things were not working.&amp;nbsp; The highest levels of every expansion are almost always not finished when the expansion is released (e.g., PoTime).&amp;nbsp; I guess they figure that it will take a while for people to get to them, so they have time to polish them off.&amp;nbsp; You have to expect bugs with expansions.&amp;nbsp; The players beta testing it do a great job, but they can't catch everything.&amp;nbsp; It's not until things get out onto the live servers, with some 200K people playing them that they find some of the bugs.&amp;nbsp; It's the nature of the beast.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;I'm not sure exactly what was promised that they didn't deliver.&amp;nbsp; I know a lot of people that think LoY was one of the best expansions they released (although it could have had a few more zones to it.)&amp;nbsp; What LDoN features were nerfed?&amp;nbsp; (Remember, XP is not a feature.)&amp;nbsp; The team that develops the expansion turns it over to the live team at some point in time.&amp;nbsp; I don't know exactly what point in time that is, but I suspect it's around the time of launch.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
