				This is a minor detail on an iksar task that I got at about level 7 from a task master in East Cabilis.  The first step of the task had me wander to some columns in the Field of Bone.  The next part was to kill giant marsh leeches and loot 4 items from the leeches.  From the description of the task, it seems as though the first part should send you to Swamp of No Hope instead of FoB as all the flavor text seems to imply you're doing a mission in a swamp.  I would guess the first line should send you south of the city to an area of ruined columns where the leeches spawn.  The task is completable, but confusing.

</BLOCKQUOTE>I remember there was an earlier bug with this task -- something like&nbsp;you had to loot the stones from particular aqua goblins - the ones near the under water tower, near cleric and druid spawns. That seemed a bit hard at level 12, so I think the dev (Rainbird maybe?) mentioned tweaking it a little.

<DIV>Which changes are preventing you from getting the quest again? <STRONG>I now understand this.

<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><STRONG>It would be nice if it only flagged you for doing the task you actually did, as you could then do V'Lynn Renloe's task for your first bracer, and then do Barrenzin's task for your second bracer.</STRONG></DIV>

<P>I can't really help with the itemization aspect of it the missions, but I'll pass the slot concerns along.&nbsp; In regards to the difficulty levels for the missions, after checking into this it appears the absence of the hard versions of those two missions is not intentional.&nbsp; The hard versions exist and I've corrected things so they are showing up on test now.&nbsp; Assuming no other issues are found on these missions they should be available after next week's update.</P>

				I know the devs already know of the Zanivar quest triggers in befallen where Zanivar wont move. However the triggers themselves seem to be working fine. If you go further in the zone going back and forth to answer the text, eventually he will head down to his final spot next to the Urn. Which by the way, the main urn and like 3 out of the 5 urn spawns are human models. So anyway, you get through all the Urns and it looks like finally it triggers Zanivar to attack. Kill him and you can loot the map. Well from there your stuck, unless you have gate. There is no NPC to zone you out like some of the other instances. Ive had the same problem with under the field of bone quest. Once you get done you best have gate or your stuck.

				<DIV>ok i dont know if a monster mission counts as a task or a quest so im posting it here since it has a timer on it <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>the griffin mission in west commons ws extremely buggy last night. the nubies where on a rampage, they run at sow speed, slaughter your party,(ALL the nubies come in a bunch), then when you respawn, they track right to you at the zone in, (as if your agro wasn't lost on death), and procced to corpse camp/death loop you. as it is there is no way to complete the mission. This insanity starts once you find 6 eggs.</DIV>

				I completed all 5 Halloween Quests. I had 4 Bristlebane tickets prior to particpating in and completing the final quest given by the puppet. I used illusion I received as reward from other quest and attempted to talk with Zigab Ribshard in PoK. He does not acknowledge that I have completed all the quests and just gives the beginning text and replies. I have tried several different illusions and none seem to work. <br><br>Any help on this??<br><br>Thanks,
