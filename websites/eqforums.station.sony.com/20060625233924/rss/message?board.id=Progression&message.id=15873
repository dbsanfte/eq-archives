    <title>A cool idea, don't know how practical though.</title>
    <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Progression&amp;message.id=15873</link>
    <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Okay, so say the server is 2 months broken in, and the requirements have just been met to unlock Kunark.&amp;nbsp; Now.&amp;nbsp; All of a sudden everyone online, and everyone that comes online within a weeks time is given a pop up box that says something like.&amp;nbsp; "You or your fellow adventurers have defeated so and so,&amp;nbsp;and have been shown the way to a new land (Kunark).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Do you wish to be able to travel these lands?"&amp;nbsp; "YES" or "NO".&amp;nbsp; After a weeks time, the votes are tallied, and if the majority is yes, then Kunark would then be unlocked.&amp;nbsp; But if the majority is No, then it would be 30 more days until the voting takes place again.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Do you guys like this idea?&amp;nbsp; I think it's kinda cool.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Obviously there would only be one vote allowed per account.&amp;nbsp; And possibly a level requirement to be able to vote?&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I suppose the question to ask is if the OPs idea would help keep more players or not.&amp;nbsp; If Kunark was opened and those who had the time could start gearin up, would that discourage casual players to stop playing?&amp;nbsp; Or if they informed the people who contributed to the unlocking tha their efforts were in vain, at least for the next 30 days, would that cause an exodus?&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I certainly dont know the answer to this.&amp;nbsp; But my personal feeling is once the unlock criteria is met, then open up the next expansion.&amp;nbsp; Making that criteria as challenging as possible,&amp;nbsp;while keeping both camps of players interested, that&amp;nbsp;is SOEs challenge.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;This is an OUTSTANDING idea!&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Majority rules, right?&amp;nbsp; That way, if unlocking the next expansion is denied, it would be because the majority of people wanted it that way.&amp;nbsp; Hmmm-then could we say, obviously there is not enough interest in unlocking the next expansion-you would only get bored and leave if we were to unlock it now.&amp;nbsp; So, your options are deal-or take your uber, leet hindparts back to whatever expansioned out of control server you came from and "progress" to your heart's content LOL.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;Personally i do not think that is such a bad idea in fact i hope they would do that... highly unlikely they would do that though.</description>

      <description>It's a terrible idea.  If you have put in the time and effort to advance, having some other people hold you back would suck incredibly.  If you don't want to advance to Kunark, don't, but don't try and stop those who are ready and willing to.  No one will force you to step foot in Kunark once it's unlocked, and no one is going to force you to play an Iksar, nor force you to use Kunark era gear...so why in the hell would you want to try and stop people who do want to progress from doing so?</description>

&lt;P&gt;No one is forcing anyone to play in all the expansions on regular servers either.&amp;nbsp; You fail to grasp why so many people want a classic type server.&amp;nbsp; I've explained it too many times, I'm not about to type a novel about it again.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I think you just owned yourself.&amp;nbsp; Last I checked the Dev's have stated that this is not a classic server, but a progression server.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Seriously though, what's with all the malice from from all these people that want this server to progress into a regular server ASAP.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;My idea works perfectly.&amp;nbsp; People like you can hurry and vote yes to unlock expansions as fast as possible, and people like me can vote no, in order to preserve the old and blissful world of original Everquest.&amp;nbsp; Either way the majority of the people playing on the server will be satisfied.&amp;nbsp; So why is it a terrible idea again?&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;It would seem the minority want it because the majority wants to move on to future expansions.&amp;nbsp; Am I right?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The same reason this server's being created in the first place, some people can't stand being behind.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Lemme tell you something folks: I'm behind. I'm not high end, I'm not end game, I don't have the best gear out there and probably never will. I know this, I accept it, becuase that's the result of my playstyle. It's STILL possible to have fun. Sure, there's a ton of content I'd LOVE to see that I won't for a good long time. I'm fine with that. The folks I work with and myself kick enough ass for me to be happy where I am, and that's what folks don't seem to get.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;"That items got 500 HP and X focii, I'll never catch up, this is BS!" You know why it has those stats? Becuase the people at that level, for the most part, put the time and effort in to work thier ass off and earn it.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I used to think the same way, then when the oppurtunity came to try out that style of play, I took it, and it opens your eyes to the effort people go through for that "insane gear". Don't believe me? PoP flag an entire guild without the backflag quest. See if your raidleader and overall leader still have their sanity afterward.&lt;/P&gt;</description>
