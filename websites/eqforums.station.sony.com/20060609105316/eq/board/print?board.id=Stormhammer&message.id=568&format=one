				<DIV>Why even have NBG on a pick up raid. It can't be enforced. For NBG to work on a Pickup it requires everyone in the raid to aggree to it. If one person doesn't agree NBG will not work. With a pickup raid of 40 to 72+ people there will always be someone that will not agree for NBG so it can't really be enforced. For that matter Large Guild Sponsered Raids don't have NBG for the very same reason. That was one of the reasons DKP is used. The idea of RL deciding on who is allowed to get loot and who don't in a GM event is not right and a person should be able to petition if they are ever refused loot if they have won that item fairly. After all the only person that can say if or if not a person that can atttend or loot at a GM event is the GM. Everyone that attends a raid has put in as much effort as the next one so everyone that participated in the raid should have egual rights to roll on the loot. Be it if the person is Time geared or still wearing newbie armor. Otherwise I'll just strip all the gear of my main and bring him to the events nekked. Roll on the NGB because atm I would need it because look, I'm nekked and then sale the stuff in the bazaar and put my time gear back on. But there will always be the few that will demand NBG, but you don't have to give up your looting rights, because of that and the GM will not enforce a NBG rule if everyone does not agree to it. I mean it's not in the TOS agreement that NBG must be used in GM events.</DIV>
