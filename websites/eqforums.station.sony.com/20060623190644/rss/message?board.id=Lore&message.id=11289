    <title>So.....think we will ever find out about Tsaph Katta?</title>
    <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Lore&amp;message.id=11289</link>
    <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I have given this subject some thought and wonder if Katta will have any place in future storylines since he is a bard and was possibly 'saved' by the elves.&amp;nbsp; Lcea's not talking so what do you all think? Is there a place for Katta in the future of Norrath?&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;There probably was some tie in to him that was ment to happen in the Luclin expansion, but it was dropped like the&amp;nbsp;Luclins tower and several other zones that were ment to be in, after all these years I dont know if we will see them and or any "wrap up" of the unfinished story lines. It may happen, they have done things like Veskar, Chardok B etc etc which furthered along old old story lines, or added in some new ones.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;Well, they seem to be good at bringing back storylines that have faltered. :smileytongue: I mean Mayong was no where to be seen or heard from in ages and they found a place for him. I think since Katta is/was a bard, Luclin will be the next fabled, Mayong needs a nemesis.......it would make sense to have Katta in there somewhere. After all, since the residents of the city of Katta abhorr vampyres and the leader of their city is a bard, I think there could be a very interesting tie-in with the events of the latest expansion. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Ayonae needs a new plane since Mayong has taken over hers. Druzzil could turn back time (she does that regularly) and bring Katta back.&amp;nbsp; There could be many intriguing ways to bring him into the storyline progression and, in fact, make Luclin more a part of the world again.&amp;nbsp; With Luclin being the next fabled, I think it's time to do a little work there. :smileywink:&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Luclin had a good storyline, but rushing the expansion really botched it. If you look at Ssra compared to Vex Thall, Ssra was way more complex in it's raid content. I think overall had McQuaid's team had the oppertunity to complete it or near completion, it would've been bigger than Velious. Either way, ya the storyline could use a shot in the arm. There's alot of inner territory in Luclin as well that could be used as fodder for expansions or just add on zones.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
