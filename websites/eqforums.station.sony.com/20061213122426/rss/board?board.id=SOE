      <title>Just a few easy questions</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=SOE&amp;message.id=5273#M5273</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Someone asked me a couple weeks back what he called "Use Metrics" were.&#xD;
I had no idea but he said they were just the numbers for how many&#xD;
people were on a server. I'm not sure if his terminology was right, but&#xD;
after mulling it over and thinking about it, I became curious.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;ol&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;li&gt;What are EQ's current numbers?&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;li&gt;Why does WoW keep bragging about 7 million subscribers while EQ&#xD;
quietly paces along without any media exposure (EQ should have been in&#xD;
South Park IMHO)?&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;li&gt;When was the last time we had a "state of the game" address?&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;li&gt;Are there plans to update the engine to be more prettified (handle graphics on par with industry standards ca. 2005)?&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;li&gt;What's is SOE's plan for EQ with Vista? Will EQ remain stable&#xD;
and/or become Games for Windows Certified so it can take advantage of&#xD;
the kiosk and marketing dollars from Microsoft (see&#xD;
http://www.gamesforwindows.com/aboutGFW/gamesForWindows.aspx for more)?&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;li&gt;Will Brenlo ever find the cure for Halfling Athlete's Foot? &lt;span&gt;:smileyvery-happy:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/ol&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;Published: December 3, 2006, 9:45 AM PST&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;!--     id="storyMeta"     --&gt;&lt;!--     Search Engine Component      --&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;NEW YORK--If you are a hard-core player of virtual worlds like &lt;I&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/I&gt;, &lt;I&gt;Second Life&lt;/I&gt;, &lt;I&gt;EverQuest&lt;/I&gt; or &lt;I&gt;There&lt;/I&gt;, IRS form 1099 may someday soon take on a new meaning for you.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;That's because game publishers may well in the not-too-distant future have to send the forms--which individuals receive when earning nonemployee income from companies or institutions--to virtual world players engaging in transactions for valuable items like &lt;I&gt;Ultima Online&lt;/I&gt; castles, &lt;I&gt;EverQuest&lt;/I&gt; weapons or &lt;I&gt;Second Life&lt;/I&gt; currency, even when those players don't convert the assets into cash.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Most governments are only beginning to become aware of the &lt;A href="http://news.com.com/Virtual+gamings+elusive+exchange+rates/2100-1043_3-5820137.html" target=_blank&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0048c0&gt;substantial economic activity in online games&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt;, but the games' rapid growth and the substantial value of the many virtual assets changing hands in them is almost certain to bring them into the popular consciousness.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;"Given growth rates of 10 to 15 percent a month, the question is when, not if, Congress and IRS start paying attention to these issues," said Dan Miller, a senior economist with the Congress' Joint Economic Committee, who is also a fan of virtual worlds. "So it is incumbent on us to set the terms and the debate so we have a shaped tax policy toward virtual worlds and virtual economies in a favorable way."&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Miller's comments came during a Saturday panel called "Tax and Finance" at &lt;A href="http://news.com.com/Who+governs+virtual+worlds/2100-1043_3-6140249.html" target=_blank&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0048c0&gt;the State of Play/Terra Nova symposium&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt;, the fourth annual gathering at New York Law School of academics, lawyers and other scholars to talk about the legal, social and economic issues surrounding virtual worlds.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;!--     pullquote     --&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;"Given growth rates of 10 to 15 percent a month, the question is when, not if, Congress and IRS start paying attention to these issues."&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;-- Dan Miller, senior economist&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;!--     end pullquote     --&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The panel was formed in the context of recent questions--&lt;A href="http://news.com.com/Are+virtual+assets+taxable/2100-1043_3-6027212.html" target=_blank&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0048c0&gt;first raised by author Julian Dibbel&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt; in his book &lt;I&gt;Play Money&lt;/I&gt; and in an article he wrote earlier in &lt;I&gt;Legal Affairs&lt;/I&gt; magazine--about whether the transfer of virtual assets, or players' acquisition of virtual loot by, for example, killing monsters, creates taxable events.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;"If you haven't misspent hours battling an Arctic Ogre Lord near an Ice Dungeon or been equally profligate spending time reading the published works of the Internal Revenue Service," Dibbell's article began, "you probably haven't wondered whether the United States government will someday tax your virtual winnings from games played over the Internet. The real question is: Why hasn't it happened already?"&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;And while &lt;A href="http://news.com.com/2061-10797_3-6126701.html" target=_blank&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0048c0&gt;Miller's committee began examining these issues in October&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt;, his comments Saturday suggested there could be wider future congressional oversight and a revised IRS tax policy. That's in spite of the fact that Miller said his committee, and Congress in general, is not out to gouge virtual world players.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;"The Joint Economic Committee is not seeking to impose a new tax on virtual economies," Miller said. "We have a very clear record of supporting lower taxes in free market."&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Meanwhile, Miller's fellow panelists also weighed in Saturday on Dibbel's question, and came at it from several different perspectives.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;First up was William LaPiana, a wills, trusts and estates professor at New York Law School. He approached the question by examining whether estate taxes would accrue on the transfer to an heir of a sizable collection of valuable virtual assets.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;LaPiana said that there is little question that the transfer of such assets could be taxable, since it is property. However, he did say that the taxes would accrue only if the total value of the estate's assets, at the time of death, exceeded the limit set by the state in which the deceased had lived. In most cases, he said, that amount is $2 million, though some states, like New York and New Jersey, have lower limits.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;There are not that many instances in which someone has that level of virtual assets, although the recent &lt;A href="http://news.com.com/2061-10797_3-6138519.html" target=_blank&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0048c0&gt;reports that &lt;I&gt;Second Life&lt;/I&gt; land mogul Anshe Chung had amassed $1 million&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt; in virtual land and other holdings certainly suggest her heirs might have some interesting inheritance tax issues if she dies.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;More problematic, LaPiana said, would be laws that require estate administrators to take on responsibility for the proper transfer of assets to beneficiaries. Because most virtual assets are locked behind password-protected accounts, it would be incumbent on the administrator to try to figure out how to get access to those accounts.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;"Whoever is going to run your estate...has an absolute obligation to collect all your property and make sure that it goes to the (proper) people," LaPiana said. "How do I make sure my trustee has access to this stuff after I die? These are all problems we're going to have to face."&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Next up, Texas Tech University School of Law tax professor Bryan Camp addressed Dibbel's question with a warning.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;"Be careful what you ask for," Camp said, "because tax is always behind the corner. Tax is the shadow life" to many issues.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Camp said that that section 61 of the U.S. tax code, a 1913 provision, stated clearly that all income, "from whatever source derived," is taxable.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Thus, the question of whether the transfer of virtual assets is taxable boils down to determining if there is a profit afterward.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;As an example, he explained that if two people were to exchange copies of books, one of which is worth $30 and the other worth $24, the person ending up with the more expensive volume would have acquired $6 of taxable income.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Another example, he said, was &lt;A href="http://news.com.com/Blogger+asks%2C+Wanna+trade+a+paper+clip+for+a+house/2100-1025_3-6061438.html" target=_blank&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0048c0&gt;Kyle MacDonald's much-publicized quest to trade up from a red paper clip to a house&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt;, which was ultimately successful.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;"He has massive tax issues," said Camp of MacDonald. "He started with (the value of) a paper clip and ended up with (the value of) a house."&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;MacDonald is Canadian, though, which puts him under Canadian tax law, which Camp did not address.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;His point is well taken, though: in determining tax liability--regardless of whether the IRS would likely try to collect--it is necessary to figure out how much profit has derived from a transaction.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;However, Camp also said he is working on a legal journal article in which he will argue that at least some profits from transfers of virtual goods are not taxable.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;!--     STORY TEASE     --&gt;For his part, Miller--who spoke last on the panel--said the Joint Economic Committee is expected to produce a report early next year that will address three goals.&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;First, he said, the report will address the areas, such as tax, cybercrime and education, where virtual worlds connect with public policy and will therefore educate the committee's staff members about such issues.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Next, the report will seek to identify future uses of virtual worlds, including those by commercial, nonprofit and governmental bodies.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;And lastly, the report will specifically investigate the tax issues raised by virtual worlds.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;"We will look at factual technical questions," Miller said, "like what is a taxable event in a virtual world."&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;And that's where the answer to Dibbel's question is likely to come into clear focus, he suggested.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;"The key takeaway for the people" at State of Play, Miller said, "is that congressional and IRS interest in this issue is simply a matter of time."&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>Transferring characters FROM a progression server to a regular server</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=SOE&amp;message.id=5243#M5243</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Good day and well met :)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I have been in conversations with customer service, as well as having used the customer service form to send in a message (and have yet to hear back from them).&amp;nbsp; I am looking to pay the standard $75 to move my character from the Combine server to Bertoxxulous, and have been told that it's not possible, as it is not an available server to transfer from on the website.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Now, I could see if there were a tactical advantage to doing this, but there is not.&amp;nbsp; In fact, it would be somewhat of a tactical disadvantage to move my character (who is flagless, mind you) over to a server where I would be playing a huge game of catch-up.&amp;nbsp; I do feel (and I'm sure there are others who feel the same way) that there would really be no issue with such a move, and would really be a good business move on the part of Sony.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Please, if I could get a response as to why this might not work, I would like to know.&amp;nbsp; I'd really love to be able to play my character that I've worked up over the past 4 months with my friends on Bertox.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Thank you!&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>GuildWars has $100,000 tounament - where is ours?</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=SOE&amp;message.id=5219#M5219</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I was watching Zoom HD TV and they had Guildwars tournament on and giving out $100,000 in&amp;nbsp;prizes.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Video Games is going bigs time. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So where is our tournament? Maybe give actual monies for first guild to take down boss mob of each expansion. Maybe for highest AC or whatever per month. Maybe some cross server pvp (they did it on the beta pvp server a few years ago, just copy your toons over to a "battle server" where you can't gain exp or items or anything just fight), with prizes. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I mean a doofus game has big time tournaments yet the best game has nothing..... &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Just think if you could have online betting on which guild will kill boss mob first lol, hadicaping and everything.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Not to say SOE has to lose money on this, charge fees to be elligable for prizes if they wish.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; like our president said, new eyes can give a new presective on things(something like that). seriously though i think eq i s abit to much of a task now for soe to continue the job. we get patches once every 2 months now, cs is nerfed every 6 months, nothing fixed or changed except for expansion launches, 15$ a month for a 8 year old game and no advertising is done just to let people know eq still around! another company i think would be great for eq, just sell to one that has great servers and devs and can transfer all the data too like blizard:)&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Any chance of giving discounted/free server transfers to certain AB players?</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=SOE&amp;message.id=5213#M5213</link>
      <description>I feel kind of ripped off. When I first started playing there was no European tag on AB, and I picked it simply because it was the first one on the list. By the time I realised it was European I was level 25 or so and didn't feel like starting over. I essentially soloed 99% of my levels because the entire server goes dead roughly at the same time I can start playing. Now that I'm getting up into levels that are very impractical to solo, I can very rarely find groups and things are going slow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is there any chance that SOE will give free server transfers for non-European players who signed up during the period that it showed up as a normal server? There is no way I'm going to start over (I hate being a low level; I can't even stand to play alts), so I'm probably going to end up quiting EQ in the long run.</description>

      <title>When are SoE going to finally find and fix the problem with zone / instance crashes!</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=SOE&amp;message.id=5176#M5176</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;As the message header states. When are we going to get a program that we pay for that actually works, with out zone crashes every time characters get charmed?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;This has happened to my guild twice tonight, once in Razorthorn instance clearing trash, and then again in Dire following a Pyro kill, at wihich stage, once every one returned we found the zone had been rolled back and the 45 minute encouter we had completed prior to the Pyro had respawned and the loots that had been awarded / won were gone because of the roll back. I mean for gods sake get these issues fixed as a PRIORTY.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Enough is Enough!&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>Check out the latest web blog from John Smedley. John talks about personal responsibility and the choices we make in our lives about video games. With the latest rash of people blaming their mistakes on video games, John's point of view is dead on: it's about &lt;a href="http://blog.station.sony.com/" target=_blank&gt;personal responsibility&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
