				Okay, I've been browsing the Lore forums for a while now and i have a question.&nbsp; Where did all teh necromatic gods come from.&nbsp; <br><br>I recall talk that bert was created/assended by a race named Xolous(sp), kinda in teh way Maynog was assended. Is this true? Does this mean hes the oldest of the 3 Necro gods.<br><br>CT -&nbsp; no idea where he came from, hes not an elemental god( who were created by teh nameless right?). So who made him, is it known?<br><br>Inny -&nbsp; No idea here eather.&nbsp; He isnt a elemental god eather.&nbsp; Has he and CT just always been around sence Nameless made the universe?<br><br>Basicly were did they come from, and whos the oldest.<br><br>PS any links to any pertaining lore would be appreciated.<br><div></div>
