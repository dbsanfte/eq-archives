      <description>About 20 different people have made threads about a pvp progression server yet the same 3-5 blue players troll and flame every post trying to get it locked on purpose, since a mod will probably read this eventually, why don't you do your job and actually do something to the people that are flaming and trolling for no reason.&amp;nbsp; Anybody that reads these boards can easily tell the anti-pvp people are being far less mature than the pro-pvp people.&amp;nbsp; If you don't like PvP then don't click on any title that has PvP in it, it's that simple.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's like watching the republicans claiming to be the moral party then going and starting wars and getting innocent people killed, SAME thing here, blue players claim to be mature yet none of them act like it whatsoever and you mods aren't doing anything about it.&amp;nbsp; I don't claim to be the poster child of maturity, but I don't spam the roleplaying forum (if there even is one) all day saying how stupid they are, if i did then i'd get banned, so when blues and roleplayers do it CONSTANTLY to the red players you need to treat them the same way.&amp;nbsp; Devs already said it was fine to post about a PvP progression server in this forum.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Lets see the person that started this thread and was upset with the flaming and trolling has been on each thread that mentioned pvp "trolling". Hmm and he has resorted to labeling people as followers of Hitler, unintelligent, 400 lb woman. I think the posts that this individual makes speak for themselve as to why the population of pvp servers are small.&lt;br&gt;What is a common theme for all these people that post supportive of pvp is that they would come back if there was pvp. There is pvp now and these same peeps quit. Why would soe invest in another server so all these same peeps would quit again as soon as something didn't go their way. They complain about the existing means of playing on a pve server by going red and not being able to be healed by a supposedly inferior blue player. Question, there is who is inferior then? If everything they want is not handed to them on a platter or they dont have that edge of a hack or the quick high of that easy gank they cry and whine and speak of the days when they were somebody. &lt;br&gt;Suck it up boy, go red and play like a man.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;You're right, you are allowed to post about PvP on this forums.&amp;nbsp; Not that I agree with it, since this forum focuses on the Combine server, but that's the Mods decision.&amp;nbsp; But on the same note, we are allowed to post in your PvP threads and disagree with you about them.&amp;nbsp; The Blue players aren't the ones being immature.&amp;nbsp; We aren't the ones calling people idiots and weaklings because they don't like our paticular form of game style.&amp;nbsp; My big problem with PvP is that it fosters the worst people of MMO communities.&amp;nbsp; Just look at the people who start the PvP threads that get locked, or look at WoW and how absolutely obnoxious the majority of the community is.&amp;nbsp; That&amp;nbsp; is predominately due to its PvP nature.&amp;nbsp; I'm sorry, but it's a fact that PvP brings out the worst in people.&amp;nbsp; PvP servers are full of griefers, gankers, and 12 year olds who just like to ruin other peoples gaming enjoyment.&amp;nbsp;</description>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;research the threads that are locked, it is not favortism or anything else, 99.9999 percent of the pvp threads degenerate into nothing but name calling and psuedo hidden offensive comments made by the same genre of people&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>Personally, I think you should go back look at who the mods have to&#xD;
keep editing for personal attacks.&amp;nbsp; Most of them are PvPers (not&#xD;
all, there are a people on both sides who get into mudslinging).&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
Once the thread degenerates into alot of personal attacks, it's easier&#xD;
to lock it than it is to manage it.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Posting an ultimatum and then attacking anyone who disagrees with you is also a great way to get a thread locked.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
btw, this thread is off topic for this forum, it should probably get moved elsewhere&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

I don't think you can get any more on topic than this thread.</description>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;I think the mods have to be somewhat amused by the PvP threads.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I know I am.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Really... in the greater landscape of the genre, PvP in EQ &lt;EM&gt;is&lt;/EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;a waste of time, when you consider that there are so many other mmo's&amp;nbsp;with significantly more&amp;nbsp;meaningful PvP built directly into their game systems - like WW2O, PlanetSide, EVE Online, DAoC, and Puzzle Pirates (yes, Puzzle Pirates :smileyvery-happy: ).&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;At least&amp;nbsp;those games'&amp;nbsp;PvP systems have&amp;nbsp;a reasonable purpose and result, with elements like&amp;nbsp;regional control, relic capture, etc., that aren't just tacked-on afterthoughts&amp;nbsp;created for the sole purpose of&amp;nbsp;catering to a vocal minority.&amp;nbsp;Have you tried the PvP in any of those games? If you enjoy EQ's neutered global PvP systems so much, I can only imagine the hours of joy you'd derive from something with legitimate significance within the context of the greater game world you're playing in. Of course, none of them come &lt;EM&gt;close&lt;/EM&gt; to capturing the sheer fun and PvE bliss that is EQ. There is &lt;EM&gt;that&lt;/EM&gt; rub...&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Comparing&amp;nbsp;feature sets, EQ's PvP is a shallow husk of aimlessness,&amp;nbsp;just about on par with WoW's currently sorry&amp;nbsp;excuse for&amp;nbsp;PvP - sorry, but baubles and trinkets&amp;nbsp;handed down for PvP faction/token grinding do not qualify as meaningful in the context of&amp;nbsp;the overall game world, imho.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Besides, how can any game system, such as a PvE-focused mmo,&amp;nbsp;that allows for&amp;nbsp;such disparate&amp;nbsp;variance in character power (via levels,&amp;nbsp;gear, purchased spells, etc.) that is&amp;nbsp;governed so heavily by individual&amp;nbsp;time&amp;nbsp;investment honestly provide you with a genuinely&amp;nbsp;even playing field for PvP? When you consider it rationally... it doesn't. It only serves as a platform for ganksters and grandiose back-slapping to validate the amount of time&amp;nbsp;players have been&amp;nbsp;&lt;EM&gt;wasting&lt;/EM&gt; on the side in PvE content&amp;nbsp;in the first place.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;OMG!!1!! When it comes down to it, PvP in EQ is&amp;nbsp;wasting time on top of wasting time, a Gordian Knot of time wasted by leveling up,&amp;nbsp;getting ganked, then stewing and leveling up&amp;nbsp;until you can&amp;nbsp;gank them back, only to be grief'd along the way, ganked again, with more leveling, on so forth. It's so &lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;pure&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;, I can't imagine why SOE hasn't made &lt;EM&gt;every&lt;/EM&gt; server completely PvP-enabled to initiate a global&amp;nbsp;timesink deep enough to keep players interested in EQ for seven years or more!!&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;lt;Looks around...&amp;gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;There, does that qualify?&amp;nbsp;Where's my disability check?!?&amp;nbsp; :smileywink:&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;And you accuse the non-PvPers of making personal attacks that get threads closed?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Are you this narrow sighted?&lt;/P&gt;</description>
