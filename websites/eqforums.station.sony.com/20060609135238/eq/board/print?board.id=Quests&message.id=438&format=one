				I'd like to see these quests fully solved.<br><br>So far, all steps apart from the final hand in for both miners seem to work consistently - although I have once seen the pack of picks refused, so this may not be entirely consistent.  The two final handins have almost always failed first time.  I have seen posts saying that a petition returns a confirmation that the quests are "definitely working as intended"; so presumably there is some final trick that we are missing.<br><br>Timers don't seem to be the answer - I have had the ring handed out on first hand in, and not for a long, long time.  This is almost always with an empty zone apart from me, btw.<br><br>The dialog from the miner might be some sort of clue - he always hands back a ring, and three fiery ores, with some comment about one for you, three for me.  On a failed hand in, he some times returns three ores, and sometimes four.  I have tried repeating hand ins multiple times, with no luck.
