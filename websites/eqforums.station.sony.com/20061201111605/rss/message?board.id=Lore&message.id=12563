&lt;P&gt;Oh and Lanys never "took up residence" in Befallen, she was "dead" and being punished in Hate by her father at that time, the whole Primordial Malice cult was an attempt by her followers to resurect Lanys and return her to the Mortal World, she never had any direct influence on them.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Naa... this is me pulling Ez's leg. He made this post a while ago on the Eq2 boards where he pass's himseld off as some sort of EQ god of lore to the "2" crowd.....Hmm now that I think about it..not much different than here! &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;Not so much wrong, as slightly inaccurate description:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Lanys T`Vyl resurfaces under mysterious circumstances and takes up the ancient Takish-Hiz fortress of Befallen as her headquarters.&amp;nbsp; Using her cult, the Primordial Malice, she plans to continue her campaign to kill Firiona, and take over Neriak.&lt;/EM&gt; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Mysterious to the player base at the time, but she herself didn't use the Primordial Malice in the Befallen, nor did she take up residence of her own free will. The Primordial Malice had brought Lanys' body&amp;nbsp;to Befallen in the attempt to bring her back to life. She was dead, her spirit in Hate being tormented by her father for her failure in Kithicor. Lanys played no active role in the occupation of Befallen and events leading up to Lanys' return.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>I recall, quite distinctly at that, that she willingly marched out to Kithicor, and quite willingly declared that she was taking up residence in "The ruins of Takish-Hiz" and then was seen there just before the revamp.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;If it did happen on your server, it was only on your server... I have never heard of that event occuring anywhere else. On Emarr the Dark elf camps in WC and Rathe and the revamp of befallen just "occured" with no fan faire or GM events.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Of course back in 2002 there wasnt realy any "multi-serverwide" event mechanism so GM's and Guides had to travel from server to server to do events or local GM's would put on thier own events on thier server which could&amp;nbsp;vary greatly from server to server.... &lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>I've never spoken to anyone else who participated in the event who *didn't* see Lanys T'Vyl during those encounters.&amp;nbsp; It's possible, however, you simply didn't participate in the events where she was active.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;No event on Karana, only thing that took place was the poof of Befallen taking its new form, and the only live action&amp;nbsp;lore within Befallen distinctly indicated that Lanys was not an active participant in that the Primordial Malice was in Befallen trying to ressurect her.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;On Morell Thule (Now E-Marr) there was no event with Lanys&amp;nbsp;leading it.&amp;nbsp; The short change to Befallen was because the Primordial Malice had taken it over and was trying to resurrect her there.&amp;nbsp; At least that is the lore I recall from that event&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;did a little poking as my memory of the events are a little fuzzy.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Illya's lists a few of the Primordial Malice members who inhabited Befallen in his mob graveyard (he mistakenly call's it Befallen 1.0). Comments posted on the Listings seem to indicate the Original revamp when Lany's people moved in was sometime around July 2001 and the zone was restored to its original undead state (with some changes) in August 2002. Unfortunatly the mobs that were in West Commons, Rathe Mountains and South Ro are no longer listed. so the Old Quests seem to have been lost (not that any actualy worked back then).&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;As I recall the reason for the dropping of the whole story line so abruptly was the Dev who was working on it Quit SoE and took all his notes and code with him..no one else could figure out what he had planned so it was easier to just remove all the Quests and NPC's.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>Having participated in EVERY child of hate event... Lanys was resurrected then usurped control of the cult that sought to bring her back and then used that cults influence to build an army and force her way into power back in neriak&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;part of that heretical GM Event/Live lore that Ridefort is so opposed to included her rebirth (for a time without memories), her hiring of adventurers directly, the ceremony in conjunction with Mayong's High Priestess, other "children of hate" trying to supplant her, and the re-release of hate in which we got to sacrifice some trolls (no gnomes were on hand), the theft of a few major artifacts... etc etc&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;quite a bit of this is available on the old Legends/SOE website (unconcionable to even consider that offical I know) or gasp... available in game in the plane of knowledge via lore books (double gasp!)&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>second and third floor they are usually a few plat apiece... look for a dark elf male for the ones pertinent to Lanys (warning they are rife with misspellings)&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Wasnt that when you were playing on Stormhammer though Nanyea? &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I think its pretty well been conceeded that the "extra" live events that happened on that server cannot be considered "official" as they did not occur on any of the "normal" servers.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>Ya 3rd floor male dark elf, "Fortifying Innoruuk's Realm." Basically Innoruuk wanted a troll sacrifice, there's some troll guy mentioned as well and I looked up him on EQ players and his title does stand as the Sacrifice. Interesting concept, wish they'd use it a bit more and ya the 6-7 books do lack at grammar.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
