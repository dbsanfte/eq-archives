    <title>Suspention of Slime</title>

    <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I have used the Ensnaring Concotion 3 potions for a while now I would usually make up several hundred, I used about 40 per week and being an enchanter I would have tash on the mob and with tash I had about a 85%+ success rate with the III version on all content. I decided to try out the new potions I found 30 Suspention of slime VII on a vendor so bought them and headed to WoS to see if the signet guy was up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I accidently pulled 2 mobs when going for a pet so decided to just off the extra 'Dragorn Vassel', I got the mob to 50% and decided to see how these new potions stacked up.....out of 30 throws I was resisted 30 times with the VII (I think that's the highest vendor component suspension you can make)......&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These new potions as they are are Trash. I got some use out of the old potions but at 1500pp per 100 I could not afford to go wild with them.&lt;br&gt;They were of limited use but I thought not over powered due to their short duration.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My problem is the Ensnaring Concotion 3 was fairly cheap to make and required no drop components. Now in order to get the same effect (not sure it will work as well even then) I must either farm GoD drops (LOL farm god zones, Thats not going to happen) or buy potions in the bazaar for 200+pp per throw.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am not rich I cannot afford to spend 20-25k+ for a stack of potions that before the change required no drop components and cost around 1500p per stack.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maybe you can see the huge gap between what was and what is. Highest Vendor made Potion cannot be used in content I had used the old vendor made potions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maybe I am just nuts when I expect replacments to actually come close to what they are replacing.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;My hope now is that that whole line be retuned to actually be of the limited use it had before. If it isn't I suspect this is the devs way of getting rid of an item without actually just pulling it out of the game.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
