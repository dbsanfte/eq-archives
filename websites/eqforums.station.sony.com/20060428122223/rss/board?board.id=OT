      <description>So what's good for friction blisters? I've done so much raking, sweeping, scrubbing and pressure washing the last few days that the calluses on my hands have once again turned to blisters. &lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

I guess people can't accept that sometimes a person can be crazy unrelated to their interests, and they flip out and kill (or methodically plan and murder but still, it's the person itself most of the time....)</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;OK the Baby is due in just a few weeks. We went to the doctor Monday and he said she is 90% efaced (spelling?) and she's allready 2cm dialated so he could come out at any time. We've got some of the 4D sonogram pictures I'de like to post and the only digital pictures I have of my wife and I are the wedding pics ( they're only 6 months old anyways) but I was wondering how do I put the pictures into my message so ya'll can see us? We don't have PhotoBucket or any of that stuff so I can't link it, but I'de like to just straight up post it so you can just look and see us. BTW, the baby shower is next saturday May 6th at Central Park Baptist Church in Carrollton, Texas on Jackson St. So if anyone wants to give us stuff we could totally use it ( we're poor).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Thanks,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;-Noii&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Ok, I am in total shock that this isn't up and posted already.:smileysurprised:  Can't believe that I'm the one doing it...lol&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Unless things have changed while I was away. Anyhow, most of you know the drill.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Majority of my weekend was spent working outside around the house.  We took the kids to the parade and carnival Saturday. They had fun, which is the most important part. Sadly enough, everyone of us got sunburnt. Nickole (daughter) get the worst. Sunday was spent working around outside and trying to finish up. Other than that, we just laid around, watched tv, and watched the kids played their new PS2 games they got for Easter.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Today, it is cloudy and rainy. :smileysad: Temp wise feels really nice though.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Laters&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Or the Monday thread! What happened this weekend?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well I decided to go to my high school reunion after all, had fun actually. Hung out with the old losers-gang and we all agreed on going out on a fancy dinner thursday :) And best of all, three people came up to me to give me their apologies for treating me the way they did at that time. I guess in the end, going to the dreaded reunion gave me some closure over the most hated period in my life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also finally watched "Chronicles of Narnia", wow oh wow, it's gorgeous! I loved it. And of course tried to find the entrance to Narnia in MY wardrobe, alas no luck there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In between played a little EQ, done some nice guild group outings and got Maedelyn two yellows closer to level 62 :)</description>

(Ignore the date.) &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That was the last time he has ate, and he hasn't been able to keep water down since Tuesday. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He's got strain F parvo. :( Vet confirmed it this morning, but I've suspected it for quite a few days now. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He was put out on our porch Tuesday night because he was barfing. What none of us knew was that he wasn't brought back in. (My brother didn't tell us that he was put out, and that he didn't bring him back in.) &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We spent all day Wendesday hunting him. We figured he'd either went somewhere to die, or that someone had taken him. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He was on the porch this morning when I got up. Coated in red mud, dirt, and leaves. That means he was outside for two days, in the cold rain, and high winds. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I managed to get him to drink a little bit of water, and so far it's staying down. (An improvement over Tuesday, he was barfing even that up then.) &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hopefully I can nurse him back to health. I've tried it with 3 parvo stricken puppies, and I've only lost one so far. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm hoping he'll be the 3rd one I nurse back to health. &lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Sweetpea and I have decided to try something different this year as far as obtaining fresh produce is concerned. We've purchased a share in a &lt;A href="http://www.localharvest.org/farms/M501" target=_blank&gt;local Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) farm&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;We paid $450 up front and beginning the last week of May until the first week of November, each week we will recieve a box of freshly picked vegetables comprised of whatever is ripe that week.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;We figure it's a win/win deal. It's locally grown organic produce. We are suppoting a local business and getting fresh organic produce each week that's already paid for.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;For years I have had an MSN email addy. I want to make another, and want the addy to be MSN and not Hotmail...but every time I try to create a new email account, I am not given the option of MSN, you get a bar to put in your desired email ID, but the last part is already entred as @hotmail.com. How do I get an MSN addy?&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=OT&amp;message.id=154009#M154009</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Lying awake since 3 AM this morning, I've come to the realization that my life stinks.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Everything about it just depresses the hell out of me.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Tired of my job and I have no idea what I want to do next or where to go.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Haven't had a meaningful relationship&amp;nbsp;in more years than I care to count.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I can't seem to do anything right.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I can feel life just passing me by, slipping through my fingers like the sands of time.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I am just completely, totally, utterly depressed.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;My life stinks and I just don't know what to do right now...&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Robert Jordan has contracted a rare and deadly disease called Amyloidosis.  You can read about it on his blog at &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.dragonmount.com/RobertJordan/"&gt;http://www.dragonmount.com/RobertJordan/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The median life expectancy is 4 years.  Here is a post that was made about the disease...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.dragonmount.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=582&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=15"&gt;http://www.dragonmount.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=582&amp;amp;postdays=0&amp;amp;postorder=asc&amp;amp;start=15 &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;div&gt;I work in the medical field and have spoken to a few people about his disease as well as done some research in the literature myself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hematology/Oncologists treat this rare disease and I do have a very good friend who is one and has treated a few people with amyloidosis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am intimately aware of medical miracles when patients who aren't supposed to be around defy the odds and do so. It is true also that a positive attitude, the love and support of friends and family, and near inexhaustible wealth make a huge difference.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All that being said, however, I don't want people to get their hopes up falsely. This is a VERY BAD disease. In many, many respects worse than cancer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The numbers quoted to RJ come from recent reviews from the Mayo Clinic and actually apply only to the healthiest patients with the most minimal amyloidosis. He has one of the worse one with involvement of the heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, I am encouraged by the fact that they are even willing to perform a bone marrow transplant. This immediately stratifies him into a better population. If he can SURVIVE the bone marrow transplant, this will upgrade him yet again. Per my friend, we will know within the next 2 to 3 weeks if the bone marrow transplant went well. In other words, if there's no news of his death by the end of April, he's probably in the clear from the life-ending infections that severely immunocompromised patients get. By June or July he'll also know if he has responded. In other words by the time he gets to his signing (if he survives of course) he may very well know already the results of the bone marrow transplant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Amyloidosis patients have a higher risk of death from bone marrow transplants than standard cancer patients because of the higher incidence of end organ damage from the amyloid depositis. Overall mortality is usually only 5% but is doubled and even tripled for amyloidosis patients.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In general, most die within months without treatment especially if amyloid deposits in the heart. Even with treatment, survival is rare after 4 years. Some series see median survival at 2 rather than 4. Also remember what RJ reminded all of us. This is the MEDIAN and not the MEAN.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In other words out of this series:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3 months, 3 months, 8 months, 1 year, 2 years, 4 years, 4 years, 5 years, 5 years, 5 years, 5 years, 6 years the MEDIAN is 4 years but that does NOT mean RJ has a chance of living 8 years if he's lucky. In fact, patients living longer than 10 years are virtually unheard of in the hematology/oncology literature and those cured can probably be listed on one hand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can RJ beat this? Yes, of course there is a chance. But make no mistake . . . doing so will be a truly remarkable task. This is HARDER . . . EXPONENTIALLY harder than beating cancer. A comparison can't even be made with Lance Armstrong who had a germ cell testicular tumor that has proven suscetibility to chemotherapy. Even the most advanced type with mets to brain and lung have survivals of 50% or so with chemo for choriocarcinoma of the testicles. Amyloidosis is a another ballgame entirely. There is a good reason why they use MEDIANS and not MEANS when they talk about prognosis for this thing. In any case cures for amyloidosis are near mythical. Of those my friend have treated one died in 7 months the other in 2 years. She's never heard of anyone living 30 years or even half that. Here's hoping RJ is the first.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I do know that if we are lucky enough to read his last book there will always be a certain poignancy in knowing that it will likely be the last book he ever writes for his fans . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sorry to be such a downer but I do think there is a lot of misunderstanding about what amyloidosis really is because it is such a weird and rare disease.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I truly hope I'm wrong but I'm prepared for the worst.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It doesn't sound very good.  He is working on the final book in the series now.  Or will be, maybe.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
