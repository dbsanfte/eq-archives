      <description>For some reason after going link dead last night while grinding my mage, I was not able to log back in to my account since it said I had 1 active character. Its been over 16 hours now and I still have that 1 active character on test :/. I am not able to log in with any of my normal servers either. I hav enever given my account name and pass out to anyone in the years I had have this account so it cant be another person. Is anyone else having this bug on test? I really really really want to play right now &lt;span&gt;:smileymad:&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ps. Sorry for my odd name, my brother did it as a joke when I first got my account years ago, I havent found out how to change it yet &lt;span&gt;:smileytongue:&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
