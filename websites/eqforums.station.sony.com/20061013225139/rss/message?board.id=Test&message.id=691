    <title>Transfers or Copies to Test.</title>
    <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Test&amp;message.id=691</link>
    <description>&lt;div&gt;I've read here on the Test Forums about the talks held in PoK to the players of test and the majority seem to not mind the added additions to Test. If it is going to be discussed further or if it has been scrapped, can you let us know by posting something on the boards here or replying to my post please? The way the current copies are being allowed are from high end guilds only. Will you please consider the mid lvl raid characters, the non raiders or as I like to call them, quest junkies. All of these types are in the game and have been here for years, we all should have the right to have our characters copied to Test like others have in the past if we request it. I can't be a high end raider or be in one of those guilds since I have limited time due to real life, going with the current status for copies being brought here. I not even considered. If copies are going to be allowed to the server, please consider all classes and characters. If transfers are going to be allowed, please post to let folks know where to sign up.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Thank you for your time,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Yushu - Iksar Monk&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Let us play a little game, a purely hypothetical game, a game that has no basis in fact or reality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;What IF an SoE employeee transfered a Test Server character to a Live Server for reasons they felt were legitimate.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now what happens if this is made into a big time public issue, debate?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Does it&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) Serve any constructive end?&lt;br&gt;2) Is it a big distraction to SoE Employee's as a group?&lt;br&gt;3) WIll it most likely establish a policy that prohibits this action?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;What IF SoE by Policy selectivly copies/transfers characters from a Live Server to Test Server for reasons they felt were legitimate. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Now what happens if this is made into a big time public issue, debate?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Does it&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) Serve any constructive end?&lt;br&gt;2) Is it a big distraction to SoE Employee's as a group?&lt;br&gt;3) WIll it most likely establish a policy that prohibits this action?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Has anyone ever heard the old Cliche &amp;quot;The very few ruin it for all the rest&amp;quot;?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Do you believe that generalization is untrue?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;All of the above is purely a whimsy, a pure fabrication of what if's to try to think through what the real world realities might be&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You end up with 2 options and only 2 Options.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) Public use /testcopy charname&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) Some Committe/Group takes applications for consideration to copy a character(s) to Test Server.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yes that is the only two main means to do it via a Public Domain mechanism.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is simply no logistical way for Test Server to accomodate the potential for /testcopy.  It can only create a chaotic environment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For there to be a public announcement of SoE choosing who gets copied and who doesnt, can do only one thing.  The rejected people will raise the issue to monumentaly ugly proportions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Both scenarios do one thing very clearly, they distract SoE Employees from doing their job.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Test Server population is not there to be a distraction to the SoE Employee's!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by EnigmaMaitreya on &lt;span class="date_text"&gt;04-12-2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;10:44 AM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It caused no public outcry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. It did serve a constructive end. Customer satisfaction.&lt;br&gt;2. The transfers did not cause a distraction. The backlash from an item wipe did.&lt;br&gt;3. The policy that was established was to never wipe test in any way again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Live characters have been copied to Test. It caused no public outcry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. It did serve a constructive end. Customer Satsifaction, and effective testing.&lt;br&gt;2. It was not a distraction. If anything, it made the jobs of the devs easier, having qualified players testing the content. That is not to be construed as a dig on Test players. Only that Test does not have any players experienced in raiding the higher zones in the game.&lt;br&gt;3. Kyth made it quite clear that a firm policy has NOT been established. The options are all still open. If anything, copies/transfers are a less preferred option.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Do I believe the few ruin it for the rest? Yes, I believe you do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There has been no fabrication. These are the actual facts. Yours closed mind prevents you from seeing that there are in fact, more than 2 options. There are more than 2 options available that SoE even put forth as options. I am sure you didn't like them though, as they would require social interaction. Nevertheless, they exist:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. Transfers. Not copies, transfers. Let me say it again for you. TRANSFERS. I am not advocating copies, nor will I. I believe opening Test up to transfers &lt;i&gt;similar to Live servers,&lt;/i&gt; is the best answer. After all, isn't a close approximation of a Live server the goal here? So we can play normally in an environment that replicates live servers, so that bugs are eliminated before making it to live servers?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. Invite by current Test player.  This was presented as a possibility previously. By having Test players make the invites, they we re responsible for the quality of player that was brought in. Merit in the eyes of active Test players becomes the only criteria.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I agree. Test is not here to be a distraction to SoE. But anyone who works in any service business will tell you that customer satisfaction is the number one priority. Transfers to Test allow for new players on Test that will consider Test their home. After all, we are talking about moving their main character here. Nearly every person who has suggested transfers has said so. Yet, you refuse to acknowledge that request. You lump copies and transfers into one category, and then argue points that are irrelevant to those wanting to transfer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; If you want to speak to the subject of transfers, and there appropriateness, I welcome the conversation. I am honestly curious how bringing my main to Test, and Test only, is harmful to the community. Otherwise, I am tired of your drivel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Jerlan, enough is enough.  I dont flame you on the boards and I dont flame you in game.  Even after you stated dozens of lies I still refrained from engaging in comments directly to you.  I expect the same common courtesy from you.  You are entitled to your opiniion and I fully agree that you do.  So stop with all this grade school sandbox bickering to me, I dont care. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I thought we discussed this ingame and came to a relaization that you and I both disagree and to leave it at that. &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks Kytherea for the answers most of us figured that but we were getting of hereing the long winded guy talking to himself again and assuming he knows what SOE thinks.  We have seen alot of people moving to test and it has been great.  I have been on the server since the day after the wipe and it is definately the greatest community around.  But we can use more people so we can raid the higher end content.  I would never agree to copies as most test people as it bring people not commited but I would agree to a permanent transfer to test if we end up needing a higher population.  Our guild has had alot of new people join us in the last few weeks and we have been helping them feel a part of the comunity.  These people are good quality people and its nice to see the fresh faces.  The biggest part of the people moving over I have found is from the advertising of test server.  Most people don't even know we exist so once they find out and the benifits it doesn't take long to get people moving.  I have read these boards for years and not posted much but jeeze Engima please quit flapping your gums in the wind, I have seen so many of your long winded posts and its almost as if your just talking to yourself to be heard.  I think you need a job or something to keep you busy as you can go on and on.  If you have something constructive and knowledgable to say then say it if not don't assume you are talking for SOE.  Sorry I needed to vent, I feel better now!  Anyway if anyone is new to the server and is serious about playing look me up and I will try to make you feel welcome as I am sure most on the server will.  I promiss if your a half decent person you will find no better server to be on than test, we are a true community and generally we try to help each other out and treat each other with respect.  So if your are new or thinking of coming to test then welcome aboard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;:smileyhappy:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Munke/Azasin/Hunteress/Shadowdance/Shadowbaane/Neraste Ect.

That doesn't exactly sound like a hard line stance against copies, not to mention transfers. That was at the server meeting back in March. Where have you seen anything since, from the Devs, saying that transfers and copies would not be allowed?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;While you haven't come out and called production players 'morons', your posts have certainly characterized them as such....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#6633ff"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Who is going to deal with the issues caused by WAAAAA They chose Joe and Not me WAAAAA they like Joe better than me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#6633ff"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Oh I came as a 50 now I made 70 in short order, raided the guild bank and I DEMAND OFF HERE.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#6633ff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#6633ff"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh how many SoE employees are going to be assigned to asnwere the constant complaint of WHat the heck you mean the server is going down for a quick patch, the zone is being repop'd every 3 minutes.  I knew SOE couldnt do squat right and here is the proof.  They cant eve keep the Bazaar zone up for 3 minutes&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And that is just from this thread. You characterize production players as unable to understand the purpose and intention of Test. You portray them as whiners, who want everything, without working for it. And frankly I find it offensive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But, since you think I am the one dealing in misquotes, misstatements and fabrications, please feel free to point them out. The real facts are that SoE wants a larger player base on Test. They have opened the floor to ideas, and presented the idea of transfers/copies themselves. All of these &amp;quot;tired old pointless threads&amp;quot; are other players chiming in with support for those ideas. You claim that the number of players who want transfers possible is a minority, yet the opinions put forth here and in the server meeting would seem to indicate otherwise. The only person I see here fighting against the idea of transfers/copies is you. Of course, you can't, or won't, give a reason for why you think this is a bad idea. I believe your exact words were:&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#6633ff"&gt;I appologize for remaing steadfast in the specific use of my words and the intentionaly being vague.  That will not change.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;This is what I have seen from your posts. If you think anything I say here is a misrepresentation, please feel free to call me on it, and I will be happy to show you exactly where I got it from. Regardless of the number of people who think transfers are a valid option, you think they are a bad option. You have strong, sound reasons for what you believe, but you aren't willing to share those reasons. Furthermore, you believe Test is just fine as it is, and doesn't need more people. Your personal enjoyment is derived from getting things by yourself without help. Yet, you feel as though you are part of a strong community. And despite your enjoyment derived from earning it yourself, you want the Devs to make items that are difficult to attain, more available. But, you think that production servers are item focused, but Test is not.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just curious, is there a side of this argument you haven't been on? My overwhelming impression is that you are upset that Sony wants more people over here. You think they are wrong for how they want to run their Test server, and anything that supports a larger population must immediately be shot down as absurd, regardless of its validity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So what ARE you adding that is constructive?&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>There isnt going to be any /testcopy /testmove other than in these tired old pointless threads trying to pretend there is an overwhelming demand for it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The OP assertion that the majority ... is so totaly wrong it wasnt even worth replying to.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gee yes sir, lets put a /testcopy in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now comes Patch day on the Live servers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1% of 400,000 characters say Oh lets go play on Test Server.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4,000 characters show up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They all go to PoK and start oocing &amp;quot;Looking to .....&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thats right lets make it a command so that all the servers can migrate all their characters to a single server.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh, you say well maybe not /testcopy /testmove but a forum to be signed up for copying.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh Ok who is going to pick the SoE team that decideds who is and who isnt?  Who is going to deal with the issues caused by WAAAAA They chose Joe and Not me WAAAAA they like Joe better than me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh who is going to deal with Oh I came as a 50 now I made 70 in short order, raided the guild bank and I DEMAND OFF HERE.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh how many Devs (note there are no official GM's on test) are going to be spending their entire work day resolving the ..... people problems caused when 4K players show up?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh how many SoE employees are going to be assigned to asnwere the constant complaint of WHat the heck you mean the server is going down for a quick patch, the zone is being repop'd every 3 minutes.  I knew SOE couldnt do squat right and here is the proof.  They cant eve keep the Bazaar zone up for 3 minutes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is no logistical means to do what you want.&lt;br&gt;It servers no purpose other than to save YOU personaly a few hours effort.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>The methodology exists, as well as the commands. To suggest otherwise is patently false.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The mass transfer of new players to a server has happened and been dealt with. Ask Stromm.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;People in PoK ooc'ing for groups might actually be a good thing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A bazaar being used as .... a bazaar.... might be a unique twist.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Test is a testing environment, subject to interruptions and bugs. That is, was and always will be clear. Production players aren't the morons you make them out to be. We get it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Transfers off of any server take 6 months. That has already been established. Don't like it? Get over it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for my few hours... in the last week, I have leveled a character to 59 on Test, and will be 70 by the weekend. And, I wold transfer my toon from Stromm in a heartbeat, through a paid transfer, if they let me. I have joined the server, leveled on Test, joined a guild on Test, participated in the community on Test, and I would still transfer to Test today. So, now what is the reason I shouldn't be able to?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or is it possible that you just want Test to yourself, that you like the high barrier of entry, and that a functional test environment, closely approximating a production server really isn't something you give a **SMURF** about?&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
