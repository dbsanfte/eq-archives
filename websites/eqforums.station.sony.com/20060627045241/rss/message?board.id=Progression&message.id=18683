      <description>Well, how about we try a different approach. Out of these dps classes, which would be the most fulfilling: Mage, Rogue, Ranger (I know rangers don't get good till much, much later with AA's)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The thought of being able to bring strong dps to a group, but not be as heavily relied upon as say a cleric or a warrior seems pretty intriguing as well. How do these 3 classes stand up in the end game?&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;I love the rogues.&amp;nbsp; A rogue will always be my main.&amp;nbsp; At the low end, especially on the progressive server they are going to be tough, make no mistake about it.&amp;nbsp; But people playing on the prog server aren't playing there because it's easy.&amp;nbsp; Once you get your epic and/or your sky belt your dps will really go up.&amp;nbsp; Like the warrior, rogues are heavily gear dependant and although they have slightly more utility due to poisons and stealth capabilities, it is minimal and won't go a long ways toward getting you groups.&amp;nbsp; Expect to have your skills maxed at all times though because those times that you are called upon to use them, you will be expected to know your stuff.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;High end rogues are a different game entirely.&amp;nbsp; They are challenging and require constant attention to every move the mob or the tank makes.&amp;nbsp; A rogue at the high end is a very busy fellow indeed, well, if he's a good rogue he will be.&amp;nbsp; The class, from low to high is rfar and away the most enjoyable that I have played.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;The&amp;nbsp;knights have dps issues at various times in this match up.&amp;nbsp; But for the most part your instincts seem good to me.&amp;nbsp; The package you get for hybridizing your tank will prolly bring most people the most fun if they arnt going to tank for raids.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;Warrior is a painful class but they are the center of the world in raids.&lt;BR&gt;I would say: be a warrior if you're a "watch-me watch-me" kind of person :smileyvery-happy:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Warriors rule as tanks the further along in the game we get.&amp;nbsp; Enchanters don't so much and become more of a buffing class later.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Early in EQ there are a lot of viable tank options beyond warriors with hybrids being able to tank pretty much as well, if not better in a lot of cases due to the ability to spell taunt.&amp;nbsp; But once kunark hits a gap is created between warriors and these other classes that widens further as the game goes on placing warriors firmly on top as the key tanks.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Enchanters are amazing as well, as they are the premiere crowd control class in EQ and are vital to caster buffs and have the best haste buffs in the game....They also do some amazing things with charm at a various points.&amp;nbsp; Eventually, though, CC becomes less of a factor.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;It's worth noting also that as CC becomes less effective, the need for additional warriors beyond the Main Tank on raids goes up to off-tank or "tank mezz" adds.&amp;nbsp; A perfect example is the Emp Ssra raid where half of the adds are mezzable by enchanters, the other half are not and must be offtanked.&amp;nbsp; In fact this encounter could be considered the moment in EQ history where the shift flips over in favor of Warriors tank mezzing over traditional CC.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Both classes are really amazing and I don't think you could go wrong with either.&amp;nbsp; It's just worth noting that their roles evolve as the game progresses and you should be looking at what you want to be doing in the long haul when you choose your main.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The problem with this whole thing is, A paladin was able to virtually stun lock a lot of mobs up until Planes of Power where stun immunity kicked in making them breathtakingly powerful. Also even if they couldn't lock the mob via stuns, they can mitigate a lot of damage by stunning. If i were going to play a tank on the progression server i hate to say it, but i'd pick a paladin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Rogues are currently number one in terms of raw DPS at the high end, but they are a very group/guild dependent class. If you have to spend long periods LFG, you probably won't enjoy a rogue because they don't solo very well. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Between Ranger and Mage, I would take Mage initially, because of the more powerful spell damage and the pet DPS. The ranger will be behind the mage until a few expansions open and he is able to get geared properly. &lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;You forgot a DPS class, monk!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Monk have utility and will have a LOT of utility for the first few months of the game since (bards) our most current pulling adversary isnt gona have their line of spells to allow pulling. Pulling will have to be done the old fashion way and monks i would expect are gona be quite sought after like we once were.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;DPS wise monks will be quite good probably till Luclin were rogues will catch up and pass us. That being said when i was raiding Anguish i would parse up there with the rogues and depending on the buffs i would get i could do more DPS then them. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I recall all my Vox and Naggy raids were it was very costly to summon a wiped raid. I can pull any corpses out of Vox lair (including the tunnels bellow her lair) and Naggy fairly quickly&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Another reason why to play a monk? We look cool with the strap looks on us! Monk can solo quite well in the old world with bandage wound and mend. I guess i am totally and 100% biased since i've always played a monk and this time is no exception!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;Bards get lull at some point around level 10 iirc, been a long time, never had any trouble pulling as a bard more or less from the time I started grouping, they won't have their get out of jail free cards but then they&amp;nbsp;allow the group to run away really fast. Not to mention they are far superior soloers. But each to their own!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>Well so what of the Cleric or Enchanter route? Basically, I'm looking for a class that is going to bring me the most group fulfillment, while being an important cornerstone for the group. Between the Ench, Cleric, or Warrior, which is going to be the easiest to get set up into a good group/guild/raid position without have to work my you know what off every day to maintain credibility and usefulness?&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;I would think enchanter, but cleric maybe. Depends on how many people decide to bot clerics rather than just play them. I've played all the classes, and warrior is the toughest road of those you mentioned, but also potentially the most fulfilling. It all depends on what you're willing to put into it.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;I don't know how it will be initially on the new server, but Enchanters aren't really considered essential anymore, except as mana buff bots. Bards have been the kings of CC for a while now. If you want to get lots of invites play a cleric, if you want to get lots of re-invites, play a&amp;nbsp;cleric &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;well. &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I have been in EQ2 since it came out so am not aware of any class changes in the last year and a half or so but my main was a Warrior since January of 2000, my top two alts where Cleric then enchanter. ill go over a few pro's and cons I had (or remember).&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Warrior was lvl 67 and a ton of fun, but there was a lot of waiting for groups, My mains will always be warriors because of the fun I did have though. Armor will come in time it is very important not to just have normal gear but resist gear to if you plan to raid.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Cleric was lvl 65 I only played him when I felt lazy, in my opinion (views may vary) was a very easy class to play and very easy to get groups and money from ressing/buffing. But for me wasnt as much fun standing in the back casting as it was to tank.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Enchanter was lvl 41 I got real sick and tired of people expecting me to summon/buff/CC all while they where chain pulling, There just isnt enough mana, you will always be out of mana. You will always have people that Need this buff or Need a certain summoned item you just cant do it fast enough to much to deal with at once and the only real money buff is clarity/breeze line.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Only advice I can give is if you like being up front and actualy fighting when in a group be a warrior. If you want to make money and get groups easily be a cleric. If you want to be wined to constantly and over worked and under paid and stuff, be an enchanter heh.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I played a Warrior for the large majority of the time I spent in EQ, and did eventually get to the end game. This was in the GoD-OoW era. But, I never really did MT for any guilds, which really didn't bother me all that much. I always felt useful to a group when I was able to tank for them and do a good job of it. The only real problem is that you need high-end gear if you want to remain competitive and leave an impression on people to ask you back if they need an excellent tank. Unfortuntely, it's not all skill with a Warrior; equipment is a huge portion of the class. If you can manage getting into an end-game guild without MT'ing, which is basically what I did, then a Warrior is great fun and you will always feel like you are bringing something to a group. Also, as an aside, picking up those mitigation AAs is a rewarding experience. &lt;span&gt;:smileyvery-happy:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But, here's the dark side. Many times, I would have to go LFG for near or upwards of an hour before getting a group. This was a problem throughout all levels, pretty much. Also, when doing side items such as the Vex Thal key and the like, which certainly aren't popular for groups, then it is rather important to have a friend or relative playing a complimentary class to you so you are able to duo/trio the more tedious things. I guess boxing is also an option here. Additionally, Warriors are usually pretty poor at solo'ing things and traveling alone. Until you can come by some clicky items (i.e. cobalt greaves/incarnadine breastplate for invis), running through the more dangerous areas without SoW/Invis handy can be nerve-wracking. Oh yeah, and tanking in Kod'taz/MPG groups will keep you on your toes with those occasional purple clubs. &lt;span&gt;:smileytongue:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ultimately, if you like the idea of being a tough tank for a group, (usually) never fearing to take the heavy damage, and picking up those shiny plate armors and sharp weapons, then a Warrior is the class for you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>I play a warrior, and would not play any other class as my main.  Hands down, to my mind, it is the most fun class in EQ.  For nonraiders, there are some certain concerns for warriors, and it is a hard path, but it is also certainly doable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a warrior, we are 100 % gear dependent.  To be good, expect to spend alot of time and effort on getting gear.  This is compounded by the fact that warriors solo poorly, making it some what harder to farm cash for upgrades.  We have no utility, and so depend on potions and such...get used to being poor, and carrying alot of crap(utility weapons and potions).  It's just part of the warrior way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The downsides to being a warrior are pretty steep, but to my mind, the upside makes it well worth it.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;I would think it will be rough being a warrior. Warriors at the high end are very much dependent on having all the latest gear and AA's. Plan on being a devoted guild raider if you want to take a warrior to the high end, because once you miss a few raids and fall off the curve it will be hard to get back on again.</description>
