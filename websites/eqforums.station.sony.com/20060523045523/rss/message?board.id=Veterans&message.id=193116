    <description>Would you like the 25% slow shamans get, or how about the 40% infectious slow that will kill any shaman who tries to use it? Your spells might not be so great, but try to use it in different context. Perhaps it's not meant to be dropped before each mob is pulled, maybe you should drop it afterwards(Will traps go off if a mob is already in camp? I don't know, I don't have mine yet), or strategically place it  in different areas where adds might come from, so that you can kite any add that comes in before it wipes out cleric. Have to be on the ball for it, but hey. There's different uses for everything, eh?&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Wizard Aura not working</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Veterans&amp;message.id=193096#M193096</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;(Prelude, for most part I'm starting this off to be humorous, but with serious point)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The level 55, and level 70 aura's arent working.. Apparently they summon a trap that generates agro towards us instead of doing something realatively useful like say berserkers get crit chance mods, monks get dodge/parry/block/etc mods, warriors get +AC.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Wizards get a trap that will go off on incoming and generate VERY early agro towards the wizard that the wizard doesnt want. For warriors hey thatd be kinda cool.. but the idea of setting a trap in the corner your raid pulls bertoxxulous, or cazic thule to. That DD's a god that can more or less turn you into a pancake before anyone ever knew what happened.. sounds pretty useless to me.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It appears to the general EQ wizard population that someone honestly doesn't like wizards. Anything cool gets nerfed, and when beta rolls around for new expantions and an amazingly large number of a wizard population says &amp;quot;wow.. that sucks.. this all we get? thats kind of disapointing&amp;quot; I dont quite understand why someone that makes these decisions doesnt take a hint, but instead says and I quote: this is what your getting, deal with it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Now while on the positive points of view (which no I have not ignored) One lowresist root that, as I hear it, breaks more often than our current greater fetter..  While the others can be considered &amp;quot;efficient spells&amp;quot; 1 rather extremely random version of claw of vox that can be used on mobs resistant to cold. 2 very efficient, but incredibly high recast, with incredibly high dangers involved.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The trap ability has no practicle purpose. We (in general) don't want it. Ok so its efficient. But like I mentioned it's highly countered by being dangerous. and slow. And to a wizard, we are not meant to handle dangerous. We get close to ONE rounded by trash mobs, and thats WITH 10k hps. (and even then in group situations Im not max buffed, Im normally running around with 8k. and a mob that quads for 1700, + a kick/bash=stun = dead wizard) Thats a quick equation to a very dead wizad. Thats why AE rains aren't used frequently. AE rains are nice, but in a way they're a little bit more controllable. Slowly in comparison our class in general looses out and a lot of people are disapointed. I know that as a buisness, you MUST be discussing, and agreeing and weighing benifit to cost and comparison to other classes, which really says to me, that you have chosen to irritate a specific group of players again and agian and again. Ok I'm pretty patient, and I'm extremely respectful, I do my best to understand that a lot of our abilities are in weigh to avoid being over-powerful. Alright.. we havn't been 'overpowerful' since kunark. Or luclin and -that- is pushing it to say we were overpowerful then.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If someone somewhere that actually has things to do with making the decisions on why wizards are starting to suck, hates the class or something please say so. If you want to 'obsolete' a class that is 'broken' or get rid of those players who have been happy patient people for many years. Please.. Say SOMETHING. I will be happy to not bother asking. Sure you'll loose out on subscriptions from a handful of people, sure people wont buy PoR.. but what are YOU trying for anyways, create a fun class, or get rid of a class that used to be fun. Thats my question..&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And no, plain and simple im not creating dissention, the dissention is already there. The opinions are already here, You created it. Heres your postit note, trash can it or remember to get around to it. Want to talk one on one with someone who is willing to talk peacefully respectfully. I'm sure there are many many many others besides myself who can or will take time to come up with reasonable non overpowering ideas that make the class fun again.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Want that special mob?  Drop a trap on his spawn point.  You win first aggro and your group gets the drop. You just gotta know where it's spawn point is....:smileywink:</description>

Without doing damage to the mob. Wether it was intended to generate that much agro or not, it can/will and has been used to out agro pally's and shadowknights CHAIN casting thier hate spells. So..  knowing that makes pulling a mob off soandso kinda easy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
