&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;Spell Suggestions (no particular order) :&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Make Decession able to be cast out of group (with confirm box)&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Chromatic Draught - 1000-1100 damage range, fast cast time, uses chromatic resist.&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Draughts in general - should be doing in the 1300-1400 damage range (keeping cast times the same and increasing mana cost) &lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Single-target snare (Lure based) &lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Improved Invis (cast on others) - Nothing is more annoying than casting Invisibility on someone at level 65 and having it wear off 10 seconds later. &lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;New Concussion - Should reduce agro by an amount in the ballpark of 800-1000 (twice as much as original Concussion) &lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;New Pillar Spells - We havent had a serious upgrade to this line in three expansions and it is the backbone of wizard solo'ing. Some new pillar spells doing in the 1400-1600 damage range with increased mana costs to reflect the damage increase would be nice.&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;New Lure Spells - covered in detail in the wizard issues thread. &lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;New Harvest Spell&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;AA Ideas (no particular order):&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Mind Clash (20 AA) - 90 minute re-use timer AA, unresistable which instantly reduces agro by 5000 (9 casts of ancient concussion). Primary purpose being on raids. Wizards currently have no agro control against high end raid monsters. Concussion is fine for MITIGATING agro, but in terms of emergency use - e.g. summoned by a monster that does 8000 dmg a round - there is a dire need for some sort of last resort for a high-end wizard who has been summoned by a monster which can kill it in 1 round of combat. The 90-minute re-use timer makes it fair so as not to unbalance the class in group situations yet addresses perfectly the issue of agro control in a raid environment. Prerequisite: Exodus&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;AA that lasts 1 minute (144 minute reuse) that reduces the casting time on all spells by half and sets recast delay to 0. (Could also do 3 levels for 30:60:90 seconds)&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Chromatic Familiar (25 AA) - Combined focus effects of the 3 GoD Familiars along with the mana regen and resists of allegiant familiar - requires all 3 GoD familiars and Allegiant Familiar as prerequisites. &lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Spell Casting Subtlety Mastery (3 levels - 5/10/15 AA) - further reduces agro generated per spell. &lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;AA that reduces Harvest of Druzzil recast time (3 levels, each reduces by a minute - 5/10/15 AA)&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;AA to reduce the resist check for all spells (3 levels, each with a -10 resist check to add - 10/15/20 AAs)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Comments:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;(1) The Wizard community feels that PoK has trivialized many of the zones. We hope in GoD that porting will play much more of a role in transportation as it did in Kunark and Velious expansions. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;(2) Leader ability: Mana regeneration&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;(3) Raise the worn mana regeneration cap to 25&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;(4) Make some of the spells quested (We all loved the Concussion spell quest, think of making&amp;nbsp;chromatic draught or new concussion an involved quest similar to concussion)&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;(5) Also consider making some of these spells only able to be obtainable through the research skill (and have runes drop throughout the new zones WITHOUT NO DROP flag)&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;(6) By far in my opinion (and others echoed in the thread) - the AA we all desire to see most is the one described as Mind Clash. In any raid encounter from Plane of Time and higher, as a wizard if you get agro, you have a 95% chance of dying. This AA will be a one shot 'mega concussion' - with the same rules applying. It should NOT be able to wipe a wizard from the agro list completely like mem blur or fade. It is merely meant to allow the wizard a split second chance to cast the AA and allow the tank to gain control of the monster again. By having a long recast time it prevents trivializing the role of agro for a wizard while at the same time eliminating the frustration of having to wait 15 minutes getting buffs and mana back after a death in a raid cause by casting 1 too many draughts. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
