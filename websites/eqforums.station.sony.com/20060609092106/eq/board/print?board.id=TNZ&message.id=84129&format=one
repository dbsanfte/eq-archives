<P>Ya, the full document was really good.&nbsp; Would be nice if he would give permission to append it.&nbsp; That way if he won't get bombarded with emails every couple of days.&nbsp; I assume there was a reason he wouldn't post the document on the boards and wanted to email it privatly.</P>

<P>No secret reason for not posting it.&nbsp; The FAQ shown above is about 1 and 1/2 pages done up in Microsoft Word.&nbsp; The Guide is about 5+ pages in Word.</P>
<P>I think the FAQ is almost too long, but the info is valid (maybe the actual numbers need to be reparsed), but the theory is sound.&nbsp; The quests however while valid are dated and the truth of it, I have done little to no factioning in a LONG time and as such I have not updated my guide in a while. (I started adding a date in the header which I change when I do modify it).</P>
<P>Also, I have no immediate plans to faction for any area.&nbsp; I joined&nbsp;the best guild and taken a new set of responsibilities therein (and anyone who factions will tell you, factioning&nbsp;is pretty much a solo venture).&nbsp;</P>
<P>And truth is I receive very few requests for it anymore.&nbsp; Seems factioning is a dying art.&nbsp; If you want to add to it in any way, by all means do so.&nbsp; Just don't change any info I originally wrote (as I can only vouch for that which I have done) and never charge anyone anything (not even a foraged vegetable) for a copy.</P>
