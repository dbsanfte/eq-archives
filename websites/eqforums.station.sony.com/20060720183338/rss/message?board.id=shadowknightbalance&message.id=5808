&lt;P class=MsoNormal 0pt; 0in **Zowie**?MARGIN: TEXT-ALIGN: justify?&gt;&lt;SPAN Verdana? FONT-FAMILY: **Zowie**?FONT-SIZE: 10pt;&gt;Shadowknights&lt;xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" &gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;SPAN Verdana? FONT-FAMILY: **Zowie**?FONT-SIZE: 10pt;&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;1. Harm Touch: &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;-The damage per level of the non AA HT has fallen behind. From levels 1-40 it gave an additional 10 damage per level, from levels 41 to 65 it gave an additional 30 damage per level, and from levels 66 to 70 there is only a 10 damage per level increase. We would like the amount of damage HT gives per level from levels 66+ to be adjusted to something more appropriate such as 50/level or atleast 30/level.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;-Improved Harm Touch should refresh on death, it originally did and was changed around the time GoD was released. We feel this change is fair since the Paladin counterpart Improved Lay Hands is capable of refreshing on death&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;-Paladins recieve two Lay Hands variants through AA's (Hand of Piety and Improved Lay Hands). These AA's are on seperate timers and one won't block the other from working. SK's recieve two HT variants through AA's as well (Improved Harm Touch and Leech Touch) however, these are on the same timer allowing only one to be used every refresh (36-72 min depending on AA's). We feel that it would be appropriate for Improved Harm Touch to be on the same timer as regular Harm Touch with Leech Touch on it's own seperate timer just as the Paladin counterparts to these AA's are. In addition to this Leech Touch should have the same recycle time as Hand of Piety once on seperate timers.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;-Improved Harm Touch could use a look at the damage it provides. Since it becomes aviable at level 59 it's base damage remains at 1000 damage and does not increase, infact without AA's to improve its damage this HT is less powerful than the normal one starting at level 61. We would like the damage of IHT to have the same base damage of our regular HT so that it is in all senses an improved Harm Touch.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;-Lifetap HT needs the name of it's hotkey changed from Leech Curse to Leech Touch or Life Curse (name of the aa in the aa window or of the spell it casts), our level 60 discipline is called Leechcurse and having multiple abilities sharing the same name can be confusing.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;-Our lifetap HT needs to have the ability to be focused with disease damage increasing effects as well as having the capability of being enchanced by our Unholy Aura discipline.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;-Improved Harm Touch is rather difficult to get higher end focus effects for. In order to make focus effects for our HT more common we would like Improved Harm Touch changed to magic resist with a massive negative resist modifier such as -1000 or -5000 so that it's still effectively unresistable but has a greater selection of focus. This would allow people far more freedom in choosing gear and not force SK's to carry around old gear to swap in simply for a HT however if done we would also like Unholyaura to not change IHT's resist check to disease if it would.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;2. In fights where the content is weaker or the mob has a high DB but low DI a class more focused on avoidence makes a better tank than a class more focused on mitigation. We feel that tank classes should always be able to outtank a non tank class of similar gear regardless of the content. For this reason we would like something such as an innate level of shielding for all 3 tank classes to help on group content such as this. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;3. SK's and Paladins are the only melee classes without a form of Parry/Riposte/Dodge disc. We would like one for emergency situations. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated) - Most likely this will be considered as part of the class re-envisioning &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;4. Our Terror spells prior to Terror of Discord are inadequete for their job. With some of the proposed changes to spell based aggro and to fear it becomes more important now than before to fix these lower end taunt spells so that they provide decent aggro for SK's who don't have their OoW taunt spells as well as the fact that higher level SK's will be losing a source of non damage aggro and will need to rely on working lower level terrors to ensure we still maintain adequete non damage aggro. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;5. Shadowknight group utility is rather low compared to that of most classes, with the invent of the guild lobby one of our bigger methods of helping people has vanished as people would much rather summon in the lobby than run back for us to summmon. As a result we would like to recieve the Convergence spell to increase our usefulness in some areas where our desireability isn't very high. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;6. Our Aura/Theft lines of spells (Aura of Hate, Aura of Pain, Aura of Darkness, Theft of Hate, Theft of Pain) have recourses which cannot be clicked off. We would like for these buffs to be clickable, in addition to this the group spells (all but the Pain line) should goto the short duration buff box. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;7. A bump from 25% to 30% on Soul Shield with an increase of the rune from 10,000 to 12,000. The reason for this is that in most cases there is no ingame difference between using the 61 and 69 disciplines, in the rare situations where the 61 disc will run out before the 69 disc (situations where dps intake is 800+) debuffs are already in and heals are stabilized resulting in no significant differences between the two abilities as they are currently. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;8. Mobs swing faster as they get higher level, with GoD we had lots of trouble channeling spells and in Omens mobs continue to hit faster but we recieve no increase to channeling. All hybrids flat out need higher channeling to perform their jobs better. It also makes sense from a game standpoint because it's our job to cast while being hit. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated) - Most likely this will be considered as part of the class re-envisioning &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;9. We would like to have the same Dodge/Parry/Riposte skillcaps as Warriors &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated) - Most likely this will be considered as part of the class re-envisioning &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;10. Since the release of GoD the number of caster mobs in zones has gone up tremendously, this is causing many SK's that pull difficulties which slow us down significantly if not in some cases make an SK attempting to FD pull impossible. Many SK's view pulling as their secondary role and would like to be capable in it just as other classes such as Monks enjoy being capable in their two biggest roles of pulling and dps. To help with this we would like a way to help prevent our feigns from being broken by spells.&amp;nbsp; &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being discussed) - Most likely this will be considered as part of the class re-envisioning &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN **Oompa-Loompa**?COLOR: red?&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;4. We would like the Terror line to be all 1 second cast spells, keeping up with Paladins early in fights is now too difficult with their improved stun aggro. Additionally the Terror line prior to Terror of Discord needs to generate higher levels of hate. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;10. Increase the chance of Willful Death to not break FD when spells are casted on you, it currently parses at 20/40% at max level, 50-60% on unresisted spells would be nice. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;1. Harm Touch: &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;-The damage per level of the non AA HT has fallen behind. From levels 1-40 it gave an additional 10 damage per level, from levels 41 to 65 it gave an additional 30 damage per level, and from levels 66 to 70 there is only a 10 damage per level increase. We would like the amount of damage HT gives per level from levels 66+ to be adjusted to something more appropriate such as 50/level or atleast 30/level.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;-Improved Harm Touch should refresh on death, it originally did and was changed around the time GoD was released. We feel this change is fair since the Paladin counterpart Improved Lay Hands is capable of refreshing on death&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;-Paladins recieve two Lay Hands variants through AA's (Hand of Piety and Improved Lay Hands). These AA's are on seperate timers and one won't block the other from working. SK's recieve two HT variants through AA's as well (Improved Harm Touch and Leech Touch) however, these are on the same timer allowing only one to be used every refresh (36-72 min depending on AA's). We feel that it would be appropriate for Improved Harm Touch to be on the same timer as regular Harm Touch with Leech Touch on it's own seperate timer just as the Paladin counterparts to these AA's are. In addition to this Leech Touch should have the same recycle time as Hand of Piety once on seperate timers.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;-Improved Harm Touch could use a look at the damage it provides. Since it becomes aviable at level 59 it's base damage remains at 1000 damage and does not increase, infact without AA's to improve its damage this HT is less powerful than the normal one starting at level 61. We would like the damage of IHT to have the same base damage of our regular HT so that it is in all senses an improved Harm Touch.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;-Lifetap HT needs the name of it's hotkey changed from Leech Curse to Leech Touch or Life Curse (name of the aa in the aa window or of the spell it casts), our level 60 discipline is called Leechcurse and having multiple abilities sharing the same name can be confusing.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;-Our lifetap HT needs to have the ability to be focused with disease damage increasing effects as well as having the capability of being enchanced by our Unholy Aura discipline.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;-Improved Harm Touch is rather difficult to get higher end focus effects for. In order to make focus effects for our HT more common we would like Improved Harm Touch changed to magic resist with a massive negative resist modifier such as -1000 or -5000 so that it's still effectively unresistable but has a greater selection of focus. This would allow people far more freedom in choosing gear and not force SK's to carry around old gear to swap in simply for a HT however if done we would also like Unholyaura to not change IHT's resist check to disease if it would.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;2. In fights where the content is weaker or the mob has a high DB but low DI a class more focused on avoidence makes a better tank than a class more focused on mitigation. We feel that tank classes should always be able to outtank a non tank class of similar gear regardless of the content. For this reason we would like something such as an innate level of shielding for all 3 tank classes to help on group content such as this. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;3. SK's and Paladins are the only melee classes without a form of Parry/Riposte/Dodge disc. We would like one for emergency situations. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated) - Most likely this will be considered as part of the class re-envisioning &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;4. We would like the Terror line to be all 1 second cast spells, keeping up with Paladins early in fights is now too difficult with their improved stun aggro. Additionally the Terror line prior to Terror of Discord needs to generate higher levels of hate. &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0066ff&gt;NEW&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;5. Shadowknight group utility is rather low compared to that of most classes, with the invent of the guild lobby one of our bigger methods of helping people has vanished as people would much rather summon in the lobby than run back for us to summmon. As a result we would like to recieve the Convergence spell to increase our usefulness in some areas where our desireability isn't very high. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;6. Our Aura/Theft lines of spells (Aura of Hate, Aura of Pain, Aura of Darkness, Theft of Hate, Theft of Pain) have recourses which cannot be clicked off. We would like for these buffs to be clickable, in addition to this the group spells (all but the Pain line) should goto the short duration buff box. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;7. A bump from 25% to 30% on Soul Shield with an increase of the rune from 10,000 to 12,000. The reason for this is that in most cases there is no ingame difference between using the 61 and 69 disciplines, in the rare situations where the 61 disc will run out before the 69 disc (situations where dps intake is 800+) debuffs are already in and heals are stabilized resulting in no significant differences between the two abilities as they are currently. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;8. Mobs swing faster as they get higher level, with GoD we had lots of trouble channeling spells and in Omens mobs continue to hit faster but we recieve no increase to channeling. All hybrids flat out need higher channeling to perform their jobs better. It also makes sense from a game standpoint because it's our job to cast while being hit. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated) - Most likely this will be considered as part of the class re-envisioning &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;9. We would like to have the same Dodge/Parry/Riposte skillcaps as Warriors &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated) - Most likely this will be considered as part of the class re-envisioning &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;10. Increase the chance of Willful Death to not break FD when spells are casted on you, it currently parses at 20/40% at max level, 50-60% on unresisted spells would be nice. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

Since it becomes aviable at level 59 it's base damage remains at 1000 damage and does not increase, infact without AA's to improve its damage this HT is less powerful than the normal one starting at level 61. We would like the damage of IHT to have the same base damage of our regular HT so that it is in all senses an improved Harm Touch.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;-Lifetap HT needs the name of it's hotkey changed from Leech Curse to Leech Touch or Life Curse (name of the aa in the aa window or of the spell it casts), our level 60 discipline is called Leechcurse and having multiple abilities sharing the same name can be confusing.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;-Our lifetap HT needs to have the ability to be focused with disease damage increasing effects as well as having the capability of being enchanced by our Unholy Aura discipline.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;-Improved Harm Touch is rather difficult to get higher end focus effects for. In order to make focus effects for our HT more common we would like Improved Harm Touch changed to magic resist with a massive negative resist modifier such as -1000 or -5000 so that it's still effectively unresistable but has a greater selection of focus. This would allow people far more freedom in choosing gear and not force SK's to carry around old gear to swap in simply for a HT however if done we would also like Unholyaura to not change IHT's resist check to disease if it would.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;2. In fights where the content is weaker or the mob has a high DB but low DI a class more focused on avoidence makes a better tank than a class more focused on mitigation. We feel that tank classes should always be able to outtank a non tank class of similar gear regardless of the content. For this reason we would like something such as an innate level of shielding for all 3 tank classes to help on group content such as this. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;3. SK's and Paladins are the only melee classes without a form of Parry/Riposte/Dodge disc. We would like one for emergency situations. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated) - Most likely this will be considered as part of the class re-envisioning &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;4. Our Terror spells prior to Terror of Discord are inadequete for their job. With some of the proposed changes to spell based aggro and to fear it becomes more important now than before to fix these lower end taunt spells so that they provide decent aggro for SK's who don't have their OoW taunt spells as well as the fact that higher level SK's will be losing a source of non damage aggro and will need to rely on working lower level terrors to ensure we still maintain adequete non damage aggro. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;5. Shadowknight group utility is rather low compared to that of most classes, with the invent of the guild lobby one of our bigger methods of helping people has vanished as people would much rather summon in the lobby than run back for us to summmon. As a result we would like to recieve the Convergence spell to increase our usefulness in some areas where our desireability isn't very high. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;6. Our Aura/Theft lines of spells (Aura of Hate, Aura of Pain, Aura of Darkness, Theft of Hate, Theft of Pain) have recourses which cannot be clicked off. We would like for these buffs to be clickable, in addition to this the group spells (all but the Pain line) should goto the short duration buff box. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;7. A bump from 25% to 30% on Soul Shield with an increase of the rune from 10,000 to 12,000. The reason for this is that in most cases there is no ingame difference between using the 61 and 69 disciplines, in the rare situations where the 61 disc will run out before the 69 disc (situations where dps intake is 800+) debuffs are already in and heals are stabilized resulting in no significant differences between the two abilities as they are currently. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;8. Mobs swing faster as they get higher level, with GoD we had lots of trouble channeling spells and in Omens mobs continue to hit faster but we recieve no increase to channeling. All hybrids flat out need higher channeling to perform their jobs better. It also makes sense from a game standpoint because it's our job to cast while being hit. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated) - Most likely this will be considered as part of the class re-envisioning &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;9. We would like to have the same Dodge/Parry/Riposte skillcaps as Warriors &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated) - Most likely this will be considered as part of the class re-envisioning &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;10. Since the release of GoD the number of caster mobs in zones has gone up tremendously, this is causing many SK's that pull difficulties which slow us down significantly if not in some cases make an SK attempting to FD pull impossible. Many SK's view pulling as their secondary role and would like to be capable in it just as other classes such as Monks enjoy being capable in their two biggest roles of pulling and dps. To help with this we would like a way to help prevent our feigns from being broken by spells.&amp;nbsp; &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being discussed) - Most likely this will be considered as part of the class re-envisioning &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN 10pt; **Zowie**?FONT-SIZE: FONT-FAMILY: Verdana?&gt;&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;1.&amp;nbsp; Knight tanking is closer to Beastlords/Rangers/Monks than it is to Warriors.&amp;nbsp; Being a tank class we should be closer to Warriors than to non tanking dps classes. &lt;SPAN red? **Oompa-Loompa**?COLOR:&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated) - Most likely this will be considered as part of the class re-envisioning&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN **Oompa-Loompa**?COLOR: #cccccc?&gt;&lt;xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" &gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;2.&amp;nbsp; With the amount mobs cast these days SK's have great difficulty fulfiling their secondary role of pulling.&amp;nbsp; If we could have a chance to not have our feigns broken by spells it would help alot. &lt;SPAN red? **Oompa-Loompa**?COLOR:&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being discussed) - Most likely this will be considered as part of the class re-envisioning&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN **Oompa-Loompa**?COLOR: #cccccc?&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;3.&amp;nbsp; SK's need some line of spells which scales to the mob.&amp;nbsp; Paladins have stuns which always reduce x% of the mobs attack time, Warriors have Defensive/Evasive/Stonewall to always reduce x% of the mobs dps, SK's need a tanking ability that scales.&amp;nbsp; &lt;SPAN red? **Oompa-Loompa**?COLOR:&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated) - Most likely this will be considered as part of the class re-envisioning&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN **Oompa-Loompa**?COLOR: #cccccc?&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;4.&amp;nbsp; SK's and Paladins are the only melee classes without a form of Parry/Riposte/Dodge disc.&amp;nbsp; We need one for emergencies and tank switches badly. &lt;SPAN red? **Oompa-Loompa**?COLOR:&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated) - Most likely this will be considered as part of the class re-envisioning&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN **Oompa-Loompa**?COLOR: #cccccc?&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;5.&amp;nbsp; Rangers recieved offensive/weapon skill caps equal to Warriors as they're an offensive class.&amp;nbsp; Following the same logic knights should recieve ALL defensive skill caps equal to Warriors rather than just the Defense cap equaling Warriors. &lt;SPAN red? **Oompa-Loompa**?COLOR:&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated) - Most likely this will be considered as part of the class re-envisioning&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN **Oompa-Loompa**?COLOR: #cccccc?&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;6.&amp;nbsp; To give SK's more group friendliness we would like a necro like res that uses essence emeralds.&amp;nbsp; One of the main strengths of Knights is that they're supposed to offer utility if our utility benefits ourselves only it doesn't sufficently counter the tanking differences between us and Warriors. &lt;SPAN red? **Oompa-Loompa**?COLOR:&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated) - Most likely this will be considered as part of the class re-envisioning&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN **Oompa-Loompa**?COLOR: #cccccc?&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;7.&amp;nbsp; Due to most boss mobs being tuned for defensive in raids it puts too large a strain on a guilds requirement of Warriors.&amp;nbsp; Awhile ago Druids were given better heals allowing them to fill in some for Clerics lessening a guilds dependance on that class.&amp;nbsp; The same thing should be done with Knights giving us a defensive-like disc lessening the necessity for a guild to field 6+ Warriors per raid for the bosses. &lt;SPAN red? **Oompa-Loompa**?COLOR:&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated) - Most likely this will be considered as part of the class re-envisioning&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN **Oompa-Loompa**?COLOR: #cccccc?&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;9.&amp;nbsp; Aura of Hate is a beneficial spell which is only useful to some clases but cannot be clicked off.&amp;nbsp; This makes the spell line unattractive for many players because the casters/priests in their groups get upset about being buffed with things which are useless to them and cannot be removed.&amp;nbsp; It would help greatly if&amp;nbsp;this could be clicked off.&amp;nbsp; Also, Aura of Pain should be able to be clicked off as well despite being self only. &lt;SPAN red? **Oompa-Loompa**?COLOR:&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN **Oompa-Loompa**?COLOR: #cccccc?&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* The effect was changed from group to single. In it's old form the click was among the weakest effects, there wasn't a reason to change it from group to self only when fixing it's problems. In it's self only form now it is still among the weakest. It's also the only tank class effect which is self only when the fact is that even the current effect as group would only leave it as average compared to the click effects other classes get.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* If the effect has to remain as self only the recast should be reduced substantially.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*Two-Handed epics should work with the Shield Block AA and provide the AC over softcap benefit which shields provide. Back in Kunark epics were given the same benefits that using shields at the time possessed (bash enabled). Since then there have been more advantages to using shields put into the game such as AC which raises softcaps and Shield Block. These advantages are huge tradeoffs for tank classes to make when choosing to weild their epic. It would make more sense to see a Pal/Shd using their epic while tanking if these benefits were present on the weapons. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;The click effects don't scale in line with other classes.&amp;nbsp; The upgrade from 1.5 to 2.0 is a 25% increase of the leechcurse portion and the accuracy recieves a 40% increase.&amp;nbsp; All other epic effects recieve a 50% increase in power except for the SK weapon. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;The effect doesn't have enough of an impact in its current form.&amp;nbsp; It only provides a couple hundred HP&amp;nbsp;per group member every 10 minutes, casting Zevfeers bite twice helps a group out more.&amp;nbsp; The current power of the effect only justifies a 2 minute recast.&amp;nbsp; The effect should be more along the lines of +10% chance to hit and 33% leechcurse for 1.5 and +15% chance to hit and 50% leechcurse for 2.0. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;The effect doesn't last long enough.&amp;nbsp; Our effect only lasts for 3 ticks (13-18 seconds).&amp;nbsp; Other classes have 1 minute durations with 10 minute recasts on their effects.&amp;nbsp; Our effect also provides less of a boost than other classes.&amp;nbsp; The durations on our click effects need to be more in line with other classes. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;There are many advantages to using shields which SK's (and Paladins) miss out on by using their epics.&amp;nbsp; The original epic weapons contained the bonuses which shields provided at the time in them because a shield could not be used with it.&amp;nbsp; We would like to see this happen again on the new epic weapons.&amp;nbsp; These weapons should be Bash enabled, work with the Shield Block AA, and have their AC function like shield AC does.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN ?Century Gothic?? 10pt; **Zowie**?FONT-SIZE: FONT-FAMILY:&gt;&lt;SPAN red? **Zowie**?COLOR:&gt;There has been no further update at this time regarding any of the old issues on your class list.&amp;nbsp; I have altered the list to reflect the new items added and submitted.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;1. Knight tanking is too far behind Warriors and too close to non tanking classes. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated)&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;2. SK's are supposed to be tied as the 2nd best tank but have the lowest damage avoidence of all melee classes. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated)&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;3. SK spellbook needs to scale to evolving content better. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated)&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;4. It is currently too tough for us to channel spells. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated)&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;5. Deathpeace is no longer sufficent as an FD tool. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated)&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
