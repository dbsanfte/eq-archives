      <description>I'm sorry if this has been discussed before, but I've taken a sudden shine to the stories around this 4 events. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All I've been able to gleen about them is the text from their quests on Allahkazam's website. If anyone could possibly collect and consolidate this information for me here, I'd be very grateful. Also if you would like to post your opinions of the stories go ahead, I would enjoy reading them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Drakkin Faction</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Lore&amp;message.id=12148#M12148</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Can anybody (preferably a dev if possible) clarify what good or evil faction each of the different dragons (Atathus, Osh`vir, Mysaphar, Keikolin, Draton`ra, and Venesh) has? Any political agendas, ulterior motives, etc. that would actually be known at this point in the timeline? &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;At first I understood (or thought I did at least) that Draton`ra was 'evil', Atathus I never quite figured out, and everybody else was 'good'. Since exploring the lore further, I found out that Venesh, Atathus and Draton`ra all used the same methods of aquiring offspring by force, whereas the other three consulted with the humans and aquired permission. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Aside from that tidbit, I can't find any other info relating to my quesion. Any clarification would be great.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>Mortals created gods?</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Lore&amp;message.id=12133#M12133</link>
      <description>Don't gods have to get their powers through worship or at least devotion? Even though dark elves, ogres, trolls, elves, paladins, rangers, wizards, iksars and the like all trample through the domains of their gods one thing remains certain. They do so with the ideals that a certain god stands for in their hearts. Paladins still believe in rightousness, ogre warriors in the aspects of war and survival of the fittest, necromancers with the manipulation of the weak and the pursuit of power, rangers and elves in upholding nature or the purity of reality (does that last statement even make sense?) I guess you could say rangers and druids want to uphold a non-shift in power such as mayong or mata muram represent. But then, who dictates what the norm is on norrath? Those who have been in power the longest it can be shown have maniupulated things in such a way it is unnoticeable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well if mortals were able to give Mayong his power, that means mortals can't just poof out of thin air to become all/semi powerful and nor can they retain that power regardless of the circumstances. It is apparent through eq lore that there were several races that existed before the main pantheon. Who's to say a god even created them? Vah Shir acknowledge no god. The myriad of races under the control of Mata Muram acknowledge no god. The sarnak were created by the Iksar, yet are more powerful as a race than the Iksar now. They practice wizardry and necromancy both as well as covering more lands in kunark than the iksar. They acknowlege only their potential power.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Shissar, The ancient race that "created' Bertoxxulus, Erudties (no known divine intervention like Barbarians to Humans took place for the Human to Erudite transformation)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These are just 3 among others. If you control the past you control the future, or the perceptions of what everyone thinks. What if dark elves had always been a race, but Innoruuk basicaly wiped out thier history and took control of them? What if the iksar had been around as long as the shissar and Cazic-Thule never created them? How would they know one way or another, they were enslaved up until Sebilis and they are still not doing to well. How is it that Norrath in a way didn't birth the elves and that the idea and zealousness of protecting nature and growth is anchored with that past and formed into the conciousness of Tunare. To say it gave their beliefs a form and since they believe fully enough it is reality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But while the gods subtly manipulate they seem to lack the power to directly take a hand in many matters, as in to crush an army in the blink of an eye or a city or some such thing. This has happened a few times. Greenmist, Solusek Ro and the Elddar forest...I can't think of many more, maybe Druzzil Ro and Zeburoxx. Maybe it drains them to interact like this. You would think a seemingly benevolent being like Tunare would want her children to evolve into more powerful beings or even Innoruuk, but no...they just keep them right where they are...feeding? off of the beliefs of these races. They don't seem all powerful in that way. When the gods combine forces they can annhiliate creatues like...the Shissar? I wonder how that's possible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Didn't in the lore somewhere it said Greenmist was an entity itself? It didn't just serve Fear or Cazic-Thule but was self-aware or something? Maybe all it cares for is destruction but still...the ability to wipe out an entire race isn't something any god has shown himself/herself capable of. Maybe the Greenmist is like a entity weapon that Cazic-Thule keeps imprisoned unless he needs to wipe people out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also Solusek Ro seems to have a disgust with the other gods, like he is willing to destroy them and he was the one that bent the mountains and destroyed the elddar. Most gods like I said don't have this type of interactive power. Maybe it is because Solusek represents power itself and it gives him an edge? All beings covet power and in doing so he is innately much more capable than the other gods...does he know this?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway just interesting food for thought in the lore of everquest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Okay, we know this is going to happen sooner or later, so how 'bout we make is sooner rather than later? We know for a fact that the Iksar and Dragons have never been on good terms...Okay, so they hate each other. And, now the dragon have these Drakkin-things&amp;nbsp; running all over the place. You know the iksar can't like that. So, how long does everyone think it will take for the Iksar to start towards Crescent Reach or whatever the Drakkin home city is called and declare war upon them?&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>Dragons on Kunark, Velious, and Antonica</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Lore&amp;message.id=12109#M12109</link>
      <description>I've been wondering something lately. Much of the dragon's troubles lately have been related to Antonica. However I always though that Velious was the place where the dragon's called home. It is the home of the scars of Veeshan as well as the Temple of Veeshan. Now I see that the breeding grounds are actually in Antonica. And where does that put the dragons on Kunark? Are there three seperate factions of dragons? Or is there one unified leader of the dragons? Anyone mind explaining?&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Obviously they couldn't do this because it would alienate so many players from an expansion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm not the most informed person on EQ lore, but from what I have read so far, Iksars and Dragons don't really have a friendly past (hence why most of Kunark is ruins).</description>

      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Lore&amp;message.id=12096#M12096</link>
      <description>Selay the Cascade draws in a sharp breath as if preparing to roar, or worse, unleash a cloud of scorching flame.&amp;nbsp; All at once, she expels the air in a harmless raspy chuckle, 'So you're not afraid of me, Wyre?&amp;nbsp; I suppose it's just as well.&amp;nbsp; I could use the company and I had been longing to [speak] with you.' If you are here to explore then greet me in my native tongue.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Selay the Cascade eyes spark with curiosity. 'You speak a derivative of elder dragon, young one. You must have a unique knowledge of [dragons]?'&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Selay the Cascade says 'I see. You know enough to get my interest it would seem. A peaceful visitor is most welcome. While my wings and legs were broken many years past and did not heal enough for me to use them as I once did, I'm as fearsome as I ever was. You would make a meager meal, but I don't feel I should eat you. Should you like to hear a [tale]? I yearn to tell it.'&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Selay the Cascade says 'Oh blessed Veeshan. I yearn to vent my turmoil.&#xD;
My love of years past is lost to me. You see, I was once a thousand&#xD;
times more beautiful than I am now and I caught the eye of the greatest&#xD;
black dragon of them all, Lord Lethar. We were both charged with the&#xD;
defense of a great and powerful [artifact] entrusted to us by Veeshan.'&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Selay the Cascade says 'Yes, it still exists today, but I shan't tell&#xD;
you where exactly just in case you are a glory-seeker. I will tell you&#xD;
that the great reliquary was torn from the ground in one great motion&#xD;
and thrust beyond the protective magical veil of the dragon's Nest. The&#xD;
ground was raised and torn so violently that parts of the great shrine&#xD;
crumbled. I was crushed under some rocks, as were other [guardians].'&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Selay the Cascade says 'Yes, there were five of us and we were the most powerful dragons of the Nest who were suited to guarding our most precious gift from Veeshan. Lethar was the most fearsome dragon of the Nest and was given the honor of being our master among the guardians of the shrine.&amp;nbsp; The [others] were the best of their own breeds, each powerful and clever in their own rights. Together, with all of our magic combined, we brought great balance and protection.'&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Selay the Cascade says 'The red dragon was called Sothgar the Wildfire. He was fierce and impulsive with great cunning.&amp;nbsp; I, the blue dragon, Selay the Cascade, was noted as being wise and careful and for my sage advice and unrelenting determination.&amp;nbsp; The green dragon was Vergalid, said to have been hatched from an egg carried down the Serpent River on a broadleaf.&amp;nbsp; Then there was [Glenicae].'&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Selay the Cascade says 'Glenicae rivaled Lethar's power, but she held no great pride and ambition as he did and was content just being in the company of her kin and the light of the artifact of Veeshan. It wasn't long before they all knew that Lethar and I found love in one another. But, in keeping with dragon law, we never fulfilled our relationship in a way we often dreamed of. We knew our positions were greater than our desires. I would give anything to turn back [time] . . .'&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Selay the Cascade says 'I would have found out what caused the tragedy and stopped it. You see, as the mountains were raised, Sothgar and Glenicae were crushed to death by the falling ceiling and rock in the reliquary. And then the most terrible thing happened -- Lethar's heart turned as black as his scales. Without the balance of our combined magic, he was lured by the power within the artifact. As he realized he was the last dragon left standing and that the balance created by the intertwined power of all the breeds was lost, he claimed ownership of the artifact. His claim was the [ruin] of our love and me.'&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Selay the Cascade says 'That simple act of arrogance doomed us all. Vergalid, was able to free himself from the rubble and used all his wits and power to right Lethar's wrong and to do his best to bring some balancing magic to the artifact, but it was too late. Lethar sealed his fate when he used the power of the artifact against Vergalid, causing him to go mad. With the last remaining good in his heart, he came to my [aid].'&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Selay the Cascade says 'His act then, gives me hope today. I believe there is still good in Lethar. He came to me where I lay buried in the rocks and freed me. It was then that he broke my heart. He looked to me with a cold ebony eye and exiled me -- broken and pleading for his love.&amp;nbsp; I could not reach him. So I left, crawling and limping. It took me a long time to find this [grove] to protect me, but here I have stayed for many years, waiting.&amp;nbsp; Waiting to find Lethar's love again and restore our artifact.'&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Selay the Cascade says 'Yes, I have remained here for thousands of years. I've had occasion to hear that matters in the reliquary are direr than ever. I do not know what has become of Lethar exactly, but I do know this -- he must be saved. I long to feel his love again and I should think I will die soon without it.&amp;nbsp; When you are strong and powerful enough, I expect you to return and offer your assistance in this.&amp;nbsp; For now, you must go. My heart weeps and I soon fear the tears will fall from my eyes. No mortal shall ever see a dragon's tears.'&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>On Mayong and Immortality</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Lore&amp;message.id=12059#M12059</link>
      <description>Mayong is probably SoE's most interesting character, vampires are usually interesting in fiction anyway when they are done right. (DESTROY ANN RICE) Ancient vampires such as Mayong are probably the most interesting because they see their fictional world and they know the past and you have to ask just what is Mayong's goal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His character is the embodiment of corruption if their ever was one. Vampires are undead and a corruption of the living, but even more so Vampires are probably what most people think of, when they think of immortal undead. Now a skeletal guardian or somesuch that guards a tomb is immortal but he does not experience life in a way that the word mortal signifies. A lich? Possibly, but then again he cannot have relationships and they seem to almost always be preoccupied with the higher studies into magic rather than playing events to their whim. Liches in most fiction want to be left alone in some swamp or four hundred feet below the ground and if you disturb them, they will mess you up. But these types of immortals do no seek the living actively and definately do not seek to control political/historical happenings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So whatever race Mayong was, is uncertain. What is certain is that if he was around during the first days of veeshan's dragons, he is not any of the current gods' creation. What's uncertain is how he attained his vampiric state. Most magical research leads to liches so either some sort of artifact turned him into a vampire or another vampire turned him into a vampire. For me, I'm going to have to lean on the artifact idea. I'm not sure what artifact, I'm not even saying Shadowspine because even the last guy that got it (the guy defending the city or whatever) got lich'd.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His rise to demi-godhood was probably the best display of corruption there is what with taking over somebody elses plane and enslaving its inhabitants. Also, I think the only reason he likes dark elves is because they are a corruption of the Elddar. Maybe he sees potential in them since he, as a corrupted being has gained so much power and he could possibly use Tier'dal more than any other race to control? Kinda like since they are born of corruption alot of the dirty work is done for him already? Not sure though.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He was necessary for entombing Kerafyrm as I think I recall from game lore. The dragons basically employed him to do it as he had no love for them, curious as to what they traded him for this serious procedure. (i'm sure SoE will have to think something up for this, but that's ok)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kerafyrm didn't wrong him, if anything Kerafyrm doesnt even realize mayong's involvement in his entombing (you don't blame the guy for building the coffin that someone else put you in.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So..speculations as to what artifact empowered him/what person turned him into a vampire and who wrong him?&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>The official SOE storyline for the new expansion:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Serpent's Spine&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the great dragon Veeshan laid claim to Norrath and set her brood of dragonkind upon it, she entrusted a very powerful gift to them -- one of her scales.  This single scale was imbued with a powerful magic that ties all dragonkind on Norrath to Veeshan and her bloodline. This artifact of Veeshan was treated with great respect and reverence and was placed in a great shrine called the Reliquary of the Scale in the dragon's Nest where it stayed protected and guarded by five Scale Guardians. Many dragons visited the shrine knowing that the magic of the scale could grant them greater wellbeing and longer life.  Many even laid their eggs there for a time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For many years, the dragons kept a protective shroud over the Nest while the lands around them became filled by races fashioned by the first gods to arrive in Norrath.  The Elddar elves created by Tunare, the goddess of Nature, settled near the Nest and built a city named Takish-Hiz. The Elddar elves prospered in their lush forest city and soon drew the jealous eye of Solusek Ro, the Prince of Flame.  He greatly resented Tunare's elves and chose to ruin them.  He raised the spine of the world along the Serpent River that ran through the elf city, creating the Serpent Spine Mountains in that single act. Over a short time, the Elddar forest withered and burned, becoming a vast sea of sand.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Solusek Ro's act affected more than just the elves. The great shrine where Veeshan's scale was held was near the banks of the Serpent River and was violently hoisted into the sky beyond the protective veil the dragons used to hide their precious Nest. Lethar, a black dragon and the strongest of the five Scale Guardians, always had great selfish ambitions, as dragons often do, but was held in check by the elder dragons.  As soon as Lethar and the scale were beyond the Nest, Lethar claimed Veeshan's scale for himself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There was little resistance to his claim as two Scale Guardians, Sothgar and Glenicae, were crushed to death as the shrine was twisted and rent by the vicious upheaval of the land beneath them.  The other two guardians were dealt with cruelly and were both banished from the shrine. They did not defy him as he threatened to destroy the scale.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over time, the scale and Lethar became bound to one another and, now outside of the veil, Lethar learned to use the scale to draw power from any dragon that came near it.  No dragons sent to retrieve the scale could defeat Lethar or break his bond with it.  Even so, the dragons continued over centuries to attempt to return the scale home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After a decade of being the sole guardian of the scale and fending off hundreds of attacks from the Nest, Lethar realized he required an agent to do his bidding while he remained on guard.  He traveled the lands and found a young, wandering female Elddar elf named Veldyn who mourned the loss of many of her kin as the forest died.  She was seduced by Lethar who greeted her with an illusion -- appearing as an Elddar elf himself.  It was not long before Lethar's son was born and named in part after his father and his mother -- Dyn`leth, the first elf-dragon child. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dyn`leth grew and his character became darker than his father's, no matter how hard his mother tried to guide him. He, much like Lethar, became obsessed with Veeshan's scale and the mystery of the power it possessed. After watching his father for many years, Dyn`leth made a discovery about the scale -- that he had been created from it in some way.  He realized he was forever bound to it and able to control its power to some degree.  He also recognized that anyone who controlled the scale controlled the dragons -- creatures Dyn`leth had no great love for.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since the Rallosian giants and ogres were driven out of the eastern lands by a curse of the gods, Dyn`leth held sway over most of the inhabitants of the regions surrounding Spine Peak.  His charm and threats forced almost all creatures to obey him.  And so it has remained for centuries. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One year ago, six dragons born in the Nest but living beyond it, returned home to see the devastation the curse brought to their birthplace. While surveying the damage, they were told the tale of the elf-dragon in the nearby mountains who controlled the scale and could bend dragons to his will. It was clear to them that the future of Veeshan's bloodline on Norrath was threatened and they sought a solution that would protect dragonkind. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a matter of days, the six dragons proposed a solution to the elders of the Nest which caused a great conflict. While the elders watched them in disgust, they explained their plan to create a new race of humans touched with dragon's blood. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The six dragons believed that if Lethar created a being of his own blood -- an elf-dragon -- they could also. The dragons promised the elders that this new race of mortals could strengthen Veeshan's bloodline on Norrath, represent them to all races, and grow powerful enough to restore Veeshan's scale with the help of other mortals.  This race would be self-sustaining and each would be born much more quickly than the 100 years it takes to hatch a dragon egg. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The greater dragons of the Nest, Rikkukin, Yar`Lir, and Tirranun especially, vehemently opposed the proposal and called the six dragons extremists who defied their laws and cast them out of the Nest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The six dragons left, undeterred, and settled in the lowlands of the Serpent Spine Mountains in a grove within an old abandoned ogre city called Nokk.  They decided to carry out their plan to create a race they would call 'drakkin' -- a human-dragon race.  The six called themselves the Circle of the Crystalwing and felt they were the only hope of a future for dragonkind. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The six dragons of the Circle are Venesh the Greenblood; Draton`ra, Master of the Void; Keikolin, Bringer of Enlightenment; Mysaphar, Seeker of All; Atathus the Red Lord; and Osh`vir the Windspirit. Venesh, Draton`ra, and Atathus share similar philosophy and differed from the other dragons. Their plans for acquiring humans for the new race did not involve cooperation.  They would selectively steal away the humans they felt had what they desired in their new offspring.  Keikolin, Mysaphar, and Osh`vir chose to cooperate with humans and have their blessing when it came to selecting humans to be touched by dragon blood. It was only days before each dragon began the rituals to infuse the humans with their blood. They delivered the humans home after the ritual and waited for the day when the dragon blood in them awakened. On that day, they would make their pilgrimage to the mountains. It took only two months for the drakkins to slowly fill the old ogre city.  The firstborn of each of the dragons formed the Scions of the Six and acted as the council for the city, which they renamed Crescent Reach.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dyn`leth's scouts reported the appearance of the first drakkins back to Dyn`leth and for the first time he felt a threat in the mountains he believed he controlled. But, as he often did, he looked for opportunity in every danger. The drakkins quickly became prey. Using the controlling power of Veeshan's scale, the knowledge he'd gained from his father, and the understanding gained from being born of the scale, Dyn'leth found a way to tap into the dragon blood coursing through the drakkin.  It wasn't as strong a connection as with a dragon, but he found he could influence them in subtle ways -- enough to use them in an army.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Dyn`leth's tyranny was about to be challenged.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The sheltered mountain path the drakkins used from Highpass Hold to the Serpent Spine Mountains on their pilgrimage became well-worn and visible to all. Norrathians would soon pour into the mountains.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Together, drakkins and other mortal races would band together to bring balance back to the mountains.&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Jartaxel on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;09-18-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;09:57 PM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

      <title>City corruption: Qeynos and Freeport</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Lore&amp;message.id=12050#M12050</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Which city is more corrupt?&amp;nbsp; My vote goes to Qeynos.&amp;nbsp; While Freeport is more open with their problems, Qeynos is prone to hiding them.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Qeynos:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The poor peole have been forced into the sewers in order to improve city life for the richer folk&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Citizens talk abot dead bodies washing up on the shore&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Guards threaten players, and ask for bribe money&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Home of the largest rogue guild on Norrath, with connections to Carson in Highpass&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;City on the edge of a revolt lead by Commander Kane.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Tax way too high for citizens, as they so claim.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Freeport:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Knights of truth casuing dissent within the city&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Tax collecters skimming off the top in taxes&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Corrupt guards known to turn a blind eye to crime&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Although Freeport has poor beggers running amok, Qenos seems to be the "evil" city, despite the fact that it's the supposed jewel of humanity.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>The Mines of Glooming Deep and Tacvi Connection</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Lore&amp;message.id=12036#M12036</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I am rather new to delving into the depths of the lore of Norrath, so please forgive me ahead of time if this line of questions seems rather elementary or obvious in answer.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Background&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I was roaming around Tacvi the other night (well, raiding actually), which was the second (maybe third) time that I have ever been in that zone.&amp;nbsp; I noticed a number of rather familiar names lying around on the floor (rotting remains actually).&amp;nbsp; Venerable names such as Absor, Vahlara (the two I can remember), etc.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; These are NPC's from the tutorial.&amp;nbsp; I have searched around to try and locate lore but have come up unsuccessful, thus I turn to you, the experts to help figure this out.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;1. The tutorial provides several pieces of information: there was a revolt, the main figures (i.e. Arias, Vahlara, etc.) played a part in that revolt but does not give its source. - Was this Murat Muram???&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;2. My knowledge of Tacvi is rather limited, yet it is apparent that a major battle took place there.&amp;nbsp; Was this battle named? Was this the great revolt mentioned in the tutorial?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;3. How is it possible that Absor, Vahlara, etc. have rotting remains in Tacvi, yet are alive and well in the Mines of Gloomingdeep?&amp;nbsp; Is there lore to support this? If so, where can I find it?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;4. Where can I find the lore that surronds Tacvi itself?&amp;nbsp; The items I found regarding Gates of Discord/Tacvi all mentioned Morden Rasp and the mage, but nothing that I saw was specific to the happenings in Tacvi that would relate to the tutorial and why NPC's would be in the tutorial that are the same as the ones in Tacvi.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <title>Dragons, Drakes, Wurms, and Griffins</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Lore&amp;message.id=12021#M12021</link>
      <description>While looking at the piece of lore from Yelinak that Eze brought out before, I noticed an interesting little nugget of information about griffins.  As the original reward for bringing Yelinak Tormax's head you are given a Clawed Griffin Sword and this text:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lord Yelinak says 'This sword is a symbol of our evolution and ancient heritage. Back when our feathered relatives were not so distant, a sword was forged and enchanted with the spirit of an elder griffin. This noble griffin bound his soul to the sword, the essence of his being honing the blade to an edge imperceptible to mortal eyes. Although our races have evolved away from each other, we still hold them in high regard. But if you think you are not worthy to wield this honor, return the sword to me and I have other tokens you may find of more use.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I had no idea that griffins were in any way related to Dragons.  Is there any other lore out there which shows a relationship between these two species?  What lore links Dragons with more traditional Dragonkin, the Drakes and the Wurms?</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;The name rings a bell to me, Yelinak and I were having a nice conversation over a cup of tea (before I promptly ended his tyrannical attempts at ousting the true rulers of Velious) when he explained that he wouldn't trust me like he did Kragen.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;I think I've heard that name somewhere before...&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
