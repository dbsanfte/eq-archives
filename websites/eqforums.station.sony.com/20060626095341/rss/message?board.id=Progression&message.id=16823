    <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;Hi. You're never going to get an Orig, Kunark, Velious only server so stop asking. I love all the people that "threaten" to quit when PoP comes out. You won't quit. You may quit the server, but you'll come back to EQ in some form eventually. Do you honestly think they give 2 **SMURF**s if they lose your 15 bucks a month? rofl.</description>

      <title>New Server Suggestions</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Progression&amp;message.id=16536#M16536</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;EQ has a few different types of servers that gives a few options to those that don't want to play on a regular blue server. PVP, roleplay, and Stomm (It was originally intended to be a "clean-slate" server, though it isn't anymore), and now The Combine. Some of these have their own coding (or so i've heard many many times), and own rules. Why don't we have some more different types of servers? &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Since we are getting The Combine, lets expand on that some:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;A) A progression type server where the expansions are only unlocked after a set schedule.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;B) A PVP progression server.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;C) A classic server that only has the original game&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;D) A classic server that only has the original game, plus Kunark and Velious.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;E) 2 classic servers that are the same as C and D, only make them PVP.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;F) Another Stromm&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;G) A progression server that lets people play their beloved berserker and beastlords and frogloks (Ok, only the frogloks are my beloveds, but others love the first two more than I love the third one, im sure).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;H) (Although this is a completely far-fetched idea, so much so that I NEVER expect it to happen, I will post it here also, since the only problem to having the game as it once was is the knowledge we have now and the resources to gain the knowledge only a few mouse clicks away). (Please dont flame me for the previous statement, it is only my opinion). A classic server that only starts out with the original EQ, and expansions are unlocked at pre-determined times, and each newly made character could only advance 3 levels per week. In addition: quest npc's and mobs are moved to different, random zones, loot tables are scrambled (so that what was once a common drop off of an aviak in SK is now an uncommon drop off of a Sand Giant in South Ro (just an example). Also, zones would be scrambled, so that you have to figure out which zoneline is going to take you to what zone, and you no longer have any clue how to get from Freeport to Qeynos (You take off in one direction, and may find out at the very end of your trip that you are ending up in Unrest. This would make exploring the world viable again, since we already know that to get from Freeport to Qeynos is through the commonlands, through Kithicor, High Pass, and the then the Karana's. Mobs would be changed around as well, so, as just one example, you could see Evil Treants in East Commonlands (something like we see in EC already with the griffon, but more often). All of these things, as well as many others, would create a&amp;nbsp;new everquest, without the knowledte we have form 7 years of exploration by everyone that came before us, with the same zones we fell in love with, only presented to us in a different way. Think you can log into Allah or Castersrealm and find out what you want to know? Think again, with this server!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I) Any number of combinations of the above suggestions, or any future suggestions that I havent even thought about (Im amazed I came up with this many suggestions in the first place! lol).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Society today thrives on having as many different choices as possible, and gamers are no exception. Those that only have the forums to vent their frustrations would find that, even if they didnt have the exact choice of server, would have a server that is as close to what they want as possible. Then they dont have to vent their frustrations anymore, and dont have to get flamed because of something that they deeply desire.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Btw, I know that they have the servers (If you merge two servers, that leaves one twice as full and one completely empty, and how many servers were merged together just last year?) to do these things with, though I think&amp;nbsp;the last&amp;nbsp;suggestion would take more effort and commitment on the devs part than what we all pay in subscription fee's and expansion purchases.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Please, submit your idea's for a new server. I hope people arent going to argue about them though. Every idea that one person comes up with, another is going to think is the stupidest thing ever conceived, then will go into all the many reasons why it is stupid and why, in their opinion, it wont work. Please, lets have&amp;nbsp;one thread on this entire board that doesnt devolve into bickering. I would love to hear some new and fresh idea's, or my idea's polished and made better, or worse.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;I would kill (some dark elves) for option D.&amp;nbsp; Original + Kunark + Velious.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I've never understood why they didn't open such a server given that many, many people left EQ1 when POK was introduced.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

I'll play until it becomes no fun, and well, PoP killed a lot of the fun for me. Book travel was just too quick, and made the world too small.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;EDIT: Wow, it saved my post count, icon choice, and signature for the past 2 years...&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by sgili on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;06-02-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;09:59 PM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

      <description>A second classic/progression server might not be a bad idea.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I doubt there is enough demand to justify a pvp.&amp;nbsp; There is only one pvp server now versus 20+ regular servers, clearly the demand for pvp servers in eq is fairly low.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;Wow, I make a few suggestions, and I get a bunch of anti-instance posts....I never even mentioned instancing. lol. I figured we could at least have a bit of fun with one or two of my idea's, didn't know the Sarcasm Patrol would para-troop in start lobbing their hand grenades at me. Oh well, I give up I guess.</description>

      <description>Yes, we should just instance everything.&amp;nbsp; When you log on, a new server is created just for you, that way you don't have to interact with anyone else at all!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In fact, in a few years, we could advance to the point where you could run the game entirely from your own computer, and not even need a connection to the net anymore!&amp;nbsp; That's pretty advanced though, it could take years before the technology is ready for that!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;God I hate instancing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;All jokes aside I wouldnt mind seeing instances of zones within this progression server. There is going to be a point in time where Lower Guk and Sol B are going to be INSANELY crowded. Be nice if you could choose which instance to enter similar to EQ2 and make a new instance say every 40 people or so.</description>

&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I thought that was the point of the whole classic server, haveing to wait hours to get a spot in a group at the camp you wanted, or stit for hours waiting for a camp to free up with a group of buddys.</description>

      <description>To be completely honest I support the initial post's ideas to a point,&#xD;
I think there should be at least a PvP prog server and maybe 1 more of&#xD;
the servers he suggested if the population on the primary server gets&#xD;
too high.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
