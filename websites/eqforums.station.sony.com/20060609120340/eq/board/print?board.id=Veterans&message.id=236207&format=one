<DIV>Also, to quickly comment on the tuning of the Shade outside of VP, as well as the events inside/base population inside. I had a superb guild on the Test server, who was elemental planes capable (however, they weren't in Plane of Fire yet - they had just killed Rallos Zek) test all of the events for me. For the Shade, I used 48 non-elementally equipped players from this raiding guild and after the tuning they were able to do it fine.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I also used this same guild (48 of them) to test the events inside. I based the events on the statistics/power of mini-bosses in Plane of Earth/Fire in terms of HP, AC, damage output, and spells and then had this guild test them. I'm sufficiently confident that these events are on par with AMY from Plane of Fire, and Xegony from Plane of Air.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Edit: P.S. Keep in mind, the Test server players generally have lesser gear and lesser AAs than a Live server player, simply due to the fact that there are more players playing on Live, making grouping and acquiring gear easier. However, I'd contend some of the Test server guilds are more skillful compared to Live server guilds because of this - they have to do more with less, which made for a good comparison point in tuning.</DIV><p>Message Edited by Zajeer-Dev on <span class=date_text>06-07-2006</span> <span class=time_text>04:14 PM</span>
