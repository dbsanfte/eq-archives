<P>Well, the skill based charms are what I consider to be in the constant family since they never get worse (since you can't lose skill); yes there were a couple from the start, but the others, faction based, gear based, time based, all fluctuate. People don't like the ones that fluctuate; I have guildmates who take lesser stat charms with consistent stats over ones that have higher potential, but aren't consistent.</P>
<P>I like raid content, and the more complicated encounters, but I do not like being insignificant in any given fight. When you're fighting alongside two dozen+ other people, you're insignificant unless you're the MT, MA or raid leader.</P>
<P>Which is why I want the gap closed more; so I can continue doing harder and harder old raid content with a single group, since interesting new single-group stuff is few and far between.</P>
