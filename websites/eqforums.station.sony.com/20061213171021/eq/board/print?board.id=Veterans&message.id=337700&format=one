<P><BR>I recalll when the developers discussed this expansion that they kind indicated that the epic wasn't going to get improved. I also recall them saying they would be phasing them out. Main&nbsp;reason&nbsp;I recall is that&nbsp;the idea is to&nbsp;keep updating as you go instead of finding one thing and sticking with it. </P>
