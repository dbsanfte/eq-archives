      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Hi!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Sorry to put the subject line as attention to developers.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Everyone can confirm that we are in a difficult situation as&amp;nbsp;our number one damage nuke is broken and will not work properly.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If possible...... could we receive an official response to our request that the spells be fixed? &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Thanks in advance for your response.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <title>Cause of Bolt spells currently missing, Dev's please read and check</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=magicianbalance&amp;message.id=4407#M4407</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Okay, have spent about 3-400 casts testing WHY my bolts are not landing (no resist message, just not landing) I am fairly sure I have found the reason. Years ago was a bug where a player could stand in the way of the mob, and the bolt would "hit" him and not the mob, this bug is back.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;After testing from numerous positions of up elevated, down elevated from my target (i.e. hills) bolts would land if my pet/PC's were NOT in direct line between me and the mob, when I specifically stood behind my pet (even within 20 feet of the mob) or another player, my bolts would NOT land, not even a resist message.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;This leads me to believe that the old bug is back, please fix.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>Thinking of rolling a Mage or Necro - few questions</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=magicianbalance&amp;message.id=4398#M4398</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Hi,&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I was wondering if anyone can answer these questions for me to assist me in my decision:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;1. What different pets do mages/Necros get (I.E Firet/Earth&amp;nbsp;etc..) and what are their roles in a group typically - like mainly DPS or Tank?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;2. Do any of them taunt and if so which one(s)?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;3. Do any of them AE nuke?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;4. Do the mage pets hold up better when tanking vs the necro Pet and if so is it because the pet is just naturally stonger or the owner has better buffs?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;5. Which class solo's better (in your opinion)? &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Think thats it for now.. Any info would be greatly appreciated..&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Thanks&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>"Heart of..." line</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=magicianbalance&amp;message.id=4397#M4397</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Is there any chance we could possibly get our "Heart of..." line (Heart of Stone, Flame, Vapor, Ice) separated so that they are each on their own individual timer? At this point in the game, with some of them eclipsed by better choices (like Silent Casting, the Fickle Fire recourse, etc.), it would make them much more viable, since currently it's really a toss-up between either using only Heart of Flame or using only Heart of Stone...the others see very little, if any, use due to the tied timers. If absolutely necessary, perhaps we could place stacking restrictions on them so you cannot use more than one at a time, if balance issues are a concern. &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;-Koz&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
Oshran said, "At this time there is no plan to seperate these into different timers.&amp;nbsp; All of the "Heart of" buffs are pretty good (even if some are better in more situations then others). Currently mages can only have these buffs active for a maximum of 90 seconds out of every 22 minutes (6% of the time).&amp;nbsp; Assuming we make the buffs non-stackable, then splitting the reuse timers will enable mages to have these buffs active for 360 seconds out of every 22 minutes (27 % of the time).&amp;nbsp; That means they will be able to utilize these relatively powerful buffs much more often (roughly 4.5 times as often) over any given period of time.&amp;nbsp; That's too much a jump in power and it also removes the interesting gameplay choice inherent in the AA set itself… 'which buff do you want on you given your current situation knowing that your choice will cause you to lose the other 3 options?'"&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;-Koz&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>Heals need a boost</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=magicianbalance&amp;message.id=4368#M4368</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I know a common sentiment with Mages is that our pet doesn't deliver enough DPS.&amp;nbsp; I view my pet as a tank and I provide the DPS through spells.&amp;nbsp; For that reason, I love my current pet and DD spells.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I have noticed however, that its getting harder and harder to heal my pet.&amp;nbsp; Just in simple terms:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;At lower levels, my heals would cover about 25% of my pets health and mobs would hit for 5-10% of my pet's health&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;These numbers have creeped up but now I see my heals cover 10-15% of my pets health and mobs hit for 10-20% of my pets health&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I haven't taken the time to research the exact numbers but my general sense is that heals are falling behind mob dps and pet HP's.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>Moving forward (re: Top Ten)</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=magicianbalance&amp;message.id=4358#M4358</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;NOTE: This is a copy/paste of a post I made at the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://eq1.eqsummoners.com/viewtopic.php?t=26026"&gt;Mage Tower&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;First of all, please excuse the overall tone of this post, which I'm sure will be a bit stern, and perhaps even a bit obnoxious. The following is a trademark &amp;quot;good thing&amp;quot;, but I want to make sure everyone is on the same page as far as expectations go. You'll understand why when you read it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Some of you may have heard whisperings about this already- the proverbial cat is out of the bag on some of the class forums. Basically, we're going to be phasing out the idea of the Top Ten lists. It's no secret that, by and large, they have not worked for a while (or, depending on how you want to look at it, they worked just fine...at first, they were more about addressing bugs, and those generally got resolved quickly, but lately, they're more of a &amp;quot;wish list&amp;quot; compilation, which does not lend itself to the same type of speedy resolution/answers).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We've (&lt;strong&gt;tentatively&lt;/strong&gt;) decided to go with a &amp;quot;question of the week&amp;quot; format, though I shudder at the idea of calling it that. In any event, we'll (&lt;strong&gt;tentatively&lt;/strong&gt;) be submitting a question each week, and Kytherea will forward them on to their respective devs, who will respond to them and send the responses back to Kytherea, who will relay them back to us.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font size="6"&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=tentatively"&gt;TENTATIVELY.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Now, the rest of the disclaimers, because again- I don't want any false expectations and disappointments at any point. Well, I don't want any false expectations and disappointments that you can blame on &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; at any point.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Above, I said we've decided to go with a &amp;quot;question of the week&amp;quot; format. The key word there is &amp;quot;question&amp;quot;- NOT &amp;quot;answer&amp;quot;. &lt;strong&gt;I'm not going to promise that we'll get an answer every week.&lt;/strong&gt; Even if we get one answer a month, that's more than we have been getting. Keep that in mind.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Last week, 17 questions were asked (one correspondent did not submit a question), and 9 responses were received. That's technically more than half. I think that's a very good start, but when the time comes that &lt;strong&gt;our&lt;/strong&gt; question does not receive a response right away- and that time WILL come- I don't want people to be disheartened. &lt;strong&gt;There's always next week.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Different questions require different devs in order to receive an answer. Spell questions go to Prathun, AA questions go to Oshran, tradeskill questions go to Ngreth, etc. &lt;strong&gt;It's inevitable that sometimes those devs will have time to answer our questions, and sometimes they will not.&lt;/strong&gt; Right now, for example, Oshran has respectfully informed us that he's just too swamped to give any AA questions the time they deserve, and will probably start to be able to accept questions in June or July. Personally, I think that's great- not only has a dev told us he's just too busy to entertain our questions at the moment, but he's also given us a (&lt;strong&gt;tentative&lt;/strong&gt;) idea of when he WILL be able to. Again, a good thing.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size="6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep in mind that the answers will not always be what you want to hear.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/font&gt;I cannot stress this enough.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Anyway...last week (the first week of May) was our first attempt at this. Because we were still keeping the idea quiet at that time, since we didn't know how it would work out, I chose the question myself. &lt;strong&gt;In the future, I will give you an opportunity to submit questions, and I will pull from that list as needed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;My first question was for Rapaz:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;At the Fan Faire, it was mentioned that certain aspects of the UI were probably going to undergo an overhaul in the near future. Of particular concern to mages would be the addition of visible damage messages from things such as pet weapon procs, pet spells, pet spell resists, etc., as well as corresponding filters for these options; and, of course, a complete overhaul of the pet window, adding buttons for newer commands such as /pet hold, /pet focus, /pet no cast, with a corresponding status window to show &amp;quot;at a glance&amp;quot; information on the current status of the pet, along with other conveniences such as percentage-based health information and, ideally, a pet inventory that would allow us to manage pet equipment easily.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;I mentioned some of this at the Fan Faire in my various discussions with the devs, and it's my understanding that these are all things mages will most likely see in the future, with the exception of one thing: the pet inventory. I didn't get a chance to mention this then, but it's something that's often requested within the community.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Would we be able to get an estimated timeline for these additions, as well as an idea of how feasible something like a pet inventory would be? Even if these changes were to go in gradually, instead of all at once, they would go a long way toward making the game more &amp;quot;pet-friendly&amp;quot;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Rapaz answered with:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I am definitely familiar with some of these requests and not so familiar with others. They sound like good ideas to me, but I do not currently have a timeframe for any of these just yet.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Which may not be the response some of you were hoping for, but it's a response. And the pet inventory idea was not blatantly shot down (to be perfectly honest, that surprised me- I've always considered a pet inventory to be a huge pipe dream that probably isn't even possible).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This week, I decided to yield to the correspondents who did not receive a response last week. It's fair, although it may not make some of you happy. But there will be plenty of time for our questions in the future, with this new format.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So...for the next couple of weeks or so, I'm going to continue to submit personal questions, and share the responses with you. These will likely be questions that I had prepared for the FF, but didn't get a chance to bring up. I'm doing this because we're still in the experimental phase of this method. After a few weeks- assuming that we decide to adopt this format &amp;quot;officially&amp;quot;- I'll open up a thread for everyone to post their questions.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Personally, I think this is a really good idea. I just hate calling it a &amp;quot;question of the week&amp;quot;, because that sets the wrong expectations, which makes me nervous. Again, even just one response a &lt;strong&gt;month&lt;/strong&gt; is better than what we were getting with the Top Ten lists. &lt;strong&gt;Just do my nerves a favour and keep your expectations realistic, please!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;-Koz&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;I am goign to be running 2 accounts on one puter and want to make one a magician.  What would be the best Class to group with a Magician?  I am assuming a healer class.  I do NOT want to Kite.  I will hardly ever be grouping outside of me and myself.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Are Mage pets tough enough to tank most of the MOBs with a healer as a duo?&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;1) allow suspended pets to remain through rez. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;2) BST can slow a mob, and heal their pets more then we can heal ours. Give us the BST pet heals.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;    There is no reason their pets can take less damage, and be healed for more then ours.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;3) Remove temporary from the summoned pet items. Since they are pet only, I don't see how&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;    stocking up could be a problem.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Well, those would be enough to make me happier.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0066ff&gt;*Chanaluss*&lt;/FONT&gt; recently the magician fire pet was&amp;nbsp;adjusted to not snare, root, and annul. are there any other &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; plans at this time to adjust them to be more useful for&amp;nbsp;magicians?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Prathun&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Rytan gets credit for changing the fire pets to&amp;nbsp;use spell lists, to explicitly specify what they should and &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; shouldn't use in combat.&amp;nbsp; If after this fix, the pets are still&amp;nbsp;out of balance and some are more useful than others I can take &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; a look at them.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Frankly, I haven't glanced at my fire pet (except the 52 as a puller) in years.&amp;nbsp; I'm curious about these comments.&amp;nbsp; Why is the removal of these spells deemed beneficial?&amp;nbsp; And what does Prathun mean when he says the fire pets use spell lists ?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>My idea for Magician Utility</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=magicianbalance&amp;message.id=4342#M4342</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;I am posting this on the mage boards to make an attempt to provide a usefull comment on a way to add a unique ability to magicians.  Please do not add rants to my post, They have all been heard before.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Desirability for a certain class is what that class can do to contribute to the other classes making them better.  Currently there are only three Magician spells with this utility.  CoTH: useful timesaver but otherwise pointless.  Mod Rod: outdated and doesnt scale well with other classes buffs.  And Damage shield line which while usefull, its not going to win over many people.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Instead I would like to see a new summoned item line of spells that create targetable clicky items with buffs that effect the hard cap of the user for a set amount of time and the result from summoning them would be a determinal spell cast on the magician for the same amount of time and effect.  ie. Magician casts spell Orb of health-  -1000 hp of magicians cap for 10 min.  This would create a clickable item for the targeted person that when clicked would give them a buff that increases their hp cap by 1000 for 10 min.  It should stack with all current buffs but not stack with itself so it doesnt get overpowering if say ten mages were to give one tank ten of said item and he gets 10k hp buff.  This could easily scale for all magician levels 1 - 70 and beyond simply by changeing the effect to one of the less important stats like int, wis, dex, resists, or the amount of the cap, possibly even increaseing the duriation as the magician reaches a higher level.  However these summoned items should only modify the caps and should not heal the person or regenerate mana, Keeping people from wanting them just for a quick shot of mana or a quick heal.  Also these items would need to be lore to keep the magician in the loop instead of one mage sitting in pok selling them eliminateing the need of the magician but everyone still getting the advantage of it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Thats all I have for my big idea for now.  Post more ideas.  I like reading them and I would like to see something besides just adding DPS to our class.  Yes we are a DPS class but we are not the best so something must bridge that gap. What is it to you?&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Need Dev. input regarding lvl 70 aura.</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=magicianbalance&amp;message.id=4334#M4334</link>
      <description>re-posting this here since it got ignored in the Veteran section.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;the lvl 70 mage aura Rathe's Strength has a serious stacking issue. If your in an area where you're not the only mage with the aura, the aura's keep overwriting each other. The main problem here is that unless your pet is right next to the other mage's pet, it wears off. Happens a lot on raids. I'll cast the aura on my pet, another mage will have it on his pet and his will overwrite mine if he comes near. Then he'll move a few feet away and the aura will wear off my pet. Its almost impossible to keep the aura on my pet, and having an aura thats supposed to last 30 minutes wear off 10 seconds after I cast it is very annoying. Please make it so the auras don't overwrite each other.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Can anyone give me some good ideas for where to solo at 63(preferably outdoors since being on my droggy is a major plus)?   I can't seem to find anywhere that is even REMOTELY rewarding xp-wise(either due to a lack of xp in the first place, or due to the downtime associated with how much the mobs hit for).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Jim125 on &lt;span class="date_text"&gt;03-29-2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;10:43 AM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;A while ago, a quest NPC was added to the game.&amp;nbsp; She took your Orb of Mastery and returned the Ornate Orb of Mastery (a permanent version) so we could always carry our epic 1.0 and we could safely augment it.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The original epic 1.0 Skittle Stick is an important part of our heritage and a downright fun item to have with great particle effects graphics.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Once we have completed our epic 1.5 could we have this orb flagged as secondary-slot?&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;This would not be overpowering as it would likely be a downgrade from whatever we are already carrying in our secondary.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;It would just be a fun way to still carry and display our old epic 1.0 &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I would love to hold my epic 1.5 and my epic 1.0 (even though its lower stats and actually reduces my characters power/abilities).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Someone mentioned that the Bolts are now being blocked again (LOS).  Can anyone confirm this?  The poster who mentioned it said they're being blocked by very small objects, players, etc.  If this is true then the spell has been once again rendered nearly useless.  In the old days it just wasn't worth it to use a bolt because if it got blocked you'd wasted a significant amount of Mana. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I really hope this isn't true, as the Bolt has been a significant weapon in my arsenal since they fixed it in the PoP era.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Kurt&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Elemental Swarm &amp; Servant of Ro are not usable in high end raids.</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=magicianbalance&amp;message.id=4293#M4293</link>
      <description>Many new raid encounters are about DPS control, in other words DPS at the wrong moment and raid is wiped.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How do Servant of Ro and Elemental Swarm fit in this Raid pattern? The answer is that these AA's only effect is to wipe raids.&lt;br&gt;This is because both these aas have &amp;quot;low&amp;quot; dps and &amp;quot;high&amp;quot; duration, both can last up to 1 minute.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mages are a DPS class and these should be our DPS disciplines but we can not use them as they are uncontrollable and dangerous. Is this fair? Does it make sense?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What about making these aas last 18 seconds and increase the dps leaving the total damage unchanged? That would give more usefulness to these aas. What about changing elemental swarm(9 mini pets) into 1 fat pet which can survive AE? What about removing kick and bash from Elemental Swarm so Raid leaders stop banning this aa cause the push wipes the raids?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thank you for reading this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
