				<P>Thank you for your comments, this has helped my understanding a lot&nbsp; <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0></P>
<P>I had no idea drops were so good at the Chardok ent on the Burning Staff, getting 40 drops over 2 days (8hours playing time) sounds good to me. We thought the drops at Royals would be better.</P>
<P>I am in a 3 year old, off peak guild on an old server. We are not whiny PL'd 65's. We just got a shock when we discovered the bottleneck for elementals.</P>
<P>I now think we will avoid elemental planes altogether. We will kill Luclin and other mobs and maybe do Ssra a couple of times a month (Saturday nights for big Raids, rest of the week LDoN and small events)&nbsp;and in a year we will have our 40 active players (3-4 group raids) upgeared to do GoD. We want challenge but we also want fun, doing Ssra every saturday for months wouldnt be fun&nbsp;. VT shards arent fun from what I have read, and not a lot of challenge since they have to be farmed and if you cant farm them then wayyyy too time consuming on top of the normal time. Farming VP keys looks like its un fun also, Trak is only up occassionally, it will take months to get all the teeth.</P>
<P>In the meantime we will hope for changes to old world zones and LDoN scaling for less than 36 person raids and less than 6 person groups.</P>
<P>The biggest issue apart from all that is the freezing/rebooting bug its causing us to cancel events and lose members <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-mad.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0></P>

				<P>SSRA might surprise you =)</P>
<P>It is up there with places like NToV for fun factor. The encounters are well designed and although the mobs are all pretty similar looking, there's enough atmosphere and lore for you to actually think "What have I done???" when you awaken the Cursed, Destroyer of Gods... The loot and droprate is also very good (especially for cursed cycle) and there are enough different targets of different difficulty that it will keep you busy for a while =) Recommend you start with Rhag cycle and work from there =)</P>
<P>VT key shard camp isn't as bad as people say. But VT itself really is as bad as people say. It's a very /yawn zone and not friendly to casuals because it takes a loooong time to clear.</P>
<P>Be sure to stop by in Griegs End at some point and kill Grieg Venecius. I love that zone =)</P>

				For me and most my friends the problem isn't equipment envy.  The problem is that you need the equipment to make any reasonable use of the expansions.  Sony needs to make money on the expansions to keep the game alive and there is not enough content to make the expansions really worth while to folks like me. (I'm speaking of GoD and also from what I fear OOW will be).  I'd really like to have a refund on GoD.  So what the end up doing is putting in one or two nifty things and the regular folks cough up the bucks to pay for the expansion content for the upper tiered guilds. I don't want to do that any more.  The reasonable thing is to have most the content that almost anyone can enjoy and a few zones that upper levels only can enjoy as part of an expansion.<br><br>I want to enjoy the journey.  I've lost the company of a lot of friends because I've refused to level madly through the game.  I want to go to new places and enjoy and learn them without having to wait for things to be green.  Or having to raid much (if at all). When you guys talk about working hard to get stuff.. it shouldn't BE work it should be fun.  I all the time hear about the drudgery of keying and back keying.  It shouldn't be drudgery it should be fun.  They need to find a way to make progression fun because the game, like life, isn't really about being there it's about getting there.  (I'm not saying everyone else should enjoy the game the same way I do only that this is the way I play it.)  To allow me to play the game the way I have enjoyed it up till now then say 'no! you must raid  now you must mindlessly work on keys now" is just rude.

				Don't snub gear just because it's from old expansions.  The game is designed in such a way that there's a reasonbly logical progression of gear.<br><br>Last night my guild was working on the Rathe encounter.  Being able to make a credible attempt at the encounter does in fact require a large number of people with a large number of flags with a large amount of good gear.  But do you know where we were 18 months ago?  NToV, gearing up. I suspect a few members still have some isolated items from ToV equipped.  I know for a fact at least 2 guilds coming up behind us spent their time in ToV as well.   It's still a completely valid starting point for a guild, and certainly not to be snubbed.  <br><br>We more or less skipped Luclin outside of isolated targets (Grieg, the AR mobs, Burrower Beast, 1 THO kill (never again!), occasional SSRA targets). And for reasons I don't recall, pretty much everone got an emp key, so we did kill emp once or twice. We mostly skipped Luclin because 2 guilds had SSRA and VT locked down, and low-level PoP was wide open.  Those guilds have moved on, though, and VT is most often cleared by semi-open raids these days.<br><br>Mostly we hit the BoT towers.  They reset every few hours, so it's not hard to find something up to kill.  Again, don't knock the gear, I'm still using some stuff from the towers, as are most of my guildies.  These aren't very difficult encounters (only sand tower is hard at all) and the loot at the point you get it is quite exciting.   Did we hit the towers over and over and over?  Yeah, we did, but we got a lot of nice loot, had a lot of fun, and every raid night a lot of guildies logged happy with their new stuff.  A guild of 30ish could have a lot of fun farming these towers.<br><br>The PoP flag encounters are hard if you're coming to them in a true progession style.  They will challenge your patience.  You will lose.  Several times, to most of them.  But it's all the better when you win.  My guild had particular difficulty with RZtW.  I don't even know how many times we ran through that script.  But you know what I do remember?  Literally jumping out of my chair and yelling the night we did beat him.      My favorite EQ moment ever.  I'd been a member of my guild for a reasonable amount of time at that point, but that was the moment I became    committed to the guild to the very end.  We'd faced a major challenge, been hit with major frustration, showed a couple of cracks, but in the end we managed to all work together flawlessly and we came through it.  <br><br>I think PoP is a marvellously designed expansion for guilds.  As you move along, you're *forced* to learn to play better as a guild.  With the exception of a few "gimmes" (Fennin Ro and his boy Sol Ro come to mind), the encounters become increasingly more difficult and require increasingly more coordination with your raid force.   That's good for guilds, learning to work together with ever increasing precision and teamwork.<br><br>PoP takes time, and it takes effort. So be it.  I wouldn't have it any other way.

<P>They will need to tweak the non EP road to GoD I think. If everyone uses Luclin etc then they need to cut and randomise the pop times to avoid queues, SSra the new KC? They also need to upgrade many of the old world zones and make LDoN gear available for resale (for poits credit) back to the adventure merchants. It takes far too long to purchase anything considering no one buys mid level LDoN stuff. This make the rewards far too long in coming.</P>

<P>There need to be other paths to glory. </P>
<P>Upgrade old world etc zones to provide the challenge and gear drops of the lower EP's, reduce the spawn times of Luclin boss/miniboss mobs. Mave meduim difficulty LDON's and scale LDON raids to numbers and sub VT gear. Even if everybody got VT keys the spawn timers would make the chance of getting anything remote. </P>
<P>Large guilds have the ability to raid massively and fast on targets that have just popped, we are left with the crumbs. Was it EQ's intention to force everybody into large guilds?</P>
<P>Veksar and CoM were well done, lets have higher level versions of these.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
