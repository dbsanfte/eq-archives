Second, at the request of the players, we're going to combine the servers that have established a voluntary rotation system for raid targets. The Rathe and Karana will now be combined.  The communities on The Rathe and Karana servers have put forth an extraordinary amount of time and energy to create their rotational systems and we want to do what we can to support these players and their chosen play style.

Just in the off chance he may read this - We on Karana have done our best to get rid of rotations and very little if anything is left why would we want to go back to rotations after spending so long getting rid of things. Perhaps you should actually find out what is happening on a server before making a rash statement like the above. If rotations are comming back do you really think karana guilds will support it, 99% are going to say no.&#xD;

      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Karana&amp;message.id=121#M121</link>

&lt;P align=left&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size=3&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Intent:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff size=3&gt;The intent of the Guild known as "Mercenaries of Nightshift" is two fold:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff size=3&gt;1) To provide a guild where 1st to 30th level (Refered to as lowbie) characters have a way of grouping with other lower level characters, join in on quests, and have more opportunities for advancement in the game.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff size=3&gt;2) Hiring out of services to other guilds / parties for barter or payment.&amp;nbsp; (explained in further detail below)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size=3&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff size=3&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;Mercenaries Guild:&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff size=3&gt;This is the idea:&amp;nbsp; To add flavor to the game, and to generate revenue, a Guild can hire our services to help during a Raid or a Quest for a particular character.&amp;nbsp; I've noticed alot of small guilds that have low level characters whom are trying to level or even get epics, but can't due to time constraints, lack of available guildies to help with raid, or any number of other issues.&amp;nbsp; Merc's of Nightshift would act as the Character (hereto refered to as Client)'s proxy guild.&amp;nbsp; Our rates would be reasonable, payout of say 1000 plat for the services of the guild for a Raid, or 500 plat for a team of people for a specific run.&amp;nbsp; These are just off the top of my head rates, and they may change over time.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;Further, in lieu of pay for services, guild would take either items, or help from said guild on our raids or runs.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Levels:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;Guild will be open to all levels.&amp;nbsp; However, any character over 30+ must mentor to either one or more of their lower class counterpart.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;Ex: 50th level Wizard MUST mentor at least one 1-30 level Wizard.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;The reason for this is simple:&amp;nbsp; I've been grouping alot lately and have grouped with some low level wizards who have gotten it into their heads that they are melee fighters.&amp;nbsp; I've been coming to the rescue of people who are being attacked by things WAY too big for them and as they run out of mana, attempting to kill an Orc Centurion with what is basically a butter knife after running out of shock of frost spells.&amp;nbsp; I will run a "Wizard Boot Camp" for wizards 1-10 to learn the ropes.&amp;nbsp; This is one example.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;We are still pending as a guild at this time.&amp;nbsp; If you are interested, please contact me directly via pernwen@gmail.com or reply to this thread.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;Hoping to hear from folks soon,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;Bill/Pernwen&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <title>Any newbie guilds recruiting?</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Karana&amp;message.id=109#M109</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I am looking for a guild to put my new shadowknight and ranger&amp;nbsp;in. I made&amp;nbsp;an sk&amp;nbsp;on Tribunal, but the leader of the guild I put her in ASSUMED that I was a newbie, got all mad that I was not a newbie and besides that, I didn't like the general attitude of the server. I have a little ranger on karana (level 10), and want to put this new ranger and shadowknight in a guild that follows the same values that I do. Basically I have been playing for 5 years now, I have most of my charactors on Tunare server, and a few elsewhere since I like to play around with more than 8 classes. I am a fair person, I can get my own items, my own levels, and my own stuff. I like to help others, I like to talk. I need a guild that follows the same values that I have, and is not hard-core raiding type. I prefer a small family type of guild that has not disappeared into other games. I also need a guild that will not freak out when I don't play a lot, since I do have other charactors on different servers, as well as comp problems every time an expansion comes out. I am currently fixing my gaming comp, so I just want some ideas as to which guild to put them in when I can log back in, thanks a ton! =)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <title>Sad Behavior</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Karana&amp;message.id=100#M100</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;This is both to vent my frustrations in general and to give people a heads up of all the bad attitudes I come across on our server.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Every server has it's hot zones.&amp;nbsp; You know, the ones where people go to get good xp fast.&amp;nbsp; On our server, Paludal Caverns is that zone.&amp;nbsp; I am no longer surprised that every time I go there with a low level alt, that I have problems with KSers.&amp;nbsp; It seems like every time I go there to PL myself someone always wants to force me out of my camp or KS me.&amp;nbsp; Now I know that technically there is no such thing as a camp.&amp;nbsp; But anyone that is courteous will be respectful and leave someone alone when they are trying to hunt solo.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Take camp 1 in PC for example.&amp;nbsp; Two hills, four tents, plenty of mobs for two seperate groups to hunt.&amp;nbsp; One group each side right?&amp;nbsp; Well, it seems that some people think it is wrong for a person to want to take two tents to solo, but it is ok for them to attempt to KS that soloer until they get fed up and leave so that all four tents are left for one group.&amp;nbsp; If you ask me, that is just plain wrong.&amp;nbsp; I've seen groups split that camp nicely many times, but there is always one person that thrives on ruining someone else's day that HAS to be a pest.&amp;nbsp; Easy solution for the soloer would be to move on and ignore the bad apples.&amp;nbsp; But is it fair to that person that they should be walked all over while the rude person(s) get their way?&amp;nbsp; Using /report, /petition and /ignore, or talking to their guild leaders doesn't always help much.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I don't know if this post will get deleted or not but I am fed up, and I am sure I am not alone.&amp;nbsp; I am going to use this thread to post names of KSers I have come accross in Norrath.&amp;nbsp; I don't mean the ones that do it once by accident.&amp;nbsp; I mean the ones that persist in pestering you until you are forced to give up and log off in frustration before you do something stupid to stoop to their level.&amp;nbsp; I will not list the names of the guilds they belonged to at the time because people change guilds, and it isnt' the guild's fault that an individual chooses to make them look bad with their disrespectful behavior.&amp;nbsp; Some of you will read this and think I am just as dumb as the newbs acting so rudely.&amp;nbsp; Sad thing is that a lot of the people behavign this way are people that have been playing a while already, some of them grown adults.&amp;nbsp; Why does being a pixelated character suddenly make it ok to be an ass?&amp;nbsp; If this post survives and doesn't get deleted, I will add names as I come across the less savory people I meet in Norrath.&amp;nbsp; If you want to add to this thread please, do not include guild names.&amp;nbsp; Do not post false information.&amp;nbsp; Be honest and don't use this as an excuse to defame an otherwise good person.&amp;nbsp; This is my way of venting, and putting out the names of people that don't want to be your friend, don't want to play nice, they just want to ruin your day.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Odesi - At the time of my issue with him he was a lvl 18 DE necromancer without a guild.&amp;nbsp; (surprise surprise)&amp;nbsp; I was happily PLing my level 14 warrior in PC at camp 1.&amp;nbsp; Had several group offers but I chose to solo instead.&amp;nbsp; I love to PL my friends and guildies and nice people i meet in zones.&amp;nbsp; But when it comes to groups of strangers it is hard for me because I always feel bad if I can't keep up and someone dies.&amp;nbsp; So I politely decline each offer for a group, stating I am simply there to get some fast xp so I can leave PC.&amp;nbsp; After all, I always end up having trouble there, but hey, the xp is great!&amp;nbsp; 20 minutes go by and I am easily holding my own with just two tents.&amp;nbsp; I am not being greedy, I dont' need all four tents.&amp;nbsp; After all, a group could come in and need a camp to pull from.&amp;nbsp; Fair is fair.&amp;nbsp; Suddenly this Odesi person comes in with a group of friends.&amp;nbsp; Offers me a group, I politely decline.&amp;nbsp; He proceeds to tell me "well we are camping here so we will just over power you."&amp;nbsp; I tell him that I have been there for 20 minutes and that there are two perfectly good tents on the other hill of the camp open, just take those.&amp;nbsp; He does not seem to want those two and has his group attack everything I pull in an attempt to KS me.&amp;nbsp; They only succeed in stealing my xp a few times but I am beyond annoyed at this point.&amp;nbsp; How is it fair for this person to come in and tell me they are taking MY camp?&amp;nbsp; After OOCing a couple times for them to please leave me be they continue their rude behavior.&amp;nbsp; I move to the other side of the camp, the two tents they were ignoring, and pull from there, only to have them KS me some more.&amp;nbsp; They think it's dumb for me to want to solo two tents, yet they think it is fair for them to have all four.&amp;nbsp; This sucks big time.&amp;nbsp; I do a petition.&amp;nbsp; I send a report.&amp;nbsp; No GMs on at the time so by the time anything gets done about it, they will be logged off.&amp;nbsp; Odesi keeps running from my alt to my main, kissing them on the cheek, and telling me in /ooc to "try to compete sweetie".&amp;nbsp; By this time I am wishing I could send an incurable virus to this person's computer just to show then that playing EQ is a privilege not a right.&amp;nbsp; I tell him in /ooc that I am not his sweetie and that with his attitude he won't have many friends other than his fellow KSing Natzis.&amp;nbsp; By this time enough has been said back and forth in /ooc that the rest of the zone is getting sick of it, even though everyone that has said anything has agreed with me whole heartedly.&amp;nbsp; It seems they too have had KSing issues today....sigh....&amp;nbsp; But what can I do about it?&amp;nbsp; Nothing.&amp;nbsp; Abso-friggin-lutely nothing.&amp;nbsp; I can only hope that one day, he gets what he deserves.&amp;nbsp; The truly sad thing about this is that one of my guildies reported to me that the previous night, they too had issues with Odesi, only it was another one of his alts.&amp;nbsp; Even worse, this other alt is in one of our ally guilds!&amp;nbsp; It is so sad that someone would be so cowardly as to hide behind an alt to make trouble and be so two faced as to act as if they are your friend on another character.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Twotime - A barbarian something or other at the time of the incident.&amp;nbsp; This person was guilded at the time.&amp;nbsp; He was also grouped with Odesi, the jerk off from above.&amp;nbsp; He never said a word, as if letting Odesi do all the talking made his actions acceptable.&amp;nbsp; He just continued to attack everything I pulled regardless of the fact that the first 10 times I asked them to leave me alone, it was nicely.&amp;nbsp; I sent a tell to a high lvl person in his guild.&amp;nbsp; Just wanted to inform them that they had a KSer in their guild that was making them look bad.&amp;nbsp; You know a guild has potential when its members actually try to do something about a bad apple instead of just letting it slide.&amp;nbsp; However, when only one person makes an effort, it makes you think poorly about that guild, which is wrong because not everyone in a guild neccessarily has a bad attitude.&amp;nbsp; The high lvl person I sent a tell to tried to get an officer's attention with no luck.&amp;nbsp; He even came to the zone to speak with Twotime but received no response from him.&amp;nbsp; Makes me so angry that someone would care so little about the image they are projecting on the guild they belong to.&amp;nbsp; Whether they care or not, there ARE people that strive to make a guild succeed.&amp;nbsp; People like Twotime just don't care because they think that if they get kicked out, big deal, they can always join another guild.&amp;nbsp; But eventually, word will spread about what an Arse womeone is and no guild wants them.&amp;nbsp; They go from Asset status to liability status.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <title>Karana Guilds</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Karana&amp;message.id=83#M83</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I was wondering if there is a list of Karana guilds actively seeking members? if so where is it located?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I am looking for an active guild for my enchanter and cleric and dont want to go through the hassle of joining and leaving every guild that comes along. Im looking for hunts and raids on a regular basis.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If anyone can steer me in the right direction I would appreciate it.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I also already listed in the Looking for guild thread in the main index of the servers forums.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Thanks,&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <title>Good Idea: Please help spread the word</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Karana&amp;message.id=65#M65</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana color=#cc0000 size=2&gt;Hello, my name is Arkticwynd Wyntyrfury' Wolfmoon.&amp;nbsp; I am the guild leader of the Arctic Wolves on the Karana Server.&amp;nbsp; I have a suggestion for adding a guild management&amp;nbsp;feature that would make the life of a guild leader and guild officer much easier.&amp;nbsp; If you are a guild leader/officer, or if you just plain like my idea, please use the /feedback option in the game, or send an email to: EQFeedback@soe.sony.com&amp;nbsp; and submit feedback similar to what I am listing below.&amp;nbsp; This is a copy of the email I sent to SoE:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana color=#cc0000 size=2&gt;I feel that a "Banned Characters" option should be added to the guild management window for all servers.&amp;nbsp; It should work the way the "friends" and "ignore" lists do.&amp;nbsp; The guild leader and officers should be able to type in the names of people that are banned from the guild.&amp;nbsp; Then members should be able to view those names by clicking on the tab or button that says "Banned Characters".&amp;nbsp; I also think that this feature should allow the /guildinvite command to recognize other characters on the banned person's account.&amp;nbsp; I am not saying it should tell you all the names of the banned person's alts.&amp;nbsp; Instead, if a banned person tries to get an alt invited into the guild, when the /guildinvite command is issued, a text box should pop up saying "This person cannot join your guild.&amp;nbsp; They have been banned on another character."&amp;nbsp; This would enable guild leaders to keep vengeful, bitter, bad apples out of their guilds.&amp;nbsp; I have seen several good guilds either have on-going problems or go down in flames becasue of one or more people that continued to causes trouble for them.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana color=#cc0000 size=2&gt;I know I would benefit a great deal from this.&amp;nbsp; For example:&amp;nbsp; There is a woman on my server that I do not get along with in RL.&amp;nbsp; She was kicked out of the last guild she and I both happened to be in, becasue she continually broke guild rules by harassing people.&amp;nbsp; She takes great pleasure in harassing me in the game, something I am workign on resolving at this very moment.&amp;nbsp; I know the names of four of her toons.&amp;nbsp; She has tried to get one of them in my guild since&amp;nbsp;it was&amp;nbsp;created.&amp;nbsp; However, she still has four character slots she could have toons in that I do not know about.&amp;nbsp; I don't necessarily want to know who all her toons are, but it would help keep her out of my guild if my idea was implemented.&amp;nbsp; I have talked to quite a few people on my server about this, both guild leaders and non-guild leaders.&amp;nbsp; They have all loved my idea.&amp;nbsp; What should I do to get Sony to seriously consider this idea?&amp;nbsp; Do I need to go around asking people to send feedback until they type their fingers to the bone?&amp;nbsp; I honestly feel this would benefit a great number of guilds.&amp;nbsp; I have already used the in-game /feedback option.&amp;nbsp; I know you are very busy so the likely hood of a response is slim to none.&amp;nbsp; But that was over two months ago, and I have not heard anything on it.&amp;nbsp; It would be nice to at least know if this suggestion is being remotely considered.&amp;nbsp; Thank you for your time.&amp;nbsp; Have a nice day.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana color=#cc0000 size=2&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana color=#cc0000 size=2&gt;Arkticwynd Wyntyrfury' Wolfmoon&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana color=#cc0000 size=2&gt;I do not know how many guild leaders out there experience problems with persistent people that have been kicked out of their guild for one reason or another.&amp;nbsp; But anything that makes the life of a guild leader easier, is a good idea to me!&amp;nbsp; If you support my idea, please use the /feedback option or send SoE an email similar to the one I pasted above.&amp;nbsp; Feel free to offer up suggestions that would perfect this idea as well.&amp;nbsp; One person can come up with a good idea, but many people coming together to perfect it turns it into a great idea.&amp;nbsp; Your comments would be appreciated.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana color=#cc0000 size=2&gt;May each respective Deity bless you, and my the Wolves guide your paths to great adventure!&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</description>
