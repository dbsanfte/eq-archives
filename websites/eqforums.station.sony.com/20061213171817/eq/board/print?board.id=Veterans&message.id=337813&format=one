<P>My only hope is that the "Epic" style of availability will continue as it has, at least from 1.0s. Anyone should be able to obtain the Epic... it's the QUEST that is "epic", not the rarity or availability of the item.</P>
<P>I've read some hints that Epics should be 'rare' or 'limited' in some form or fashion, and I disagree with that line of thought. If Devs want to create/load in "Artifacts" or other super-rare items, that's cool. But the idea of a lengthy quest, the end of which grants you a reward that is prized and potent for the level attained and time invested, is something that any player, from casual to hard-core, should be able to experience.</P>
<P>With that said, I DO think it would be awesome if Sony would create Epic armor quests. Even if it's only for select pieces (and not whole suits), I think it'd be super cool. Lengthy quests, lots of lore, that anyone can undertake, for good rewards. That's how I hope they remain.</P>
<P>Just my 2 coppers. <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0></P>
