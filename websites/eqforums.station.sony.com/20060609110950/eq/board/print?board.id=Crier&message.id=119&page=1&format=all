<DIV>It's day one at The Electronic Entertainment Expo or E3.&nbsp; Brenlo and I board the bus that will take us to the Los Angelas convention center, traffic is a bit on the nasty side and it takes us nearly an hour to go just over 3 miles, thank goodness we don't live here in LA.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>We arrive at the show and push our way through the crowds of people waiting to get into the exhibit halls when the doors officially open, we run into the folks from EQ Interface, we wave hello as we pass by.&nbsp; Once we get inside there is loud music, bright flashing lights and tons of signage.&nbsp; The SOE booth is unlike anything I've ever seen before.&nbsp; It's a large castle with a huge video screen that is running a video that features most of SOE's titles.&nbsp; We plan to have the EverQuest portion featured on EQLive soon.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>There are a few "Booth Babes," with PSP's attached to their belts, Antonia Bayle is posing for pictures and the SOE employees at the counter are handing out stickers.&nbsp; We have people walking around the show asking "Did you know type questions that correspond with posters around the outside of the booth, these our questions about our various games, those that answer correctly win a prize.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The inside of our closed booth is rather large..&nbsp; It features various meeting rooms, PCs with demos of most of our titles, and some really cool looking posters on the wall.&nbsp; There is alo a smoothie bar and a few refreshments.&nbsp; Unfortunately there wasn't any pie in sight, Brenlo and I consoled each other with a walk around the show floor to check out the other booths in the area.&nbsp; There are lots of exciting things to see.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>We return and Sylvene from stratics stops in.&nbsp; We chat for a bit, take a few pictures and then Brenlo rushes off to one of those meeting rooms.&nbsp; A bit later Gemdiver stops by to say hello.&nbsp; Rashere, Chris Lena, and I chat with him for a bit.&nbsp; It's great to see some familiar faces!</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>It's time to leave the how for the day, our feet are tired and sitting down to take the bus home feels like a gift from Karana.&nbsp; Until tomorrow, this has been Ashlanne Barefoot, your official E3 correspondent.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>P.S.&nbsp; We hope to have pictures to post tomorrow.</DIV><p>Message Edited by Ashlanne on <span class=date_text>05-19-2005</span> <span class=time_text>03:15 PM</span>

<DIV>Day 2 - </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>It's way too early to be awake, ok ok so it's only ten minutes after 8 AM...&nbsp; I am sitting in our hotel lobby sipping my vanilla latte and munching on a croissant, once again not a slice of pie in sight, oh well at least I have coffee.&nbsp; The bus should be here soon, I hope traffic isn't as bad as yesterday...</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Later in the day -</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>It's almost 3:30 in the afternoon now.&nbsp; Today seems longer then yesterday, perhaps thats due to staying up too late and partying last night <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-wink.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I have stayed pretty close to the SOE booth so far but we've had a ton of visitors today.&nbsp; The folks from EQ Interface stopped in first thing this morning.&nbsp; I chatted with them for a few minutes.&nbsp; I saw Gemdiver again for a bit as well.&nbsp; Allakhazam and Illia from &nbsp;Allakhazam's Magical Realm were poking around I think I saw Rashere talking to them.&nbsp; Zorillius is in the booth today as well, I waved hello to him earlier.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Thats all I have for now except a little birdie told me that we may have information regarding the next expansion for EverQuest available at Fan Faire in June.&nbsp; I am very excited to hear this news...</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I am working to get pictures up for you, in fact right now Brenlo is out looking for someone that has the proper USB attachment for the camera.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>See ya later,</DIV>
<DIV>Ashlanne your official E3 Halfling Correspondent.</DIV>

<DIV>Hello From E3 on day Three!!</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I am sitting in the Tech room waiting to get some more pictures to show you.&nbsp; Brenlo put up a few in his <A href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=brenlo&amp;message.id=61" target=_blank>Coffee Diaries</A> yesterday.&nbsp; It was tough getting to the show today, we took Brenlo's car because we had to check out of our hotel.&nbsp; Trying to find parking at the convention center is "fun," no really it was a joy <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-wink.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I am still a bit excited about what happened yesterday evening.&nbsp; Brenlo and I went out to dinner in Hollywood and as we were walking back to the car we noticed a crowd of people crossing the street.&nbsp; They had just finished the Premire for the "Longest Yard," and everyone was heading to the after party.&nbsp; I got to see Adam Sandler and tons of other celebrities but&nbsp;I won't bore you with that for now...</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The booth is a hopping place this morning there is lots to see, I plan to get the camera out and take more pictures today.&nbsp; I probably won't get to post those until Monday though.&nbsp; For now here is a picture of Antonia on day one with an EQ player.&nbsp; Look he has a Fan Faire shirt on.&nbsp; <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0></DIV>

<P>Monday is here and it's been a long day.&nbsp; I think anyone who spends more then one full day at E3 probably wants to spend a few days in a dark quiet room, sensory overload is a bad thing mmmkay!!&nbsp; <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-wink.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0>&nbsp; So the show was awesome.&nbsp; Lots of great things to see which I am sure you know now just by checking out the various write ups out there...&nbsp; I know I was checking out G4 this morning to see what they had to say...</P>
<P>So really all I have are a bunch more pictures.&nbsp; I was able to get the others re-sized so they look much better now.&nbsp; The PC I was using in our booth must not like Halflings or something because it sure gave me a headache.</P>
<P>This is the front of our booth.&nbsp; This was basically the scene from Wednesday morning until Friday at 4.&nbsp; What a crowd!</P>
<P><IMG src="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/forum_images/e3/Outside_booth.jpg"></P>
<P><BR>Here is a picture of your little Halfling Correspondent hard at work <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-tongue.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0> Great magazine by the way!!</P>
<P><IMG src="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/forum_images/e3/Ashlanne_SOE_Worlds.jpg"></P>
<P><BR>This is a great shot of our favorite Halfling, Brenlo.&nbsp; He is standing next to one of our great marketing folks.&nbsp; Some of you may remember her from the New Orleans Fan Faire Best of the Best Tournament.</P>
<P><IMG src="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/forum_images/e3/Brenlo_Greenberg.jpg"><BR></P>
<P>Speaking of Fan Faire, here is a great shot of Fan Faire Jen!!&nbsp; Jen heads up the team that organizes Fan Faire.&nbsp; She and her team also organize events like E3, GenCom, and Comic Con...</P>
<P><IMG src="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/forum_images/e3/fanfaireJen.jpg"></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><BR>Our booth always opens to SOE employees on Friday from 2 PM to 4 PM.&nbsp; You never know who might turn up.&nbsp; You folks know this guy...&nbsp; Here is EQ Designer Rahtiz...</P>
<P><IMG src="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/forum_images/e3/Rahtiz_at_E3.jpg"></P>
<P><BR>I told you our booth was huge... This is a picture of part of the inside, you can see part of the smoothie machine behind that brick counter.&nbsp; <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-very-happy.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0></P>
<P><IMG src="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/forum_images/e3/booth_inside.jpg"></P>
<P><BR>Ashlanne and Brenlo hanging out under those weapons I told you about.&nbsp; Aren't they neat looking???</P>
<P><IMG src="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/forum_images/e3/Brenlo_Ashlanne.jpg"></P>
<P><BR>This is the Antonia Bayle we had for day #2 and #3...&nbsp; I have 2 pictures of her.<BR>First Picture -</P>
<P><IMG src="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/forum_images/e3/Day_2_Antonia.jpg"><BR></P>
<P>Second Picture - (just noticed I labeled the picture wrong, ignore the label)</P>
<P><IMG src="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/forum_images/e3/Day_One_Antonia1.jpg"><BR></P>
<P>Here is one of those lovely ladies I spoke of the first day of the show....&nbsp; Some of you may refer to them as "Booth Babes."&nbsp; She also has a couple of those stickers I told you about too.</P>
<P><IMG src="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/forum_images/e3/Booth_babe_PSP.jpg"></P>
<P>Larger Versions of this poster could be found in several places at the show...&nbsp; Wonder if I could get one for the office I share with Ky <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-wink.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0></P>
<P><IMG src="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/forum_images/e3/SOE_Poster.jpg"></P>
<P>Remember how I told you Sylvene from Stratics stopped by?&nbsp; We grabbed a quick picture of her and Tamara during her visit.&nbsp; Sorry about the blurry picture....</P>
<P><IMG src="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/forum_images/e3/caroline_tamara.jpg"><BR></P>
<P>And I leave you with a picture of the Huge screen that was perched atop our booth.&nbsp; I will also poke the person that promised me the video footage, maybe I will use one of those swords that were on the walls...</P>
