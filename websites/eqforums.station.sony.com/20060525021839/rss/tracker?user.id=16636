      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;monks are currently 1 of most overpowered classes if not the most overpowered class.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;They get best snare in game, some of best stuns in game, best regen/avoidance, and to top it off, unresistable nuke. Someone from dev. team pry plays monk on zek. The imbalance between what diff. classes get in DoN is rediculous. Did monks really deserve chromatic neg 400 adjust snare and nuke? Honestly? Why not just give them ht as well?&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Zek is overpopulated. We need breathing time, currently 90% of zones are empty because the second you start exp. group, you get attacked. Just too many people with nothing to do. Second team server would own, then all sz tards can go back and ruin eq for themselves.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;What pvp from SZ are you talking about? I have counted total of may be 12 people from SZ that even zone into pvp zones. It is usually 2 -3 bards and a monk, most of "pvp" they do involves mobs or faction (hi seru) they keep dying and training. I am yet to see any pvp enchanters name Pinhedd, whats ur name on RZ? &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;That is it, VZ/TZ pvp by far more, i fight them every day, every day people are different. SZ pvp was mostly camping PoDs in DS and running off whenever any comparable odds zone in. Honestly most of Hate I see ONLY when 30-40 of them go to raid Qvic. What are those pvpers from SZ that you referring to? Greenies from Assault? I am yet to see any "skill" you keep referring to. Please do point those out, or at least 20 or 30 people that PvP, and not just raid instanced zones and talk smurf on board.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So far all I see is occasional group going thru LS or 3 bards/monk training. Where is the pvp?&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Let me get this straight, Hate ninjalooted something (probably warped on corpse) from Defiant or PDM and GM said it was legal? What was the name of GM please? He should be fired asap for GM favoritism, item should be returned to a rightful owner and person that ninjalooted item needs to be banned and all officers of his guild given a 7 day suspension with exception of Speedd. Speedd needs to be banned. His wizzie was banned on SZ. I am not sure what you needed to do on SZ to get banned short of repeatedly crashing server and being absolutely blatant about it, but he has done it (got banned on SZ). He however got unbanned, does he have a good pal in CS that keeps making favorable decisions and keep him and 2 other training retards from hate from being banned?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;There is a clear slant of GM favoritism that I see on new Zek, it seems only Hate are satisfied with GM support while rest of the server are pretty much pissed with it. Given state of GM support pre merger on Zek where Dannkurt pretty much babysitted Wudan raids and gave frivolous warnings and harassed all people opposed to Wudan and looking who Wudan merged with after the merge, I dont think its too far fetched at this point to call a foul play.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;This is absolutely the first time that I hear about ninja looting being legal. If anything it is either a retro-active change made to fit a specific situation or a bad judgement or intentional favoritism on part of a GM. Since i find it hard to believe that a boss mob (this isnt about someone looting a fabled fungi, is it?) can be ninjalooted without hacks, this isn't just a rule dispute. This is what we refer to as "gm bullsmurf".&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Yes, Zek has become a cesspool of EQ with addition of SZ, merging other 3 servers wouldnt have been so bad, SZ just really makes it not worth it. Other guilds do hack, Haabx from Defiant is even more blatant about it than SZ people, but they hack for different reasons. They hack to gain edge in pvp, I can deal with that if they cant compete fairly. Hate hacks to absolutely ruin your EQ expirience even at expence of being repeatedly owned (which they get). That is something GMs need to deal with. Perhaps do a forceful movelog of all SZ people back to SZ. I can guarantee you they all will manage to ruin EQ for each other in a week and everyone on Zek will be much happier.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=PVP&amp;message.id=10235#M10235</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Calliel, I am really simply looking for a solution so that new Zek server doesnt become a repeated failure of SZ in couple of months where top guilds are "bored" with game because they dont want to spend 8 hours on next raid for 30 hp upgrade and cant find any pvp challenge because bottom part of server cannot progress at all and threfore cannot present a pvp challenge.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Note, I accept and welcome pvp resolution of content disputes, if your guild and mine are after same mob, I would most certainly say that PvP is the way to resolve the problem, even if it DOES include raid interruption and interference. Which is similar to what Mearis was saying. My guild in past did fight over spawn disputes and I think it is how it should be handled.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;What I dont approve of, is c-blocking for sake of c-blocking in order to eliminate competition by any means necessary, and that is what new "rules" are aimed at as well as what entire PDM/Defiant alliance seem to be about. Note they dont eliminate raid interruption, they simply state that those raid interruptions are OK only for ONE side, while NOT ok for the other side. Neither me nor Mearis proposed a way to solve it, even if we have an idea how, we simply pointed that in current state, those rules strongly favor those that already have the upper hand while putting other side at even bigger disadvantage.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;One more time, its not that we are against attacking raids as they are, its that we are against free ticket to attack raids for one side (bigger guilds) and punishment for exactly same thing to the other side, that is called double standard and it is bad. Its bad for all of us not because you consider us a losing side, not like with rumored 2 guild warnings PDM will last to enjoy the benefits rules provide, it is simply bad for the server because it encourages c-blocking and does not in any way prevent or solve issues thus pointing server in direction which we already know failed TWICE, once on SZ and once on TZ. I for once would like for most of people on server to have fun, not just part of it.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Personal attacks aside, Mearis does have some kind of a point. If you only can disrupt raids that you can contest for, it does put lower end guilds at a distinct disadvantage.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Lets be honest, lower end guilds are at disadvantage already, they are:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;1. Less numerous&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;2. Worse geared&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;3. Dont have mere access to some of content&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Giving upper end guilds an OK to mess with raids on lower end while prosecuting them for paying back, is rather unfair. It takes not a "FAIR CHANCE" but a mere reasonable possibility of lesser guild to either compete or to fight back. Mere possibility that your raids might be disrupted by lesser guild might serve as deterrence for a bigger one to prevent bigger guild&amp;nbsp; from interfering with lesser one's raiding. However, if you let bigger one to disrupt lesser one's raids while prohibiting them fighting back, you are looking at simply UNFAIR conditions.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I dont get argument "too bad we beat you to content" for 2 reasons. First of all, server merger put some people at innate disadvantage because on my server, I wouldnt let a guild like say Hate exist in my pvp ruleset. I kosed 2 guilds of similar status off server and they were way ahead of me in progression. I did not have a chance to interfere with progression of other guilds that I have to pvp with now, instead I blocked progression of other guilds that I saw as threat and done it at expense of my own progression. Secondly, PvP should be challenge. However fun it is to get uber geared character and then go around dropping people with virtual godmode, SZ's expirience , I hope, taught us that people simply dont like pvp in condition of total and complete unfairness. It is either fair or people will quit the game.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The appeal of new PvP server is increased challenge, not more opportunities to c-block more people, **SMURF** as much gear as you can, post 30 posts "I pwnzoreded joo" and then "get bored and quit". For PvP to represent a challenge, it needs to be somewhat balanced and somewhat fair. I have fought a few Hate on new Zek server and I dont understand how people such as Pinhed would represent any kind of pvp challenge to those. I mean, unless his magelo is 100% incorrect, or unless his sole and main pvp weapon was training, pvping him would neither be challenge nor fun. It is limited to carrying around crimson potion and bothering to press attack. That is what pvp systems that allow unrestricted c-blocking without allowing fighting back produce. That is the reason why TZ and SZ were 2 least populated servers. If you want PvP on new Zek to completely die out in few months, by all means, take SZ and TZ for model and go with it.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;RZ and VZ represented by far more balanced pvp environment and by far bigger population.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Once again, PvP is only really fun when its challenging and fair. When you are constantly fighting overwhelming odds on 1 side and getting warnings and suspensions on the other, it gets really really really old, really really really fast.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;As for PDM's owning in pvp, I am yet to see a single tagged PDM that doesnt use macroquest plugins to warphack and instagate, Rayine being one of the most blatantly obvious with using those, I mean guy doesnt even bother to pretend hes not hacking. Not that I care much, we got enough PDM farmed for points, but still... I would say Hate is most blatant hackers so far, PDM being close second, do you guys require distribution of macroquest 2 upon joining? &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=PVP&amp;message.id=9966#M9966</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;That is Callien, because you think of your VZ player made PnP to be universal as applied to new server. I have been on Rallos for 5 years and counting and at no point was a rule enforced PnP stating anywhere that you cannot attack raid during an encounter. There has been several player made PnP agreements during various wars and that is what gave birth to what we think is acceptable and what YOU think is acceptable.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I dont understand where problems with "rotations" coming into play, perhaps you were mis informed coming to the merge, most of Rallos gives about as much as rat's smurf about rotating stuff they cant do. What most of people have problems with is "Farming lesser geared people for pvp points when you are bored" and that is what most of your "pvp" consists on. Dont for one minute pretend that you and your guild are warring anyone over content. You attack people for no reason and you interfere with their playtime because you are bored and because you "might get pvp points" plus of course theres that "i pwn joo" thing you can throw around.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Look, no PnP agreements will work or even exist unless sides that are fighting are willing BOTH to comply to them. I by no means care what those are, I attack people that attack me and my friends and if you want to play dirty, we will play dirty back. I have absolutely 0 in game mob contests with your guild, and contesting or rotating CBQ is not borderline retarded, it is completely and utterly retarded to begin with. If there is agreed set of PnP rules that both sides agreed to comply with and those are public, I will encourage my guild to comply with them and expect people on other side to follow those too, otherwise you sound at very least hypocritical. For the record we were on a mob when Defiant jumped us in Kod'Taz, so I kinda consider thing in Natimbi to be a payback of sorts.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=PVP&amp;message.id=9958#M9958</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I have had horrendous expirience with RZ GM Dannkurt who now changed name because everyone was tired of him. It isnt the number of GM, its what those GMs do. Dannkurt spent 99% of his time going around removing last names of people that he felt were "breaking policy" and harassing people that he grew to dislike personally. You could give him full report of sexual harassment, death threats and blatant hacking at the same time and he would shrug his cyber shoulders and attentively look the other way. Yet he managed to issue more warnings for GM harassment (when people msged him back pissed) than all combined GMs and guides for entire 5 year history of Rallos combined.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;This is NOT problem with numbers of GMs, it is what abovesaid GMs spend their "valuable and paid" time on. One GM like Ozuri of late Rallos would be sufficient for entire The Zek and Hate would probably be on permanent 10 day suspension as result. Put 30 GMs like Dannkurt on The Zek and all you will see is a lot of suspensions for GM harassment and no last names for 75% of the population.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;As it stands, the easy to fix solution for GM interference should be scheduling a GM or a Senior Guide to attend raids of 1 of 3 sides to monitor any BLATANT hacking or training like in case of Pofire being crashed on EoD/AD raid when Fennin was 3% (or did it die?). There are 3 big sides on RZ atm, there isnt more than 1 or 2 guildes needed to supervise ongoing raids. Calling GM after you were trained or zone crashed doesnt do you much good, for "we need to witness the exploit in order to take action", so just schedule a guide or GM to be present when you start raiding.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I think for the blatant bullsmurf that The Zek server is, CS owes us at least that.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;If you are referring to the Pandas/Defiant attempt at CBQ being attacked, let me assure you, there were 30 people in the raid (as I was in it) and several un-raided groups monitoring Nedaria/Kod'Taz and etc. I understand exaggregating for sake of emphasis, but Defiant shouldn't be the first to point fingers because my guild been attacked during miniraid prep. in Kod'Taz by Defiant members. Defiant been beaten out, reformed and zerged us again with Pandemonium. If you are against "raid interference" please be against "ANY" raid interference, not just "if we attack their raids its fine according to PnP, but if they attack ours, scream bloody murder"..&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Our recruits been intentionally exp. killed in Kod'Taz and wos and many other zones by members of your "alliance" so I can assure you that many of your members treat PnP very liberally, or rather remember about it when THEY are on wrong end of it. I have been jumped by 2 Midnight Haven necros while fighting Hate in NC (they are your feeder guild correct?) and then when ONE minute later I re-engaged abovesaid necros in NC, they whined that they pulled a mob (note they attacked me first and I never left the zone) and I was meanie (mob was 3% when I attacked),&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I can point fingers all day long about PnP and player agreements. I did see Calliel go after Hate first in DS and only then engage me and Setti, and I myself ALWAYS go after Hate first and try not to grief people too much (unless I really hate them), but unless your side of this conflict makes a coherent effort to enforce the PnP on your side instead of just pointing accusing finger and making big eyes, this will quickly become a free for all grief fest that Sullon was. We all know what happened to Sullon and understand why their ruleset and lack of GM interference will lead to a dead server, so lets not all go there.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;One last time, when you are making serious accusations, like in case of CBQ raid, please get your facts straight first. Like numbers. If you have issues with PnP being broken, discuss it with opposing side and come to either resolution or some ground rules and penalties for breaking those rules. As it stands right now, I believe, everything is taken completely on good faith and no one cares if THEIR side breaks PnP (but god forbid other side does).&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>REAL ISSUES with Zek and how to fix them</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=PVP&amp;message.id=9955#M9955</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;No broad "omg, fix hacking" in this post, no calls for nerfs or rebalancing/reworking pvp system. Just pointing some blatant bugs that need to be fixed easily in under 15 mins (thats how long it would take me to fix them).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;1. /w "guildname" invisibility. For some reason be it GM favoritism, **SMURF**ty coding or intentional exploiting, some The Zek guilds are invisible to /w "guildname" command. I can point specifically to "Hate" and "Defiant" as not appearing when you do "/w defiant". This is accomplished in case for example of Defiant by placing 2 break spaces at the end of guild name which effectively renders search script a la SoE impotent. There are workarounds it, but there is absolutely no reason why ANY guild should be granted /w invisibility. I dont want to type /w guild1006 every time I need to see what Hate are in zone. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;How to fix it: Run a simple script that removes all breakspaces at beginning of guildname, at the end of guildname, all the double breakspaces and etc. It takes 15 minutes to write script for you DB admin. If he/she tells you it takes longer, fire him and ask me to do it. If you dont want to fire your admin and too lasy to do the simple change, make an HTML or a post on this board (sticked) will suffice with all guild# of all Zek guilds.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;2. Instagating. Everyone seems to instagate lately and I honestly doubt that much money is being dumped onto potion merchants. In my expirience, instant "poof" of a player is caused by either using an instant gate potion that costs 1kpp or 3 kinds of hacks. 1. is Macroquest 2 hack that allows you to instantly gate to bind. 2. /zone hack that allows you to zone into any zone connected to one you are in.&amp;nbsp; 3. instant camp with Macroquest 2. What is really BAD about instant gating is that it doesnt allow to distinguish between legit (but lame) players that use potion and blatant hackers.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;How to fix it. Add a cast message to instagate potion, like "The Nexus" on wiz. instagate or "Exodus" on dru/wiz ability. Make it something "The Bind". What will that accomplish? It will let legit players to see who is cheating and allow us to report cheaters for GM/Guide investigation. We cant really report every instagater, I mean there are just TOO MANY, but if we knew for SURE which ones are hacking, it would help.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;3. Warphacking and etc. from what I understand, macroquest uses EQ interface and submits "/" commands to client. Easiest way to fix it, I imagine, would be restricting which commands can be submitted and executed, or alternatively all / commands could be logged by the server for say last 24 hours.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Many unique atributes of other classes have been destroyed time over time again and I dont see you complaining about it. Where were you when horses were introduced and bards unique ability to run faster than anyone was shared with all the other classes? I can go on and on and on about this, but it all boils down to this:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;At this point in pvp, it is easier to fix balance by making mujaki more resistable than rebalancing all pvp nukes as whole. It is easier, faster , wont break anything and will take 15 minutes of fixing without drastic consequences. All you need is to agree to that and we are done. You agree that Mujaki shouldnt be best pvp nuke, I agree with it too, but if we start rebalancing all the pure caster nukes, it will bring up MORE imbalance than there already is, so why not just fix the single most overpowered one and be done with it until SoE has time for another HUGE pvp balancing?&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
Yes, necromancers are the only int caster capable of healing themselves if you ignore items.&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;This implies that with items other int. casters can heal themselves using ITEMS. Rest of your post implied that items is what makes pvp difference, enabling other classes dispell like enchanters (true), cast DS as magician (true), instagate as wizards (true). So if a necromancer can consistently BUY vendor sold instagate potion to give him ability of a wizard, or can get equipment that makes him able to do dispells as enchanter or ds as magician, where exactly are those items that allow other casters to get some of the necromancer abilities?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The point I am trying to make here is that necromancers are lucky enough to have the ability to heal themselves to begin with, an ability UNIQUE to all caster classes. Fact is, that ability apparently is ALSO a best pvp nuke in existence due to faster cast than lure while having equal dps. THAT is what is wrong. The lifetap should NOT be best pvp nuke available thru all casters, it should be a way to HEAL (I can agree with that), but should not be THE BEST pvp nuke that enables necromancers to tank melees simply by tapping hps back.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;You keep going in&amp;nbsp; a circular argument refuting your own claims (uselessness of mr based spells that are easily dispelled for necromancers while their apparent potency for shamans), having ABILITY to debuff in your claim is more powerful than having ABILITY to cast hard to resist dots and heal over time dots that require double dispell to neutralise? How is it 1 click of pumice can be so damaging to a necromancer pvp and do nothing in your eyes to shaman pvp?&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;those misterious items that allow all the casters to reliably heal themselves for 700+ every 3 seconds and that can be found as clicks on items and dont require farming ice giants for the 300hp heal potions.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I understand that in your opinion all the other caster classes should spend all their free time and cash on camping ice giants hoping for a toe drop where you can zone in and take cheap shots at them, but believe me I doubt many of them really think its too much fun.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Secondly, shaman debuff at this point seems as continuation of dr. debuff and I think PR debuff will be removed from it shortly to "balance" them back and put spell in line with previous versions.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So what is this amasing item that allows other classes to efficiently heal themselves without relying on potions that 1. are limited in supply and 2. godaweful to camp and 3. arent store bought unlike cures. If in addition to the 1k gate potion there was 1k cheal instaclick potion for sale, I would agree with you, but there isn't. IG toes are helluva lame camp and if all the casters relied on them for pvp balance, there would be constantly 30 people for every IG spawn in eF and pf. Did you mean stein of moggok with heal charges? Or whichever stein it was?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Look, if necromancer lifetaps rquired ice giant toe per cast and necros had to camp ice giants in order to lifetap their hp back, I would kind of agree with you, even tho potion heals 300 hp and lifetap heals more, but as long as for each lifetap necromancer does he would have to go and camp IG toe, it would be reasonable.. as it stands, you get its kind of BS. Best pvp nuke, best or second best pet, dots, ability to dispell 4 slots with right equipment, 2 da's shadowstep, manatap... if necromancers had rapture as well, why would we even need all the other casters really? Necromancers can do it all equally well or BETTER. You can nuke better than wizard, can dispell as well as enchanter with wbos, your pet is about as good as mage's or arguably better if you count raise undead aa's and of course you have dots and 2 DA's plus FD's in case mobs aggro. Am I missing something or are necromancers so way ahead of other casters they cant even understand how it is to be a CASTER CLASS?&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;So you and Iksarbandit argue that necromancer MR based dots are absolutely useless because anyone with half a brain will dispell them making them impractical in PvP, but by the same virtue Shaman's malos is groundbreaking PvP staple that "balances" shamans as viable pvp class by virtue of the debuff alone?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;How is it necromancer dispellable dots are impotent and useless in pvp according to you both, but shaman's malos that is dispellable just as well is not useless and very potent? Am I seeing a double standard here?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So you keep telling everyone that necromancer dispellable dots are impractical in pvp because they are easy to dispell as well as necromancer dr/pr dots which are "easy to cure" (not that easy) and that Necromancer cannot rely on dots in pvp to deal damage and thus needs a fast unresistable nuke that is also a self heal..&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;But shamans who get essentially same pr/dr dots but no dispellable dots are balanced because of Malos? Did I miss a patch message that made malos un dispellable? Or decay debuff uncurable? &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;How is it dispelling necro dots and curing them makes necromancer dots absolutely impotent, but dispelling malos and curing shaman dots doesnt affect shaman dots at all? &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I am getting kind of lost in this discussion, for some reason dispells that render necro dots useless dont work against malos?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The truth is, necros simply dont WANT to rely on dots because lifetaps are way too overpowered to begin with. I agree, if I had an AK-47 why would I want to rely on my knife? Especially if everyone else is running around with brass knuckles, but I would certainly not call it "balance". &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;As for heals.. necromancer is only pure caster class that is even CAPABLE of healing itself. If necromancer's lifetap healing part was taken away from them, they would still be most powerful caster class hands down because they have it all, best pvp nuke, second best pet among casters, dots, burst dps via lifeburn, swarm pets and swarm dead aa ability that pretty much rivals that of mage aa pets.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I dont get it.. if lifetaps wouldnt heal you in pvp anymore and just dealt un-resistable damage, you would still be single most powerful caster class.. and YET you dont feel that your class is overpowered? And dont think that mujaki needs to be nerfed? Wow..&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;That is kind of a silly question sitizen, it all depends on circumstances and a zone. Generally speaking in an outdoor zone where bards at innate advantage, rangers are single biggest threat to bards.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;In a tight fighting quarters or indoors such as for example CoD zonein, pretty much any class with good burst dps or a good 2hander can and will kill a bard.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;You once again skewing this discussion into "who can kill a bard", well pre patch SKs and wizards could and I felt it was fairly balanced, but the real question is "who can kill a PoTime geared paladin"? And answer is "pretty much no one".&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I am not disputing survivability of my class, I know damn well that if I want to haul ass from someone, I can haul ass and most likely run away 1 on 1 from anyone, but so can druids, wizards and pretty much anyone if their mind is set on just escaping.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I am disputing my pvp potency as in ability to kill opponents in reasonable amount of time without having to bore them to death.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Yet this thread was not even about bards to begin with, this is thread about necromancer lifetap being overpowered because it is a lifetap and a best pvp nuke at SAME time. But hey, it is a pretty good tactic to continuously change subject of debate from the debated points to the personality of a debater and claim that I cannot dispute necromancers being overpowered because you percieve my class as being overpowered. Once again, it does work well in presidential debates.. why not on this board eh?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I am still waiting on an explanation how shamans are perfectly balanced with their pr/dr dots and necromancer dots are complete crap while both land the same? Is it because they are crap compared to overpowered lifetap and you simply dont need to use dots because the lifetap is overpowered?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Hey Iksarbandit since your "pvp expirience" havent taught you how to bypass full buff stacks, I would suggest you learn how to play the game before arguing with real pvpers, ok?&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;I tell you what, if I explain to you how to bypass full buff stacks or semi full buff stacks, will you publically accept that you were wrong and post that necromancers are indeed overpowered and lifetaps need to be balanced, or will you bounce back with some outrageous claim how wizard can run equally geared necromancer by chaining forceshield and thus pwn him in 1 on 1 fight? I dont want more bs, tell me either YES if I explain to you how to effectively deal with full buff stack u will admit you were wrong all along and change your position, or NO you will keep babbling how necromancers arent overpowered and how I should take lessons from you in pvp.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;Yes, Enchanter nuke was better than Mujaki, hell yeah baby, go powernuking enchanters that could nuke better in pvp than necros, and dont forget those pesky mages and druids.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I am simply not going to argue with you because in responce to arguments, both of you make absolutely outrageous claims and refuse to own up to your own lies. The bit with enchanters having better nuke than necromancers did itfor me. Lets do this, for balancing necros, mujaki is given checks and dmg of enchanter nuke, then everyone will be happy. According to you anyways.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=PVP&amp;message.id=7675#M7675</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Ok for one, I highly doubt anyone actually choses their pvp gear based on "fighting necros and only necros". Pre patch high cr/fr were absolutely essential for fighting druids, no one without at least 250+ in fr/cr unbuffed could call his gear "pvp" gear, dont forget mages and their critting bolts. FR/CR while irrelevant against necros were very important pvp resists. DR was even more important since shaman VP was sv dr check and I believe sk spears are PR (altho they called dr for some reason) so the theoretical "person with only MR but no other resists" model while nice to "pretend" didn't realisticaly exist, at least not on RZ.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Secondly, other casting classes were in exactly same shoes in regards to resists as you describe, make it are STILL in same shoes as you describe, why you might not feel its fair to all caster classes, that is state of pvp balance that allowed more or less even pvp field.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Thirdly and most importantly you are actually misleading in your argument and thus hurting your own case. You are trying to pretend that ONLY lifetaps got upgraded in patch and are ONLY reliable mean of damage. That is simply untrue. Since patch your dots land at reliable rate. So you (unlike other casters) have viable and reliable way of dealing damage (dots) and still have means of getting hps back (tapping eye), what you WONT have is ability to tank melees while getting hps back without any danger of dying and best pvp nuke at same time. You may call it nerf, I call it balance. &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
