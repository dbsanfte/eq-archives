</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>Thanks for your opinion that adds nothing to the conversation...&nbsp; Quite obviously it isn't a bug, but I will take every opportunity to voice my complaint to the Dev team as one of the few subscribers playing a Drakkin main.&nbsp; You don't have to get involved if it bothers you, however I will keep talking about it until they correct the problem.&nbsp; I paid for the ****ing feature several expansions ago and I'll be damned if a Dev who wasn't even around when it happened will tell me that I can't use it when every other race can.

Kinda a run on sentence, sorry.. heh.<br><br>The range attack ability has pretty much worked the same way for 7 years.. as far as the autoface / centering on a target upon clicking the hotkey go's. I believe this bug has somthing to do with the changes made to the "bolt spells, and arrow spells" in the 12/05/06 patch, in the patch before the upcoming patch..<br><br>I understand that alot of bugs arose when they changed a few things in that patch.. I just would like to know if there going to fix this bug with range attack, or was there intent to change this?<br><br>This has nothing to do with the command "/autofire" btw, im talking about the old fashion Range Attack single shot / throw button.<br><br>An ahead thanks.. <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-very-happy.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0><br><div></div><p>Message Edited by -Sendars-Saryrn- on <span class=date_text>12-12-2006</span> <span class=time_text>05:02 AM</span>

<P>Then shut up and go home, you win don't dye any of your armor.&nbsp; As that issue has NO bearing on you, let the people who are concerned with it deal with it.&nbsp; No one is making you go out and dye your drakkin's ugly armor.</P>
<P>And Dharkj they are already considering it so you may as well drop the whole it will never happen line.&nbsp; Generally when the dev's do or try and do something innanely stupid, that wasn't asked for, and was in no way needed, they reverse it.&nbsp; The best example is when the fools went and made Mistmoore into a 60+ zone when it was used a lot by people in it's previous incarnation.&nbsp; <BR></P>

<P>This thread has de-evolved way off topic and has become pretty nasty.&nbsp; I am closing the thread.</P>
<P>As a side note, Drakkin being unable to dye armor is not a bug, but a design that Developers chose to have in the game.&nbsp; They are considering giving Drakkin the ability to dye temporarily as they intend to revamp the entire dye system.&nbsp; However no decisions have been made as to whether or not to let Drakkin dye armor or not, nor when it might be implemented.</P>
