				<div></div>We've known for quite a while, through anecdotal evidence, that there was some sort of cap on the Omens augs.&nbsp; At the last Fan Faire, Maddoc confirmed that the success caps (or minimum fail rates, as the devs refer to them) apply to all the GM armors and the Omens augs, and nothing else at that time.&nbsp; However, this is the first time we've gotten a hard figure for the augments.&nbsp; (Based on collated player success/fail results, we've got reasonable estimates for the GM armor caps, but to my knowledge, no one has made an estimate at Omens success cap rates.)<br><div></div><p>Message Edited by Kyroskrane on <span class=date_text>06-06-2006</span> <span class=time_text>05:58 PM</span>

<P>I think there's one more test left to do here.</P>
<P>At 300 Skill, with a brand new 12% trophy (6/7) do 1000 combines and see what that success rate is.&nbsp; </P>
<P>It would also be beneficial to plot the success rate for each set of 100 combines to see if they improve over time.</P>
<P>I believe that is what people really have questions about.... That while doing the trophy learning curve from 12% to 15% if there is something else going on that is impacting the initial success rate 9when starting out at 12%).&nbsp;&nbsp;From what people have written, it might be acting somewhat like learning the conversions for GoD TS items which improves over time based on the number of combines done.<BR><BR>It could be that at 12% something is not working quite right until the trophy hits 13% or some other percentage of the progression towards 15% (I don't know if the trophy actually increase from 12 through 13, 14, to 15% or just jumps to it at the end)...</P>

<P><BR>Nothing personal but when you run the same test with the idea you're going to improve your results and you don't get improved results, I think that is a problem. YOu are supposed to be luckier with the modifier not without it. Even though you want to argue statistics the fact is you got worse results with the torphies then without it all together.

<P>The high modifier skill level should automatically give you a better chance of success. I wonder if the fixed failure cap is actually messing with the statistical succes rate.</P>

				I can't say all that much about the specifics of Tradeskills, but I can speak a bit to the statistics.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Kaspin is correct that all this technically speaks to is that assured
failures % is working properly, given the current information.&nbsp;
But more can be said with a little bit of additional information from
Ngreth.<br>
<br>
At what skill level does the combine reach the 95% success rate?&nbsp;
That's the one piece of information that's missing.&nbsp; If it is like
5 skill points below the test skills, then this is all but
conclusionary evidence that the 15% modifier trophy is not adversely
effecting combine rates of recipes above the natural skill level.<br>
<br>
That's all it would say (though it would disprove the "it lowers the
skill" theory), and nothing really more.&nbsp; You could generalize it
out to the other modifiers, but technically nothing else would be
"proved", without testing the others thoroughly.&nbsp; But, truth is
that's an insane amount of work.&nbsp; The last time I did 1k combines
in something close to "one sitting", my wrist was sore for 3
days.&nbsp; Oh, and thanks Ngreth for making the Rock Salt to Fine Salt
combine doable in multiples.&nbsp; My wrist appreciates it.<br>
<br>
Also, people need to remember, what I call, "The **SMURF** Rule of Statistics (EQ version)". <br>
<br>
"Expected % only happens as X (# of combines) approaches
infinity."&nbsp; So you can only expect to make 95% of your combines
after an infinite amount of combines.&nbsp; 1,000,000,000,000,000,000
isn't at infinity, and in fact, the success amount at that point could
easily be a bit off from the Expected %, due to variance.&nbsp; Stats
aren't a nice thing to deal with at times.&nbsp; <span><img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-sad.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0></span><br>
<br>
Still, there could be issues with one of one of the lower modifiers not
actually having an effect.&nbsp; This test in no way addresses that
issue, though you're free to make the generalization.<br>

				<DIV>This was not to show improved results.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>This was in response to people saying "when I got my trophy, I started failing more often" and this shows that within a reasonable range this is not true.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>there will be some variance since we are dealing with random numbers.&nbsp; And there is no <STRONG>good</STRONG> way to test this with enough tests and large enough numbers to smooth out the variance that randomness gives.&nbsp; If we make a bot to do it, people will say the bot itself skewed the numbers, and we just do not have the resources to dedicate a person to doing enough tests with large enough numbers to smooth out the variance that the randomness will give.</DIV>
