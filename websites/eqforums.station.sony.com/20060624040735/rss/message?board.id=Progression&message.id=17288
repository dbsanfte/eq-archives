      <title>Remember... Progression, not classic: A Few Suggestions (long)</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Progression&amp;message.id=17195#M17195</link>
      <description>This is my post with ideas on how to make this server the best it can possibly be and hopefully the devs read it and maybe take some of my suggestions seriously.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To start, I quit EQ about 2 years ago after playing since Kunark and I really like the idea of this server. It will give everyone a chance to see how EQ was then, and how it differs to EQ, now. Unfortunately, Everquest has gone through years of changes and updates and a real "classic" server is not possible. This is why I am going to suggest a few ideas that will possibly help make the gameplay better and fresher. (More fresh since the MAJORITY of players will be previous EQ players.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First, the spell changes for pre 50 will have a big impact on gameplay, so I think some minor bosses should be added to newbie zones. This may seem like a laughable idea and "not classic", but I think it will add a certain degree of freshness to the server. For example, I remember when I first played EQ on my human mage.. a giant train came up from the depths of Blackburrow; the train had a white gnoll in it with a whip.. a gnoll with the likiness I have never seen before (because it was white, never been to paw)... this was amazing to me and I thought about when I could finally fight that unique gnoll and see what kind of loot he might have to offer. This incredible feeling made me want to play EQ even more and gave a feeling of imagined-development.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, to get to the point of these "newbie-bosses". With the spell enhancements as I stated before, these newbie bosses could drop melee weapons (and caster items too) that would balance out the spell upgrades. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, it wouldn't take a lot of work and if need-be, it could be added worldwide because it really doesn't even impact the game at all.Also, the bosses would have certain names to make them unique and memorable. It would have what I like to call the "Fippy Darkpaw effect" and make people nostalgic once again after passing these areas. A good way to do this would be to make the named bosses random spawns for each class that is in the game. For example, a warrior monster named Warlord Djerr Darkpaw could spawn, and then right there you would know it is going to drop an item meant for a tank class, and even before the monster is dead the tank classes of the group would already be excited because they know that some loot is coming their way. Of course, there will be caster monsters with different names such as High Priest Whatever and Arch Mage Soandso... this makes for memories and excitement, and most of all freshness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bosses could be added in:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Blackburrow: &lt;br&gt;Example: Rare spawn named gnolls that drop decent low level weapons up to par with new spells. The named gnolls would spawn in different rooms and spawn every few HOURS. These weapons would also be WORTH camping for, and people would want to GROUP for these items building a COMMUNITY that made the original EQ what it is. Because without a community... this server is as good as dead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Qeynos Hills:&lt;br&gt;Example: Pyzjn and Hadden are great examples of what made EQ nostalgic. My suggestion is to add more monsters like this to Qeynos Hills and zones like it (Karanas/Commons). For example, there could be a named rabid grizzly that drops nice claws, or an invisible bandit that wanders around and can only be seen with see invis. (The monsters obviously drop some sort of unique item that is beneficial to have.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Butcherblock, Misty Thicket, Nektulos, Lavastorm, East Commons, West Commons, Kithicor, Highpass Hold, Highkeep, SolA, Najena, Runny Eye, Dagnor's Cauldron, Estate of Unrest, and other various "newbie/lowbie" areas would also have new named monsters that are on an hourly basis... that spawn monsters appropriate to the local menace near and around group exp areas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As stated, the point of these various newbie bosses would be to promote grouping and community, balance out melees and casters due to patches, and to of course bring back the feeling of camping/discovering.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, a lot of you might agree with me and some may disagree. To the people that disagree and say it isn't "classic", I say it is quite necessary for both freshness and balance. When wizards are nuking for 600 at level 26, melee players will be doing 1/4  of their damage. This boss solution gives a fix to years of patching and even adds some new content to an old game. I see it as a necessary evil to a game that can't be made truly classic due to years of patching.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now that I have suggested a fix to the caster/melee/freshness issue, I move on to part 2.&lt;br&gt;-------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Part 2: Raiding with new items and spells&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With new items from newbie-bosses and and the updating of classic items to a new power to compete with new spells from the recent patches, it seems that the old world boss monsters would be in for a rude awakening. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think that a solution is viable, and now I am going to suggest it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Simply, their hitpoints need to be increased and tested to ensure that they are formidable. While damage has been upgraded due to patches and items, the resists and hit points of players have not been, so it will most likely be easy to just raise the hit points of certain monsters and that should definitely provide an easy fix to compensate for new player damage.&lt;br&gt;--------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Part 3: Progression and time frame required to move forward&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is what is going to make or break the server... progression - and how long it takes - and how it is done.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Right now, I don't know if there is a serious guild that is going to actually log on to the server and speed level to 50 on a 6 year old game.. for some reason I don't see 30 organized people doing that... most speed levelers will probably be seperated in different guilds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway, this is my idea on how progression should be done. (By the way, I am only going to give Kunark as an example since it is the first one.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What I feel needs to be done to make the server good is to really try to make the new EQ feel more like the old EQ. Knowing that a real "classic" server is 100% impossible due to years of changes, I think it is definitely possible to mix the new EQ with the old EQ to make it feel more like the old EQ than the new EQ.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, to Kunark we go.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On World of Warcraft they had what was a "War Effort" to gain access to the new content AQ. It relied on a serverwide effort to get items to different NPCs and when the NPCs eventually had all the items necessary, the gates to the new content were open. In my opinion, EQ needs a war effort to gain access to Kunark.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We all know that the good and evil forces both had to fight to gain territory on the new continent, so why not let the players have a hand in saying when the forces could start going.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The good races could turn in items at the Butcherblock Docks and the Evil races could turn in items in the Desert of Ro (Oasis). Items that could be required could be nostalgic items such as the Minotaur Battle Axe and regular items like rations and bandages. Also, the axes would be different from the actual axe so that it stacks, but you get the point I'm sure. It would just be special items added in to the monsters so that the items are attainable all the way up while leveling (and stackable) so not much farming has to be done after leveling is through. Even Maddroc said that he wants to do a quest, and I think that this would be the best option since it fits into the storyline and can potentially use old school EQ items. I also suggest making this quest long and fun. This server can possibly host a great community if you do the war effort right.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course, during the collections NPCs will be seen around Butcherblock docks and Oasis... to remind us that there is a war being fought on Kunark (and to show that the city of Fironia Vie wasn't built in a day). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then, once the collection is complete the entire server will gain access to the Ruins of Kunark expansion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course, there will be special items that are needed from named monsters across Norrath. For example, the war effort may need special items from the Froglok King, Nagafen, and Vox to craft a special type of armor or something else... (Just to make the big monsters part of the progression.)&lt;br&gt;---------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Part 4: General Notes and Opinions&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First off, this isn't a classic server and never was, it is a progression server. While the devs are definitely trying to make it as classic as possible the game has just gone through too many changes to make a completely classic server impossible. This doesn't mean that it can't feel like old EQ though. I have a few notes and opinions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;#1: There should be NO instances up until instances were released (LDoN). The reason for this is that instances are a controllable part of the classic feel, so adding them would further detach the game from classic EQ unnecessarily.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;#2: The experience on the server should be 70% of what it is on normal servers if at all possible. The reason for this is to promote community and to avoid lagging behind in the "War Effort" quest that opens Kunark. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If people level too quickly there will be complaining about farming for the war effort, reducing exp solves this problem and builds community. I see this as necessary if possible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;#3: GM Events - There should be GM events throughout this server especially during the unlocking of new content. Not necessary but a nice touch.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;#4: Community - This servers success or failure really depends on if people will create a community. That is why I feel the need for an exp reduction and the war effort. As it looks, there are going to be a lot of people on the server so grouping should be very popular. Trust me, this all comes down to community... seriously, if it doesn't have it, it's done.. plain and simple.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;#5: Tasks - All new quests/tasks added any time (exception of newbie armor quests) should NOT be in the game. If the new tasks are implemented on this server I'm not even going to play it and I just wrote up this huge 2 hour suggestion... this is crucial and does not need to be in the game. The reason I would allow the newbie armor quest is for balance because of the big caster upgrade... other than that, NO TASKS or the server will fail in my opinion. People can put up with some new stuff that uses old items, but the new tasks for exp are just too much, most won't stick around. It should be kept as classic as possible with only necessary changes; tasks aren't necessary.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;#6: Maps - I know it has already been said that maps are in, but I think they should be out... I thought I'd put this in even though the decision is final, but I think maps should definitely be out. Maps are LoY, this is original (as of now).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;#7: New NPCs/Guards - New NPCs should all be removed from this server and guards should be reverted back to their original forms. Guards as of now are not as they used to be and need to be reverted back to being killable for exp/loot. The new NPCs also have no place in a new Norrath and should be removed until they are ready to be there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;#8: Last Words - Please keep in mind most of my suggestions that involve new item creation and monster hit point increase only apply to the first expansion. The problem with spells is solved after Kunark is released so the game can just go back to its original state after that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finally, I wrote this up and it is unedited, it isn't even proof read so... it may have some mistakes. These are just off the top of my head ideas that I think could help the server. If you made it this far through the post, congradulations. Hopefully people read it, especially the developers.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;Unfortunately I don't see a lot of that happening, but I certainly see where you're coming from in those areas.&amp;nbsp; Not bad suggestions I don't think.&amp;nbsp; I don't necessarily agree with all of them are want all of them, but they would be viable options for a few problems I've been concerned with as well.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Classic OR Progression: building NEW never-before-seen content is not part of what The Combine is about.&amp;nbsp; If I wanted that, I'd buy this next expansion they're planning, instead.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

The fact is, the spells can't be changed back to classic... it would require a change on every server (which is retarded), so I figure add some new weapons pre-Kunark. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course, they can't have any special graphics, they will just be regular looking short sword type weapons with better stats. Weapons like Langseax and SSoY will still be the best (when upgraded), but I think this is necessary to help even out the melee/caster dps... when a wizard does 3x the damage as a rogue/monk... no groups are going to want those melee dps classes. It is a necessary evil....</description>
