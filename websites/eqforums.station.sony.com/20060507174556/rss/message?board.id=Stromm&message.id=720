    <title>Day time player</title>
    <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Stromm&amp;message.id=720</link>
    <description>&lt;div&gt;Are there any guilds on Stromm that do a lot of day time (EST) grouping and/or raiding? I generally can play from about 9 or 10 AM EST until 4PM EST. My main is a level 68 Nec with about 200 aa's. I am looking for a guild where i can grow the toon, greatly improve his gear, and start doing DoDH spell missions, MPG trials etc. I have been playing for less than a year so it has taken me some time to elarn my class well, but I am ready and willing to learn the high end now if anyone can steer me somewhere that I can have the chance to do it.&lt;/div&gt;</description>
