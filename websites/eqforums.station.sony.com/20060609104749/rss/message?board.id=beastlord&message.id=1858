      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I made it to 65 ya me got a few AA's. For a long time, my warder was able to tank, dish out damage better than me. I always assumed this would be the case. Now as Ive gotten more AAs and defensive abilitys my warder has become just some DOT that follows me. I guess this isnt so much of a complaint but more of a realization that well the game changes for beasts as you get up there. I always figured our pets would be able to out tank us and dps. Still I love the beast class cant wait to see whats in store for it. &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Can someone tell me about (or where to find) info on pet focuses?&amp;nbsp; Sounds like they are very useful, and I have no idea where to get them etc.&amp;nbsp; Sorry if this has been addressed.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>With the right AAs and the Pet Focus items, your pet can still handle some heavy damage. Mine can take for me in a pinch still at 65, and he regens like some kind of Fungi Monster. 6-7% a /tick/. As soon as I get Pet Discipline, he'll be able to tank most exp mobs indefinately. For those unfamiliar with the trick... You set your pet on a mob, and let him hit it and hopefully taunt and proc a time or two. Then you use '/pet hold'. If he's a focussed pet, he's now regenning faster than most exp mobs can damage him, so he can just sit there and keep the mob's attention until you're ready to kill it.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;In&amp;nbsp;GoD our pets are tiny, insignificant speed bumps. D:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I blow away my pet's dps and did so before I entered the Elemental Planes and Time.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So it depends on the level of play you are at. In Normal LDON&amp;nbsp;our pets can easily off tank. In Hard LDON they're not very good.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;We get no AA's or Foci that help our pet's defensive abilities. The DPOC focus from LDON merchants provides an awesome regen effect to our pet when they are not in combat.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I can't imagine using Rorith's tactics, that certainly isn't the most efficient way to solo, which is the only time you'd use it. Certainly not in off-tank situations where you need your pet to get and maintain agro.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Not sure if people understand. The regen the pet gets from the focus only kicks in if the pet is &lt;EM&gt;not &lt;/EM&gt;attacking. I duo with my wife all the time, a mage. Don't know where you got the idea I was talking about soloing. I hate soloing.&amp;nbsp;What I was saying was that&amp;nbsp;the only time you would want to take advantage of sitting the pet down during the fight to have it regen&amp;nbsp;is when you are doing mobs you can solo, otherwise the pet's regen will not keep up with any mob beating on it. If you think sitting a&amp;nbsp;pet down while its getting beat by a mob in Kod'Taz will save it you are mistaken about how good the regen is. Now if you have the pet focus from Time or GoD and the Pet Affinity AA the pet may be able to off tank in Kod'Taz. I know for a fact Mage pets with Pet Affinity, Time Focus and pet defensive AA's can tank in Kod'Taz. However, we don't get the pet defensive AA's Mages do.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I could&amp;nbsp;see this tactic being more useful for folks whose pet is actually the better tank. I surpassed my pet's ability to tank a long time ago and the groups I play with can earn 3 AA's an hour these days. Again, its about efficiency of the tactic. If you are using the tactic of sitting your pet down so it can regen while its being beat senseless I guarantee you are not earning xp very efficiently or effectively. Group's and duo's are the best way to get xp and imo have fun. Mages are a super partner, their abilities complement ours extremely well.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

With a couple HP buffs, or some extra spell regen, this can be more than enough to hold up under a lot of attacks. (Admittedly, it probably couldn't handle 900+ hits or anything insane like that, but if you need to park some trash mob out of the way for a while, this is a great trick.)</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Im 65th with decent gear and about 110AAs atm.. I tank a ton better than my pet, I also outdamage her by quite a bit..&amp;nbsp; but in a pinch I can back off and she can handle the fight while I heal myself.&amp;nbsp; I do not have the pet augment yet, but I plan to get that as it definitely helps my Necro friends pets.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Ya once you hit 65. Start doing a few harder things the pet upgrades just dont keep comming. I have the Aug from TAK working on the pet AAs eventually. They just seem to lose alot of their toughness.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
