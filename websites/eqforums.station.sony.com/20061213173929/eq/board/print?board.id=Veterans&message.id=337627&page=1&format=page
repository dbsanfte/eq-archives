<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Can I be very honest and say the bolded portion of that statement scares me? I can surely appreciate the intent behind it and hope that it can/does/will happen. The problem is the gear gap between raiders (in full raid gear) and non raiders (in full non raid gear) is so large at this point that it can only be measured in terms of levels over the current cap. I say that based on my guild group's attempt to take down the 68.3 boss at 70 (100% failure) and doing it again last week with 2x 75/74/72. Night and day in a way that can only be captured by reading full raid gear accounts of how easy the DoD arcs are from well over a year ago. If an upgrade to the charm is implemented in a way such as those arcs there will be a wave of melded demographics but once it has crested and moved on there will be significant numbers of people who wont be able to get it until the next level bump; is my fear anyway.</P>
<P>I do not overly envy the dev's jobs. The problem with content is, at this&nbsp;point, you almost have to tweak it&nbsp;not by what level the intended targets are but what they will likely be wearing. The up and down shifts in the TSS endzones are an evidence of this I believe.<BR></P>

				An idea zajeer may like -- Give the follow two options for raid level charm augs:<br><br>1) Have charm flags added to normal raid level augs.<br><br>2) Create a quest similar to BiC to make the best charm aug.&nbsp; Have it be considerably powerful after the last groupable/mini raid stage, but require parts from high end raids to take it to the point where it's better than the augs you normally get from raids. <br><br>Example:<br>
Quested up to mini raid level (comparable step 10 bic) - 125 hp mana&nbsp; 2% spell&nbsp; shield / dot shield<br>
Raid aug (non-quest) -&nbsp; 175 hp mana 3% spell shield / dot shield<br>
Fully powered quested aug (multiple items from high end raids needed) - 225 hp mana 4% spell shield / dot shield<br><br>This way any raider, regardless of out-of-raid playtime, can have access to raid level charm augs.&nbsp; But raiders who are willing to put in effort outside of raids can get something that's a step above.&nbsp; This also gives non-high end raiders a shot at a considerable upgrade, if they're willing to put the effort into it.<div></div><br><br>

<P>Simply to give raiders the option of purchasing the items. Every single item in EQ has raid equivalent items that are superior to single group, solo items. Personally I see no reason to drift from this trend especially since there are items presently in the game for charm slots from raid encounters.&nbsp; Subsequently flagging additional charms would not be overpowering. In reality this would help players plan their gear a lot more effectively as well as potentially ease some of the headaches for those responsible for itemization. I know I would appreciate less frustration as a player and assuredly would feel likewise if&nbsp;I were responsible for itemization.&nbsp;<BR></P></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>To reply to the second quote; In order to even raid the end zones of TSS requires TONS of grouping and solo tasks. This is yet another valid point to introduce raid level charm augs. Especially since the best charm aug to date, minus the Queen Sendaii and Emperor Draygun augs,&nbsp; was from LDoN which is how many expansions ago? <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-tongue.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0></DIV><p>Message Edited by MythSR on <span class=date_text>12-12-2006</span> <span class=time_text>09:36 PM</span>

<P>How many of you people complaining have a maxed LDoN Charm aug? I was the first person on my server to finish the Wayfarers charm - and I did it in a mix of guild groups and pick up groups. I have no problem with having a new charm aug that is attainable to everyone, regardless of tier.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I was the top Ranger in the top guild on my server when I did the LDoN aug - and my closest competition was from non-raiders. We might need to redefine "Casual and Raider" into "Hardcore and non-Hardcore" players. I know tons of hardcore players who never raid. I know even more raiders that play extremely casually. </P>
<P>EQ is a social game. Devs and content designers want to see players interact with each other. That is why this game was created, and still exists. Meet people, work together for a common goal, and gain the rewards of that teamwork. Don't be offended if an aug is added that is doable by non-raiders as well as raiders. One aug isn't going to suddenly close the gap in risk vs reward for your overall gear profiles.</P>
<P>You can still use guild-only groups to achieve the reward - you don't have to socialize with new folks if you don't want to. But having the option to do so is nice, and that option is&nbsp;the foundation upon which this great game was built. </P>

				I tend to agree that charm augs should come from non-raid content.<br>
<br>
Unfortunatly, the raiders doing non-raider comment you made - I'm not
challenged in any way by non-raid content.&nbsp; It's not really fun
for me to do it, other than if required to get a reward.<br>
<br>
The best part of EQ grouping for raiders shouldn't be a carrot - it
should also include fun, challenge, excitement, risk, etc.&nbsp; I
played on progression for quite awhile with friends.&nbsp; We had hella
fun times levels 15-55 taking on hard content where death was a very
large risk.&nbsp; Where we were constantly challenged.&nbsp; Despite
the fact that I did that content 7+ years ago, and I was on low
level/new/gimp toons - it was still fun just to be challenged.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
That simply does not exist in today's group game for us as raiders, and
I shouldn't have to switch to some character besides my main to
experience it in a groups etting.<br>
<br>
Theres a reason 90% of my guild logs on only for raids.&nbsp; The other
10% - its pretty much powersources only atm.&nbsp; It's sort of sad -
because we've all had tons of fun at one point being challenged in the
group game - but not anytime recently really.<br>
<br>
So what am I trying to say in regards to your comment?&nbsp; Just that
I'm refuting your comment about raiders not being in enough group
content.&nbsp; It's entirely true, but your reasoning for it is that
there isn't rewards for it (partially true).&nbsp; Instead, its more of
- theres no fun/challenge in it, in addition to being no reward.<br>

<P>VP key quest sucked. Was far worse than TSS.</P>
<P>Velious faction sucked, as did keying for ST. Not every guild/player could get that huge faction hit by killing the zone boss - and ST keys were not as common as they are today. Huge time sink. Huge. You actually need a new definition of huge to understand just how bad it was.</P>
<P>Luclin Emp key, Emp weapon and then VT shard camps. Holy wow, I am almost insulted folks are complaining about TSS when I go back over these horrible time sinks.</P>
<P>PoP had raid&nbsp;flags. Every zone past PoJ. Nothing else needs to be said.</P>
<P>GoD was just a horrible horrible content mistune.</P>
<P>OOW you not only had to camp the sigs, but do the MPG raid trials. Something today's players do not have to do - just sigs.</P>
<P>DoDH and PoR? I retired just before DoDH launch.&nbsp; After returning getting DS/DP keyed took me <STRONG><EM>months. </EM></STRONG>PoR isn't going so hot, either. Getting folks to do the same old instances juust doesn't seem to hold the same replay value. Instanced progression usually caters to certain class/group designs. Not much room for flexibility there.</P>
<P>TSS progression is just Exp grinding in open zones. No instances, not everyone needs to have the task - different folks can get different tasks completed in the same group or solo. It put the Quest back into <EM>Ever<STRONG>Quest</STRONG></EM>. It is actually horribly easy to do. Drops are common, repops are fast (not 12 hours +/- or 3 days etc).</P>
<P>EverQuest used to be hard. Instancing brought a little too much convenience to the playerbase. Some people will always prefer it. Some will always prefer open zones. It is important to balance those wants and needs of the plaer base. So far, TSS has offered very little in the way of progression blocks or bottlenecks. It is all up to the initiative of the playerbase. Anyone can get raid flagged.</P>
<P>Just have to go after it with determination and flexibility.</P>

<P>If the raid encounters in TSS gave faction hits (Stitch giving Infiltraitor, Sothgar giving Scholars), I'd like the system Much more.&nbsp; I'm dreading 2 months from now when 99% of the guild is done and apps are trying to get groups to go do eggtenders or arbitor and you trying to juggle who gets raided in.&nbsp; If instead each raid win gave faction, even half of a single tasks worth, it would make it so those that put forth the raid effort eventually get 'flagged'.&nbsp; </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Honestly, why would Jenray give faction for bagging 4 drakes from eggs, but not really care that you stopped Sothgar lashing out?</P>
