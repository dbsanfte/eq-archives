      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Rogue flat out blows away mages when it comes to raids on DPS at the endgame.&amp;nbsp; During the original era mage is better due to the lack of gear, but thats only going to last a couple months.&amp;nbsp; Once rogues get the ragebringer, which is about 1/10 the difficulty of the mage epic, they become king dps.&amp;nbsp; With further expansions and better weapons, the gap between mage and rogue dps widens even further.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Also you have to add in the fact that most end game guilds wont allow the mage to use a pet on certain raids when there are AEs and what not.&amp;nbsp; A ninja afk or a few seconds of not paying attention can mean the raid wiping.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I think when you decide what class you want to play (in your case between mage and rogue) you need to look at whats funnest for you, not whats going to be most useful to other people.&amp;nbsp; Think of yourself: do you enjoy playing a caster or a melee?&amp;nbsp; Do you really want a pet?&amp;nbsp; Do you want to be able to see the most increases from getting that new weapon?&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;A lot of raid leaders will ask you to not summon your pet until you can get the Pet Dsic AA basically making you a crappy wizard for most raids until Luclin</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Well, last I checked a wizard wasn't a magician. But anways, magicians have tons of problems in raids and aren't allowed to keep their pets up. Pre xxx expansion they couldn't keep&amp;nbsp; control of their pets. /pet hold is a recent development, although it is several years old. Ya, that makes sense, really. So pet classes will be kinda unwanted for raids in the classic EQ. Even necromancers were't much wanted. Their big spells are all over level 50. Ya, they will be wanted for summon corpse, though. Magicians might be wanted for summoning armor to re-equip a raid for corpse recovery.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Remember, corpse recovery will be a much bigger issue now than it is now... get it?&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Mages will defintely be in demand for summoning again.&amp;nbsp;I find that refreshing. That aspect of the mage was pretty much rendered obsolete by bazaar and the flood of cheap stat gear that became available shortly after.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Pets have always had pathing issues. Some zones were especially bad. Try summoning a pet by the newbie lift in Gfay sometime then running in a straight line to Crushbone. You will lose your pet somewhere around the orc lift because it will go wandering off on it's own someplace. Inside Crushbone is even worse, because pet will sometimes pick up a legionnaire or three as it wanders around even though pets aren't supposed to be substantial source of aggro anymore. I guess some mobs will still go for a pet if the difference in levels is great enough. I was stupid enough once as a shadowknight to summon a pet inside The Warrens. The room I was in was completely green to me, and nothing was attacking but once pet appeared, the whole room aggroed and I had to get the heck out of there. I bug reported it because I knew pet aggro was supposed to have been eliminated, but I never heard anything back or saw any mention of it in any patch message thta followed. I would imagine you could still summon sk pet inside a room of greens with the same result. :smileysad:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Vegeta-X on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;06-11-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;07:28 PM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

      <description>A mage rocks a rogue during classic.&amp;nbsp; After that I'd say they are about&#xD;
equal in a group the rest of the way.&amp;nbsp; A rogue with good gear may do&#xD;
more pure DPS than a mage, but a mage also brings things like stuns&#xD;
from their pet, damage shields, mod rods, and the ability to do spike&#xD;
DPS when needed.&amp;nbsp; Keep in mind, epics are very important items for both&#xD;
the rogue and mage to be very effective, and the rogue epic is MUCH&#xD;
easier, but once a mage gets their epic they dominate against Kunark /&#xD;
Velious era XP mobs (the pet can off tank as well as a warrior, and it&#xD;
also out aggros pretty much everything (due to its DD proc that procs&#xD;
at an insane rate, and its stun), so it can be used to get mobs off&#xD;
clerics and enchanters who over aggro; before pets were changed to not&#xD;
hold aggro if any PC was also in melee range (thanks Legacy of Steel&#xD;
;D), the epic would often pull aggro from a warrior, and could be used&#xD;
as the groups MT in some situations).&amp;nbsp; Once a rogue gets Primal things&#xD;
even out again.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Rogues are much more equipment dependent than mages, so if you aren't&#xD;
going to play enough to be in a high end raiding guild, you may feel&#xD;
mre powerful as a mage.&amp;nbsp; On the other hand, a rogue decked out in the&#xD;
latest raiding gear will always be a monster damage dealing machine.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
Also, pets lose more effectiveness against higher level NPCs than PCs&#xD;
do (due to the level gap between pets and the mobs), so when crawling&#xD;
through a tough single group dungeon, such as SG or Velketor's castle,&#xD;
a mages DPS will drop more in relation to the rogues.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
On raids, rogues are generally in higher demand than mages.&amp;nbsp; Having one&#xD;
or two mages is more important than having a rogue in most cases (until&#xD;
traps in luclin), due to CoH, damage sheilds, malosini (its a lot nicer&#xD;
to have mages for malosini, so Shamams can go straight to attempting&#xD;
slow after Malo/Tash is on), and mod rods (not too important until&#xD;
Luclin introduces Mod Rod 2s), but after the necessities are taken care&#xD;
of, adding rogues is much better than adding more mages.&amp;nbsp; Pet damage is&#xD;
crippled against raid mobs, and in many cases are raped by AEs, or&#xD;
simply can't be used.&amp;nbsp; On top of that, mage nukes are often resisted or&#xD;
partially resisted against boss mobs, and require melee range in order&#xD;
to have a chance of doing damage.&amp;nbsp; This is only true until Luclin&#xD;
though.&amp;nbsp; Bolt spells are also nearly impossible to hit a mob with on a&#xD;
raid unless you levitate.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Raiding as a mage is frustrating until Luclin, but honestly, playing a&#xD;
more useful raiding class doesn't make the raids that much better.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
Raiding satisfaction comes from the performance of the guild as a&#xD;
whole, rather than knowing you did more damage than guildmate Y.&amp;nbsp; I&#xD;
should add that you may find raiding as a mage less repetitive and/or&#xD;
boring.&amp;nbsp; As a rogue your entire raiding career will be /assist, auto&#xD;
attack, BS, BS, evade, etc., with the occasional scouting request, up&#xD;
until Luclin when you are needed to disarm traps.&amp;nbsp; As a mage, in&#xD;
addition to sending your pet in and casting nukes, you will also be&#xD;
apart of the debuff/slow team, have to make sure the tanks always have&#xD;
a DS on, setup CoH for latecomers, and spit out mod rods when needed.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
I'd say it comes down to what style of play you prefer.&amp;nbsp; Would you rather be a caster or a melee?&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
PS: back it the day a lot of people underestimated the usefulness of a&#xD;
mage in an XP group.&amp;nbsp; At one time there were legitimate reasons behind&#xD;
this belief: pets used to be much harder to control, and a lot of mages&#xD;
did not control their pets well.&amp;nbsp; Pets used to be on the same faction&#xD;
as the mage, so poor pathing could get the group trained if the mage&#xD;
wasn't paying attention.&amp;nbsp; Also, until partway through luclin, pets&#xD;
would not refuse to attack mezed mobs and would not automatically stop&#xD;
attacking a mob once it was mezed, so are careless mage was liable to&#xD;
break mezes and get enchanters killed.&amp;nbsp; Pets also used to take a&#xD;
significant amount of XP if they did more than of the NPCs HP in&#xD;
damage.&amp;nbsp; This was only ever an issue in classic, and in Kunark /&#xD;
Velious if the mage had an epic, but a lot of people still just assumed&#xD;
pet = less XP.&amp;nbsp; These are no longer issues today, but some players&#xD;
still may have a bias against mages when choosing people for XP&#xD;
groups.&amp;nbsp; Just a warning.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I'm not trying to dis mages or any other caster class as i love them all, but rogues and other melees have a great deal more to do in a raid or grp than : Attkon, bs/bs/evade/bs.&amp;nbsp; There are a ton of discs and weapon types that require a lot of timing, thought and knowledge of when and how to use.&amp;nbsp; Playing a melee has as much going on as any caster class with the possible exception of bards, mh and ccers.&amp;nbsp; With rogues this is especially true as the goal is to balance the maximum dps while at the same time avoiding agro.&amp;nbsp; It is a lot more involved than just hitting evade each time you see the mobs face and new mobs in new zones require constant repositioning in order to maintain good dps.&amp;nbsp; A rogue at the high end is actually a great deal of work to play properly.</description>

      <description>I didn't mean to say rogues are easy to play on raids, just that they&#xD;
only have one role on raids until Luclin.&amp;nbsp; You can break it into a&#xD;
hundred steps, covering every minute detail, or you can generalize it&#xD;
in a few words.&amp;nbsp; EQ is a very repetitive game.&amp;nbsp; By the time you've&#xD;
leveled a class to 60 and raided a bit all the small things become&#xD;
second nature.&amp;nbsp; You know where you need to be and if you are out of&#xD;
position, you know when its safe to go all out, you know when you need&#xD;
to hold back, you know when to use duelist,&amp;nbsp; and you know when to use&#xD;
counterattack or nimble (etc..).&amp;nbsp; There is still a lot of moving and&#xD;
buttons that need pushing, but there's no longer any critical thinking&#xD;
tied to it.&amp;nbsp; It was a challenge initially, but you've learned how to&#xD;
DPS efficiently, and now its just repetition.&amp;nbsp; You know how to react to&#xD;
any changes, and if a new situation comes up you have the tools to&#xD;
adapt to it.&amp;nbsp; It's the same with mages, it's the same with every&#xD;
class.&amp;nbsp; If asked, you can explain exactly why you took every action,&#xD;
but all that went through your head before you took the action was&#xD;
"____ happened, I need to ____."&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Short term, and before the deadly AoE of PoP, rogues are a fun and versatile class. They provide excellent dps in groups.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If you are looking for the long run mages are always a sweet addition to group (solid dps), to raids (coth) and excellent solo/duo players.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I would play a mage if i had to decide between those two classes.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Rogue all the way, IMO.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Like everything there are tradeoffs......Really depends on waht you want to do.&amp;nbsp; If you want to be pure DPS go rogue.&amp;nbsp; If you want to be able to solo, go mage.&amp;nbsp; If you don't want your dps to be situational, go rogue.&amp;nbsp; If you want to have really nice utility go mage.&amp;nbsp; If you don't want a lot of limitations in certain raid situations, a mage is going to have problems, where a rogue is going to have very very few problems raiding if ever.&amp;nbsp; BTW, I don't know what this guy is talking about with rogues havign problems with AoEs in PoP.....There's AA for that too.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Mages are excellent DPS and have a lot of utility but it's mana based, pet based, and nukes can be resisted.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Until you can get pet AAs you will likely be asked not to summon your pet on a lot of raids.&amp;nbsp; Your ability to do DPS will be based on available mana.&amp;nbsp; You will also need separate buffs for your pet until you get AA for group buffs too.&amp;nbsp; But, your pet is a monster and they get really good later on, so if you like to be able to solo, a Mage might be for you.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Whereas a rogue properly played is total raw dps power that is basicly unlimited.&amp;nbsp; A rogue in crappy gear and minimal AA just slides down the dps scale a bit.....A rogue in great gear with a lot of AA is a total DPS machine.&amp;nbsp; But both are still unlimited raw dps to a group or raid.&amp;nbsp; But you wont be soloing much if at all.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;It's all about tradeoffs and you have to decide what it is you really want to do.&amp;nbsp; Personally, I prefer melees to robed casters, and I particularly don't like playing pet classes myself, so it would be a no brainer for me.&amp;nbsp; Go rogue.&amp;nbsp; You ever meet a rogue who didn't just LOVE it? :)&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Technically, yes, but this doesn't really happen that much.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Because of ripostes and the like, ALL melee dps should&amp;nbsp;be given the back of&amp;nbsp;a mob and that is where they really need to be.&amp;nbsp; If you are consistently not getting the backs of mobs then your tanks aren't doing their jobs very well and this should be addressed by whoever in your guild is leading raids/tanks.&amp;nbsp; Not that there aren't exceptions but for the most part, tanks need to be firmly positioning mobs so that the back is accessable for reasons beyond just giving rogues a target.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Also, there are AAs that overcome this as well for rogues....Chaotic stab and its upgrades lessen the directional loss in DPS for rogues a great deal.&amp;nbsp; With the right AAs a rogue can even assassinate from the front.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;In addition, even without backstabbing, rogues are on the highest melee damage tables available for normal melee hits, so even without access to a mobs back, they will still be doing as much dps as any other melee class minus special attacks.&amp;nbsp; Again this is even less of a factor when a rogue has the chaotic stab AAs.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;For sustained unconditional DPS, Rogues really do rule.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Massimo_Bertoxx on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;06-12-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;11:22 AM&lt;/span&gt;</description>
