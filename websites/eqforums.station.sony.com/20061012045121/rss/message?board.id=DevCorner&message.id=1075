    <description>&lt;DIV&gt;So you are chain pulling for your group.&amp;nbsp; The current mob is getting low on health, so you run off to pull another mob.&amp;nbsp; While you are off getting the mob, the rest of the group finishes off the previous mob...and no one gets xp because you are too far from the group.&amp;nbsp; This is incredibly frustrating.&amp;nbsp; The group is then pissed at you, because they got no xp.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;This has always been an incredible frustration to me.&amp;nbsp; I took a break from EQ for a few months, and I come back, and it seems the range has been reduced even more.&amp;nbsp; I thought this was my imagination, until it was confirmed that the range was decreased.&amp;nbsp; I just cannot understand this.&amp;nbsp; To me, this is THE most frustrating thing about EQ.&amp;nbsp; Is the purpose to prevent chain pulling for some strange reason?&amp;nbsp; I'm thinking it has something to do with trying to prevent people from grouping up with other soloers so they can solo and still get the group bonus.&amp;nbsp; If so, there HAS to be a better way to prevent that.&amp;nbsp; Maybe if the person is OOR and they didn't do any damage to the mob then no one gets xp.&amp;nbsp; As it is, its main function is to prevent people from chain pulling.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>i find that as a ranger in WOS, if i can shoot the mob I'm pretty safe to get XP. At 10% mob life i run out into the middle of the field of Bazus, Chimeras, and Shadowhunters... oh wait just one shadowhuter.... Turn around, shoot the mob in camp while simultaneously viewing the field in 3rd person perspective.... I get Xp, the grp gets XP, no one gets mad and the next mob is a turn and a /range attack away. Little quirks like the no xp for grp puller OOR thing make the game more challenging. Instead of complaining about something ingame, find a way around it. Necessity is the mother of all invention.... By the way, i learned to compensate for OOR issues in Overthere on the Skyfire ramp back when i was lvl 30-40.... For those of you who spent those levels doing MONSTER MISSIONS, you have deprived yourself of valuable lessons in EQ. Short-cuts are for players who left eq but who've done it the hard way and know what the heck they're doing but dont want to spend 3 years getting back to where they were. NOT for the new Ebay'd Cleric who still uses Mark of Kinfs and CH at lvl 70 on trash mobs durring COA raids. LEARN SOME SKILLS by doing crap the hard way. If EQ had a button that gave you all the best gear and maxxed your level and AAs, then it wouldnt be worth my or your time. Challenges are fun to take on and overcome. Take this pulling challenge as an opportunity to prove that you can overcome small things and prevail, making yourself a better player and more respected among your in-game peers. Don't whine until Staples gives you an easy button.... Anyway, good luck all in the new TSS expansion. Cya in game soon!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;~Fred, 70.99 ranger of Tunare.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;I find your post insulting.&amp;nbsp; The fact that we want a bug fixed means we don't like challenges?&amp;nbsp; For one thing, I have done less then a dozen monster missions.&amp;nbsp; I like playing a ranger, not some random class.&amp;nbsp; I'm not looking for any short cuts.&amp;nbsp; How does having a bug where your group loses xp make the game more fun or challenging?&amp;nbsp; What in the heck does wanting this bug fixed have to do with someone asking for an easy button.&amp;nbsp; It is freaking easy to sit there and wait for the mob to die before pulling the next...that seems to be your solution.&amp;nbsp; That is the only workaround for this bug.&amp;nbsp; That seems to be your solution.&amp;nbsp; I'd prefer to be able to chain pull.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I am respected by my in-game peers and know how to play my class very well.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The fact that I want this bug fixed does not change that a wit, and it is just plain stupidity to suggest that it does.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Yeah, that has been brought up in this thread before.&amp;nbsp; Doesn't really address it though.&amp;nbsp; After first is dead, you go to get another mob, 2nd mob dies, group gets no xp.&amp;nbsp; You can bring mob and immediately run to get next when tank tags mob, but even that isn't always enough on longer pulls.&amp;nbsp; The only sure way to avoid this problem, is to not chain pull.</description>

      <description>No, No, No, and No.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Speaking as someone who was invovled in the reason this code was&#xD;
implemented, and someone who did the quad kiting group bonus trick, and&#xD;
as someone who pulls for groups legit and experiences this bug, I will&#xD;
summarize this in its correct form.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
This thread has a lot of useful information and a lot of irrelevant&#xD;
information and the problem is people continue to merge and then&#xD;
attempt to break them apart to the point that someone who doesn't&#xD;
understand this issue is not going to be any closer to grasping it by&#xD;
the time they work through the pages of the thread. I'm sure that is&#xD;
part of the reason a year has passed with this thread, let alone 6&#xD;
years of the bug, without any resolution.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
A poster above wrote somewhat unintelligibly, but they nailed it on the&#xD;
head. The problem with this code was introduced to prevent mages,&#xD;
necros, and shamans from AFKing with their pets holding a camp, sitting&#xD;
somewhere far out of range and getting free exp all night. If the pet&#xD;
could clear the camp over and over and not die, you could return when&#xD;
you pleased with levels upon levels of free exp. This occured in 1999&#xD;
only a few months after the game went live.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
At the time of this code implementation pets were kos and had faction.&#xD;
If you cleared a camp and placed your pet there, when the mobs&#xD;
respawned the pets would get hit by the mobs and proceed to clear the&#xD;
camp for you. At this time if you were nearby you would be added to the&#xD;
hatelist, but if you were too far out of range, you would not generate&#xD;
any aggro at all. You would get free experience and in the event your&#xD;
pet died, you would just sit wherever you went without getting&#xD;
attacked, coming back bummed out that you left yourself in all night&#xD;
only to be out of food and drink.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Their first step in the solution was: If your pet is aggro to&#xD;
something, you are aggro to something. While the pet retains its own&#xD;
hate levels, you being the owner also suffer the consequences of your&#xD;
pet's actions. Now for the AFKer's, when your pet died trying to hold&#xD;
the camp, the mobs would come running for you. Also if a second mob&#xD;
spawned while your pet was fighting one and it hit your pet, you'd be&#xD;
added to the hate list and if you were sitting while afk, your sit&#xD;
aggro would be greater than the assist aggro your pet gained, and the&#xD;
add or second spawn would come running and kill you. &lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
The problem was there is still a max "persue" range, and so if you were&#xD;
a very far, very safe amount, you would still get experience and in&#xD;
either of these new events, you would still be safe. Your name would&#xD;
stay on the hatelist for a while (back then mobs had their own bluring&#xD;
autoblur, timed blur, and other events, so it wouldn't be perm), but it&#xD;
would definately keep you aggro for enough time that if you ran into&#xD;
"persue" range, they would come running for you.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
----&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
So folks are still safely getting experience from pets at this point.&#xD;
So instead of the smart solution (which is the most recent, pets have&#xD;
no faction and are not KOS), someone came up with the idea that if you&#xD;
were too far from where a mob was dying and you were on its hatelist,&#xD;
you would not get experience for the kill. This stopped all afk pet exp&#xD;
farmers from being able to gain any exp unless everyone on the hatelist&#xD;
and eligible for the pool of experience "to be applied" upon death were&#xD;
there near it.&amp;nbsp; The problem was, this was not tied to pets or people&#xD;
solo or anything, it was a universal change applied to hatelist and exp&#xD;
code across the board.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
This change has never been reversed, though the code that has reduced&#xD;
the range I'm willing to bet is additional. I'd even wager a modern dev&#xD;
looking at the legacy fix&amp;nbsp; wouldn't realize what they are seeing let&#xD;
alone that it&amp;nbsp; is the cause.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
***This is the sole reason that you lose exp due to being out of range.&#xD;
There is no such thing as "first aggro".&amp;nbsp; If you have a group of 6 and&#xD;
the puller brings the mob, have anyone else in the group get on the&#xD;
hatelist by casting a detrimental spell on the mob (damage or not,&#xD;
either way) and then run as far away as they can before the mob dies.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
It obviously has to meet the distance requirements but the point is it&#xD;
will not only happen to the puller, it happens to everyone on the&#xD;
hatelist that is eligible for experience. Meaning someone out of the&#xD;
group can run off and not affect your mob if they run off and your&#xD;
group stays put and finishes it.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
------&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
That's the issue and its what needs to be looked into.&amp;nbsp; As a summary&#xD;
about the issues other people are confusing, here is just a FYI on the&#xD;
"group bonus" code which _DOES_NOT_HAVE_ANYTHING_TO_DO_WITH_THE_ABOVE,&#xD;
so please take the following text as something totally unrelated.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
When the group experience bonuses were tuned during the Planes of Power&#xD;
expansion, there was a way to exploit this. You would group up with&#xD;
someone and then you would move to one side of the zone and they would&#xD;
move to the other.&amp;nbsp; You could add up to 6 people, and the more you&#xD;
added, the better the bonus got. Here was the problem, and I'll use&#xD;
Dreadlands as an example.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Before the group bonuses, exploit, and then nerf, if Player A was at&#xD;
the spires in dreadlands killing skeletons and Player B was at Karnor's&#xD;
Castle wall killing random trash, both players would receive solo&#xD;
experience because they were not in range of each other.&amp;nbsp; The devs came&#xD;
in and added bonuses for grouping to address a long-broken system and&#xD;
to make grouping more beneficial than soloing, trying to create a&#xD;
preference for grouping over soloing because it was more worthwhile.&#xD;
Sadly the soloers took advantage of this. Now with the new bonuses,&#xD;
Player A at the spires still got "solo" exp because of how far apart&#xD;
they were, but because of the fact Player A was grouped with Player B,&#xD;
Player A got the bonus for being grouped added as a modifier onto the&#xD;
experience. So instead of getting the great solo experience of before,&#xD;
they got even BETTER experience.&amp;nbsp; So you group 6 soloers, you all get&#xD;
out of range of each other, and you all get solo experience for a kill,&#xD;
modified by the bonus for being grouped with 6, and you were making&#xD;
insane amount of exp.&amp;nbsp; Folks quadding in Plane of Fire could get 2-3 aa&#xD;
per 4 mobs, and swarm kiting bards could make 75-100aa in a single&#xD;
pull.&amp;nbsp; You can imagine its not possible, but I did it and believe me it&#xD;
was.&amp;nbsp; If you had a bunch of soloing friends then you would all reap the&#xD;
benefits, but some of the most wretched of the bunch actually would&#xD;
group 5 bots afk at a zone line and then go off and solo just to&#xD;
powerlever themselves or with one other person next to them usually&#xD;
several levels under but enough to get exp and powerlevel the second&#xD;
person super fast.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
They fixed this bug by making the bonus check be based on how close you&#xD;
were to the rest of the members of your party, not based on the fact&#xD;
you were grouped. This change did not affect the original above bug in&#xD;
any way shape or form. It was merely added to the routine that decides&#xD;
whether or not "You gain party experience!" or "You gain experience!".&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
If its party experience, you get the bonus modifier, its its regular&#xD;
experience, you get regular experience.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
And that folks, is the bottom line.&amp;nbsp; If devs or QA or anyone still&#xD;
wishes to resolve the frustration of this bug, please reference the&#xD;
changes in 1999 to the HATELIST and exp for radius, not anything else&#xD;
or related to group bonuses.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Thank you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;By leaving this "no exp if out of range" code in, they also helped to deter the rampant KS'ing problem that was about in kunark era. Where a puller would go out and get a mob only to have it snagged, by druids(mostly in my exp) or other soloers, before the pull managed to get back to the group. Since most KS'ers wouldn't dare fight the mob within range of the group they KS'ed the pull from (for fear of blowing their mana pull in a burn fight) they would pull it away; being out of range when the mob was killed.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I believe this is why they have left it in for so long, because it has helped solve Kill Stealing problems. You can still loot the corpse, but most ks'ing was done for exp in outdoor zones.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;By leaving this "no exp if out of range" code in, they also helped to deter the rampant KS'ing problem that was about in kunark era. Where a puller would go out and get a mob only to have it snagged, by druids(mostly in my exp) or other soloers, before the pull managed to get back to the group. Since most KS'ers wouldn't dare fight the mob within range of the group they KS'ed the pull from (for fear of blowing their mana pull in a burn fight) they would pull it away; being out of range when the mob was killed.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I believe this is why they have left it in for so long, because it has helped solve Kill Stealing problems. You can still loot the corpse, but most ks'ing was done for exp in outdoor zones.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I don't think that would affect it.&amp;nbsp; The person on first aggro in that case, would not be in the group, so I don't think this bug would occur.&amp;nbsp; More testing needed I guess.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;Wow, excelent post Mookina.&amp;nbsp; That totally explains the no xp "bug".&amp;nbsp; I agree, it is frustraiting when people make posts tying it to the grouped soloers change, when that has been debunked over and over in this thread.&amp;nbsp; Its obvious they haven't read past the first page.</description>

      <description>Amazing, this thread goes back over a year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;I know from personal experience that the problem was there at least for several years before that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Scanning the 7 pages of the thread I saw only one official response, and that was quite some time ago. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was a promise to have it looked into.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hmmm...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Just base the exp bonus on the number of group members in range of the kill.  Everyone still gets exp, slightly reduced if puller is oor, can't be exploited by scattered soloers.</description>

      <description>The Bug (AKA Known Problem) is a group puller can be oor and group doesn't get xp for the kill. This occurs in Riads as well but usually the puller get's nothing.&lt;br&gt;Solo = XP&lt;br&gt;Group = Group XP if 4+ add Group Bonus XP&lt;br&gt;Raid= Raid XP&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So the original idea was 4+ solo classes killing red's in diffrent parts of a Zone getting Group Bonus XP.... Simply put if they really are conserned about this then if OOR (Out of Range) of corpse no GRP bonus xp to person (although I think this is TOTALLY stupid.... Since mobs can Run away some mobs very fast.... {krin, echainers, etc...}) And the group bonus never was all that great... it just made grouping almost as good xp as soloing....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Solo = Best XP (no bonus to soloing)&lt;br&gt;Group = Not so good with 4+ aka Group Bonus Great XP (this was to encourage grouping it never was better xp then soloing)&lt;br&gt;Raid= Sucky XP.... XP mob gives divided by players in raid (Doesn't seem to matter which zone) Have to be in Radius of mob to get xp but the divider seems to be raid total. With NO Bonuses to xp...&lt;br&gt;A 2 group raid isn't so bad but a 3+ group raid get's like nothing for xp.... I guess raids might get group bonus but it's xp divided by the raid number then applied to group bonus wich is why we get a bit more xp then we used to... (Pre-raid system the main group got the xp so it's better then that...but not much)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The basic CHANGE everyone want's whether they know it or not is getting rid of this bug if your in the group that does the greatest damage in the same zone you all get the xp. The idea behind this penalty is Faulty logic plain and simple this needs to be fixed. And shouldn't be too hard get rid of the excess code turn it back when xp bonus was added (2003 ish)&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Couple inaccuracies in your post.&amp;nbsp; First of all, the bug has nothing directly to do with the grouped solo xp issue.&amp;nbsp; The person OOR has to be ON the mobs hatelist for the bug to occur.&amp;nbsp; If there were people spread out in the zone soloing, while grouped, this bug would not happen as they would not be on the other's mobs hatelist.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Other inaccuracy is what you said regarding solo vs group xp.&amp;nbsp; If you are in a really bad group I suppose solo xp could be better.&amp;nbsp; But in groups that I join xp is much faster then solo.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;Solo experience does not even come close to group experience over time at 70 at least, unless I am totally out of the loop.&amp;nbsp; Unless you are saying that without the bonus, group exp would suck and that's why the bonus is there?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I honestly do not see the point of the strict range anymore.&amp;nbsp; Maybe some time in the past it would have made sense... but if six necros want to solo for exp they can easily do so near each other as they could in six spots in the zone, no?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
