      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Names are respawning in the AO the fourth born mission number one.  Each of the two names drops a quest piece ... therefore should not respawn (in my opinion). It makes the encounter harder than it needs to be. Killing Gareth the first time was hard enough with him having a seemingly unlimited ability to summon &amp;quot;book&amp;quot; adds.  Having him respawn is just thoughtless and inconsiderate. In our case it was during the fight with the second named and we had put our casters on Gareths island ... He spawned and started spouting adds all over the place on top of the adds spouted by the second named.  I am hoping this was just an error and will be corrected.  This mission is buggy as all heck as it is without unfathomable named respawns.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Tried Dain 3 today...The first 4 runs went smooth for me but as I was rotating in guildies so they could get seals the General would poof on us. We won all of the missions but 3 of the General corpses poofed on us. Twice we died and ran back and Dwarfs killed the General before we made it back (dain was at ent so he lived) and the third time the General was the first in his wave to die and left no corpse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Becoming The Vessel - pet kills do not count toward the mission total which, given the requirement of 60, turns out to be quite an annoyance. I recommend backing pets off at 10% or so. DoTs seem to be fine, lots of necro kills in the accreditted 60 we racked up.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I have incredible lag in the zone Elddar Forest. I have no problems in any other zone but this one. The only way I can move is to turn my clip plane down to 5%, stare at the ground, and put auto follow on someone in my group.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Pathing in Relic is really really bad, especially Z-axis issues.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Yesterday my group wiped twice when&amp;nbsp;a mob warped onto us.&amp;nbsp; This mob isn't even from this part of the zone and he didn't come through the walls.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Yesterday, I also saw a ton of "ghosting" where the wandering mobs in the upper levels appeared to be walking right&amp;nbsp; in front of me, then they poofed away.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Given the first warping mob appearance, I could never be sure what was a ghost and what was a real mob.&amp;nbsp; Many deaths later, I could certainly FEEL the difference.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;This was intentional.  a fewreasons that I'm aware of:&lt;br&gt;1.  People were not getting the 5 individual quests, and therefore weren't getting the marks when they killed the named.  Since this quest was stretchign what the task system was intended to do (I forget what dev said that), they simplified it.&lt;br&gt;2.  If you were in a group, and died while killing the named, you got no credit even if your group killed it; this happened alot on the drake (oroshar?) and ravenglass, with people dieing to adds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don't know if they really cared about the raids.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;personally, I think raiding these mobs was pretty gimp; they weren't hard to kill with a single group (or even less for most of them).&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;hr&gt;noitaerc wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am not going to read through 17 pages of discussion.  if this has been reported, great, if not here is one:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Originally, the quests for killing the 5 named mobs were individual quests, and each one updated when you killed the named mob and gave you a mark to hand in for the cloak quest.  They combined the 5 named killing quests into one quest for the cloak.  I had the 5 individual quests on my warrior before they fixed the quest, and got the marks as stated above.  i did the conversations with my chanter after they &amp;quot;fixed&amp;quot; the quests, and all the chanter got was the cloak quest to hand in the 5 marks.  Now, when the chanter kills the named for the marks, there is no update, and no mark put into inventory, but has to loot one of three marks off the named. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;was this done intentionally to prevent the raiding of the mobs and giving everyone the mark, or is it a bug that makes a single group have to kill the named twice?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>I tested this tonight(and appologies if this is posted elsewhere, I did scan thru all 17 pages of this thread tho), and can confirm this bug to be reproducable. If 2 of the same aura interact, when the two people with the same aura move out of range of each other, the aura leaves the short turn buff box, and you lose the benefit, even tho checking the aura window shows the aura is still running. Moving back in range of each other, and the aura's reappear in the short term buff box with the benefit returning. The only other way to get your aura benefit back is to manually shut the aura off and restart it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It appears that the game is seeing you move out of range of the aura, so shuts it off without checking to see if another aura is still in range. This is incredibly annoying in raids, where I am usually grouped with another warrior, and we constantly turn off and on each others auras by moving around.</description>

      <description>Hi,&lt;br&gt;The Freeport Sewers are a nice enough zone but the pathing in there isn't the best. In the rooms is where it really falls down and some mobs get so confused they will run around a while, get really confused, return to spawn and just stand there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also there are parts of Freeport that are darker then the Sewers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Aura's and Illusions do not stack.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So far I've tested Water Ele Illusion, Skeleton and Mask Skeleton.  None allow the Aura to remain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Couple sets of mobs in rage are also instantly respawning.  Not a horrid problem, but they tend to keep the doorway blocked.  So not good either.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Is that because it's not supposed to which begs the questions why make items slotted for ammo with stats in the first place then or because it's a bug that nobody ever bothered to fix....and if it's just supposed to be that way don't you think GMs and the bug people would know about it....heh heh...bug people...heh heh....&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But I can't find anyone who knows whether or not Ammo slotted items should give you their stats...if no stats why not just use them right out of inventory instead of wasting a slot that does nothing for you by equipping an item there.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Woran Peece&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Some ammo slot items have stats so you don't take a huge stat hit when your using them in range I suppose. If you look at the ammo slot on my warrior, it has stats, but you need one equipped to actually throw them. In any case, in 6 years of playing I don't recall ammo slot items ever giving stats unless you equip it in the range slot, so it's fairly safe to assume (imo) that its not a bug and working as intended omgz</description>

      <description>A very specific issue here.  In Razorthorne (specifically Samples of Corruption instance), the room at the top of the first flight of stairs has a broken doorway.  You can't cast through it at all, because 'you can't see your target' - and NPCs have extreme trouble getting through it also (as in it takes them 20-30 seconds and they usually just end up warping past it.  It's especially annoying since in the mission, the room contains 2 unmezzable 2k hitting mobs, and because you can't cast through the doorway, it severely reduces your options as to how to deal with them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Not sure if its a new bug with PoR, but MM missions that have certain required monsters, like Dain, Naggy etc... if for whatever reason the instance wont load and you get the &amp;quot;mystical blah blah blah wont let you in&amp;quot; message and nobody gets in you will still get a 2 minute warning that the required NPCs must be in the zone or it will boot you.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Problem is the instance still never fully loaded and thus we all got booted from a halfway loaded instance. And no one ever got to zone in. Problem repeated itself several times till finally I guess we got lucky.&lt;/div&gt;</description>
