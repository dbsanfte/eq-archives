Those of us that want to rush to the next expansion get as much enjoyment out of doing so as you would hanging out with your friends in Paw or Unrest for weeks. Giving a sarcastic remark like the one you did, "There must be a prize at the end." would be like me saying "Boy do I wish I had taken 6 months to get through old world content...that sounds like FUN FUN FUN." I wouldn't think a "Community Relations Manager" such as yourself would make such an inflammatory comment. </P><br><hr></blockquote><br><br><br>Yet you and your fellow zergers are totally disregarding the overwhelming majority that wants this server to move along slow enough to form a good community and maintain what's special about this server to begin with, the fact that it's NOT a regular server. It's a minority rush to satisfy your own selfish desires, and to hell with what most of the other people on the server want.<br><br>Tell me this, when you've unlocked all the expansions what will you do? Will you stay or will you go back to your 400AA mains on "server X"? If you choose the second, then you really are being completely selfish. Take what you want, then leave the no longer special Combine to those of us who wanted to enjoy it for the long run. Typical raider mentality - take what you want when you want with total disregard for the desires of others.
