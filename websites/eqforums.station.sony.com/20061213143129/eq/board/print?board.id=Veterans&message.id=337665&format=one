<div>On a sidenote would be nice to get an explanation of yesterdays mess, spoiled a raid night for me. No information on board or antyhing on what was going on but when there are 99 general channels in chat you know something is seriously wrong.</div>

<div>/Ardbeg of AB, Wind of Tranquility</div><br><hr></blockquote>As far as I understood it whole soe went mamalglands up. Even devs and ops couldnt log in...no-one could so the only ones able to post stuff etc where the ones that were online already. During the day word on there being no login, no info and no communication available started to come in through fansites where those people of SoE that posted there announced the problem.<br><br>Given the severity of the problem at SoE HQ I think they did do what they could, which was actualy nothing.<br></div>
