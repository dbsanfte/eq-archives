      <description> Hey everyone, I just have a quick question about the new armor quests.  I have started working from PoK and have begun the armor quests which you are directed to right after leaving the tutorial.  I am currently working on the quest where you must go to Innothule Swamp and kill a multitude of different mobs and loot certain items.  One of these mobs are called Bull Alligators and I must loot two pieces of their meat and give them to my quest giver.  I am a Ranger, but in all honesty I only see on of these every ten or so minutes and they never drop the proper item.  Could I be going after the wrong mob or is there a better zone to hunt for this mob in?  Also, if I need to level up my Ranger who is currently level 11, where should I go to get the best experience?  Thank you all for your input in advance, sorry if this is an obvious question. &lt;span&gt;:smileyhappy:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>I've spent about 8 hours on this quest, and I'm about ready to give it up &lt;span&gt;:smileytongue:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I get there, kill one bull aligator, run around killing everything else, wait ages.  Another bull pops, I start attacking it when suddenly two kobold hunters pop and usually latch onto me, maybe a froglok too and then I die.  Most frustrating.  It wouldn't be so bad but I need the bull alligator teeth for another quest and I've only got one of those out 20-25 kills...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Unfortunately no, it won't fix the Nek Forest locations.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The reason why (now that Fan Faire is over I can mention this) is because the data for the locations to Nek forest have been updated to the SHINY NEW Nektulos Forest zone, which you will have "soon".&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>I would like to comment on the newbie armour quests as well.  Good Lord where do I start...lol.  First of all I am a newbie as well.  So far, any armour quests I've undertaken have been awful.  My 11 bst kitty needs one more &amp;quot;scorpion legs&amp;quot;. notice i said LEGS, and I have been in the pit surrounding shar vahl for h......o....u......r..........s, and  the only scorpions that drop the required item are whiptail scorpions. When I come across one every half hour to an hour or so, I do not get the legs.  OK, now to my 10 necro,  I have one more lg briar snake skin to complete my newbie armour and I come across snakes alright in Toxxulia Forest, but giant snake, reg snakes, moss snakes but nooooooooooooooo lg briar or lg thistle snakes. Once in a blue moon there do I come across one as well.   oh, and I almost forgot I took the advice that another player gave to the OP abour going to Barrenstein for the snake venom quest and I have been searching for hours in the commonlands as well for a giant rattlesnake.  WHAT IN THE SAMHILL IS GOIN ON?????????????????????? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm really seriously beginning  to think that unless you played the game when it first came out and are a high lvl player forget it.  In my opinion I really don't think this is the game for newbies.  I have been playing this game for 4 months now and I can't finish a newbie armour quest.   Good luck to all us newbies, it's an uphill battle my friends.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

The whiptail scorpions are one, I forget the other. When you see one, take notice where it came from. Then kill everything in the area. Litteraly everything. You will start seeing where the scorpions spawn at. Just camp the spot and you can reliably get the spawn you need.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Simply running around blindly killing and hoping for a spawn will just lead to frustration.</description>

I'm a &amp;quot;newbie&amp;quot;, having only played for a couple months, and I have completed every single armor quest with no help (unless there are more after my current level). I'm not saying that this is a great acomplishment by any means, most of them just consist of hunting down some mob, killing 10 of another mob, looting a few items, and claiming a reward, yet somehow people still find room to complain that this is &amp;quot;too easy&amp;quot;. Another thing I always hear newbies complaining about is lack of platinum. If people paid any attention at all to how plat is made, and how easy it is to make it (read: lazy tradeskillers), then there would be far less ooc begging than there is (I see atleast two beggers per day, at least). Anyway, theres my semi off topic rant for the day.</description>

WHAT IN THE SAMHILL IS GOIN ON??????????????????????&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm really seriously beginning to think that unless you played the game when it first came out and are a high lvl player forget it. In my opinion I really don't think this is the game for newbies. I have been playing this game for 4 months now and I can't finish a newbie armour quest. Good luck to all us newbies, it's an uphill battle my friends.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;People that complain about a game not being newbie friendly annoy me. I'm a &amp;quot;newbie&amp;quot;, having only played for a couple months, and I have completed every single armor quest with no help (unless there are more after my current level). I'm not saying that this is a great acomplishment by any means, most of them just consist of hunting down some mob, killing 10 of another mob, looting a few items, and claiming a reward, yet somehow people still find room to complain that this is &amp;quot;too easy&amp;quot;. Another thing I always hear newbies complaining about is lack of platinum. If people paid any attention at all to how plat is made, and how easy it is to make it (read: lazy tradeskillers), then there would be far less ooc begging than there is (I see atleast two beggers per day, at least). Anyway, theres my semi off topic rant for the day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did you know that (in most cases) there are 2 versions of armor/weapon quests?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first version (not available for all races/classes, though most are covered) are obtained from your hometown guildmaster, are based in your home city and surrounding zones, and involve collecting items (from mobs or some items may be purchasable from vendors/bazaar) and crafting the armor (generally using tailoring or smithing, though the combines for these are generally no-fail) or turning in items to an npc (weapon). These old-style armor quests do NOT use the task window. Based on Sumu59's post, I take it he is doing the old style armor quests. Yes. Some of the mobs/items involved ARE quite rare. When the newbie zones were more populated (GFay comes to mind), people would call out in /ooc what they needed, and when others came across it (assuming they did not need it themselves), they would /ooc where it was rotting (Nice way to build the sense of community in the same). Plus with more people in the zone, more mobs were being killed, increasing the number of new mob spawns (which gave more of a chance for the mobs/items you needed to spawn).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second version, which I believe Vunutus was speaking about, involves getting quests from PoK from either Barryezin or V'Lynn Renloe (two different tasks, but same reward). - There is a third quest giver - Castelen Drewe, but his pieces or armor are completely different - so I will exclude him for this discussion. These quests DO use the task interface, and involve killing # of certain mobs, collecting certain items, and scouting certain areas. There are 9 pieces available via these quests (again, excluding Castelen Drewe) - with 2 quests for each piece, 18 total quests. These can be obtained beginning at level 11, and there is one per level. It is important to note - 3 of the quests are group tasks (need at least 2, or more,  in a group to do them with the appropriate level average) - These quests are obtained at levels 15, 18, and 19. The reward is a note to give to your hometown guildmaster. When you present the note, you get one of the armor/weapon pieces, and experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you do the first method (old-style) or the second method - you will find that the end result is the same - in fact (in most cases) the EXACT same armour pieces/weapons (though the 9th quest generally added a new weapon that was not previously available via old style armor quests).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now with regards to Castelen, he gives quests beginning at level 10 - level 14, and then gives you a couple additional tasks at level 19. His tasks use the task interface, and when you complete the task, you receive the piece. These pieces are generally non-visible armor slot items (shoulderpads, neck, etc).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One final personal observation: Yes...some tasks (or portions thereof) are easier than others, some older-style quest's items are easier to find/collect than others. You will find that this trend will continue long after these newbie armor quests are done - if this wasn't the case, everyone would have their epic, etc. While Everquest is a game (and a great one, IMHO), it does involve some work. Frankly, again in my opinion only, the work is what makes the quests worth the while. I love the sense of accomplishment when I find something I have been working on for a while, or successfully complete a quest (progressive or otherwise) that has taken some time to complete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hope this clarifies the differences and similarity between the versions of armor quests.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div align="left"&gt;    You are looking for the right mob in the only zone the task will update when a chunk of meat is looted.   However this can be a frustratingly rare drop from an uncommon mob.  Most people just abandon this quest and go to Barrenzin in PoK who will give you a quest called Harvest of Venom which rewards you with the same armor piece and is much easier to do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;     Blackburrow, Crushbone and Kurn's Tower in Field of Bone are good for lev 11&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;                                                        Bob the Bald&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
