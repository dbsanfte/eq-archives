    <description>&lt;div&gt;I do agree that it is just a game and the EULA says &amp;quot;play or not, we don't give a smurf, we allready got yer money&amp;quot;, but from a customer service standpoint there should be some kind of compensation. The player has paid for AN ENTIRE MONTH OF SERVICE, and if due to problems caused and/or fixable only by SOE then they paying customer should get some kind of compensation. If you pay your rent on the first of the month and your house burns down on the 15th the renting person legally owes you for the 15 days you did not reside in the house (this is a documented civil suit in California). The most reasonable thing I can think of is to extend the players paid time period by the time taken with the problem. So if you couldn't play for 12 hours then 12 hours will be tacked on the end of your current months subsrciption before your card is charged for the next month.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;On the other hand it is just a game and it's only a few bucks so get over it. Go read a book or something. Also, it would seem that the players can still play on other characters , so they aren't really missing out on anything other than the fact that they aren't getting exactly what they want( playing their main) when they want it. go level your alt, get some tradeskilling done etc. I'm sure you can find something else to do in game on a different character that won't make you feel like you wasted your day, even though you weren't able to play your main.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;-Noii&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;I have to say this is one of the dumbest experiances i have had since sept 1999 when i opened my account.  I zoned into East Freeport from Relic around 10:30 am edt and have been locked off my main character ever since.  It appears my options are now thus:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;1) play another character/do RL stuff  -  this is what ive been doing most of the day only to find out all it does is put you further in line to be fixed - what the hell is this bull**SMURF**.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;2) sit in a moderated chat room and be berated by GMs for sending tells but not allowed to speak in teh chat room, oh and you get booted after 15 mins and hopefully you arent alt tabbed out and miss your turn.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I hope you guys are planning on giving us (the people stuck in Freeport ALL DAY on a freaking SATURDAY) some type of compensation for wasting our time.  None of that everyone gets double xp bull**SMURF** either, i want some xp potions i can use at MY leisure since you have screwed with my time all day long.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In truth I was very unhappy yesterday too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1.  Reason one Freeport/South ro went down and no mention in game messages until like 5pmest that night(not an exact time).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2  Moderated locked general chat and no gm or cs around for hours after the zone went down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Zone was sort of down or down not sure which since you try and log in and show as in the zone for a second (thiis varied) and then crash back to server screen or your 2nd attempt in the zone would show down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4.  One gm on that seemed to be servicing multiple servers for this problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5.  My group had made plans to work on the corruption tower mission and with frep down there was no way to get there 8(.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This that will improve this experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1.  From the moment the problem started occuring there should been an active presence by GMs (multiple not one) in chat and in game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2.  Unlock the chat and moderate by removing or kicking offenders who are probably kids anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3.  Bring the zone completly down if there are problem don't leave it in a sort of might be up down status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4.  If zone is down there should be a go home button to pok that is greyed out until you try and enter a zone thats down and when you do it becomes and option for one port to pok.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will have to rate that as one of the worst example of customer service to date in EQ, right behind no aniversery pricing this year and no discussion as of why.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lemme just clear something up here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, the guy is obviously peeved. He likes EQ, he can't play EQ, his char is locked in a zone that's down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now fine, there's some assumption and hyperbole in what the guy is saying, I'm sure, he's just letting off a little steam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mistake made here, is that certain people, and i suppose the term fanboi gets bandied around and works for some people, to describe someone who revels in quoting some matter of fact detail or even worse a line from the EULA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thousand Dollar Legislation does not equal human decency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some advice, don't kick a man when he's down and look like you're revelling in it. It makes you look like a **SMURF**.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

All jokes aside, I care if someone uses it as a free gate. The AA origin has a 72 minute reuse timer, and requires you to spend AA. If you make return home work every 15-30 minutes, I for one want my AA back. There is no reason I spent AA to buy something level 1's can do for free, and faster at that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I still like my idea. If you've ever tried to load into a zone which was down, you notice a little box pops up that says &amp;quot;this zone is currently unavailable&amp;quot;(or something like that). Add two buttons to that same window. One says &amp;quot;wait longer&amp;quot;, the other says &amp;quot;Enter PoK&amp;quot;  (or guild lobby, or home town, or whatever they choose to put there). This window only pops up when the zone your character is logged into is down, and it happens to be a different window than the &amp;quot;10-15 seconds&amp;quot; window you get trying to zone into Guild hall which means camping in an instance like GH doesn't give you free gate. This solves so many problems, from GM's being forced to waste time moving characters when they could be doing whatever else they could/should be doing, to people waiting 6 hours to have a stuck character moved, and it does all of this in a way that doesn't allow for free gates and what have you when the zone isn't down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just giving people game breaking (yes, free gate all, IMO, is game breaking. It's not a mechanic that should exist, and /wave to shammies gate potion business) abilities just because at some point they might be used in a sensible manner makes no more sense than nerfing 10,000 honest players to stop two guys from cheating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, people need to give some slack to SOE. They didn't mean for the zones to come down on you and trap you, it was an error. Have you never made an error? It's hypocritical to jump on SOE everytime they make a mistake if you yourself make them. Someone pointed out a 4+ minute delay per character (assuming no one had left chat) to move a character. Assume you were the only person stuck, would 5 minutes be too long to wait? No, 5 minutes is actually very timely. It's not the GM's fault that there is 160+ people in line for 5 minutes of service anymore than it's the fault of a waitress that there is no table available for at the moment. You don't expect your meal to be discounted, do you? Call me a plant, an SOE employee or a fanboi if you want, they are not accurate titles. I am just understanding of humans and their imperfections! This is why I attempt to present reasonable and logical solutions, as seen above, that may help to eliminate problems for both sides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Dangon-Veeshan on &lt;span class="date_text"&gt;04-16-2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;02:07 AM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Dangon-Veeshan on &lt;span class="date_text"&gt;04-16-2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;02:07 AM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>For the record, I think the idea of &amp;quot;wait longer&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;go to PoK&amp;quot; is very good.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My comment was purely to ridicule the people who respond to sensible, non-inflammatory posts with the all-too-popular &amp;quot;fanboi&amp;quot; moniker simply because he isn't spewing bile and hatred.  I know most people got it, but if you didn't, I can't help you. =)&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

There was no meeting this morning where a vote was taken on how to really tick off Sufi today. You should get, as compensation, exactly what you deserve, nothing. SOE at no time makes any promises of server stability or up time. Read that EULA before you accept it. I know I know, I'm an SOE employee/plant. It's funny, no one commented on all the days those zones were up or thanked SOE for that play time, but as soon as they go down it's a personal vendetta against you and you deserve compensation. If you actually want some compensation though, do you think this is the way to get it, with rudeness and demands? Has no one heard the saying about the effects of sugar (sometimes said as honey) vs. vinegear when attempting to catch small insects?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hey jerkface, I hate you and you suck! Now give me something, ok?&amp;quot; ... If someone came to me at work and said that, I'd give them half a peace sign and nothing more. You're entitled to nothing, you deserve nothing, and with an attitude such as that, I am almost certain you'll get it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a game, calm down. I've been stuck in zones that were down in the past. I've had issues where I wanted to play and for whatever reason I could not, be it the sone, or the server being down. I've always managed to have the situation resolved without having to resort to angry rants. Not that I wouldn't, just that I always try the polite, respectful path first and what do you know, 9 out of 10 times it will work!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have an idea for SOE while I am here. With a game as large and resource consuming as the current Everquest, it is to be expected that at certain times zones will crash. The cause and solution to these problems is not always immediately available. Perhaps there is a way to set it up so that if a character attempts to log into a zone which is listed as &amp;quot;unavailable at this time&amp;quot;, the same box that says that could include two buttons. One being &amp;quot;I'll wait&amp;quot; and the other being &amp;quot;Enter PoK&amp;quot;. This would reduce the workload of CS on these occasions by no longer requiring GMs to take their time to que and move 120+ characters from a broken zone. Barring some huge coding feature or complication of this that I am not seeing, I think an option such as this would be a win-win for all involved. Less GM time spent moving characters leaving more time for dealing with other issues, and less waiting time for players who fall victim to unfortunate circumstances such as these.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Dangon-Veeshan on &lt;span class="date_text"&gt;04-15-2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;05:53 PM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Also, it would seem that the players can still play on other characters , so they aren't really missing out on anything other than the fact that they aren't getting exactly what they want( playing their main) when they want it. go level your alt, get some tradeskilling done etc. I'm sure you can find something else to do in game on a different character that won't make you feel like you wasted your day, even though you weren't able to play your main.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;-Noii&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Would be nice if it worked like that, but read the fine print in the &amp;quot;My Account&amp;quot; section.  They dont give refunds. LOL&lt;/div&gt;</description>
