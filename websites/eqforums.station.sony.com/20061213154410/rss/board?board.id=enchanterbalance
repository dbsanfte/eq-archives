      <title>A novel suggestion regarding the Charm issue.</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=enchanterbalance&amp;message.id=5147#M5147</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Replace the Coax spell with something else.&amp;nbsp; Or replace the 75 Charm.&amp;nbsp; One of the two.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The Devs have noted, with some good reasoning to back them up, that Charm could never go back to the way it was in POP days.&amp;nbsp; And I can understand the reason why charm was changed as harshly as it was.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;But I can also say that these changes mean that Charm is now seldom worth doing at all except under rare circumstances.&amp;nbsp; And others have pointed out why this is so, I will not belabor the point.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Charm has, therefore, become a much-less-significant part of the enchanter arsenal.&amp;nbsp; And the Enchanter class needs some improvements.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Why compound the problem by giving us two new charms over five levels in TSS?&amp;nbsp; Each class is supposed to get the same number of spells in the new expansion, and Coax is taking up a spot that could be used for something that would solve&amp;nbsp;current problems, instead of exacerbating old ones.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Two charms per expansion has been the paradigm for Enchanters since the POP era, and Coax was obviously thrown in by the Autopilot while the Devs were thinking about something else.&amp;nbsp; Get rid of it.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Hi, I raided on my&amp;nbsp;enchanter yesterday for my first time and while it was very fun I felt really lost as to what I was supposed to be doing.&amp;nbsp; I play on the Sleeper server (up to Luclin unlocked) and was wondering what the enchanters's typical role is on a raid.&amp;nbsp; Any help you could give me would be much appreciated.&amp;nbsp; I am level 36 atm, but I'll be 52 probably in a couple of weeks.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <title>Crowd Control for Unmezzable Mobs: A Proposal</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=enchanterbalance&amp;message.id=5120#M5120</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I'm not going to bore you all with a long preface or "state-of-the-class" type summary, so I'll just get right to it.&amp;nbsp; A proposal for enchanter crowd control for mobs that are normally unmezzable and/or unstunnable:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;cast on mob:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;"Daze" effect - 90% snare, 50% melee slow, -50% spell haste, attack debuff (or melee skill modifier decrease), duration&amp;nbsp;3 ticks&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;recourse on player (short duration window):&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;"Daze" effect recourse - fragile effect, with improved spell effect that recasts&amp;nbsp;an improved&amp;nbsp;"daze" spell on the player's target that has the same effect as the original but with a bonus to the resist modifier.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The basic premise of this effect is that the enchanter uses his or her magical control over the mind to disrupt the target creature's normal brain functions, significanly slowing its movement, attack rate, spellcasting, and making its attacks more wild and ineffective.&amp;nbsp; This is a short duration effect (3 ticks) that must be maintained by "concentration", which is enforced by the&amp;nbsp;having the auto-recast as a fragile effect.&amp;nbsp; If the enchanter breaks their concentration on&amp;nbsp;the hold they have over the creature's mind (by meleeing or spellcasting) they must either recast the daze&amp;nbsp;or deal with an extremely pissed off mob.&amp;nbsp; In order to prevent this from being used for kiting purposes, have the daze break when damaged (or possibly make a check to break each time it is damaged, like root).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;This has the same risks of use as a mezmerize spell but the counterbalancing effect of having to "concentrate" to maintain the effect is that you can CC mobs that are normally unmezzable and/or unstunnable (e.g. giants).&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>Unmei, I was wondering...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Clerics get GoM to proc off their heals.&lt;br&gt;Since we are not wizards, but mez more than we nuke (or are supposed to) would it be too much to ask to get GoM adjusted to proc off mezzes?&lt;br&gt;It just seems incredibly unfair to me that I spent a ton of AA on an ability that isn't available to me on the spells I *should* be casting.&lt;br&gt;The latest expansions require far more mezzing, yet I cannot get a mana saving proc out of my primary function?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Doesn't seem right to me and I was wondering what they have to say for themselves on that. :)</description>

      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=enchanterbalance&amp;message.id=5023#M5023</link>
      <description>If I'm gonna gripe all the time about the lousy state of enchanters, I might as well offer some solutions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) Remove clarity potions from the game NOW. Putting crack in a bottle was the last insult and did wonders for making is even less necessary in a group. When I play my ranger, I'm appalled at the attitude toward getting an enchanter in the group. Just mooch the buffs and use a potion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) Refund Dire Charm and TD3 AAs and let us decide if we want to repurchase them or spend them elsewhere. Can you say &amp;quot;landslide?&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3) New AA: spell casting permanence. Every buffer class will want this, I suspect. With this AA, buff timers don't tick down as long as the caster is in the group. So long as the chanter stays in the group, his buffs will stay on. Requirement: SCRM.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4) More powerful nukes. I'm tired of druids and mages out-nuking me 3-4:1. Ancient:Neurosis is laughable.&lt;br&gt;4a) Nuke with a mana shatter. When the nuke lands, there is an x% chance that a chunk of the mob's mana will be destroyed, so they have less mana.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;5) Mana shatter: Instead of mana drain, this spell just plain wipes out a portion of a mob's mana pool and dispells it. Useful for those high caster mobs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;6) Better DoTs. Shammies can do 2k/tick. We do what? 300? In particular, Asphyxiate has the nice extra feature of dropping the mobs Str.  A new DoT that does more damage, lowers str/atk/dex/agi, would be a big improvement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;7) New AA: Weakening Hold. One or two seconds before charm breaks, the chanter gets the message &amp;quot;You feel your grip over %t weakening,&amp;quot; giving them a start on recharming. Requirement: Dunno, maybe TD3.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;8) Mental balance. Just like the cleric AA divine arbitration balances HP, let us balance out the mana in a group, excluding the pure melees. So if a cleric is going OOM and the SK and chanter are 90 mana, it refills the cleric.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;9) Improved cripple. Why do chanters and shammies have the exact same cripple? Shammies get the better slow, ever so slightly. We should get a better cripple.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;10) More stunnable mobs. Man, I'm sick of mobs resisting stuns. Diodites, anyone?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;11) A better epic effect. Our epic click is a joke.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;12) Why is Hastened Gathering a 2-2-2 AA while Quick buff and hastened MGB are 3-6-9?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;13) Silent Casting should not be activated, it should be innate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Have at it, boys and girls.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Long time coming</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=enchanterbalance&amp;message.id=5022#M5022</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Well it has been a long 5 + years for me as an enchanter,but I believe the time has come for me to allow my toon to die one final time and move on.I have been patient to no end in waiting for the changes needed to bring us back to being something other than a buffbot and it obviously isnt coming.I have seen the highs and lows to being a chanter,and these days unless I am raiding,a group cannot be found.I have tried to start groups,tried to join all guild groups,and the response is always the same - enchanters are not useful enough in todays content to provide a modicum of dps to help groups.Against raid targets we vary but roughly we can sustain around 200-300 dps while other classes snicker while they crank out 1.2-1.6k dps against the same targets.Against group targets we fair even worse,with many of the mobs being dead before we can actually land more than 1 nuke.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Instead of the devs showing notice to the pleas of the enchanter community to restore charm to a useful state once more,they instead offer us somewhat sub par spells that help others - help others in doing more dps,help others in regening more mana.We asked for an inherent spell or ability to regen our own mana and are instead given an aura to help those in group - proof yet again we are meant to do nothing more than help others while remaining essentially useless by ourselves.If we generate a ceratain degree of hate in a mob,the enchanter is still high on that mobs target list if the tank goes down - and yet our ability to mitigate damage or survive against the increasingly difficult mobs has not scaled upwards.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;On the solo abilities,enchanters fair by far among the worst now that charm has been crippled to uselessness.Charm was crippled when other classes complained we could sustain roughly 1k dps with certain charmed pets.An ability at that time that was not reached by those classes.Now those same classes far surpass what we were capable of in the past,yet we remain with a nerf to keep us in check.On days when I am not raiding,I have to bear listening to how beastlords,necros,wizards,bards,mages,can solo areas like RSS when they cant find groups,and I wonder why I am listening to their chat while sitting in the guild pool.Because I cant find or make a group - people are no longer interested in having an enchanter along now that content has been made more friendly towards non cc groups.DoD offered a degree of hope for us like PoR did,yet with DoD,almost all single group missions were designed so poorly,and in such difficulty,that no one wants to repeat them.Our hopes of attaining all our spells from that expansion rested solely on our abilities to be first in line to buy it and start on it asap.After the first few weeks of release,no one wanted to repeat the missions needed for spells or disciplines,thus leaving many in the dark for attaining what they needed.PoR was worse on this note in that groups wanted heavy dps to help them get through content and we = not heavy dps.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;My subscription runs out in first week of June and I doubt seriously I will renew anymore because we have been handed too many empty promises.An enchanter is what I started with and have no desire to start another class this late in the game.I have managed to rise in power to the point I am in the top 10 on my server,yet this class has long since been fun to play and impossible to solo effectively when we cant find groups.I have tried to lend my voice on opinions and suggestions for our class,and have watched as we are ignored from one expansion to the next or tossed small bones in order to pacify us into submission.We have recieved no compensation for the nerf given to us when charm was crippled,and have been laughed at by the devs when we tell them we have several thousand suggestions for them to look at for a fix.We ask for our abilities to be restored and are ignored,necros ask for the ability to crank out more dps and are given more spells to help them.Bards ask for more abilities to make them even more useful in groups and ask for better abilities to solo and are handed those on a silver platter.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I for one have had enough.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Mind Shatter: Adjustments?</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=enchanterbalance&amp;message.id=4954#M4954</link>
      <description>There's been a lot of chatter about Mind Shatter in various forums, so I thought I'd get a post in here to centralize discussion a bit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Right now, this spell is a very efficient DoT and situational mana regen spell for targets that have Mana to tap, but is uncastable on mana-less targets.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While, obviously, in an ideal world, this spell would work on all targets, I don't think that change is likely to occur.   The other possible thing we can push for is for the spell to be castable, as a DoT, on targets with no mana, but that it would not return the mana regen recourse, making it an inefficient but still significant short term DPS boost when combined with nuking (The damage per cast time on Mind Shatter is fairly high.).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please weigh in on what, if anything, you feel we should try to get done with this spell.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My personal stance is that the spell is fine as is because I would virtually never use it in situations where it didn't return the recourse, so I'd rather use my/our finite collective effort on other issues, but if folks feel that pushing one or the other of the alternatives is important, we can go with that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;It has been asked before on other posts,but what would be the chance of getting our CURRENT mind buffs to break overcap on intell and wisdom?Or haste for that mater?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It is kind of silly to see our strength and dex at 450 while our intel and wis are halted at 415 while buffed.An considering the new docs have pasted on us the buffbot sillouette,why not the ability to break haste cap to 110-120% ?&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Hate!</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=enchanterbalance&amp;message.id=4927#M4927</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;So, I am being LFG for 3 weeks trying to get group and progress in any spell missions of POR.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Once I was lucky to be allowed play outside group in Devistation and loot the would be rotting skins.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Got 3 of them in 5 hours of playing outside group.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I LFG at night time or during weekends.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;12 hours of &amp;quot;playing&amp;quot; EQ while being LFG!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I get offers to play Creator missions... I refuse.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The game mechanics SUX!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Every Guild groups help themselve and do what their progression requires. Guildless players are out of luck!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I HATE PoR spell mission system and all these quests!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;With Runes I had some chance to get them while exping with group. Now groups dont want Enchanter in group. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Now I am in different phase of quest status with other players.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why am I trying to play Enchanter again? &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Well, because my Rogue who have become my Main after Charm Nerf is also Nerfed and is no longer a DPS or fun to play.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Plus, as Rogue I was already kicked out of group in favor of Ranger who can snare or Monk who can split pull...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So, I've tried to play my Enchanter who has 891AA and 6700 HP unbuffed, all spells pre-POR.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Well, whose ass do I have to kiss these days to get invited in any group?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;My account is payed for anotehr 2 months. After that time SOE will not see me around anymore.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Have you ever hated this game? I do now!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Compliment on ideal balance</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=enchanterbalance&amp;message.id=4875#M4875</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I am a skilled 4yr+ veteran and skilled Enchanter.&amp;nbsp; I spent a lot of time charming solo and two-box.&amp;nbsp; Its been a while since I found an ideal charm encounter to solo.&amp;nbsp; My Enchanter is just Time flagged and not uber equipped by any mean&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The new 55 Aura quest in Tak, requires killing four season guardians.&amp;nbsp; These are 70, don't hit too hard but have lots of HP.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I charmed a guardian of sand and fought the seasons mobs.&amp;nbsp; Each fight took a while.&amp;nbsp; At the end of each I was under 10% mana and exhausted.&amp;nbsp; I had to gate away one of four times.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;In short it took everything I had to solo these and it was an absolute blast.&amp;nbsp; A ton of fun.&amp;nbsp; THIS type of mob (in my opinion as an experienced charm solo-er) is the ideal type of encounter.&amp;nbsp; Its a good benchmark, then I think.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;For those of you who do not visit the Artisan's Way forum, Dev Ngreth just confirmed this afternoon that they do not plan to make Dreary Deeds researchable anytime soon.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;He also stated that there is no hard cap on tradeskills, and that there is a hidden success cap on cutting OoW augments, altho he didn't say what that cap was.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Just a note.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>PoR Charming issue</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=enchanterbalance&amp;message.id=4845#M4845</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Well, here I am.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I decided to go and play with charm in the new expansion, to see if I could charm solo, or reverse charm solo, or something.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I went to Arcstone, went over the bridge rght there near the zone in, and attempted to charm one of the devil woman things.&amp;nbsp; (When I log in&amp;nbsp;tonight, I'll catch the mob names.)&amp;nbsp; Immune to charm.&amp;nbsp; Not too high level for this spell, but immune.&amp;nbsp; I thought the entire idea of the charm nerf was so they'd &lt;EM&gt;stop&lt;/EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;putting charm immunity flags on things.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So I took 7k in damage while I mezzed this dark blue mob.&amp;nbsp; Is this an oversight, an accidental flagging?&amp;nbsp; I'd really like to know.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I was in the Beta, although only for the last 2 weeks.&amp;nbsp; In that time, every time I was able to log into the server, the beta patcher was down, or the server was down, or something similar.&amp;nbsp; So I got to do no testing.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Unfortunate, because I would have raised holy hell about this earlier if I had.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;EDIT:&amp;nbsp; Ok, read on the Vet's board that apparently reverse charming has been nerfed totally now as well.&amp;nbsp; Anyone else here notice any severe charming problems?&amp;nbsp; Because it was broken enough as it was; it doesn't need to be any more broken.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Elosia on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;02-23-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;09:52 AM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

      <title>Non-Mezzable Mobs, Working as Intended?</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=enchanterbalance&amp;message.id=4842#M4842</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;First I must say I have not explored much of the PoR missions; but I have done 3 of them so far.  In the arena mission and the first mission to get the level 70 aura, all mobs were not mezzable, nor charmable.  Now I know that this is just a small percentage of the missions that we get to do in PoR but so far I am not impressed with how CC is being handled.  Does this get better or is it more of the same in the rest of the missions?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Thanks.&lt;/div&gt;</description>
