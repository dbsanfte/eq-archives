				I've played an Enchanter since November of '99 with some breaks in between. Now I play at the top end raiding, so my perspective will be focused there. Mainly in relation to itemization, Enchanters are expected to do the same job they always have but on a very uneven playing field versus mobs compared to the other caster's jobs.<br><br>CLASS: Enchanter<br> <br>HP: Being one of the most frontline casters HP used to be more important than anything. However, as mob dmg went up exponentially, and gear only raised moderately, this went out of focus.<br>Mana: Now the lifeblood of all I do, mana is obviously the most vital to functioning. However, I rarely find my problems [death, et c.] come from a lack of mana<br>Endurance: No impact <br>AC: The caster cap has remain unchanged so long and the way silk classes mitigate make this almost useless. Perhaps thats an issue that needs to be fixed, rather than gear<br> <br>HP Regen: Downtime reducer, even with max regen its not enough to make it that worthwhile<br>Mana Regen: Obviously most important but hard caps make it overly abundant. <br>Endurance Regen: Not important to me, but its also nonexistant I think<br> <br>Strength: Helps me carry that 100k plat and thats about it<br>Stamina: Its important for me to have max sta because its more hp, thats about it<br>Agility: Not important to me<br>Dexterity: Also not important unless Im soloing with Lilac<br>Charisma: The myth stat of enchanters, I'm at the cap and I'd like to think it affected my mez and charm but I believe its such a small help its not important<br>Intelligence: More mana, more tradeskills help, easily capped<br>Wisdom: No relevance to me <br> <br>Resists: Always important but the way resists seem to work makes it not worth the effort to have them maxed for most new content. For old content though and exp groups, max resists are wondeful<br> <br>Combat Effects: No relevance<br>Shielding: Vital to an Ench, perhaps slightly harder to come by. While I'm sure everyone will scream for shielding, I think it would help enchanter survivability<br>Stun Resist: Vital, shaking off that stun during mez intense moments can be the saving factor. Every moment I'm stunned mobs are killing people<br>Strikethrough: No relevance<br>Spell Shield: Very useful and more easily gotten for casters<br>Avoidance: I loathe Avoidance; I'm so far past the cap and it seems they think if they throw an Avoid mod on something, they can leave off something actually useful.<br>Accuracy: No relevance<br>DOT Shielding: Like SS but rarer<br> <br>Skill Mods: Not enough, and the ones that exist don't do anything unless it raises your skill a certain amount. That 8% mod on Time robe is completely useless. The 12% mod on DP back actually does something though since it raises the skill enough points. <br>Click Effects: The few ench specific clickies have been nice, it would be nice to see some more in the future but we've been told they're too unbalancing<br>Proc Effects: No relevance, although I think any caster proc weapons should have a better mod since we suck, but then we might be meleeing all the time<br>Worn Effects: Can't think of any ench specific atm<br>Focus Effects: Probably one of the most frustrating factors of gear planning<br><br>Innoruuk's Irony: the tash focus, is on 2 items. One is from Anguish gloves and the other is an aug from a LDON raid that you can only con people into doing once because its so boring. See, this focus would have been great on DP class item... or you know, any other item option. <br><br>Reagent Conservation: Last seen on an anguish mask, and there was really nothing in between there and reagent conservation V or whatever it was, makes this a useful but almost nonexistant focus. You could always take away the peridots from our rune and alendar line,... but I figure this is a more viable option <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-wink.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0><br><br>Spell Specific mana pres: Seen on almost every DP class item... the 25% Mana preservation. I'm sorry but this is just ridiculous when almost everyone running around in these zones already is going to have 20% Mana pres. That 5% for ONE spell doesn't make it worthwhile. I pray this never shows up again and I'll leave it at that.<br><br>Since they seem set on keeping some focus' capped, perhaps in the higher end the focus range could be decreased. If you want to keep Detrimental Mana Pres at 20%, then say the focus in Demi could be 3-20%, DK could be 5-20%.<br><br>Really, looking back over the past 3 expansions items they are boring, unoriginal and provide very few options for some essential focus' [altho I will say Last Bloods helped this issue to an extent but also caused a bunch of other problems]. Obviously not every item can be a "WOW, I just HAVE to have that" but they are currently nonexistant. And a final note, cookie cutter items are NOT okay, and everyone notices it. It makes item design look lazy and like they don't really care about their job.
