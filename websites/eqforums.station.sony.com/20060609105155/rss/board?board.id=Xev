      <title>Clan Chaos is making some changes.</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Xev&amp;message.id=75#M75</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I am Falfedet Morstisvere, leader of Clan Chaos. In the past we have set our goals tward achieving epics, with more and more content changes, and the upcoming server merge we have opened the floodgates once again. This humble guild is one of the oldest remaining on xev, we have always been a family guild, seldom raiding, but working tward the goals of all the members. It seems in our future we must begin some form of raiding to catch up to the flow of content. The current active member count is low, and because of this our min. recruitment level has been lowered back to 13.&amp;nbsp; We dont have the numbers to raid at this time, but the goal is to gather the members we need, and start a " weekend " raiding schedule. That doesnt limit us to weekend raiding, but due to work schedules and time restraints I cant promise the 7 day runs that some guilds can do, RL comes first. period. Clan Chaos is held to only a few simple rules.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;1. ANYTHING FOR A GUILDIE. If I can do something to help a guildmate, I will, and I know the members of this guild feel the same.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;2. NEED BEFORE GREED. If you dont know what this means, maybe EQ isnt the game for you.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;3. FOLLOW THE LEADER. In group or raid situations the most important thing is to be organized, listen carefully.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;4. HAVE FUN. This is a game. This is only a game. If we do well, WE do well, if we do poorly WE do poorly, But WE'LL have fun.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;5. IF YOU GET UPSET.&amp;nbsp; Any/All disputes between members will be handled as diplomatically as possible. I will try&amp;nbsp;to make sure &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; everyone comes away from any dispute feeling that the right thing was done. nobodys perfect.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If you've come across anyone who's been trained in Clan Chaos odds are they were a valuable asset to the group/raid. If you would like to be a part of the rebuilding of Clan Chaos just send a tell to Falfedet , or go to www.clanchaos.com&amp;nbsp; I will be putting up a recruitment page very soon, in the meantime you can read our mindless chatter.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Falfedet Morstisvere ( 65 Necromancer of Xev )&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <title>"Cult of Setekh" is looking for members to rebuild this once great guild.</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Xev&amp;message.id=70#M70</link>
      <description>Hello everyone. I'm an officer representing the guild "Cult of Setekh" and we are currently looking for fine players like yourselves to reform this guild to it's former standing it once had. We have recently reformed this guild and are still quite small. However if you want to be in on the beginnings of what will once again become great and make the guild known send me "Nephilya" or current leader "Warsrange" a /tell or E-mail in game for more information. So if you'd like to help a guild grow and make some new friends in the process this would be great for us all! We are currently looking for lvl 60+ members but if you are still interested and in high 50s contact me.</description>

      <title>Merge Xev?</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Xev&amp;message.id=62#M62</link>
      <description>I would like to know if/when there will be a xev merger of some kind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Considering the lack of group ability and most definatly lack of raid ability (outside of guilds) it would be nice to get a higher population in here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As it stands, it is getting rather boring to play when it seems the game is geared more and more away from solo play....but with less and less people there isn't much choice but to solo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With that in mind, xp and gear really stinks if forced to solo, and not to mention the ability to gain the funds to buy from guilds who actually have the numbers on to group only with guildies in the zones that have good decient drop/xp.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now I know these guilds may not like the idea....but um....not all of us are in a big guild or have the time to play EQ every waking moment in order to be in such guilds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So for the casual players who don't like PoK experience (ie none, sitting there LFG all dang day, or in low xp zones till people are around for a group) could we get a merge???</description>

      <title>Logging Out Issue</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Xev&amp;message.id=36#M36</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I'm wondering if anyone else is experiencing this problem.&amp;nbsp; When I log out of EQ to the character select screen to Quit, I ALWAYS get a black screen and EQ stops responding.&amp;nbsp; As a cleric if I have to /quit out, EQ locks up with the black screen.&amp;nbsp; The only way that I can log out of EQ is to /camp desktop.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I have reloaded the patches, did a thorough files scan, did repairs with all my EQ discs...am I missing something?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;My computer is 2.4ghz, 512DDR 3700 ram, and a GF4 5600 Video card and I connect through a DSL w/ router.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Any help would be appreciated.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>This Server Needs Something</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Xev&amp;message.id=32#M32</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;The Xev server has been my home for sometime now &amp;amp; I have never felt the need to use these boards for anything other than RL entertainment &amp;amp; information. Sadly, I have come to the conclusion that this is a terrible server with far more unfriendly people tha I can stand for. All eight character slots of this server are full for me &amp;amp; I don't care to be insulted, harassed, or belittled any longer. Why would anyone be so blatantly rude to anyone is beyond me. I am not the most experienced player but not the newest by any means. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;-- My dwarf cleric was belittled in OOC for not having the right spell selection for my level. An " Experienced " player informed me of my short-comings &amp;amp; wouldn't stop harassing me until I left his group &amp;amp; zone. The first person ever to make my ignore list.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;-- My troll warrior was harassed in BB on OOC for being in the wrong zone. I understand role-playing but not at the expense of another players right to hunt where he may. The last time I looked, we pay to play this fine game; not to be harassed or insulted for the sake of role-playing. I was forced from BB by this person, who felt insulting me &amp;amp; KS-ing would prevent me from hunting in his chosen zone. I petitoned with no response.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;-- My ogre beastlord was getting his first start in the tutorial &amp;amp; i was having fun speaking in the third-person. I got alot of laughs &amp;amp; was enjoying myself. That's when the " Experienced " player showed it's ugly face. I was doing it all wrong. I didn't know there was a wrong way to have alittle fun. I was refered to as idiotic, stupid &amp;amp; the laughing-stock of the entire zone. The second person to make my ignore list.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;My concerns may be trivial to most &amp;amp; I know that it may seem like another rant from a frustrated player with thin skin, but let's please think about what we say &amp;amp; how we say it in the future. Just because you are on a faceless system with a keyboard &amp;amp; "experience " on your side. It doesn't give anyone the right to treat people anyway you want. You may feel good about yourself or self-important but there is a price to be paid in the end. By chewing away at others, you are only hurting yourself. There are no excusses for being rude to someone. People deserve to be respected not attacked. If I wanted to be attacked I would have started on the PvP servers instead.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Due to the rudeness in general of the server, I am forced to move on to another home. My toons will be missed but never forgotten. If anyone reading this thread gets anything from the post, I hope it's this : " Be nice to your fellow man. There is no second chance to make a first impression. ". Thank you.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

Given the atrocious and blatant poor gamesmanship, I am compelled to share with you the awful behavior a group of yours committed tonight.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I have been camping Coercer T'Vala and some other tier 1 named mini's in Plane of Hate for over a month waiting for a Concordance of Dark Magic.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I was there, as usual, and the mob was up. I checked the nearby area and noone was there. No mobs were dead anywhere in the Northwest corner of the zone. Clearly noone was hunting this region.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;PoH is full of houses with multiple mobs in them. In this house there is a mob at the door, a mob in the back room, then T'Vala. I charmed Mob1 then pacified T'Vala and pulled Mob2 cleanly. We were fighting in the doorway to the house, when an SA group barreled past me, pulled T'Vala, killed him and looted him.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The whole time I was screaming STOP STOP **Oompa-Loompa** are you doing ?!?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;One of them handed me a piece of trash loot. They KNOW they cannot pull TVala single so they are blatantly lying if they pretend they didn't know I just cleared the house.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I did a /guildstatus and found slaasher (I believe) was an officer. He wouldn't reply to tells, the group just ran away.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Kinamex sent me a tell saying the mob dropped nothing.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Someone else sent me a tell saying "sorry it wasn't me who overran you".&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Finally Grouchy replied and admitted he saw me but they pulled anyway.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This is an extremely rare mob with the rarest drop I've ever seen in 4 years (and 3 epics) of playing EQ.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Grouchy then sent a tell saying my book dropped and I could have the drop of another mob. I ran there and he said "sorry a guildie looted it". I asked who and he said Lafourche, who wasn't listed with an SA tag.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;After I finally got some response from SA, everyone involved denied seeing me which is sickening lying. You know for a FACT that was my camp and my mob. You know you can't go in the back room of a house, I just finished clearing it.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I certainly hope the rest of SA isn't such terrible players and people as these are. It's just a game but when you have no scruples or morals it reflects on who you are as a real life person.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Donoven has a tough time sorting out the truth, but the fact is as I said them exactly and you cannot dispute it. It only adds insult to injury that you simply lied to your own guild leader to cover up your abusive cheating behavior.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Now I wonder if anyone has the fortitude of character to admit they were wrong and offer ammends. Frankly, I doubt it.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Ethyre Iri'Descent 65th Enchanter&lt;BR&gt;Officer - Lions of The Heart guild on Xev&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;

      <title>Next Open Raid on Vox/Naggy?</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Xev&amp;message.id=24#M24</link>
      <description>Any upcoming open raids on Vox or Naggy?  Got a small group of friends who would love to do it just for the fun of it, but we don't have enough folks or leadership to put together our own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Assuming that posting your intent on this board doesn't cause some underhanded guild leader to leapfrog your intended raid target date/time and beat you to it :-P.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Never the less, thanks in advance for any info if you can provide it!</description>

      <title>Well, now I know...</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Xev&amp;message.id=16#M16</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Earlier today, an open raid was forming to take a shot at the Carprin Cycle in Crypt of Decay...&amp;nbsp; There was some discussion/argument between the leader of this open raid and the leader of NULL.&amp;nbsp; Aparently there was a personality/ego clash and as a result, NULL leapfrogged the open raid and jumped Carprin.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;To backflag two apps.&amp;nbsp; *2*!!!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Apparently those 2 applicants were more important to NULL than the 40ish gathered folks opinions.&amp;nbsp; And their friends.&amp;nbsp; More important than their reputation.&amp;nbsp; But wait, I forgot, this is EQ.&amp;nbsp; Guild rep doesn't mean anything anymore as long as you can field the proper raid force.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Niiiiice guys.&amp;nbsp; Way to go.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>Lions of the Heart seeks new members</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Xev&amp;message.id=13#M13</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;LIONS OF THE HEART - www.lionsoftheheart.com&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;A family style guild:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Lions of the Heart is a family style guild that enjoys raiding but also realizes that individuals do have real lives that take precedence over a game.&amp;nbsp; Lots of guilds call themselves family style and I am sure they all have their own definition of that.&amp;nbsp; In our case, it means we run our guild as a family enviroment. That means guild chat stays clean, no profanity or dude speak.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Abbreviations are fine just please no "r u fine"s.&amp;nbsp; Family style also means to me that we try and maintain a friendly enviroment.&amp;nbsp; We expect our members to be relatively calm and level headed at all times and not prone to fly off at the handle whenever things don't go their way.&amp;nbsp; That being said, things happen and we all get upset.&amp;nbsp; Its how we deal with it that makes the difference.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;What are we looking for?:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;What we are looking for are mature and self-reliant players who are interested in a guild made up of people who are mostly older in age 30+ and who enjoy a non-hostile social enviroment in which to game.&amp;nbsp; Although our membership is older we do not assume you can't be mature and younger; that means we do not have an age limiit but we are an older crowd.&amp;nbsp; We wish to experience high end content and so we do raid but we don't make it the sole purpose for our playing.&amp;nbsp; That being said we are happy to recruit great players but we also want them to be great people too.&amp;nbsp; Its easier to learn how to be a good person then it is to be a good player. A good person who enjoys a relaxed gaming enviroment is always welcome and if you are a good player then that is an added bonus :)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Level Requirements:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Our guild is primarily made up of players with characters of level 50+ but we do have lower level players and many of us have alts.&amp;nbsp; That being said, most grouping and raid opportunities are to be found in the level 50+ range.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; We have no level limits or minimum number off AA points required because raiding is only PART of what we are about.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Lions Management style:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I think we have a good group of officers but as with any guild, that I know of at least, this is a "volunteer" job for which no one gets paid. We do our best to be professional and fair and to deal with situations that come up in a calm and well thought out manner.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; As guildleader and founder of the Lions of the Heart this is something I take to heart myself.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Some people will fly off the handle at the drop of the hat but from what I can see that rarely solves anything.&amp;nbsp; Our officers are there to provide leadership and resolution to difficult issues in a calm manner and to assist fellow guildmates in developing their own leadership abilities to&amp;nbsp; help supplment the officer corps in raids and such.&amp;nbsp; We are definitely not perfect but&amp;nbsp; we do realize that leadership is not just telling people what to do.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Raiding&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;As mentioned we do wish to see more of the higher content but we also set ourselves up for a bit more of a challenge as we aren't demanding minimum levels or aa points from our members.&amp;nbsp; We may make requirements above minimum levels on individual raids if needed but overall membership in the guild is more of function of who you are as a person not your gaming ability BUT we do need to be responsible and ensure we have what we need on a raid.&amp;nbsp; Since we do not enforce raid activity on our membership we have taken a bit longer to start some higher end raiding but we are getting there and now have in place some more organized progression. This is definitely not for everyone but if you are interested in a guild that likes to raid but not as intensely as a pure raiding guild then consider Lions of the Heart.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;We know we are not the guild for everyone:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;We know there are many guilds out there better suited for a lot of people then Lions of the Heart would be.&amp;nbsp; We don't try to be all things to all people.&amp;nbsp; We try to maintain a friendly family style enviroment that has some raiding content and is an alternative to those seeking the high end content in a more relaxed enviroment.&amp;nbsp; That doesn't make us better or superior its just the way we want things for our guild.&amp;nbsp; It is not our intention to offend anyone.&amp;nbsp; We just want to have fun playing Everquest together in a friendly enviroment.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <title>Upwardly Mobile Guild</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Xev&amp;message.id=10#M10</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Looking for a new guild?&amp;nbsp; GREAT!&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I am currently forming a new guild along with my coleader Fatiena.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The name of the guild will be Ascendo Mobilo Xev....AMX for short.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;( Upwardly Mobile.)&amp;nbsp; *grin*&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;We will be requiring 60+ with 50AAs and if you are level 65 you will need 100AAs.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; We have not formed any other requirements at this time, but there will most likely be more.&amp;nbsp; There will be a strenuous application process and you must have a magelo in order to apply.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;You may send your interest in our guild to Ascendomobiloxev@yahoo.com and await an answer from either myself or Fatiena as soon as we can.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Officers have not been chosen as of yet, but at this time, applications will be handled in person by Fatiena and myself.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;We will be EP flagging those who show not only an interest in moving up with the guild, but show reliability in their class.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; We will be raiding 4 times a week, with 2 required and then one raid optional on Sundays and some possible pick up raids during the week...totally optional.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;We will be&amp;nbsp;flagging for Time and GoD quickly but you&amp;nbsp;will be required to attend EP flagging&amp;nbsp;regardless of status in EPs.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; As you know, Fatiena and I have run&amp;nbsp;many successful open EP raids and are very capable of pulling our guild through quickly and efficiently.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;This guild will be a family type guild with sparklies.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;:smileyvery-happy:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Hope to hear from you !&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Hugs!&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Typeopos&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Ascendo Mobilo Xev&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Honor and Integrity&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;We will accept no substitutes&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
