&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Tradeskill Top 10 Issues&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1) Velium weapon to Velium ore conversions &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Additonal information provided with the 2/4/05 update&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;2) Bag tokens:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;3) Rotating stock on vendors&lt;BR&gt;4) Nitram Anizok's plight&lt;BR&gt;5) New Bag Designs&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;NEW item added with the 2/4/05 update&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;6) Expanding Jewelcrafting Mastery to other skills and classes &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;7) Omens tradeskill materials are too rare.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Additonal information provided with the 2/4/05 update&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;8) Balancing the Grand Robe / Grand Tunic / Phylactery quest for melees&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;9) Excessively low drop rates for PoP temper components&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;10) Difficulty in skill up paths to 300&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;NEW item added with the 3/4/05 update&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN class=292541702-11112004&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1) Velium weapon to Velium ore conversions&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;You can currently break down Fine Steel weapons to get various quantities of High Quality ore. Could a similar conversion be added to convert Velium weapons to assorted blocks, bricks, and pieces of velium ore?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Let's say I am doing a load of arctic wyvern armor for tailoring skillups. I have 200 arctic wyvern hides. It takes 2 small pieces of velium to make a velium bit. It takes 3 velium bits to make 2 velium studs. It takes 1 brick of velium to make 2 pieces. That means I need 1.5 bricks of velium (or 3 small pieces of velium) per velium stud. Which means I need 300 bricks of velium (30 bags full...that's more than I can hold in my inventory and in my bank) to break down into 600 small pieces in order to make 200 studs. That is a HECK of a lot of farming in Crystal Caverns, considering it takes at least two passes through the entire upper and lower orc camp to get just a single bag of bricks. That means it would take 600 passes through both upper and lower orcs. If you only get a single camp, that's 1200 passes. At (I assume) 20 minutes per spawn cycle, that's 400 hours of farming. For what will amount to about 10 skillups if you get a rate of 1 skillup per stack of hides.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;New Information Added 2/4/05&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Some additional information &lt;A href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Trade&amp;amp;message.id=3958&amp;amp;jump=true" target=_blank&gt;&lt;FONT color=#f0a911&gt;on the Artisan's Way&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt; compiled by Moraganth, that might be useful in this issue.&amp;nbsp; I would past it here, but it's rather long.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN class=292541702-11112004&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial color=#0000ff&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;This is a particularly large issue that I didn't have time to get to this time around, primarily because it's going to require extra-special care to ensure that we don't introduce any profitability exploits. Fear not! It's still on the list and has even moved up a rank or two.&lt;IMG height=16 src="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.gif" width=16 border=0&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2) Bag tokens:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;This has been partially implemented with the update on 10/13 - Minor Update (see 2C)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;2A) Showing bag stats&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN class=292541702-11112004&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial color=#0000ff&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Adding Bag Stats - This turns out to be more difficult than it initially seems and didn't make it in this round. It'll remain on the list for the future, though it may take some time.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;2B) Additional Tokens for bags. A list of GOD bags that do not have bazaar tokens was compiled and can be found &lt;A href="http://mboards.eqtraders.com/eq/showthread.php?t=16068" target=_blank&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffcc33&gt;here&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp; The list also includes non weight reducing bags that it would be great to have tokens for.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Additional request, 2/4/05&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;A token for the Ice Cream Curn was one recently requested.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN class=292541702-11112004&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial&gt;Additional Tokens - Most specialty bags and containers have been added to this NPC. If there are any more, feel free to let me know, I'll throw it on the list.&lt;IMG height=16 src="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.gif" width=16 border=0&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;3) Rotating stock on vendors&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A few months ago, the number of slots on a vendor was reduced from 100 (of which 20 were "under the counter") to 80. This took away the ability of players to "vendor mine" which served as both a plat sink and a way to increase the flow of usable items (particularly tradeskill supplies).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Are there any alternative ways planned to help tradeskiller find rare items on vendors? For example, it's often been suggested that when selling an item to a "full" vendor, it shouldn't automatically disappear. Rather, the oldest player-sold item would poof and the item being sold would appear at the top of the list. This would allow vendors to keep a "rotating stock" of player-sold items. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;UPDATE FROM TANKER (thanks Tanker):About a month ago, I spent some time looking into this, and discovered a few gotcha's in the Merchant code that make this more than a one-day project. In talking about it with my lead, it was decided that the solutions to these problems were both too time-consuming for right now, and contained side-effects that would need full review before this was done. An optimist would place this issue as "Under review", but under no circumstances would I look for this Soon(TM). However, without going into ANY specifics, I wouldn't be surprised by an alternative method of gathering supplies coming up in the future... don't ask.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;4) Nitram Anizok's plight&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Tinkerers are concerned about the ability to get to Nitram in Innovation, as he is the only vendor for certain non-stacking tinkering supplies. The problem is due to both see-invis mobs along the path to reach him, and the fact that he is also used for a quest (Xanamech).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Possible Suggestions on how to&amp;nbsp;implement this &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;NEW&amp;nbsp;added with the 11/19/04 update&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Suggestion 1:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Alternative to moving Nitram, consider putting in some sort of teleport to and from Nitram. Have the port only work for one person per 6 hours game time (about 15 minutes real time). That’s enough to give tradeskillers easy access to Nitram without breaking any quests or interfering with Nitram’s role in the Xanamech quest/raid.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Suggestion 2:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Another proposed alternative is to create a new vendor in Abysmal Sea, with the same inventory as Nitram Anizok in PoI. To make it interesting you could increase his Greed modifier to make the items slighty more expensive than buying from Nitram. If players want the items cheaper, they have to brave PoI to buy from Nitram. The storyline would be that Tramin Anizok (Nitram's cousin) has recently set up an import/export business in Abysmal Sea, importing parts from his cousin in the Planes. He sells all of the parts needed for the Anizok family recipes, although at a markup due to the dangers of exporting the raw materials.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Suggestion 3:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Another possible solution would be to leave poor Niltram alone, but either add a new NPC in the tower with the PoI zone in or make the ogre there a merchant that has the same inventory.&amp;nbsp; As with suggestion 2, the components would be more expensive if you bought them here, than if you fought your way to Niltram and bought them from him.&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;SPAN class=292541702-11112004&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial color=#ff0000&gt;This is something&amp;nbsp;that we&amp;nbsp;need to investigate a bit, to make sure I'm not trivializing any combines or breaking any quests / events by moving him.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;5) New Bag Designs &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;NEW item added with the 2/4/05 update&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;New bag designs and/or ability to DYE bags. I'm bored of the same old graphics, plus it would help to manage my bank &amp;amp; inventory if I had more variety in the looks. If I could dye them, that would be great...brown is so dated..... I loved the new bag look for the bag that people received as a /claim item (for LoY, I think, Satchel of Abu-Kar) but no other bags have since been given that graphic &lt;SPAN class=292541702-11112004&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;6) Expanding Jewelcrafting Mastery to other skills and classes&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I guess I don't need to restate the arguments here.&amp;nbsp; From what I've seen, the community is about&amp;nbsp;85-90% in favor of this.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN class=292541702-11112004&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;With Omens, there are several additional "Mastery" AA's available to the players.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman"&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;SPAN class=292541702-11112004&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial color=#0000ff&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;As mentioned at Fan Faire, there are currently no plans to extend JCM to any additional classes.&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;7) Omens tradeskill materials are too rare. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The rare parts for Omens augments, (Slugworms, Discordant Scoriae, and Trean Flies), plus the gemstone augments themselves, seem to drop very rarely indeed. Given the risk of failure at multiple steps during the aug tradeskill process, is this intended? Similarly, many of the other tradeskill items such as bloods and hides seem disproportionately rare.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;8)&lt;STRONG&gt; Balancing the Grand Robe / Grand Tunic / Phylactery quest for melees&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;Maddoc said he would look at adding an alternate reward for melees who wish to do this quest, since they cannot use the Grand Robe/Tunic. Discussions included either adding a new reward for melees or making the Token of Service tradable. This is probably something that's very easy to do, and again one of the easiest things to do which will get done before any of the others.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;8A) Ghoul of Takish-Iz broken, very frustrating!&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;This is very much related so I have combined it in the same item. - The Ghoul is an insanely rare spawn, and almost impossible for a non-tracker to catch without using tools-that-shall-not-be-mentioned. In addition, even when he does spawn and is caught, his drop is way too rare. One person suggests that the Anchor drop rate should be no worse than 1 in 3 kills, and preferably better than that.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I have killed the Ghoul of Takish-Iz more than 30 times in the last 2 months - he is supposed to drop the last piece I need for the phylactery quest - the spiritual anchor. I know for a fact as recently as late April/early May he was still dropping the anchor. By all accounts the Anchor is a 1/4 to 1/5 drop so the odds of me not getting one in 30 kills are bordering on impossible .... in an ongoing discussion on EQtraders, if you factor in two other player's experiences in the last month we have killed the Ghoul 41 times with 0 drops. The amount of time I have spent on this quest now vastly exceeds the amount of time it took me to get my epic or do anything else ever in this game - hundreds of hours, at least a hundred just on the ghoul..... somethin' ain't right about that.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;9) Excessively low drop rates for PoP temper components &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Given the quality of OoW tradeskill armors and drops, PoP armors have essentially become obsolete, or standby items until you can get the "good" stuff from OoW. The balancing of plate vs. chain was a superb step that will help revive the PoP plate market. The follow-up to this is a significant increase in drop rates, not just for temper components, but for all the items for PoP tradeskills. If PoP tradeskill items are to remain reasonably competitive in the OoW era (and yes, I know some folks will argue that they &lt;I&gt;don't&lt;/I&gt; have to stay competitive), they must be much cheaper than they currently are, and this can only happen if supply increases. This means that drop rates must increase, and by a huge margin. A single raid on a mini-boss named in the elemental planes should yield enough supplies for at least one PoP tradeskill item -- note that this implies multiple attempts, given current fail rates. An elemental god raid should see enough drops for 2-3 finished items.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;New information, Added 2/4/05:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Well they decreased the number of tempers and ammount of metal needed. Great. Now unfortunately less people seem to be in PoP so for those of us lesser mortals without EP flags its just as hard to get this stuf made as before. Although Magnetic&amp;nbsp;did alot of damage to this market anyway, some drop rate increase might help here.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;10) Difficulty in skill up paths to 300 &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;New item, added with the 3/4/05&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;The tradeskill caps have been raised to 300 for all the tradeskills. However, the skill up paths are very difficult to non-existent for some of them. Now, from Maddoc's post on EQ Traders, it would seem that he has plans to address the skill up paths for all the trades:&amp;nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;MADDOC WROTE: &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;"Without going too deeply into specifics quite yet, what this means to you is a much more smooth skill-progression for all skills . . . In some cases, this may mean that trivial of any given recipe will be increased or decreased, to help fill in the some areas of need.&amp;nbsp; Overall, the changes will greatly benefit the tailors (and other tradeskillers, of course) in the form of a smoother progression across the board."&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In general, I think everyone would agree that this is a good thing. However, there are some specific issues pertaining to the various trades that still should be mentioned. What better place to start than. . . .&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;10A) Tailoring.&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;BR&gt;Well, there is sure a lot of discussion on tailoring in the TS community today. As Maddoc posted yesterday:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;MADDOC WROTE:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;"Now, as I'm sure you've noticed, some of these changes found their way live, somewhat unexpectedly, and I can understand the frustration at the changes, however... "&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Having mid-to-high level tailoring recipes to bridge the gap has long been desired by the community, even more so now with the change of the skill cap from 250 to 300. However, from Maddoc's post, it seems pretty clear (at least to me) that the trivial change to the Solstace Robes and the Velious tailoring should not have been pushed live until all the other changes that he has in mind (for tailoring) were pushed live as well. If, as Maddoc stated, the push was unintentional, then resetting the trival levels back to their original levels should be done, until all the other changes for tailoring are ready to be pushed live as well. Everything should go simulataneously, or nothing should go at all. This would also allow post 252 tailors to use up the large quantities of components that they had saved up for a large tailoring run.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Since most people stock up on items for a long run of combines, having an unexpected change like this imposes a lot of anger and frustration on the community, especially coming, as it did, a couple weeks after the skill caps were raised. Tailors who were maxed out at 250 went back to farming ingredients to raise their skill to 300. Typically, people would farm one ingredient at a time. They'll spend days getting 100 (in a lot of cases cases several hundred) Arctic Wyvern Hides, and then fishing for that many Cobalt Cods, and then moving on to the velium. Many people were in the middle of gathering the ingredients, and now are left with a large stockpile of ingredients that are worthless to them.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;With regards to the velious tailoring, all the pieces currently trivial at 252. Having an arbitrary level of 252 doesn't make sense for all pieces, because the amount of velium needed is different for different pieces. Previous convention suggested that the more ore (velium in this case) needed, the higher the trivial level for the piece. Therefore, the recipes should either scale more logically based on this, or the velium requirement should be reduced to 1 for all of them. (Speaking of velium, what better way to reduce the mindless farming of velium for these recipes, than to implement the velium weapon to ore conversion, requested in number 1.)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Since the components for Solstice Robes and Velious leathers are, in fact, not common or cheap, the lowered trivials should accompanied by increased drop rates on the Velious leather components (and making the velium easier to gather, as the issue in number 1 requests&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ) and possibly the removal of the most expensive components for the Solstice Robes.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;In addition, because of the trivial changes, there are currently no viable skill up paths to 300.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;10B) Research.&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;BR&gt;The research cap is at 300 now, however, there are currently no recipes that trivial over 227. It would be great if the PoP spells would be researchable now. That would help alleviate two problems. 1) it would give researchers higher skill combines to work on, and 2) it would help bring down the price of 63/64/65 PoP spells, which are rediculously to insanely priced in the bazaar these days. Another suggestion is to allow you to research spells for any INT caster, perhaps everyone getting the same book to do the combines. In addition, adding in recipes to research spells for hybrid spells would seem to make sense as well. INT casters can currently research spells for priests, but not for hybrids.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;In addition to not having the ability to skill up past 227, researchers do not have a tradeskill trophy. Since research is being treated as a regular tradeskill, it would only make sense that there was a trophy as well.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;10C) Fletching.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;The skill up path for non-wood elf or non-Karana worshiping PCs is very difficult past 282. Fletching components in OoW and DoN do not drop frequently enough to make them a viable skill up path. Making PoP bows is also not a viable skill up path, because of the rarity/price of components.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;10D) Alchemy.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;Many of the alchemy recipes above 250 require a foraged item, however, shaman don't seem to forage as well as some other classes.&amp;nbsp; Could we get some higher skill recipes that do not use foraged items to use when skilling up?&lt;SPAN class=time_text&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;6) Expanding Jewelcrafting Mastery to other skills and classes &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;7) Omens tradeskill materials are too rare.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Additonal information provided with the 2/4/05 update&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;9) Excessively low drop rates for PoP temper components&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;10) Difficulty in skill up paths to 300&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;NEW item added with the 3/4/05 update&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN class=292541702-11112004&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1) Velium weapon to Velium ore conversions&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;You can currently break down Fine Steel weapons to get various quantities of High Quality ore. Could a similar conversion be added to convert Velium weapons to assorted blocks, bricks, and pieces of velium ore?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Let's say I am doing a load of arctic wyvern armor for tailoring skillups. I have 200 arctic wyvern hides. It takes 2 small pieces of velium to make a velium bit. It takes 3 velium bits to make 2 velium studs. It takes 1 brick of velium to make 2 pieces. That means I need 1.5 bricks of velium (or 3 small pieces of velium) per velium stud. Which means I need 300 bricks of velium (30 bags full...that's more than I can hold in my inventory and in my bank) to break down into 600 small pieces in order to make 200 studs. That is a HECK of a lot of farming in Crystal Caverns, considering it takes at least two passes through the entire upper and lower orc camp to get just a single bag of bricks. That means it would take 600 passes through both upper and lower orcs. If you only get a single camp, that's 1200 passes. At (I assume) 20 minutes per spawn cycle, that's 400 hours of farming. For what will amount to about 10 skillups if you get a rate of 1 skillup per stack of hides.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;New Information Added 2/4/05&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Some additional information &lt;A href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Trade&amp;amp;message.id=3958&amp;amp;jump=true" target=_blank&gt;&lt;FONT color=#f0a911&gt;on the Artisan's Way&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt; compiled by Moraganth, that might be useful in this issue.&amp;nbsp; I would past it here, but it's rather long.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN class=292541702-11112004&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial color=#0000ff&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;This is a particularly large issue that I didn't have time to get to this time around, primarily because it's going to require extra-special care to ensure that we don't introduce any profitability exploits. Fear not! It's still on the list and has even moved up a rank or two.&lt;IMG height=16 src="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.gif" width=16 border=0&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2) Bag tokens:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;This has been partially implemented with the update on 10/13 - Minor Update (see 2C)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;2A) Showing bag stats&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN class=292541702-11112004&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial color=#0000ff&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Adding Bag Stats - This turns out to be more difficult than it initially seems and didn't make it in this round. It'll remain on the list for the future, though it may take some time.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;2B) Additional Tokens for bags. A list of GOD bags that do not have bazaar tokens was compiled and can be found &lt;A href="http://mboards.eqtraders.com/eq/showthread.php?t=16068" target=_blank&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffcc33&gt;here&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp; The list also includes non weight reducing bags that it would be great to have tokens for.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Additional request, 2/4/05&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;A token for the Ice Cream Curn was one recently requested.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN class=292541702-11112004&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial&gt;Additional Tokens - Most specialty bags and containers have been added to this NPC. If there are any more, feel free to let me know, I'll throw it on the list.&lt;IMG height=16 src="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.gif" width=16 border=0&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;3) Rotating stock on vendors&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A few months ago, the number of slots on a vendor was reduced from 100 (of which 20 were "under the counter") to 80. This took away the ability of players to "vendor mine" which served as both a plat sink and a way to increase the flow of usable items (particularly tradeskill supplies).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Are there any alternative ways planned to help tradeskiller find rare items on vendors? For example, it's often been suggested that when selling an item to a "full" vendor, it shouldn't automatically disappear. Rather, the oldest player-sold item would poof and the item being sold would appear at the top of the list. This would allow vendors to keep a "rotating stock" of player-sold items. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;UPDATE FROM TANKER (thanks Tanker):About a month ago, I spent some time looking into this, and discovered a few gotcha's in the Merchant code that make this more than a one-day project. In talking about it with my lead, it was decided that the solutions to these problems were both too time-consuming for right now, and contained side-effects that would need full review before this was done. An optimist would place this issue as "Under review", but under no circumstances would I look for this Soon(TM). However, without going into ANY specifics, I wouldn't be surprised by an alternative method of gathering supplies coming up in the future... don't ask.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;4) Nitram Anizok's plight&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Tinkerers are concerned about the ability to get to Nitram in Innovation, as he is the only vendor for certain non-stacking tinkering supplies. The problem is due to both see-invis mobs along the path to reach him, and the fact that he is also used for a quest (Xanamech).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Possible Suggestions on how to&amp;nbsp;implement this &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;NEW&amp;nbsp;added with the 11/19/04 update&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Suggestion 1:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Alternative to moving Nitram, consider putting in some sort of teleport to and from Nitram. Have the port only work for one person per 6 hours game time (about 15 minutes real time). That’s enough to give tradeskillers easy access to Nitram without breaking any quests or interfering with Nitram’s role in the Xanamech quest/raid.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Suggestion 2:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Another proposed alternative is to create a new vendor in Abysmal Sea, with the same inventory as Nitram Anizok in PoI. To make it interesting you could increase his Greed modifier to make the items slighty more expensive than buying from Nitram. If players want the items cheaper, they have to brave PoI to buy from Nitram. The storyline would be that Tramin Anizok (Nitram's cousin) has recently set up an import/export business in Abysmal Sea, importing parts from his cousin in the Planes. He sells all of the parts needed for the Anizok family recipes, although at a markup due to the dangers of exporting the raw materials.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Suggestion 3:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Another possible solution would be to leave poor Niltram alone, but either add a new NPC in the tower with the PoI zone in or make the ogre there a merchant that has the same inventory.&amp;nbsp; As with suggestion 2, the components would be more expensive if you bought them here, than if you fought your way to Niltram and bought them from him.&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;SPAN class=292541702-11112004&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial color=#ff0000&gt;This is something&amp;nbsp;that we&amp;nbsp;need to investigate a bit, to make sure I'm not trivializing any combines or breaking any quests / events by moving him.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;5) New Bag Designs &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;NEW item added with the 2/4/05 update&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;New bag designs and/or ability to DYE bags. I'm bored of the same old graphics, plus it would help to manage my bank &amp;amp; inventory if I had more variety in the looks. If I could dye them, that would be great...brown is so dated..... I loved the new bag look for the bag that people received as a /claim item (for LoY, I think, Satchel of Abu-Kar) but no other bags have since been given that graphic &lt;SPAN class=292541702-11112004&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;6) Expanding Jewelcrafting Mastery to other skills and classes&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I guess I don't need to restate the arguments here.&amp;nbsp; From what I've seen, the community is about&amp;nbsp;85-90% in favor of this.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN class=292541702-11112004&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;With Omens, there are several additional "Mastery" AA's available to the players.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman"&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;SPAN class=292541702-11112004&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial color=#0000ff&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;As mentioned at Fan Faire, there are currently no plans to extend JCM to any additional classes.&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;7) Omens tradeskill materials are too rare. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The rare parts for Omens augments, (Slugworms, Discordant Scoriae, and Trean Flies), plus the gemstone augments themselves, seem to drop very rarely indeed. Given the risk of failure at multiple steps during the aug tradeskill process, is this intended? Similarly, many of the other tradeskill items such as bloods and hides seem disproportionately rare.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;8)&lt;STRONG&gt; Balancing the Grand Robe / Grand Tunic / Phylactery quest for melees&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;Maddoc said he would look at adding an alternate reward for melees who wish to do this quest, since they cannot use the Grand Robe/Tunic. Discussions included either adding a new reward for melees or making the Token of Service tradable. This is probably something that's very easy to do, and again one of the easiest things to do which will get done before any of the others.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;8A) Ghoul of Takish-Iz broken, very frustrating!&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;This is very much related so I have combined it in the same item. - The Ghoul is an insanely rare spawn, and almost impossible for a non-tracker to catch without using tools-that-shall-not-be-mentioned. In addition, even when he does spawn and is caught, his drop is way too rare. One person suggests that the Anchor drop rate should be no worse than 1 in 3 kills, and preferably better than that.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I have killed the Ghoul of Takish-Iz more than 30 times in the last 2 months - he is supposed to drop the last piece I need for the phylactery quest - the spiritual anchor. I know for a fact as recently as late April/early May he was still dropping the anchor. By all accounts the Anchor is a 1/4 to 1/5 drop so the odds of me not getting one in 30 kills are bordering on impossible .... in an ongoing discussion on EQtraders, if you factor in two other player's experiences in the last month we have killed the Ghoul 41 times with 0 drops. The amount of time I have spent on this quest now vastly exceeds the amount of time it took me to get my epic or do anything else ever in this game - hundreds of hours, at least a hundred just on the ghoul..... somethin' ain't right about that.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;9) Excessively low drop rates for PoP temper components &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Given the quality of OoW tradeskill armors and drops, PoP armors have essentially become obsolete, or standby items until you can get the "good" stuff from OoW. The balancing of plate vs. chain was a superb step that will help revive the PoP plate market. The follow-up to this is a significant increase in drop rates, not just for temper components, but for all the items for PoP tradeskills. If PoP tradeskill items are to remain reasonably competitive in the OoW era (and yes, I know some folks will argue that they &lt;I&gt;don't&lt;/I&gt; have to stay competitive), they must be much cheaper than they currently are, and this can only happen if supply increases. This means that drop rates must increase, and by a huge margin. A single raid on a mini-boss named in the elemental planes should yield enough supplies for at least one PoP tradeskill item -- note that this implies multiple attempts, given current fail rates. An elemental god raid should see enough drops for 2-3 finished items.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;New information, Added 2/4/05:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Well they decreased the number of tempers and ammount of metal needed. Great. Now unfortunately less people seem to be in PoP so for those of us lesser mortals without EP flags its just as hard to get this stuf made as before. Although Magnetic&amp;nbsp;did alot of damage to this market anyway, some drop rate increase might help here.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;10) Difficulty in skill up paths to 300 &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;New item, added with the 3/4/05&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;The tradeskill caps have been raised to 300 for all the tradeskills. However, the skill up paths are very difficult to non-existent for some of them. Now, from Maddoc's post on EQ Traders, it would seem that he has plans to address the skill up paths for all the trades:&amp;nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;MADDOC WROTE: &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;"Without going too deeply into specifics quite yet, what this means to you is a much more smooth skill-progression for all skills . . . In some cases, this may mean that trivial of any given recipe will be increased or decreased, to help fill in the some areas of need.&amp;nbsp; Overall, the changes will greatly benefit the tailors (and other tradeskillers, of course) in the form of a smoother progression across the board."&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In general, I think everyone would agree that this is a good thing. However, there are some specific issues pertaining to the various trades that still should be mentioned. What better place to start than. . . .&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;10A) Tailoring.&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;BR&gt;Well, there is sure a lot of discussion on tailoring in the TS community today. As Maddoc posted yesterday:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;MADDOC WROTE:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;"Now, as I'm sure you've noticed, some of these changes found their way live, somewhat unexpectedly, and I can understand the frustration at the changes, however... "&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Having mid-to-high level tailoring recipes to bridge the gap has long been desired by the community, even more so now with the change of the skill cap from 250 to 300. However, from Maddoc's post, it seems pretty clear (at least to me) that the trivial change to the Solstace Robes and the Velious tailoring should not have been pushed live until all the other changes that he has in mind (for tailoring) were pushed live as well. If, as Maddoc stated, the push was unintentional, then resetting the trival levels back to their original levels should be done, until all the other changes for tailoring are ready to be pushed live as well. Everything should go simulataneously, or nothing should go at all. This would also allow post 252 tailors to use up the large quantities of components that they had saved up for a large tailoring run.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Since most people stock up on items for a long run of combines, having an unexpected change like this imposes a lot of anger and frustration on the community, especially coming, as it did, a couple weeks after the skill caps were raised. Tailors who were maxed out at 250 went back to farming ingredients to raise their skill to 300. Typically, people would farm one ingredient at a time. They'll spend days getting 100 (in a lot of cases cases several hundred) Arctic Wyvern Hides, and then fishing for that many Cobalt Cods, and then moving on to the velium. Many people were in the middle of gathering the ingredients, and now are left with a large stockpile of ingredients that are worthless to them.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;With regards to the velious tailoring, all the pieces currently trivial at 252. Having an arbitrary level of 252 doesn't make sense for all pieces, because the amount of velium needed is different for different pieces. Previous convention suggested that the more ore (velium in this case) needed, the higher the trivial level for the piece. Therefore, the recipes should either scale more logically based on this, or the velium requirement should be reduced to 1 for all of them. (Speaking of velium, what better way to reduce the mindless farming of velium for these recipes, than to implement the velium weapon to ore conversion, requested in number 1.)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Since the components for Solstice Robes and Velious leathers are, in fact, not common or cheap, the lowered trivials should accompanied by increased drop rates on the Velious leather components (and making the velium easier to gather, as the issue in number 1 requests&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ) and possibly the removal of the most expensive components for the Solstice Robes.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;In addition, because of the trivial changes, there are currently no viable skill up paths to 300.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;10B) Research.&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;BR&gt;The research cap is at 300 now, however, there are currently no recipes that trivial over 227. It would be great if the PoP spells would be researchable now. That would help alleviate two problems. 1) it would give researchers higher skill combines to work on, and 2) it would help bring down the price of 63/64/65 PoP spells, which are rediculously to insanely priced in the bazaar these days. Another suggestion is to allow you to research spells for any INT caster, perhaps everyone getting the same book to do the combines. In addition, adding in recipes to research spells for hybrid spells would seem to make sense as well. INT casters can currently research spells for priests, but not for hybrids.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;In addition to not having the ability to skill up past 227, researchers do not have a tradeskill trophy. Since research is being treated as a regular tradeskill, it would only make sense that there was a trophy as well.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;10C) Fletching.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;The skill up path for non-wood elf or non-Karana worshiping PCs is very difficult past 282. Fletching components in OoW and DoN do not drop frequently enough to make them a viable skill up path. Making PoP bows is also not a viable skill up path, because of the rarity/price of components.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;10D) Alchemy.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;Many of the alchemy recipes above 250 require a foraged item, however, shaman don't seem to forage as well as some other classes.&amp;nbsp; Could we get some higher skill recipes that do not use foraged items to use when skilling up?&lt;SPAN class=time_text&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Tradeskill - (Part 2)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;7) Reduce the amount of storage necessary &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Partially implemented with the 6/29/05 patch&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Suggestions for tradeskill tools:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;1) A super-expensive geerlok that modifies ALL trade skills&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;II) Add common tradeskill tools to the key chain (or toolbelt) the first time they're used&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;C) Advanced collapsed containers (Summon the expanded tradeskill container filled with a set of tools for the trade)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Additional information with the 7/3/05 update.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;4) &lt;I&gt;Selectively&lt;/I&gt; increase the stack sizes for other items, such as:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;OL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Celestial Essence - used in many different tradeskills, in vast quantities, increasing the stack size to 200 would not be amiss. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Gems (Blue Diamonds, Diamonds, etc) &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;other? spider(ling) silks and threads / swatches, perhaps? &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;In addition, it would make it much easier to collect PoP bow ingredients if the staves would stack. One bow staff takes a full slot which hinders us to pick them up and save since tradeskillers usually are serious packrats&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;MADDOC WROTE - 12/2/05: This is something that's on our list of things to review and is partially the reason we got the stackability changes made to begin with.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Making this adjustment for ammo was a relatively easy and painless change. Items that are used as source-items in tradeskills are not as straight forward, so we'll need to look at them on an item by item (and likely on a skill by skill) basis. It's not an overly difficult thing to do, it just takes a little time. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;8) Difficulty in skill up paths to 300 -&amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The tradeskill caps have been raised to 300 for all the tradeskills. However, the skill up paths are very difficult to non-existent for some of them. Now, from Maddoc's post on EQ Traders, it would seem that he has plans to address the skill up paths for all the trades:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;MADDOC WROTE:&amp;nbsp; "Without going too deeply into specifics quite yet, what this means to you is a much more smooth skill-progression for all skills . . . In some cases, this may mean that trivial of any given recipe will be increased or decreased, to help fill in the some areas of need.&amp;nbsp; Overall, the changes will greatly benefit the tailors (and other tradeskillers, of course) in the form of a smoother progression across the board." &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;In general, I think everyone would agree that this is a good thing. However, there are some specific issues pertaining to the various trades that still should be mentioned. What better place to start than. . . .&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;8A) Tailoring. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Well, there is sure a lot of discussion on tailoring in the TS community today. As Maddoc posted yesterday:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;MADDOC WROTE: "Now, as I'm sure you've noticed, some of these changes found their way live, somewhat unexpectedly, and I can understand the frustration at the changes, however... "&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Having mid-to-high level tailoring recipes to bridge the gap has long been desired by the community, even more so now with the change of the skill cap from 250 to 300. However, from Maddoc's post, it seems pretty clear (at least to me) that the trivial change to the Solstace Robes and the Velious tailoring should not have been pushed live until all the other changes that he has in mind (for tailoring) were pushed live as well. If, as Maddoc stated, the push was unintentional, then resetting the trival levels back to their original levels should be done, until all the other changes for tailoring are ready to be pushed live as well. Everything should go simulataneously, or nothing should go at all. This would also allow post 252 tailors to use up the large quantities of components that they had saved up for a large tailoring run.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Since most people stock up on items for a long run of combines, having an unexpected change like this imposes a lot of anger and frustration on the community, especially coming, as it did, a couple weeks after the skill caps were raised. Tailors who were maxed out at 250 went back to farming ingredients to raise their skill to 300. Typically, people would farm one ingredient at a time. They'll spend days getting 100 (or more) Arctic Wyvern Hides, and then fishing for that many Cobalt Cods, and then moving on to the velium. Many people were in the middle of gathering the ingredients, and now are left with a large stockpile of ingredients that are worthless to them.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;With regards to the velious tailoring, all the pieces currently trivial at 252. Having an arbitrary level of 252 doesn't make sense for all pieces, because the amount of velium needed is different for different pieces. Previous convention suggested that the more ore (velium in this case) needed, the higher the trivial level for the piece. Therefore, the recipes should either scale more logically based on this, or the velium requirement should be reduced to 1 for all of them. (Speaking of velium, what better way to reduce the mindless farming of velium for these recipes, than to implement the velium weapon to ore conversion, requested in number 1.)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Since the components for Solstice Robes and Velious leathers are, in fact, not common or cheap, the lowered trivials should accompanied by increased drop rates on the Velious leather components (and making the velium easier to gather, as the issue in number 1 requests&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ) and possibly the removal of the most expensive components for the Solstice Robes.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;In addition, because of the trivial changes, there are currently no viable skill up paths to 300.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;8B) Research.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The research cap is at 300 now, however, there are currently no recipes that trivial over 227. Higher level recipes are needed (such as PoP spells) so that researchers can skill up to 300.&amp;nbsp; Creating recipes to make PoP spells would help alleviate two problems. 1) it would give researchers higher skill combines to work on, and 2) it would help bring down the price of 63/64/65 PoP spells, which are rediculously to insanely priced in the bazaar these days.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Another suggestion is to allow you to research spells for any INT caster, perhaps everyone getting the same book to do the combines. In addition, adding in recipes to research spells for hybrid spells would seem to make sense as well. INT casters can currently research spells for priests, but not for hybrids.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;In addition to not having the ability to skill up past 227, researchers do not have a tradeskill trophy. Since research is being treated as a regular tradeskill, it would only make sense that there was a trophy as well.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;From November 2005 Halfling Hodgepodge Extreme (reply by Maddoc):&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;One of the things that we've been discussing lately has been the possibility of extending the current line of trophies to be tiered, instead of just one trophy at 250 skill. The benefits of this would allow us to upgrade the trophies if / when we increase the tradeskill caps again, as well as reward those who have attained the higher skills with more stats and bigger modifiers. This extension would also include adding trophies for the skills that do not currently have any. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;8C) Fletching.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The skill up path for non-wood elf or non-Karana worshiping PCs is very difficult past 282. Fletching components in OoW and DoN do not drop frequently enough to make them a viable skill up path. Making PoP bows is also not a viable skill up path, because of the rarity/price of components.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;From November 2005 Halfling Hodgepodge Extreme (reply by Maddoc):&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;We have several ideas on how to extend fletching beyond its current usefulness and limitations -- This includes adding additional means to obtain 300 skill for everyone, as well as adjusting the recipes which make it far too easy for certain races and / or classes to raise their skill. Without delving too deeply into thedetails, expect some changes in the near future (January / February timeframe). &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;8D) Alchemy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Many of the alchemy recipes above 250 require a foraged item, however, shaman don't seem to forage as well as some other classes.&amp;nbsp; Could we get some higher skill recipes that do not use foraged items to use when skilling up?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;From November 2005 Halfling Hodgepodge Extreme (reply by Maddoc):&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Foraging is a beneficial skill that gives us a means of creating specific recipes aimed at a smaller section of the tradeskill community, however... It also should not be the gating factor for gaining skill points in any one specific tradeskill.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In many cases, the items that can be obtained via foraging are also able to be obtained via other means. This is a trend we plan on continuing as we move forward with as we introduce more recipes into the game. In the situations where a skill-up recipe does use foraged items, we'll make sure there's an equivalent recipe that uses a dropped counterpart. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;9) Tradeskill Super-trophy - &lt;FONT color=red&gt;New item (sort of) with the 8/5/2005 Update&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Could we get some kind of super trophy for multi-tradeskill GM's? Here are some ideas on what could be done in this vein.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A tradeskill super-trophy is defined as a trophy you can only obtain once you have all seven tradeskill trophies (excluding alchemy, poison making, tinkering, and research), or one that requires 300 in all seven general tradeskills, or both.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;One possibility is a combine that requires all seven trophies plus some other item, yielding back six normal trophies and one super-trophy with increased stats or abilities.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Another option is for a no-fail combine of all seven trophies in a quest container to yield the super-trophy.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Consensus seems to be that the super-trophy should give a skill bonus for all tradeskills. This is the preferred option. However, the developers have indicated that this may take a disproportionate amount of time to implement. An alterative would be to make the super-trophy with no tradeskill modifiers at all. A player would combine the super-trophy alone in a forge and it would return the super-trophy and a no-drop, no-rent, lore item with a bonus to smithing; it could be combined in a tailoring kit or loom to yield a tailoring-boosting item, and so on.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Another popular option is to have the super-trophy give a 10% bonus to tradeskills. A single item that has +10% to all tradeskills would be superb; alternately, each of the no-drop, no-rent, lore items discussed above could have the 10% mod.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Could the existing tradeskill trophies be adjusted so that each yields a unique 100% WR bag? Thus, a person with three trophys could get three different 100% WR bags that don't poof on logging. This was mentioned as being possible in the past.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Other than that, a Gnomish Army Knife was suggested in another thread. The only differences are:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;1. A super-trophy is made from trophies in a no fail combine. A GAK is made from Geerloks in a high-trivial combine.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;2. A GAK would be rare like a super-trophy, but tradable, at a high price.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;3. A super-trophy would have STATS like the existing trophies. A GAK would be a pure skill mod, like existing Geerloks.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The purpose here is conserving bankspace by reducing the number of geerloks you need to keep on hand.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;10) Increase Bank Space. - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;New Item 12/2/05&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Tradeskillers are notorious pack rats.&amp;nbsp; They save anything and everything that has a tradeskill tag on it.&amp;nbsp; The result is that we often have several characters with banks full of tradeskill ingredients.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Never mind more than one tradeskill. If you want to do cultural armors, you essentially need to dedicate about five bank slots purely for patterns and components (like the books, hammers, or needles). If you're doing both smithed and tailored armors, that makes six bank slots. Add in one more bank slot for components (which is a VERY low estimate) and that's seven bank slots, just for one single class of combines!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The trend now seems to be item-based keys -- if you have Item X in your bank or inventory, you can enter Zone Y. This means the high end raider will have maybe a bagful of such items. Quests are also based on long collect-and-hand-in type things; for example, Bellfast's quest for melee requires you to collect and hand in ten different mechanoinstruction scraps that don't stack, in addition to other stuff. Epic 1.5 and 2.0 quests are full of no-drop two-slot containers that you can't get back if you destroy.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The upshot of all this is that bank space is being crunched even worse than it was in the PoP era. LoY added eight bank slots to help reduce that crunch. My advice to reduce bank space needs is as follows:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;1) Add another eight bank slots. This is essential to deal with no-drop items like cultural armor and augment patterns.&lt;BR&gt;2) Ensure that all quests that give out a container also provide some way to store it or get it back. Either make the containers tokenizable or collapsible; or else ensure that once you get a container, you can destroy it and get another one back by hailing the NPC that gave it to you. Another alternative is to have quest NPC's give out a non-container item with instructions to hand that item back to them to get the appropriate container.&lt;BR&gt;3) Ensure that all key items go on the key ring or provide a flag, so that you may destroy the key item once you have it.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN class=time_text&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;The ogres are mounting a revolt, because of the request for more halfling pie recipes and tinkered mounts.&amp;nbsp; They feel that the larger races are being slighted by these requests and have asked that more&amp;nbsp;recipes using halflings as ingredients be added, and in addition more gnome punting contests be arranged.&lt;STRONG&gt; &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;IMG height=16 src="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-tongue.gif" width=16 border=0&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1) Rotating stock on vendors &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;C&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;urrently being evaulated or "Under Review" in Tanker's words&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;A while back&amp;nbsp;the number of slots on a vendor was reduced from 100 (of which 20 were "under the counter") to 80. This took away the ability of players to "vendor mine" which served as both a plat sink and a way to increase the flow of usable items (particularly tradeskill supplies).&amp;nbsp; Are there any alternative ways planned to help tradeskiller find rare items on vendors? For example, it's often been suggested that when selling an item to a "full" vendor, it shouldn't automatically disappear. Rather, the oldest player-sold item would poof and the item being sold would appear at the top of the list. This would allow vendors to keep a "rotating stock" of player-sold items.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;BR&gt;UPDATE FROM TANKER (thanks Tanker):About a month ago, I spent some time looking into this, and discovered a few gotcha's in the Merchant code that make this more than a one-day project. In talking about it with my lead, it was decided that the solutions to these problems were both too time-consuming for right now, and contained side-effects that would need full review before this was done. An optimist would place this issue as "Under review", but under no circumstances would I look for this Soon(TM). However, without going into ANY specifics, I wouldn't be surprised by an alternative method of gathering supplies coming up in the future... don't ask.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;New question 6/3/05: Tanker indicated that it was difficult to do.&amp;nbsp; However, there have been recent changes to the merchants UI.&amp;nbsp; Have these changes made this a more feasable possibility now?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=661420023-03062005&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Tanker: Since&amp;nbsp;the new Merchant window went in, I have not had time to look into whether the new layout alleviates any of the problems I saw when looking at this earlier, though&amp;nbsp;my memory of these issues is that the list view of the new merchant window may help.&amp;nbsp; Given the new&amp;nbsp;window is not sorted by&amp;nbsp;"time first&amp;nbsp;of this item was sold to this merchant" anymore, though, a new player (or any player) would have difficulty determining which item would disappear/just disappeared from the list when he sold&amp;nbsp;that new item to the merchant.&amp;nbsp;This idea could probably use a fresh look at it's feasibility, "Under Review" could now more appropriately describe the state of this feature.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2) Nitram Anizok's plight&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Tinkerers are concerned about the ability to get to Nitram in Innovation, as he is the only vendor for certain non-stacking tinkering supplies. The problem is due to both see-invis mobs along the path to reach him, and the fact that he is also used for a quest (Xanamech).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Any thoughts on the suggestions on how to implement?&amp;nbsp; Is this a possiblity with the changes to the trivial levels that are coming SOON (tm)??&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN class=292541702-11112004&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;UPDATE FROM MADDOC 12/2/05: This is something that was mentioned at the last Fan Faire and had somehow slipped my mind. Nitram will now be a more mobile, making some supply trips to various junk piles closer to the zone-in area, which will make him a lot more accessible than he is currently. This should be pushed out to all live servers in the next scheduled update. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;3) New Bag Designs &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;NEW item added with the 2/4/05 update&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;New bag designs and/or ability to DYE bags. I'm bored of the same old graphics, plus it would help to manage my bank &amp;amp; inventory if I had more variety in the looks. If I could dye them, that would be great...brown is so dated..... I loved the new bag look for the bag that people received as a /claim item (for LoY, I think, Satchel of Abu-Kar) but no other bags have since been given that graphic &lt;SPAN class=292541702-11112004&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;4) Mass Combines With One Click &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;NEW item added with the 6/3/05 update&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Allow mass (bulk) combines (say 5 or 10 at a time) for trivial&amp;nbsp;combines (perhaps restricted based on how trivial, 100 points trivial, 200 points trivial, no-fail only.)&amp;nbsp; Enchanters (and other classes) can already mass enchant/mass imbue 5 at a time.&amp;nbsp; When restricted to very trivial/no fail combines, it's not terribly different, and would not be unbalancing.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN class=time_text&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;5)&amp;nbsp;Tradeskill components are unreasonably rare - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Modified item with 8/5/2005 update. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;5a. OoW drops - including Lightning Cores, Slugworms, Trean Flies, Discordant Scoriae, etc. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;5b. PoP drops - temper components&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;5c. DoN drops - Another item might be the balance and availability of Master's level DoN drops. I know it has been brought-up before, but they are not equal. Take smithing for example. It would be nice if all drops had at least 2 zones from which they can drop, which are non-keyed/flagged. Any keyed/flagged zones should be only a 3rd option.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I used non-keyed to also mean non-flagged.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;yttrium ore: Drop in multiple zones from multiple mobs. Seems to be sufficienly abundent.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;pile of gravel: drops in 2 non-keyed zones of which I am aware: the hole &amp;amp; PoN. I usually get 0 to 2 in 30 minutes of killing gargs in either zone.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;midnight stones: drop in 1 non-keyed zone, from multiple mobs. Usually end up with 0 to 1 in 30 minutes of killing in the garg area (nightstalker drop rate has been painfully bad for me). I think I've gotten one from hobgoblins but I can't remember (only done them once for my xp buff)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;great reptile tooth: supposedly drop in 1 non-keyed zone and 1 keyed zone: PoN &amp;amp; PoEarth. (never even seen one drop but I'm going off of posts). Someone who has more knowledge of this drop please post.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Other rare DoN Cultural components: Storm Volaas Hair, used in High Elven Master Tailoring. Drops off two MoB types in one Zone.&amp;nbsp; Great Reptile Hides&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;5d. Research components that are extremely rare. Here's a link to a spreadsheet that has a listing of most of the rare components: &lt;A href="http://www.geocities.com/arrdour/rarecomponents.xls" target=_blank&gt;&lt;FONT color=#fac400&gt;http://www.geocities.com/arrdour/rarecomponents.xls&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Another problem is the items who is used for diffrent spells.&amp;nbsp; Take words of virtue for example. It is very rare and is used for rare spells (such as Transon's Elemental Renewal) but its also a component in alot of very common spells, that will never get researched, since none will ever waste words of virtue on them.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If posible remove the rare words from common spells and replace them with common research items that will provide a way to skill up.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN class=time_text&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;6) Balancing the Grand Robe / Grand Tunic / Phylactery quest for melees&amp;nbsp; &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Maddoc said he would look at adding an alternate reward for melees who wish to do this quest, since they cannot use the Grand Robe/Tunic. Discussions included either adding a new reward for melees or making the Token of Service tradable.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;This is probably something that's very easy to do, and again one of the easiest things to do which will get done before any of the others.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;6A) Ghoul of Takish-Iz broken, very frustrating!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;This is very much related so I have combined it in the same item. - The Ghoul is an insanely rare spawn, and almost impossible for a non-tracker to catch without using tools-that-shall-not-be-mentioned. In addition, even when he does spawn and is caught, his drop is way too rare.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;"I have killed the Ghoul of Takish-Iz more than 30 times in the last 2 months - he is supposed to drop the last piece I need for the phylactery quest - the spiritual anchor. I know for a fact as recently as late April/early May he was still dropping the anchor. By all accounts the Anchor is a 1/4 to 1/5 drop so the odds of me not getting one in 30 kills are bordering on impossible .... in an ongoing discussion on EQtraders, if you factor in two other player's experiences in the last month we have killed the Ghoul 41 times with 0 drops. The amount of time I have spent on this quest now vastly exceeds the amount of time it took me to get my epic or do anything else ever in this game - hundreds of hours, at least a hundred just on the ghoul..... somethin' ain't right about that."&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Tradeskill Top 10 Issues&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1) Rotating stock on vendors&lt;BR&gt;2) Nitram Anizok's plight&lt;BR&gt;3) New Bag Designs&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;NEW item added with the 2/4/05 update&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;4) Mass Combines With One Click - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;NEW item added with the 6/3/05 update&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;5)&amp;nbsp;Tradeskill components are unreasonably rare - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Item modifed&amp;nbsp;with the 8/5/05 update&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;6) Balancing the Grand Robe / Grand Tunic / Phylactery quest for melees&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;7) Reduce the amount of storage necessary - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Partially Implemented with the 6/29/05 Patch - New Information with 7/3/05&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;8) Difficulty in skill up paths to 300&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;NEW item added with the 3/4/05 update&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;9) Tradeskill Super-trophy - &lt;FONT color=red&gt;New item (sort of) with the 8/4/2005 Update&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;10) Stackability of various tradeskill components - &lt;FONT color=red&gt;New item with the 8/5/2005 Update&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1) Rotating stock on vendors &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;C&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;urrently being evaulated or "Under Review" in Tanker's words&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;A while back&amp;nbsp;the number of slots on a vendor was reduced from 100 (of which 20 were "under the counter") to 80. This took away the ability of players to "vendor mine" which served as both a plat sink and a way to increase the flow of usable items (particularly tradeskill supplies).&amp;nbsp; Are there any alternative ways planned to help tradeskiller find rare items on vendors? For example, it's often been suggested that when selling an item to a "full" vendor, it shouldn't automatically disappear. Rather, the oldest player-sold item would poof and the item being sold would appear at the top of the list. This would allow vendors to keep a "rotating stock" of player-sold items.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;UPDATE FROM TANKER&lt;/STRONG&gt; (thanks Tanker):About a month ago, I spent some time looking into this, and discovered a few gotcha's in the Merchant code that make this more than a one-day project. In talking about it with my lead, it was decided that the solutions to these problems were both too time-consuming for right now, and contained side-effects that would need full review before this was done. An optimist would place this issue as "Under review", but under no circumstances would I look for this Soon(TM). However, without going into ANY specifics, I wouldn't be surprised by an alternative method of gathering supplies coming up in the future... don't ask.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;New question 6/3/05:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Tanker indicated that it was difficult to do.&amp;nbsp; However, there have been recent changes to the merchants UI.&amp;nbsp; Have these changes made this a more feasable possibility now?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=661420023-03062005&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Tanker&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Since&amp;nbsp;the new Merchant window went in, I have not had time to look into whether the new layout alleviates any of the problems I saw when looking at this earlier, though&amp;nbsp;my memory of these issues is that the list view of the new merchant window may help.&amp;nbsp; Given the new&amp;nbsp;window is not sorted by&amp;nbsp;"time first&amp;nbsp;of this item was sold to this merchant" anymore, though, a new player (or any player) would have difficulty determining which item would disappear/just disappeared from the list when he sold&amp;nbsp;that new item to the merchant.&amp;nbsp;This idea could probably use a fresh look at it's feasibility, "Under Review" could now more appropriately describe the state of this feature.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2) Nitram Anizok's plight&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Tinkerers are concerned about the ability to get to Nitram in Innovation, as he is the only vendor for certain non-stacking tinkering supplies. The problem is due to both see-invis mobs along the path to reach him, and the fact that he is also used for a quest (Xanamech).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Any thoughts on the suggestions on how to implement?&amp;nbsp; Is this a possiblity with the changes to the trivial levels that are coming SOON (tm)??&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Possible Suggestions on how to&amp;nbsp;implement this &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;NEW&amp;nbsp;added with the 11/19/04 update&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Suggestion 1:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Alternative to moving Nitram, consider putting in some sort of teleport to and from Nitram. Have the port only work for one person per 6 hours game time (about 15 minutes real time). That’s enough to give tradeskillers easy access to Nitram without breaking any quests or interfering with Nitram’s role in the Xanamech quest/raid.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Suggestion 2:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Another proposed alternative is to create a new vendor in Abysmal Sea, with the same inventory as Nitram Anizok in PoI. To make it interesting you could increase his Greed modifier to make the items slighty more expensive than buying from Nitram. If players want the items cheaper, they have to brave PoI to buy from Nitram. The storyline would be that Tramin Anizok (Nitram's cousin) has recently set up an import/export business in Abysmal Sea, importing parts from his cousin in the Planes. He sells all of the parts needed for the Anizok family recipes, although at a markup due to the dangers of exporting the raw materials.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Suggestion 3:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Another possible solution would be to leave poor Niltram alone, but either add a new NPC in the tower with the PoI zone in or make the ogre there a merchant that has the same inventory.&amp;nbsp; As with suggestion 2, the components would be more expensive if you bought them here, than if you fought your way to Niltram and bought them from him.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN class=292541702-11112004&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial color=#ff0000&gt;This is something&amp;nbsp;that we&amp;nbsp;need to investigate a bit, to make sure I'm not trivializing any &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=292541702-11112004&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial color=#ff0000&gt;combines or breaking any quests / events by moving him.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;3) New Bag Designs &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;NEW item added with the 2/4/05 update&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;New bag designs and/or ability to DYE bags. I'm bored of the same old graphics, plus it would help to manage my bank &amp;amp; inventory if I had more variety in the looks. If I could dye them, that would be great...brown is so dated..... I loved the new bag look for the bag that people received as a /claim item (for LoY, I think, Satchel of Abu-Kar) but no other bags have since been given that graphic &lt;SPAN class=292541702-11112004&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;4) Mass Combines With One Click &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;NEW item added with the 6/3/05 update&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Allow mass (bulk) combines (say 5 or 10 at a time) for trivial&amp;nbsp;combines (perhaps restricted based on how trivial, 100 points trivial, 200 points trivial, no-fail only.)&amp;nbsp; Enchanters (and other classes) can already mass enchant/mass imbue 5 at a time.&amp;nbsp; When restricted to very trivial/no fail combines, it's not terribly different, and would not be unbalancing.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN class=time_text&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN class=time_text&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;5)&amp;nbsp;Tradeskill components are unreasonably rare - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Modified item with 8/5/2005 update. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;5a. OoW drops - including Lightning Cores, Slugworms, Trean Flies, Discordant Scoriae, etc. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;5b. PoP drops - temper components&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;5c. DoN drops - Another item might be the balance and availability of Master's level DoN drops. I know it has been brought-up before, but they are not equal. Take smithing for example. It would be nice if all drops had at least 2 zones from which they can drop, which are non-keyed/flagged. Any keyed/flagged zones should be only a 3rd option.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I used non-keyed to also mean non-flagged.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;yttrium ore: Drop in multiple zones from multiple mobs. Seems to be sufficienly abundent.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;pile of gravel: drops in 2 non-keyed zones of which I am aware: the hole &amp;amp; PoN. I usually get 0 to 2 in 30 minutes of killing gargs in either zone.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;midnight stones: drop in 1 non-keyed zone, from multiple mobs. Usually end up with 0 to 1 in 30 minutes of killing in the garg area (nightstalker drop rate has been painfully bad for me). I think I've gotten one from hobgoblins but I can't remember (only done them once for my xp buff)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;great reptile tooth: supposedly drop in 1 non-keyed zone and 1 keyed zone: PoN &amp;amp; PoEarth.

&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;6) Balancing the Grand Robe / Grand Tunic / Phylactery quest for melees&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;7) Reduce the amount of storage necessary&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Partially implemented with the 6/29/05 patch&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Suggestions for tradeskill tools:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;1) A super-expensive geerlok that modifies ALL trade skills&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;II) Add common tradeskill tools to the key chain (or toolbelt) the first time they're used&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;C) Advanced collapsed containers (Summon the expanded tradeskill container filled with a set of tools for the trade)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Additional information with the 7/3/05 update.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;4) &lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;Selectively&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; increase the stack sizes for other items, such as:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;OL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Celestial Essence - used in many different tradeskills, in vast quantities, increasing the stack size to 200 would not be amiss. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Gems (Blue Diamonds, Diamonds, etc) &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;other? spider(ling) silks and threads / swatches, perhaps? &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;8) Difficulty in skill up paths to 300 -&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The tradeskill caps have been raised to 300 for all the tradeskills. However, the skill up paths are very difficult to non-existent for some of them. Now, from Maddoc's post on EQ Traders, it would seem that he has plans to address the skill up paths for all the trades:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;MADDOC WROTE&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&amp;nbsp; "Without going too deeply into specifics quite yet, what this means to you is a much more smooth skill-progression for all skills . . . In some cases, this may mean that trivial of any given recipe will be increased or decreased, to help fill in the some areas of need.&amp;nbsp; Overall, the changes will greatly benefit the tailors (and other tradeskillers, of course) in the form of a smoother progression across the board." &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;In general, I think everyone would agree that this is a good thing. However, there are some specific issues pertaining to the various trades that still should be mentioned. What better place to start than. . . .&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;8A) Tailoring. &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Well, there is sure a lot of discussion on tailoring in the TS community today. As Maddoc posted yesterday:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;MADDOC WROTE:&lt;/STRONG&gt; "Now, as I'm sure you've noticed, some of these changes found their way live, somewhat unexpectedly, and I can understand the frustration at the changes, however... "&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Having mid-to-high level tailoring recipes to bridge the gap has long been desired by the community, even more so now with the change of the skill cap from 250 to 300. However, from Maddoc's post, it seems pretty clear (at least to me) that the trivial change to the Solstace Robes and the Velious tailoring should not have been pushed live until all the other changes that he has in mind (for tailoring) were pushed live as well. If, as Maddoc stated, the push was unintentional, then resetting the trival levels back to their original levels should be done, until all the other changes for tailoring are ready to be pushed live as well. Everything should go simulataneously, or nothing should go at all. This would also allow post 252 tailors to use up the large quantities of components that they had saved up for a large tailoring run.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Since most people stock up on items for a long run of combines, having an unexpected change like this imposes a lot of anger and frustration on the community, especially coming, as it did, a couple weeks after the skill caps were raised. Tailors who were maxed out at 250 went back to farming ingredients to raise their skill to 300. Typically, people would farm one ingredient at a time. They'll spend days getting 100 (or more) Arctic Wyvern Hides, and then fishing for that many Cobalt Cods, and then moving on to the velium. Many people were in the middle of gathering the ingredients, and now are left with a large stockpile of ingredients that are worthless to them.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;With regards to the velious tailoring, all the pieces currently trivial at 252. Having an arbitrary level of 252 doesn't make sense for all pieces, because the amount of velium needed is different for different pieces. Previous convention suggested that the more ore (velium in this case) needed, the higher the trivial level for the piece. Therefore, the recipes should either scale more logically based on this, or the velium requirement should be reduced to 1 for all of them. (Speaking of velium, what better way to reduce the mindless farming of velium for these recipes, than to implement the velium weapon to ore conversion, requested in number 1.)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Since the components for Solstice Robes and Velious leathers are, in fact, not common or cheap, the lowered trivials should accompanied by increased drop rates on the Velious leather components (and making the velium easier to gather, as the issue in number 1 requests&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ) and possibly the removal of the most expensive components for the Solstice Robes.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;In addition, because of the trivial changes, there are currently no viable skill up paths to 300.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;8B) Research.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The research cap is at 300 now, however, there are currently no recipes that trivial over 227. Higher level recipes are needed (such as PoP spells) so that researchers can skill up to 300.&amp;nbsp; Creating recipes to make PoP spells would help alleviate two problems. 1) it would give researchers higher skill combines to work on, and 2) it would help bring down the price of 63/64/65 PoP spells, which are rediculously to insanely priced in the bazaar these days.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Another suggestion is to allow you to research spells for any INT caster, perhaps everyone getting the same book to do the combines. In addition, adding in recipes to research spells for hybrid spells would seem to make sense as well. INT casters can currently research spells for priests, but not for hybrids.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;In addition to not having the ability to skill up past 227, researchers do not have a tradeskill trophy. Since research is being treated as a regular tradeskill, it would only make sense that there was a trophy as well.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;8C) Fletching.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The skill up path for non-wood elf or non-Karana worshiping PCs is very difficult past 282. Fletching components in OoW and DoN do not drop frequently enough to make them a viable skill up path. Making PoP bows is also not a viable skill up path, because of the rarity/price of components.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;8D) Alchemy.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Many of the alchemy recipes above 250 require a foraged item, however, shaman don't seem to forage as well as some other classes.&amp;nbsp; Could we get some higher skill recipes that do not use foraged items to use when skilling up?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;9) Tradeskill Super-trophy - &lt;FONT color=red&gt;New item (sort of) with the 8/5/2005 Update&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Could we get some kind of super trophy for multi-tradeskill GM's? Here are some ideas on what could be done in this vein.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A tradeskill super-trophy is defined as a trophy you can only obtain once you have all seven tradeskill trophies (excluding alchemy, poison making, tinkering, and research), or one that requires 300 in all seven general tradeskills, or both.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;One possibility is a combine that requires all seven trophies plus some other item, yielding back six normal trophies and one super-trophy with increased stats or abilities.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Another option is for a no-fail combine of all seven trophies in a quest container to yield the super-trophy. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Consensus seems to be that the super-trophy should give a skill bonus for all tradeskills. This is the preferred option. However, the developers have indicated that this may take a disproportionate amount of time to implement. An alterative would be to make the super-trophy with no tradeskill modifiers at all. A player would combine the super-trophy alone in a forge and it would return the super-trophy and a no-drop, no-rent, lore item with a bonus to smithing; it could be combined in a tailoring kit or loom to yield a tailoring-boosting item, and so on.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Another popular option is to have the super-trophy give a 10% bonus to tradeskills. A single item that has +10% to all tradeskills would be superb; alternately, each of the no-drop, no-rent, lore items discussed above could have the 10% mod.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Could the existing tradeskill trophies be adjusted so that each yields a unique 100% WR bag? Thus, a person with three trophys could get three different 100% WR bags that don't poof on logging. This was mentioned as being possible in the past.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Other than that, a Gnomish Army Knife was suggested in another thread. The only differences are:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;1. A super-trophy is made from trophies in a no fail combine. A GAK is made from Geerloks in a high-trivial combine.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;2. A GAK would be rare like a super-trophy, but tradable, at a high price.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;3. A super-trophy would have STATS like the existing trophies. A GAK would be a pure skill mod, like existing Geerloks.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The purpose here is conserving bankspace by reducing the number of geerloks you need to keep on hand.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;10) Stackability of various tradeskill components - &lt;FONT color=red&gt;New item with the 8/5/2005 Update&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It would REALLY be nice if the enchanted large bricks stacked like the unenchanted do .... Enchanted Large Bricks of Steel don't stack either, yet the Large Brick of High Quality Ore do.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In addition, it would make it much easier to collect PoP bow ingredients if the staves would stack. One bow staff takes a full slot which hinders us to pick them up and save since tradeskillers usually are serious packrats.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Make spell scrolls stacakable, if possible.&amp;nbsp; This would make guild bankers VERY happy!!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN class=time_text&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;The ogres are mounting a revolt, because of the request for more halfling pie recipes and tinkered mounts.&amp;nbsp; They feel that the larger races are being slighted by these requests and have asked that more&amp;nbsp;recipes using halflings as ingredients be added, and in addition more gnome punting contests be arranged. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;IMG height=16 src="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-tongue.gif" width=16 border=0&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Tradeskill Top 10 Issues&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1) Rotating stock on vendors&lt;BR&gt;2) Nitram Anizok's plight&lt;BR&gt;3) New Bag Designs&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;NEW item added with the 2/4/05 update&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;4) Mass Combines With One Click - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;NEW item added with the 6/3/05 update&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;5)&amp;nbsp;Tradeskill components are unreasonably rare - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Item modifed&amp;nbsp;with the 8/5/05 update&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;6) Balancing the Grand Robe / Grand Tunic / Phylactery quest for melees&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;7) Reduce the amount of storage necessary - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Partially Implemented with the 6/29/05 Patch - New Information with 7/3/05&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;8) Difficulty in skill up paths to 300&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;NEW item added with the 3/4/05 update&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;9) Tradeskill Super-trophy - &lt;FONT color=red&gt;New item (sort of) with the 8/4/2005 Update&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;10) Stackability of various tradeskill components - &lt;FONT color=red&gt;New item with the 8/5/2005 Update&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1) Rotating stock on vendors &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;C&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;urrently being evaulated or "Under Review" in Tanker's words&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;A while back&amp;nbsp;the number of slots on a vendor was reduced from 100 (of which 20 were "under the counter") to 80. This took away the ability of players to "vendor mine" which served as both a plat sink and a way to increase the flow of usable items (particularly tradeskill supplies).&amp;nbsp; Are there any alternative ways planned to help tradeskiller find rare items on vendors? For example, it's often been suggested that when selling an item to a "full" vendor, it shouldn't automatically disappear. Rather, the oldest player-sold item would poof and the item being sold would appear at the top of the list. This would allow vendors to keep a "rotating stock" of player-sold items.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;UPDATE FROM TANKER&lt;/STRONG&gt; (thanks Tanker):About a month ago, I spent some time looking into this, and discovered a few gotcha's in the Merchant code that make this more than a one-day project. In talking about it with my lead, it was decided that the solutions to these problems were both too time-consuming for right now, and contained side-effects that would need full review before this was done. An optimist would place this issue as "Under review", but under no circumstances would I look for this Soon(TM). However, without going into ANY specifics, I wouldn't be surprised by an alternative method of gathering supplies coming up in the future... don't ask.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;New question 6/3/05:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Tanker indicated that it was difficult to do.&amp;nbsp; However, there have been recent changes to the merchants UI.&amp;nbsp; Have these changes made this a more feasable possibility now?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=661420023-03062005&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Tanker&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Since&amp;nbsp;the new Merchant window went in, I have not had time to look into whether the new layout alleviates any of the problems I saw when looking at this earlier, though&amp;nbsp;my memory of these issues is that the list view of the new merchant window may help.&amp;nbsp; Given the new&amp;nbsp;window is not sorted by&amp;nbsp;"time first&amp;nbsp;of this item was sold to this merchant" anymore, though, a new player (or any player) would have difficulty determining which item would disappear/just disappeared from the list when he sold&amp;nbsp;that new item to the merchant.&amp;nbsp;This idea could probably use a fresh look at it's feasibility, "Under Review" could now more appropriately describe the state of this feature.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2) Nitram Anizok's plight&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Tinkerers are concerned about the ability to get to Nitram in Innovation, as he is the only vendor for certain non-stacking tinkering supplies. The problem is due to both see-invis mobs along the path to reach him, and the fact that he is also used for a quest (Xanamech).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Any thoughts on the suggestions on how to implement?&amp;nbsp; Is this a possiblity with the changes to the trivial levels that are coming SOON (tm)??&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Possible Suggestions on how to&amp;nbsp;implement this &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;NEW&amp;nbsp;added with the 11/19/04 update&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Suggestion 1:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Alternative to moving Nitram, consider putting in some sort of teleport to and from Nitram. Have the port only work for one person per 6 hours game time (about 15 minutes real time). That’s enough to give tradeskillers easy access to Nitram without breaking any quests or interfering with Nitram’s role in the Xanamech quest/raid.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Suggestion 2:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Another proposed alternative is to create a new vendor in Abysmal Sea, with the same inventory as Nitram Anizok in PoI. To make it interesting you could increase his Greed modifier to make the items slighty more expensive than buying from Nitram. If players want the items cheaper, they have to brave PoI to buy from Nitram. The storyline would be that Tramin Anizok (Nitram's cousin) has recently set up an import/export business in Abysmal Sea, importing parts from his cousin in the Planes. He sells all of the parts needed for the Anizok family recipes, although at a markup due to the dangers of exporting the raw materials.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Suggestion 3:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Another possible solution would be to leave poor Niltram alone, but either add a new NPC in the tower with the PoI zone in or make the ogre there a merchant that has the same inventory.&amp;nbsp; As with suggestion 2, the components would be more expensive if you bought them here, than if you fought your way to Niltram and bought them from him.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN class=292541702-11112004&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial color=#ff0000&gt;This is something&amp;nbsp;that we&amp;nbsp;need to investigate a bit, to make sure I'm not trivializing any &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=292541702-11112004&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial color=#ff0000&gt;combines or breaking any quests / events by moving him.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;3) New Bag Designs &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;NEW item added with the 2/4/05 update&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;New bag designs and/or ability to DYE bags. I'm bored of the same old graphics, plus it would help to manage my bank &amp;amp; inventory if I had more variety in the looks. If I could dye them, that would be great...brown is so dated..... I loved the new bag look for the bag that people received as a /claim item (for LoY, I think, Satchel of Abu-Kar) but no other bags have since been given that graphic &lt;SPAN class=292541702-11112004&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV align=left&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV align=left&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;4) Mass Combines With One Click &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;NEW item added with the 6/3/05 update&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV align=left&gt;Allow mass (bulk) combines (say 5 or 10 at a time) for trivial&amp;nbsp;combines (perhaps restricted based on how trivial, 100 points trivial, 200 points trivial, no-fail only.)&amp;nbsp; Enchanters (and other classes) can already mass enchant/mass imbue 5 at a time.&amp;nbsp; When restricted to very trivial/no fail combines, it's not terribly different, and would not be unbalancing.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV align=left&gt;&lt;SPAN class=time_text&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN class=time_text&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV align=left&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;5)&amp;nbsp;Tradeskill components are unreasonably rare - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Modified item with 8/5/2005 update. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV align=left&gt;&lt;BR&gt;5a. OoW drops - including Lightning Cores, Slugworms, Trean Flies, Discordant Scoriae, etc. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;5b. PoP drops - temper components&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;5c. DoN drops - Another item might be the balance and availability of Master's level DoN drops. I know it has been brought-up before, but they are not equal. Take smithing for example. It would be nice if all drops had at least 2 zones from which they can drop, which are non-keyed/flagged. Any keyed/flagged zones should be only a 3rd option.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I used non-keyed to also mean non-flagged.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;yttrium ore: Drop in multiple zones from multiple mobs. Seems to be sufficienly abundent.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;pile of gravel: drops in 2 non-keyed zones of which I am aware: the hole &amp;amp; PoN. I usually get 0 to 2 in 30 minutes of killing gargs in either zone.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;midnight stones: drop in 1 non-keyed zone, from multiple mobs. Usually end up with 0 to 1 in 30 minutes of killing in the garg area (nightstalker drop rate has been painfully bad for me). I think I've gotten one from hobgoblins but I can't remember (only done them once for my xp buff)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;great reptile tooth: supposedly drop in 1 non-keyed zone and 1 keyed zone: PoN &amp;amp; PoEarth. (never even seen one drop but I'm going off of posts). Someone who has more knowledge of this drop please post.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Other rare DoN Cultural components: Storm Volaas Hair, used in High Elven Master Tailoring. Drops off two MoB types in one Zone.&amp;nbsp; Great Reptile Hides&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;5d. Research components that are extremely rare. Here's a link to a spreadsheet that has a listing of most of the rare components: &lt;A href="http://www.geocities.com/arrdour/rarecomponents.xls" target=_blank&gt;&lt;FONT color=#fac400&gt;http://www.geocities.com/arrdour/rarecomponents.xls&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Another problem is the items who is used for diffrent spells.&amp;nbsp; Take words of virtue for example. It is very rare and is used for rare spells (such as Transon's Elemental Renewal) but its also a component in alot of very common spells, that will never get researched, since none will ever waste words of virtue on them.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If posible remove the rare words from common spells and replace them with common research items that will provide a way to skill up.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Ashlanne on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;08-05-2005&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;05:45 PM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff00ff&gt;Tradeskill -&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff00ff&gt;&amp;nbsp;List Update scheduled for&amp;nbsp;08/05/05 (Part 2)- &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=292541702-11112004&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Updates from Maddoc and Tanker are noted under their respective items in red.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;6) Balancing the Grand Robe / Grand Tunic / Phylactery quest for melees&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Maddoc said he would look at adding an alternate reward for melees who wish to do this quest, since they cannot use the Grand Robe/Tunic. Discussions included either adding a new reward for melees or making the Token of Service tradable.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;This is probably something that's very easy to do, and again one of the easiest things to do which will get done before any of the others.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;6A) Ghoul of Takish-Iz broken, very frustrating!&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;This is very much related so I have combined it in the same item. - The Ghoul is an insanely rare spawn, and almost impossible for a non-tracker to catch without using tools-that-shall-not-be-mentioned. In addition, even when he does spawn and is caught, his drop is way too rare.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;"I have killed the Ghoul of Takish-Iz more than 30 times in the last 2 months - he is supposed to drop the last piece I need for the phylactery quest - the spiritual anchor. I know for a fact as recently as late April/early May he was still dropping the anchor. By all accounts the Anchor is a 1/4 to 1/5 drop so the odds of me not getting one in 30 kills are bordering on impossible .... in an ongoing discussion on EQtraders, if you factor in two other player's experiences in the last month we have killed the Ghoul 41 times with 0 drops. The amount of time I have spent on this quest now vastly exceeds the amount of time it took me to get my epic or do anything else ever in this game - hundreds of hours, at least a hundred just on the ghoul..... somethin' ain't right about that."&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;7) Reduce the amount of storage necessary&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Partially implemented with the 6/29/05 patch&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Suggestions for tradeskill tools:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;1) A super-expensive geerlok that modifies ALL trade skills&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;II) Add common tradeskill tools to the key chain (or toolbelt) the first time they're used&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;C) Advanced collapsed containers (Summon the expanded tradeskill container filled with a set of tools for the trade)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Additional information with the 7/3/05 update.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;4) &lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;Selectively&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; increase the stack sizes for other items, such as:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;OL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Celestial Essence - used in many different tradeskills, in vast quantities, increasing the stack size to 200 would not be amiss. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Gems (Blue Diamonds, Diamonds, etc) &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;other? spider(ling) silks and threads / swatches, perhaps? &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;8) Difficulty in skill up paths to 300 -&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The tradeskill caps have been raised to 300 for all the tradeskills. However, the skill up paths are very difficult to non-existent for some of them. Now, from Maddoc's post on EQ Traders, it would seem that he has plans to address the skill up paths for all the trades:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;MADDOC WROTE&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&amp;nbsp; "Without going too deeply into specifics quite yet, what this means to you is a much more smooth skill-progression for all skills . . . In some cases, this may mean that trivial of any given recipe will be increased or decreased, to help fill in the some areas of need.&amp;nbsp; Overall, the changes will greatly benefit the tailors (and other tradeskillers, of course) in the form of a smoother progression across the board." &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;In general, I think everyone would agree that this is a good thing. However, there are some specific issues pertaining to the various trades that still should be mentioned. What better place to start than. . . .&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;8A) Tailoring. &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Well, there is sure a lot of discussion on tailoring in the TS community today. As Maddoc posted yesterday:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;MADDOC WROTE:&lt;/STRONG&gt; "Now, as I'm sure you've noticed, some of these changes found their way live, somewhat unexpectedly, and I can understand the frustration at the changes, however... "&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Having mid-to-high level tailoring recipes to bridge the gap has long been desired by the community, even more so now with the change of the skill cap from 250 to 300. However, from Maddoc's post, it seems pretty clear (at least to me) that the trivial change to the Solstace Robes and the Velious tailoring should not have been pushed live until all the other changes that he has in mind (for tailoring) were pushed live as well. If, as Maddoc stated, the push was unintentional, then resetting the trival levels back to their original levels should be done, until all the other changes for tailoring are ready to be pushed live as well. Everything should go simulataneously, or nothing should go at all. This would also allow post 252 tailors to use up the large quantities of components that they had saved up for a large tailoring run.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Since most people stock up on items for a long run of combines, having an unexpected change like this imposes a lot of anger and frustration on the community, especially coming, as it did, a couple weeks after the skill caps were raised. Tailors who were maxed out at 250 went back to farming ingredients to raise their skill to 300. Typically, people would farm one ingredient at a time. They'll spend days getting 100 (or more) Arctic Wyvern Hides, and then fishing for that many Cobalt Cods, and then moving on to the velium. Many people were in the middle of gathering the ingredients, and now are left with a large stockpile of ingredients that are worthless to them.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;With regards to the velious tailoring, all the pieces currently trivial at 252. Having an arbitrary level of 252 doesn't make sense for all pieces, because the amount of velium needed is different for different pieces. Previous convention suggested that the more ore (velium in this case) needed, the higher the trivial level for the piece. Therefore, the recipes should either scale more logically based on this, or the velium requirement should be reduced to 1 for all of them. (Speaking of velium, what better way to reduce the mindless farming of velium for these recipes, than to implement the velium weapon to ore conversion, requested in number 1.)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Since the components for Solstice Robes and Velious leathers are, in fact, not common or cheap, the lowered trivials should accompanied by increased drop rates on the Velious leather components (and making the velium easier to gather, as the issue in number 1 requests&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ) and possibly the removal of the most expensive components for the Solstice Robes.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;In addition, because of the trivial changes, there are currently no viable skill up paths to 300.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;8B) Research.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The research cap is at 300 now, however, there are currently no recipes that trivial over 227. Higher level recipes are needed (such as PoP spells) so that researchers can skill up to 300.&amp;nbsp; Creating recipes to make PoP spells would help alleviate two problems. 1) it would give researchers higher skill combines to work on, and 2) it would help bring down the price of 63/64/65 PoP spells, which are rediculously to insanely priced in the bazaar these days.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Another suggestion is to allow you to research spells for any INT caster, perhaps everyone getting the same book to do the combines. In addition, adding in recipes to research spells for hybrid spells would seem to make sense as well. INT casters can currently research spells for priests, but not for hybrids.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;In addition to not having the ability to skill up past 227, researchers do not have a tradeskill trophy. Since research is being treated as a regular tradeskill, it would only make sense that there was a trophy as well.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;8C) Fletching.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The skill up path for non-wood elf or non-Karana worshiping PCs is very difficult past 282. Fletching components in OoW and DoN do not drop frequently enough to make them a viable skill up path. Making PoP bows is also not a viable skill up path, because of the rarity/price of components.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;8D) Alchemy.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Many of the alchemy recipes above 250 require a foraged item, however, shaman don't seem to forage as well as some other classes.&amp;nbsp; Could we get some higher skill recipes that do not use foraged items to use when skilling up?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;9) Tradeskill Super-trophy - &lt;FONT color=red&gt;New item (sort of) with the 8/5/2005 Update&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Could we get some kind of super trophy for multi-tradeskill GM's? Here are some ideas on what could be done in this vein.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A tradeskill super-trophy is defined as a trophy you can only obtain once you have all seven tradeskill trophies (excluding alchemy, poison making, tinkering, and research), or one that requires 300 in all seven general tradeskills, or both.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;One possibility is a combine that requires all seven trophies plus some other item, yielding back six normal trophies and one super-trophy with increased stats or abilities.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Another option is for a no-fail combine of all seven trophies in a quest container to yield the super-trophy. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Consensus seems to be that the super-trophy should give a skill bonus for all tradeskills. This is the preferred option. However, the developers have indicated that this may take a disproportionate amount of time to implement. An alterative would be to make the super-trophy with no tradeskill modifiers at all. A player would combine the super-trophy alone in a forge and it would return the super-trophy and a no-drop, no-rent, lore item with a bonus to smithing; it could be combined in a tailoring kit or loom to yield a tailoring-boosting item, and so on.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Another popular option is to have the super-trophy give a 10% bonus to tradeskills. A single item that has +10% to all tradeskills would be superb; alternately, each of the no-drop, no-rent, lore items discussed above could have the 10% mod.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Could the existing tradeskill trophies be adjusted so that each yields a unique 100% WR bag? Thus, a person with three trophys could get three different 100% WR bags that don't poof on logging. This was mentioned as being possible in the past.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Other than that, a Gnomish Army Knife was suggested in another thread. The only differences are:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;1. A super-trophy is made from trophies in a no fail combine. A GAK is made from Geerloks in a high-trivial combine.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;2. A GAK would be rare like a super-trophy, but tradable, at a high price.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;3. A super-trophy would have STATS like the existing trophies. A GAK would be a pure skill mod, like existing Geerloks.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The purpose here is conserving bankspace by reducing the number of geerloks you need to keep on hand.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;10) Stackability of various tradeskill components - &lt;FONT color=red&gt;New item with the 8/5/2005 Update&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It would REALLY be nice if the enchanted large bricks stacked like the unenchanted do .... Enchanted Large Bricks of Steel don't stack either, yet the Large Brick of High Quality Ore do.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In addition, it would make it much easier to collect PoP bow ingredients if the staves would stack. One bow staff takes a full slot which hinders us to pick them up and save since tradeskillers usually are serious packrats.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Make spell scrolls stacakable, if possible.&amp;nbsp; This would make guild bankers VERY happy!!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN class=time_text&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;The ogres are mounting a revolt, because of the request for more halfling pie recipes and tinkered mounts.&amp;nbsp; They feel that the larger races are being slighted by these requests and have asked that more&amp;nbsp;recipes using halflings as ingredients be added, and in addition more gnome punting contests be arranged. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;IMG height=16 src="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-tongue.gif" width=16 border=0&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Tradeskill Top 10 Issues&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1) Rotating stock on vendors&lt;BR&gt;2) Nitram Anizok's plight&lt;BR&gt;3) New Bag Designs&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;NEW item added with the 2/4/05 update&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;4) Mass Combines With One Click - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;NEW item added with the 6/3/05 update&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;5)&amp;nbsp;Tradeskill components are unreasonably rare - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Item modifed&amp;nbsp;with the 6/3/05 update&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;6) Balancing the Grand Robe / Grand Tunic / Phylactery quest for melees&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;7) Reduce the amount of storage necessary - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Partially Implemented with the 6/29/05 Patch - New Information with 7/3/05&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;8) Difficulty in skill up paths to 300&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;NEW item added with the 3/4/05 update&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1) Rotating stock on vendors &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;C&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;urrently being evaulated or "Under Review" in Tanker's words&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;A while back&amp;nbsp;the number of slots on a vendor was reduced from 100 (of which 20 were "under the counter") to 80. This took away the ability of players to "vendor mine" which served as both a plat sink and a way to increase the flow of usable items (particularly tradeskill supplies).&amp;nbsp; Are there any alternative ways planned to help tradeskiller find rare items on vendors? For example, it's often been suggested that when selling an item to a "full" vendor, it shouldn't automatically disappear. Rather, the oldest player-sold item would poof and the item being sold would appear at the top of the list. This would allow vendors to keep a "rotating stock" of player-sold items.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;UPDATE FROM TANKER&lt;/STRONG&gt; (thanks Tanker):About a month ago, I spent some time looking into this, and discovered a few gotcha's in the Merchant code that make this more than a one-day project. In talking about it with my lead, it was decided that the solutions to these problems were both too time-consuming for right now, and contained side-effects that would need full review before this was done. An optimist would place this issue as "Under review", but under no circumstances would I look for this Soon(TM). However, without going into ANY specifics, I wouldn't be surprised by an alternative method of gathering supplies coming up in the future... don't ask.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;New question 6/3/05:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Tanker indicated that it was difficult to do.&amp;nbsp; However, there have been recent changes to the merchants UI.&amp;nbsp; Have these changes made this a more feasable possibility now?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=661420023-03062005&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Tanker&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Since&amp;nbsp;the new Merchant window went in, I have not had time to look into whether the new layout alleviates any of the problems I saw when looking at this earlier, though&amp;nbsp;my memory of these issues is that the list view of the new merchant window may help.&amp;nbsp; Given the new&amp;nbsp;window is not sorted by&amp;nbsp;"time first&amp;nbsp;of this item was sold to this merchant" anymore, though, a new player (or any player) would have difficulty determining which item would disappear/just disappeared from the list when he sold&amp;nbsp;that new item to the merchant.&amp;nbsp;This idea could probably use a fresh look at it's feasibility, "Under Review" could now more appropriately describe the state of this feature.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2) Nitram Anizok's plight&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Tinkerers are concerned about the ability to get to Nitram in Innovation, as he is the only vendor for certain non-stacking tinkering supplies. The problem is due to both see-invis mobs along the path to reach him, and the fact that he is also used for a quest (Xanamech).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Any thoughts on the suggestions on how to implement?&amp;nbsp; Is this a possiblity with the changes to the trivial levels that are coming SOON (tm)??&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Possible Suggestions on how to&amp;nbsp;implement this &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;NEW&amp;nbsp;added with the 11/19/04 update&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Suggestion 1:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Alternative to moving Nitram, consider putting in some sort of teleport to and from Nitram. Have the port only work for one person per 6 hours game time (about 15 minutes real time). That’s enough to give tradeskillers easy access to Nitram without breaking any quests or interfering with Nitram’s role in the Xanamech quest/raid.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Suggestion 2:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Another proposed alternative is to create a new vendor in Abysmal Sea, with the same inventory as Nitram Anizok in PoI. To make it interesting you could increase his Greed modifier to make the items slighty more expensive than buying from Nitram. If players want the items cheaper, they have to brave PoI to buy from Nitram. The storyline would be that Tramin Anizok (Nitram's cousin) has recently set up an import/export business in Abysmal Sea, importing parts from his cousin in the Planes. He sells all of the parts needed for the Anizok family recipes, although at a markup due to the dangers of exporting the raw materials.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Suggestion 3:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Another possible solution would be to leave poor Niltram alone, but either add a new NPC in the tower with the PoI zone in or make the ogre there a merchant that has the same inventory.&amp;nbsp; As with suggestion 2, the components would be more expensive if you bought them here, than if you fought your way to Niltram and bought them from him.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN class=292541702-11112004&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial color=#ff0000&gt;This is something&amp;nbsp;that we&amp;nbsp;need to investigate a bit, to make sure I'm not trivializing any &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=292541702-11112004&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial color=#ff0000&gt;combines or breaking any quests / events by moving him.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;3) New Bag Designs &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;NEW item added with the 2/4/05 update&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;New bag designs and/or ability to DYE bags. I'm bored of the same old graphics, plus it would help to manage my bank &amp;amp; inventory if I had more variety in the looks. If I could dye them, that would be great...brown is so dated..... I loved the new bag look for the bag that people received as a /claim item (for LoY, I think, Satchel of Abu-Kar) but no other bags have since been given that graphic &lt;SPAN class=292541702-11112004&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff00ff&gt;Tradeskill -&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff00ff&gt;&amp;nbsp;List Update scheduled for&amp;nbsp;07/05/05 (Part 2)- &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=292541702-11112004&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Updates from Maddoc and Tanker are noted under their respective items in red.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;4) Mass Combines With One Click &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;NEW item added with the 6/3/05 update&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Allow mass (bulk) combines (say 5 or 10 at a time) for trivial&amp;nbsp;combines (perhaps restricted based on how trivial, 100 points trivial, 200 points trivial, no-fail only.)&amp;nbsp; Enchanters (and other classes) can already mass enchant/mass imbue 5 at a time.&amp;nbsp; When restricted to very trivial/no fail combines, it's not terribly different, and would not be unbalancing.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;5)&amp;nbsp;Tradeskill components are unreasonably rare - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Modified item with 6/3/2005 update. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;5a.&amp;nbsp; OoW drops - including Lightning Cores, Slugworms, Trean Flies, Discordant Scoriae, etc.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;5b.&amp;nbsp; DoN drops - all those cultural thingies are just TOO rare.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;5c.&amp;nbsp; PoP drops - temper components&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;6) Balancing the Grand Robe / Grand Tunic / Phylactery quest for melees&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Maddoc said he would look at adding an alternate reward for melees who wish to do this quest, since they cannot use the Grand Robe/Tunic. Discussions included either adding a new reward for melees or making the Token of Service tradable.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;This is probably something that's very easy to do, and again one of the easiest things to do which will get done before any of the others.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;6A) Ghoul of Takish-Iz broken, very frustrating!&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;This is very much related so I have combined it in the same item. - The Ghoul is an insanely rare spawn, and almost impossible for a non-tracker to catch without using tools-that-shall-not-be-mentioned. In addition, even when he does spawn and is caught, his drop is way too rare.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;"I have killed the Ghoul of Takish-Iz more than 30 times in the last 2 months - he is supposed to drop the last piece I need for the phylactery quest - the spiritual anchor. I know for a fact as recently as late April/early May he was still dropping the anchor. By all accounts the Anchor is a 1/4 to 1/5 drop so the odds of me not getting one in 30 kills are bordering on impossible .... in an ongoing discussion on EQtraders, if you factor in two other player's experiences in the last month we have killed the Ghoul 41 times with 0 drops. The amount of time I have spent on this quest now vastly exceeds the amount of time it took me to get my epic or do anything else ever in this game - hundreds of hours, at least a hundred just on the ghoul..... somethin' ain't right about that."&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;7) Reduce the amount of storage necessary&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Partially implemented with the 6/29/05 patch&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Suggestions for tradeskill tools:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;1) A super-expensive geerlok that modifies ALL trade skills&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;II) Add common tradeskill tools to the key chain (or toolbelt) the first time they're used&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;C) Advanced collapsed containers (Summon the expanded tradeskill container filled with a set of tools for the trade)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Additional information with the 7/3/05 update.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;4) &lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;Selectively&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; increase the stack sizes for other items, such as:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;OL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Celestial Essence - used in many different tradeskills, in vast quantities, increasing the stack size to 200 would not be amiss. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Gems (Blue Diamonds, Diamonds, etc) &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;other? spider(ling) silks and threads / swatches, perhaps? &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Make Spell scrolls stackable (to 20) if possible, this would make &lt;U&gt;guild&lt;/U&gt; bankers VERY happy!&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;8) Difficulty in skill up paths to 300 -&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;New item, added with the 3/4/05 &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The tradeskill caps have been raised to 300 for all the tradeskills. However, the skill up paths are very difficult to non-existent for some of them. Now, from Maddoc's post on EQ Traders, it would seem that he has plans to address the skill up paths for all the trades:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;MADDOC WROTE&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&amp;nbsp; "Without going too deeply into specifics quite yet, what this means to you is a much more smooth skill-progression for all skills . . . In some cases, this may mean that trivial of any given recipe will be increased or decreased, to help fill in the some areas of need.&amp;nbsp; Overall, the changes will greatly benefit the tailors (and other tradeskillers, of course) in the form of a smoother progression across the board." &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;In general, I think everyone would agree that this is a good thing. However, there are some specific issues pertaining to the various trades that still should be mentioned. What better place to start than. . . .&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;8A) Tailoring. &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Well, there is sure a lot of discussion on tailoring in the TS community today. As Maddoc posted yesterday:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;MADDOC WROTE:&lt;/STRONG&gt; "Now, as I'm sure you've noticed, some of these changes found their way live, somewhat unexpectedly, and I can understand the frustration at the changes, however... "&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Having mid-to-high level tailoring recipes to bridge the gap has long been desired by the community, even more so now with the change of the skill cap from 250 to 300. However, from Maddoc's post, it seems pretty clear (at least to me) that the trivial change to the Solstace Robes and the Velious tailoring should not have been pushed live until all the other changes that he has in mind (for tailoring) were pushed live as well. If, as Maddoc stated, the push was unintentional, then resetting the trival levels back to their original levels should be done, until all the other changes for tailoring are ready to be pushed live as well. Everything should go simulataneously, or nothing should go at all. This would also allow post 252 tailors to use up the large quantities of components that they had saved up for a large tailoring run.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Since most people stock up on items for a long run of combines, having an unexpected change like this imposes a lot of anger and frustration on the community, especially coming, as it did, a couple weeks after the skill caps were raised. Tailors who were maxed out at 250 went back to farming ingredients to raise their skill to 300. Typically, people would farm one ingredient at a time. They'll spend days getting 100 (or more) Arctic Wyvern Hides, and then fishing for that many Cobalt Cods, and then moving on to the velium. Many people were in the middle of gathering the ingredients, and now are left with a large stockpile of ingredients that are worthless to them.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;With regards to the velious tailoring, all the pieces currently trivial at 252. Having an arbitrary level of 252 doesn't make sense for all pieces, because the amount of velium needed is different for different pieces. Previous convention suggested that the more ore (velium in this case) needed, the higher the trivial level for the piece. Therefore, the recipes should either scale more logically based on this, or the velium requirement should be reduced to 1 for all of them. (Speaking of velium, what better way to reduce the mindless farming of velium for these recipes, than to implement the velium weapon to ore conversion, requested in number 1.)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Since the components for Solstice Robes and Velious leathers are, in fact, not common or cheap, the lowered trivials should accompanied by increased drop rates on the Velious leather components (and making the velium easier to gather, as the issue in number 1 requests&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ) and possibly the removal of the most expensive components for the Solstice Robes.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;In addition, because of the trivial changes, there are currently no viable skill up paths to 300.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;8B) Research.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The research cap is at 300 now, however, there are currently no recipes that trivial over 227. Higher level recipes are needed (such as PoP spells) so that researchers can skill up to 300.&amp;nbsp; Creating recipes to make PoP spells would help alleviate two problems. 1) it would give researchers higher skill combines to work on, and 2) it would help bring down the price of 63/64/65 PoP spells, which are rediculously to insanely priced in the bazaar these days.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Another suggestion is to allow you to research spells for any INT caster, perhaps everyone getting the same book to do the combines. In addition, adding in recipes to research spells for hybrid spells would seem to make sense as well. INT casters can currently research spells for priests, but not for hybrids.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;In addition to not having the ability to skill up past 227, researchers do not have a tradeskill trophy. Since research is being treated as a regular tradeskill, it would only make sense that there was a trophy as well.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;8C) Fletching.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The skill up path for non-wood elf or non-Karana worshiping PCs is very difficult past 282. Fletching components in OoW and DoN do not drop frequently enough to make them a viable skill up path. Making PoP bows is also not a viable skill up path, because of the rarity/price of components.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;8D) Alchemy.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Many of the alchemy recipes above 250 require a foraged item, however, shaman don't seem to forage as well as some other classes.&amp;nbsp; Could we get some higher skill recipes that do not use foraged items to use when skilling up?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;EM&gt;The gnomes are becomming increasingly agitated that the halfings are requetsting pie recipes, and have asked me to include tinkered mounts (such as spiders) for them as well.&lt;/EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Tradeskill Top 10 Issues&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1) Velium weapon to Velium ore conversions &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Additonal information provided with the 2/4/05 update&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;2) Bag tokens&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;8) Balancing the Grand Robe / Grand Tunic / Phylactery quest for melees&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1) Velium weapon to Velium ore conversions&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Additonal information provided with the 2/4/05 update&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;You can currently break down Fine Steel weapons to get various quantities of High Quality ore. Could a similar conversion be added to convert Velium weapons to assorted blocks, bricks, and pieces of velium ore?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Let's say I am doing a load of arctic wyvern armor for tailoring skillups. I have 200 arctic wyvern hides. It takes 2 small pieces of velium to make a velium bit. It takes 3 velium bits to make 2 velium studs. It takes 1 brick of velium to make 2 pieces. That means I need 1.5 bricks of velium (or 3 small pieces of velium) per velium stud. Which means I need 300 bricks of velium (30 bags full...that's more than I can hold in my inventory and in my bank) to break down into 600 small pieces in order to make 200 studs. That is a HECK of a lot of farming in Crystal Caverns, considering it takes at least two passes through the entire upper and lower orc camp to get just a single bag of bricks. That means it would take 600 passes through both upper and lower orcs. If you only get a single camp, that's 1200 passes. At (I assume) 20 minutes per spawn cycle, that's 400 hours of farming. For what will amount to about 10 skillups (or less) if you get a rate of 1 skillup per stack of hides.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;New Information Added 2/4/05&amp;nbsp; &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Some additional information &lt;A href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Trade&amp;amp;message.id=3958&amp;amp;jump=true" target=_blank&gt;&lt;FONT color=#f0a911&gt;on the Artisan's Way&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt; compiled by Moraganth, that might be useful in this issue.&amp;nbsp; I would paste it here, but it's rather long.&amp;nbsp; &lt;SPAN class=292541702-11112004&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial color=#0000ff&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;This is a particularly large issue that I didn't have time to get to this time around, primarily because it's going to require extra-special care to ensure that we don't introduce any profitability exploits. Fear not! It's still on the list and has even moved up a rank or two.&lt;IMG height=16 src="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.gif" width=16 border=0&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2) Bag tokens: &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Although this has been partially implemented with the patch last October, two issues still remain, which is keeping this on the list.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2A) Showing bag stats&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN class=292541702-11112004&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial color=#0000ff&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN class=292541702-11112004&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial color=#0000ff&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Adding Bag Stats - This turns out to be more difficult than it initially seems and didn't make it in this round. It'll remain on the list for the future, though it may take some time.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2B) Additional Tokens for bags.&lt;/STRONG&gt; A list of GOD bags that do not have bazaar tokens was compiled and can be found &lt;A href="http://mboards.eqtraders.com/eq/showthread.php?t=16068" target=_blank&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffcc33&gt;here&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp; The list also includes non weight reducing bags that it would be great to have tokens for.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Additional request, 2/4/05&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;A token for the Ice Cream Curn was one recently requested.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN class=292541702-11112004&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;3) Rotating stock on vendors &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;C&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;urrently being evaulated or "Under Review" in Tanker's words&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;A while back&amp;nbsp;the number of slots on a vendor was reduced from 100 (of which 20 were "under the counter") to 80. This took away the ability of players to "vendor mine" which served as both a plat sink and a way to increase the flow of usable items (particularly tradeskill supplies).&amp;nbsp; Are there any alternative ways planned to help tradeskiller find rare items on vendors? For example, it's often been suggested that when selling an item to a "full" vendor, it shouldn't automatically disappear. Rather, the oldest player-sold item would poof and the item being sold would appear at the top of the list. This would allow vendors to keep a "rotating stock" of player-sold items.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;UPDATE FROM TANKER&lt;/STRONG&gt; (thanks Tanker):About a month ago, I spent some time looking into this, and discovered a few gotcha's in the Merchant code that make this more than a one-day project. In talking about it with my lead, it was decided that the solutions to these problems were both too time-consuming for right now, and contained side-effects that would need full review before this was done. An optimist would place this issue as "Under review", but under no circumstances would I look for this Soon(TM). However, without going into ANY specifics, I wouldn't be surprised by an alternative method of gathering supplies coming up in the future... don't ask.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;New question 6/3/05:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Tanker indicated that it was difficult to do.&amp;nbsp; However, there have been recent changes to the merchants UI.&amp;nbsp; Have these changes made this a more feasable possibility now?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN COLOR: FONT-FAMILY: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: red; Arial? 11pt;&gt;&lt;SPAN class=661420023-03062005&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Tanker&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Since&amp;nbsp;the new Merchant window went in, I have not had time to look into whether the new layout alleviates any of the problems I saw when looking at this earlier, though&amp;nbsp;my memory of these issues is that the list view of the new merchant window may help.&amp;nbsp; Given the new&amp;nbsp;window is not sorted by&amp;nbsp;"time first&amp;nbsp;of this item was sold to this merchant" anymore, though, a new player (or any player) would have difficulty determining which item would disappear/just disappeared from the list when he sold&amp;nbsp;that new item to the merchant.&amp;nbsp;This idea could probably use a fresh look at it's feasibility, "Under Review" could now more appropriately describe the state of this feature.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;4) Nitram Anizok's plight&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Tinkerers are concerned about the ability to get to Nitram in Innovation, as he is the only vendor for certain non-stacking tinkering supplies. The problem is due to both see-invis mobs along the path to reach him, and the fact that he is also used for a quest (Xanamech).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Any thoughts on the suggestions on how to implement?&amp;nbsp; Is this a possiblity with the changes to the trivial levels that are coming SOON (tm)??&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Possible Suggestions on how to&amp;nbsp;implement this &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;NEW&amp;nbsp;added with the 11/19/04 update&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Suggestion 1:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Alternative to moving Nitram, consider putting in some sort of teleport to and from Nitram. Have the port only work for one person per 6 hours game time (about 15 minutes real time). That’s enough to give tradeskillers easy access to Nitram without breaking any quests or interfering with Nitram’s role in the Xanamech quest/raid.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Suggestion 2:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Another proposed alternative is to create a new vendor in Abysmal Sea, with the same inventory as Nitram Anizok in PoI. To make it interesting you could increase his Greed modifier to make the items slighty more expensive than buying from Nitram. If players want the items cheaper, they have to brave PoI to buy from Nitram. The storyline would be that Tramin Anizok (Nitram's cousin) has recently set up an import/export business in Abysmal Sea, importing parts from his cousin in the Planes. He sells all of the parts needed for the Anizok family recipes, although at a markup due to the dangers of exporting the raw materials.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Suggestion 3:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Another possible solution would be to leave poor Niltram alone, but either add a new NPC in the tower with the PoI zone in or make the ogre there a merchant that has the same inventory.&amp;nbsp; As with suggestion 2, the components would be more expensive if you bought them here, than if you fought your way to Niltram and bought them from him.&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN class=292541702-11112004&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial color=#ff0000&gt;This is something&amp;nbsp;that we&amp;nbsp;need to investigate a bit, to make sure I'm not trivializing any &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN class=292541702-11112004&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial color=#ff0000&gt;combines or breaking any quests / events by moving him.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;5) New Bag Designs &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;NEW item added with the 2/4/05 update&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;New bag designs and/or ability to DYE bags. I'm bored of the same old graphics, plus it would help to manage my bank &amp;amp; inventory if I had more variety in the looks. If I could dye them, that would be great...brown is so dated..... I loved the new bag look for the bag that people received as a /claim item (for LoY, I think, Satchel of Abu-Kar) but no other bags have since been given that graphic &lt;SPAN class=292541702-11112004&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff00ff&gt;Tradeskill -&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff00ff&gt;&amp;nbsp;List Update scheduled for&amp;nbsp;06/03/05 (Part 2)- &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=292541702-11112004&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Updates from Maddoc and Tanker are noted under their respective items in red.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;6) Mass Combines With One Click &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;NEW item added with the 6/3/05 update&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Allow mass (bulk) combines (say 5 or 10 at a time) for trivial&amp;nbsp;combines (perhaps restricted based on how trivial, 100 points trivial, 200 points trivial, no-fail only.)&amp;nbsp; Enchanters (and other classes) can already mass enchant/mass imbue 5 at a time.&amp;nbsp; When restricted to very trivial/no fail combines, it's not terribly different, and would not be unbalancing. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;7)&amp;nbsp;Tradeskill components are unreasonably rare - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Modified item with 6/3/2005 update.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;7a.&amp;nbsp; OoW drops - including Lightning Cores, Slugworms, Trean Flies, Discordant Scoriae, etc.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;7b.&amp;nbsp; DoN drops - all those cultural thingies are just TOO rare.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;7c.&amp;nbsp; PoP drops - temper components&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;8) Balancing the Grand Robe / Grand Tunic / Phylactery quest for melees&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;Maddoc said he would look at adding an alternate reward for melees who wish to do this quest, since they cannot use the Grand Robe/Tunic. Discussions included either adding a new reward for melees or making the Token of Service tradable.&amp;nbsp; &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;This is probably something that's very easy to do, and again one of the easiest things to do which will get done before any of the others.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff3300&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff3300&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff3300&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;8A) Ghoul of Takish-Iz broken, very frustrating!&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;BR&gt;This is very much related so I have combined it in the same item. - The Ghoul is an insanely rare spawn, and almost impossible for a non-tracker to catch without using tools-that-shall-not-be-mentioned. In addition, even when he does spawn and is caught, his drop is way too rare. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff3300&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;"I have killed the Ghoul of Takish-Iz more than 30 times in the last 2 months - he is supposed to drop the last piece I need for the phylactery quest - the spiritual anchor. I know for a fact as recently as late April/early May he was still dropping the anchor. By all accounts the Anchor is a 1/4 to 1/5 drop so the odds of me not getting one in 30 kills are bordering on impossible .... in an ongoing discussion on EQtraders, if you factor in two other player's experiences in the last month we have killed the Ghoul 41 times with 0 drops. The amount of time I have spent on this quest now vastly exceeds the amount of time it took me to get my epic or do anything else ever in this game - hundreds of hours, at least a hundred just on the ghoul..... somethin' ain't right about that."&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff3300&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff3300&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;9) Reduce the amount of storage necessary&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;NEW item added with the 6/3/05 update&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;Suggestions for tradeskill tools:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff3300&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff3300&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;1) A super-expensive geerlok that modifies ALL trade skills&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff3300&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff3300&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;II) Add common tools to the key chain the first time they're used&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff3300&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff3300&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;C) Advanced collapsed containers (Summon the expanded tradeskill container filled with a set of tools for the trade)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff3300&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;Bank space for all the DoN patterns.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff3300&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;Cultural patterns and molds from DoN take up a tremendous amount of bank space.&amp;nbsp; Suggestions to reduce the space neccessary:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff3300&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff3300&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;1) Give us a token that can be turned in to a specific NPC who will give&amp;nbsp; you back the token (minus one charge) and a stack of the patterns or molds (having the item charged would not lead to an unlimited supply of patterns/molds.)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff3300&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff3300&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;B) Double the size of the banks.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff3300&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff3300&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;III) Increase the stack size for items with the tradeskill flag from 20 to 100.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff3300&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff3300&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;10) Difficulty in skill up paths to 300&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;New item, added with the 3/4/05 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;The tradeskill caps have been raised to 300 for all the tradeskills. However, the skill up paths are very difficult to non-existent for some of them. Now, from Maddoc's post on EQ Traders, it would seem that he has plans to address the skill up paths for all the trades:&amp;nbsp; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff3300&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;MADDOC WROTE&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&amp;nbsp; "&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Without going too deeply into specifics quite yet, what this means to you is a much more smooth skill-progression for all skills . . . In some cases, this may mean that trivial of any given recipe will be increased or decreased, to help fill in the some areas of need.&amp;nbsp; Overall, the changes will greatly benefit the tailors (and other tradeskillers, of course) in the form of a smoother progression across the board."&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;In general, I think everyone would agree that this is a good thing. However, there are some specific issues pertaining to the various trades that still should be mentioned. What better place to start than. . . .&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff3300&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff3300&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;10A) Tailoring. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Well, there is sure a lot of discussion on tailoring in the TS community today. As Maddoc posted yesterday:&amp;nbsp; MADDOC WROTE: "Now, as I'm sure you've noticed, some of these changes found their way live, somewhat unexpectedly, and I can understand the frustration at the changes, however... "&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff3300&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;Having mid-to-high level tailoring recipes to bridge the gap has long been desired by the community, even more so now with the change of the skill cap from 250 to 300. However, from Maddoc's post, it seems pretty clear (at least to me) that the trivial change to the Solstace Robes and the Velious tailoring should not have been pushed live until all the other changes that he has in mind (for tailoring) were pushed live as well. If, as Maddoc stated, the push was unintentional, then resetting the trival levels back to their original levels should be done, until all the other changes for tailoring are ready to be pushed live as well. Everything should go simulataneously, or nothing should go at all. This would also allow post 252 tailors to use up the large quantities of components that they had saved up for a large tailoring run.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff3300&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;Since most people stock up on items for a long run of combines, having an unexpected change like this imposes a lot of anger and frustration on the community, especially coming, as it did, a couple weeks after the skill caps were raised. Tailors who were maxed out at 250 went back to farming ingredients to raise their skill to 300. Typically, people would farm one ingredient at a time. They'll spend days getting 100 (or more) Arctic Wyvern Hides, and then fishing for that many Cobalt Cods, and then moving on to the velium. Many people were in the middle of gathering the ingredients, and now are left with a large stockpile of ingredients that are worthless to them.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff3300&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff3300&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;With regards to the velious tailoring, all the pieces currently trivial at 252. Having an arbitrary level of 252 doesn't make sense for all pieces, because the amount of velium needed is different for different pieces. Previous convention suggested that the more ore (velium in this case) needed, the higher the trivial level for the piece. Therefore, the recipes should either scale more logically based on this, or the velium requirement should be reduced to 1 for all of them. (Speaking of velium, what better way to reduce the mindless farming of velium for these recipes, than to implement the velium weapon to ore conversion, requested in number 1.)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff3300&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;Since the components for Solstice Robes and Velious leathers are, in fact, not common or cheap, the lowered trivials should accompanied by increased drop rates on the Velious leather components (and making the velium easier to gather, as the issue in number 1 requests&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ) and possibly the removal of the most expensive components for the Solstice Robes.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff3300&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&amp;nbsp;In addition, because of the trivial changes, there are currently no viable skill up paths to 300.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff3300&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff3300&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;10B) Research.&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;BR&gt;The research cap is at 300 now, however, there are currently no recipes that trivial over 227. Higher level recipes are needed (such as PoP spells) so that researchers can skill up to 300.&amp;nbsp; Creating recipes to make PoP spells would help alleviate two problems. 1) it would give researchers higher skill combines to work on, and 2) it would help bring down the price of 63/64/65 PoP spells, which are rediculously to insanely priced in the bazaar these days. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff3300&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;Another suggestion is to allow you to research spells for any INT caster, perhaps everyone getting the same book to do the combines. In addition, adding in recipes to research spells for hybrid spells would seem to make sense as well. INT casters can currently research spells for priests, but not for hybrids.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff3300&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;In addition to not having the ability to skill up past 227, researchers do not have a tradeskill trophy. Since research is being treated as a regular tradeskill, it would only make sense that there was a trophy as well.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff3300&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff3300&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;10C) Fletching.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;The skill up path for non-wood elf or non-Karana worshiping PCs is very difficult past 282. Fletching components in OoW and DoN do not drop frequently enough to make them a viable skill up path. Making PoP bows is also not a viable skill up path, because of the rarity/price of components.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff3300&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff3300&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;10D) Alchemy.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;Many of the alchemy recipes above 250 require a foraged item, however, shaman don't seem to forage as well as some other classes.&amp;nbsp; Could we get some higher skill recipes that do not use foraged items to use when skilling up?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#6666ff&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff3300&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;FONT color=#6666ff&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff3300&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;FONT color=#6666ff&gt;&lt;EM&gt;The gnomes are becomming increasingly agitated that the halfings are requetsting pie recipes, and have asked me to include tinkered mounts (such as spiders) for them as well.&lt;/EM&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Tradeskill Top 10 Issues&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1) Velium weapon to Velium ore conversions &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Additonal information provided with the 2/4/05 update&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;2) Bag tokens:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;3) Rotating stock on vendors&lt;BR&gt;4) Nitram Anizok's plight&lt;BR&gt;5) New Bag Designs&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;NEW item added with the 2/4/05 update&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;6) Expanding Jewelcrafting Mastery to other skills and classes &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;7) Omens tradeskill materials are too rare.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Additonal information provided with the 2/4/05 update&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;8) Balancing the Grand Robe / Grand Tunic / Phylactery quest for melees&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;9) Excessively low drop rates for PoP temper components&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;10) Difficulty in skill up paths to 300&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;NEW item added with the 3/4/05 update&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN class=292541702-11112004&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1) Velium weapon to Velium ore conversions&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;You can currently break down Fine Steel weapons to get various quantities of High Quality ore. Could a similar conversion be added to convert Velium weapons to assorted blocks, bricks, and pieces of velium ore?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Let's say I am doing a load of arctic wyvern armor for tailoring skillups. I have 200 arctic wyvern hides. It takes 2 small pieces of velium to make a velium bit. It takes 3 velium bits to make 2 velium studs. It takes 1 brick of velium to make 2 pieces. That means I need 1.5 bricks of velium (or 3 small pieces of velium) per velium stud. Which means I need 300 bricks of velium (30 bags full...that's more than I can hold in my inventory and in my bank) to break down into 600 small pieces in order to make 200 studs. That is a HECK of a lot of farming in Crystal Caverns, considering it takes at least two passes through the entire upper and lower orc camp to get just a single bag of bricks. That means it would take 600 passes through both upper and lower orcs. If you only get a single camp, that's 1200 passes. At (I assume) 20 minutes per spawn cycle, that's 400 hours of farming. For what will amount to about 10 skillups if you get a rate of 1 skillup per stack of hides.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;New Information Added 2/4/05&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Some additional information &lt;A href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Trade&amp;amp;message.id=3958&amp;amp;jump=true" target=_blank&gt;&lt;FONT color=#f0a911&gt;on the Artisan's Way&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt; compiled by Moraganth, that might be useful in this issue.&amp;nbsp; I would past it here, but it's rather long.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN class=292541702-11112004&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial color=#0000ff&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;This is a particularly large issue that I didn't have time to get to this time around, primarily because it's going to require extra-special care to ensure that we don't introduce any profitability exploits. Fear not! It's still on the list and has even moved up a rank or two.&lt;IMG height=16 src="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.gif" width=16 border=0&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2) Bag tokens:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;This has been partially implemented with the update on 10/13 - Minor Update (see 2C)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;2A) Showing bag stats&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN class=292541702-11112004&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial color=#0000ff&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Adding Bag Stats - This turns out to be more difficult than it initially seems and didn't make it in this round. It'll remain on the list for the future, though it may take some time.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;2B) Additional Tokens for bags. A list of GOD bags that do not have bazaar tokens was compiled and can be found &lt;A href="http://mboards.eqtraders.com/eq/showthread.php?t=16068" target=_blank&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffcc33&gt;here&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp; The list also includes non weight reducing bags that it would be great to have tokens for.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Additional request, 2/4/05&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;A token for the Ice Cream Curn was one recently requested.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN class=292541702-11112004&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial&gt;Additional Tokens - Most specialty bags and containers have been added to this NPC. If there are any more, feel free to let me know, I'll throw it on the list.&lt;IMG height=16 src="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.gif" width=16 border=0&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;3) Rotating stock on vendors&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A few months ago, the number of slots on a vendor was reduced from 100 (of which 20 were "under the counter") to 80. This took away the ability of players to "vendor mine" which served as both a plat sink and a way to increase the flow of usable items (particularly tradeskill supplies).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Are there any alternative ways planned to help tradeskiller find rare items on vendors? For example, it's often been suggested that when selling an item to a "full" vendor, it shouldn't automatically disappear. Rather, the oldest player-sold item would poof and the item being sold would appear at the top of the list. This would allow vendors to keep a "rotating stock" of player-sold items. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;UPDATE FROM TANKER (thanks Tanker):About a month ago, I spent some time looking into this, and discovered a few gotcha's in the Merchant code that make this more than a one-day project. In talking about it with my lead, it was decided that the solutions to these problems were both too time-consuming for right now, and contained side-effects that would need full review before this was done. An optimist would place this issue as "Under review", but under no circumstances would I look for this Soon(TM). However, without going into ANY specifics, I wouldn't be surprised by an alternative method of gathering supplies coming up in the future... don't ask.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;4) Nitram Anizok's plight&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Tinkerers are concerned about the ability to get to Nitram in Innovation, as he is the only vendor for certain non-stacking tinkering supplies. The problem is due to both see-invis mobs along the path to reach him, and the fact that he is also used for a quest (Xanamech).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Possible Suggestions on how to&amp;nbsp;implement this &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;NEW&amp;nbsp;added with the 11/19/04 update&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Suggestion 1:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Alternative to moving Nitram, consider putting in some sort of teleport to and from Nitram. Have the port only work for one person per 6 hours game time (about 15 minutes real time). That’s enough to give tradeskillers easy access to Nitram without breaking any quests or interfering with Nitram’s role in the Xanamech quest/raid.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Suggestion 2:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Another proposed alternative is to create a new vendor in Abysmal Sea, with the same inventory as Nitram Anizok in PoI. To make it interesting you could increase his Greed modifier to make the items slighty more expensive than buying from Nitram. If players want the items cheaper, they have to brave PoI to buy from Nitram. The storyline would be that Tramin Anizok (Nitram's cousin) has recently set up an import/export business in Abysmal Sea, importing parts from his cousin in the Planes. He sells all of the parts needed for the Anizok family recipes, although at a markup due to the dangers of exporting the raw materials.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Suggestion 3:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Another possible solution would be to leave poor Niltram alone, but either add a new NPC in the tower with the PoI zone in or make the ogre there a merchant that has the same inventory.&amp;nbsp; As with suggestion 2, the components would be more expensive if you bought them here, than if you fought your way to Niltram and bought them from him.&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;SPAN class=292541702-11112004&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial color=#ff0000&gt;This is something&amp;nbsp;that we&amp;nbsp;need to investigate a bit, to make sure I'm not trivializing any combines or breaking any quests / events by moving him.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;5) New Bag Designs &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;NEW item added with the 2/4/05 update&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;New bag designs and/or ability to DYE bags. I'm bored of the same old graphics, plus it would help to manage my bank &amp;amp; inventory if I had more variety in the looks. If I could dye them, that would be great...brown is so dated..... I loved the new bag look for the bag that people received as a /claim item (for LoY, I think, Satchel of Abu-Kar) but no other bags have since been given that graphic &lt;SPAN class=292541702-11112004&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;6) Expanding Jewelcrafting Mastery to other skills and classes&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I guess I don't need to restate the arguments here.&amp;nbsp; From what I've seen, the community is about&amp;nbsp;85-90% in favor of this.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN class=292541702-11112004&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;With Omens, there are several additional "Mastery" AA's available to the players.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman"&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;SPAN class=292541702-11112004&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial color=#0000ff&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;As mentioned at Fan Faire, there are currently no plans to extend JCM to any additional classes.&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;7) Omens tradeskill materials are too rare. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The rare parts for Omens augments, (Slugworms, Discordant Scoriae, and Trean Flies), plus the gemstone augments themselves, seem to drop very rarely indeed. Given the risk of failure at multiple steps during the aug tradeskill process, is this intended? Similarly, many of the other tradeskill items such as bloods and hides seem disproportionately rare.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;8)&lt;STRONG&gt; Balancing the Grand Robe / Grand Tunic / Phylactery quest for melees&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;Maddoc said he would look at adding an alternate reward for melees who wish to do this quest, since they cannot use the Grand Robe/Tunic. Discussions included either adding a new reward for melees or making the Token of Service tradable. This is probably something that's very easy to do, and again one of the easiest things to do which will get done before any of the others.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;8A) Ghoul of Takish-Iz broken, very frustrating!&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;This is very much related so I have combined it in the same item. - The Ghoul is an insanely rare spawn, and almost impossible for a non-tracker to catch without using tools-that-shall-not-be-mentioned. In addition, even when he does spawn and is caught, his drop is way too rare. One person suggests that the Anchor drop rate should be no worse than 1 in 3 kills, and preferably better than that.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I have killed the Ghoul of Takish-Iz more than 30 times in the last 2 months - he is supposed to drop the last piece I need for the phylactery quest - the spiritual anchor. I know for a fact as recently as late April/early May he was still dropping the anchor. By all accounts the Anchor is a 1/4 to 1/5 drop so the odds of me not getting one in 30 kills are bordering on impossible .... in an ongoing discussion on EQtraders, if you factor in two other player's experiences in the last month we have killed the Ghoul 41 times with 0 drops. The amount of time I have spent on this quest now vastly exceeds the amount of time it took me to get my epic or do anything else ever in this game - hundreds of hours, at least a hundred just on the ghoul..... somethin' ain't right about that.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;9) Excessively low drop rates for PoP temper components &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Given the quality of OoW tradeskill armors and drops, PoP armors have essentially become obsolete, or standby items until you can get the "good" stuff from OoW. The balancing of plate vs. chain was a superb step that will help revive the PoP plate market. The follow-up to this is a significant increase in drop rates, not just for temper components, but for all the items for PoP tradeskills. If PoP tradeskill items are to remain reasonably competitive in the OoW era (and yes, I know some folks will argue that they &lt;I&gt;don't&lt;/I&gt; have to stay competitive), they must be much cheaper than they currently are, and this can only happen if supply increases. This means that drop rates must increase, and by a huge margin. A single raid on a mini-boss named in the elemental planes should yield enough supplies for at least one PoP tradeskill item -- note that this implies multiple attempts, given current fail rates. An elemental god raid should see enough drops for 2-3 finished items.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;New information, Added 2/4/05:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Well they decreased the number of tempers and ammount of metal needed. Great. Now unfortunately less people seem to be in PoP so for those of us lesser mortals without EP flags its just as hard to get this stuf made as before. Although Magnetic&amp;nbsp;did alot of damage to this market anyway, some drop rate increase might help here.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;10) Difficulty in skill up paths to 300 &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;New item, added with the 3/4/05&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;The tradeskill caps have been raised to 300 for all the tradeskills. However, the skill up paths are very difficult to non-existent for some of them. Now, from Maddoc's post on EQ Traders, it would seem that he has plans to address the skill up paths for all the trades:&amp;nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;MADDOC WROTE: &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;"Without going too deeply into specifics quite yet, what this means to you is a much more smooth skill-progression for all skills . . . In some cases, this may mean that trivial of any given recipe will be increased or decreased, to help fill in the some areas of need.&amp;nbsp; Overall, the changes will greatly benefit the tailors (and other tradeskillers, of course) in the form of a smoother progression across the board."&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In general, I think everyone would agree that this is a good thing. However, there are some specific issues pertaining to the various trades that still should be mentioned. What better place to start than. . . .&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;10A) Tailoring.&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;BR&gt;Well, there is sure a lot of discussion on tailoring in the TS community today. As Maddoc posted yesterday:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;MADDOC WROTE:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;"Now, as I'm sure you've noticed, some of these changes found their way live, somewhat unexpectedly, and I can understand the frustration at the changes, however... "&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Having mid-to-high level tailoring recipes to bridge the gap has long been desired by the community, even more so now with the change of the skill cap from 250 to 300. However, from Maddoc's post, it seems pretty clear (at least to me) that the trivial change to the Solstace Robes and the Velious tailoring should not have been pushed live until all the other changes that he has in mind (for tailoring) were pushed live as well. If, as Maddoc stated, the push was unintentional, then resetting the trival levels back to their original levels should be done, until all the other changes for tailoring are ready to be pushed live as well. Everything should go simulataneously, or nothing should go at all. This would also allow post 252 tailors to use up the large quantities of components that they had saved up for a large tailoring run.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Since most people stock up on items for a long run of combines, having an unexpected change like this imposes a lot of anger and frustration on the community, especially coming, as it did, a couple weeks after the skill caps were raised. Tailors who were maxed out at 250 went back to farming ingredients to raise their skill to 300. Typically, people would farm one ingredient at a time. They'll spend days getting 100 (in a lot of cases cases several hundred) Arctic Wyvern Hides, and then fishing for that many Cobalt Cods, and then moving on to the velium. Many people were in the middle of gathering the ingredients, and now are left with a large stockpile of ingredients that are worthless to them.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;With regards to the velious tailoring, all the pieces currently trivial at 252. Having an arbitrary level of 252 doesn't make sense for all pieces, because the amount of velium needed is different for different pieces. Previous convention suggested that the more ore (velium in this case) needed, the higher the trivial level for the piece. Therefore, the recipes should either scale more logically based on this, or the velium requirement should be reduced to 1 for all of them. (Speaking of velium, what better way to reduce the mindless farming of velium for these recipes, than to implement the velium weapon to ore conversion, requested in number 1.)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Since the components for Solstice Robes and Velious leathers are, in fact, not common or cheap, the lowered trivials should accompanied by increased drop rates on the Velious leather components (and making the velium easier to gather, as the issue in number 1 requests&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ) and possibly the removal of the most expensive components for the Solstice Robes.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;In addition, because of the trivial changes, there are currently no viable skill up paths to 300.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;10B) Research.&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;BR&gt;The research cap is at 300 now, however, there are currently no recipes that trivial over 227. It would be great if the PoP spells would be researchable now. That would help alleviate two problems. 1) it would give researchers higher skill combines to work on, and 2) it would help bring down the price of 63/64/65 PoP spells, which are rediculously to insanely priced in the bazaar these days. Another suggestion is to allow you to research spells for any INT caster, perhaps everyone getting the same book to do the combines. In addition, adding in recipes to research spells for hybrid spells would seem to make sense as well. INT casters can currently research spells for priests, but not for hybrids.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;In addition to not having the ability to skill up past 227, researchers do not have a tradeskill trophy. Since research is being treated as a regular tradeskill, it would only make sense that there was a trophy as well.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;10C) Fletching.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;The skill up path for non-wood elf or non-Karana worshiping PCs is very difficult past 282. Fletching components in OoW and DoN do not drop frequently enough to make them a viable skill up path. Making PoP bows is also not a viable skill up path, because of the rarity/price of components.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;10D) Alchemy.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;Many of the alchemy recipes above 250 require a foraged item, however, shaman don't seem to forage as well as some other classes.&amp;nbsp; Could we get some higher skill recipes that do not use foraged items to use when skilling up?&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
