<DIV>Any Dev worth asking a question to already post here once a week and they're generally answering someones question. Few questions are unique enough to require a special correspondent to pass them along. Hell, I've never played a wizard but I can list thier most frequent questions as well as anyone who spends 10 minutes a day on this forum.</DIV>

<DIV>Correspondent ask Kyth, she asks a Dev, Dev answers Kyth, Kyth asnwers Correspondent. (last time we communicated like this it was called the telegraph) And when the correspondent finally post it on the forums&nbsp; the first reply is always "Can we get a dev to confirm this?"</DIV><p>Message Edited by Parsis on <span class=date_text>06-05-2006</span> <span class=time_text>09:31 PM</span>

				<div></div><div></div>A weekly question won't necessarily mean a weekly answer.<br>That is considered communication? Why ask questions if no answer is to be expected? We are to ask rhetorical questions of the devs?<br><br>I could understand they might need time to answer questions if we quizzed them on topics they might not know about but I'm sure most questions would be confined to EQ, at least for the first few months. Are we to believe that they don't have any plan for CHeal (cleric question) or that they couldn't be bothered supplying an answer? Prathun posts about needing to look into things, kk he is new to his post but are all the devs new to their posts too? Surely there is a plan or a direction in place for the game?

				<DIV>&gt;&gt; These spells have long cast times to ensure they are not used to escape a combat situation that has gone wrong. It keeps them different from evacs. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Yeah, that made sense years ago before the Exodus AA and before the Evacuate spell. As it is, unless you've already used Exodus, I can't see a Wizard keeping any evac spell up. And once Exodus is down, Evacuate is the only spell worth memming because it keeps you in the zone rather than porting you somewhere close. So since there's no real reason to use another spell to escape a bad situation, any casting time longer than that of Evac should be find for a port.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>A lot of the port spells take a rather long time to refresh after memorization, and some have just plain crazy casting times. PoK is 18 seconds IIRC. There's no reason for that.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>That said, if some of the core Wizard issues get addressed, they can raise the casting time on our ports to 60 seconds and I doubt any Wizards will complain. <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0></DIV>

There is usually no reason to evac to a different zone (there haven't been zones with unsafe succor points in a very long time), but there are evac spells for that too - to Nek, Fay, etc. Now why in the world would I want to portal out of combat instead of evacing? There is a very, very, very small chance of leaving party members behind on evac but nobody would ever portal instead of evac really - just for the reason of leaving the zone. And yet portal spells have casting times from 16 to 24 sec.<br><br>Translocate: If I were to TL somebody else out of combat (so that the mob that's killing them would kill me instead??), there is the basic Translocate spell (8 sec). TL them to Nexus instead of the bind point is 10 sec. But TL to PoK (and some other places) is 15 sec. Why? What possible purpose other than just being inconvenient can that serve?<br><br>None of those spells with extra long casting times are used to escape combat. They are used quite as intended - to transport groups and raids to and from perfectly safe places around the world. And that's where players' time is simply wasted for no real reason.<br></div>
