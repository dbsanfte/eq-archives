    <title>Veteran AA question</title>
    <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Veterans&amp;message.id=239385</link>
    <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I have had 4 veteran AA's since last year when I purchased the 1 year extended&amp;nbsp;plan and received my extra AA. (character was born april 2002)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Now that the next Veteran AA went live today, Will I receive the 5th Veteran AA too?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>This whole thing has me confused as well. I started playing 3-19-99 and have had an active account since. When the annual plan came out, I bought it right away and have been paying yearly since. My account shows 7.8 years though. I'm confused how I can have less then the 8 year vet reward when I do the annual renewal and my account actually hit 7 physical years 3 months ago. I got a message from a GM telling me that I have another 120 days left before my "8 years" are up.. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A second problem I have that I only have vet rewards on 4 of the 7 characters on my account, and it will not allow me to claim rewards on the 3 other characters. When I try it says all of my rewards have already been claimed...&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>I hate to bump this thread again, but it has been over 24 hours.&amp;nbsp; Can we please get some resonse as to whether the 2 year sub will give us vet rewards in adavance, on time (like monthly subscribers), or an answer indicating that at least this thread has been read by an SOE employee?&amp;nbsp; the "locked for two years"a nswer by CS makes no logical sense.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>First, the "locked for two years" bit sounds like CS not understanding the question. &lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
What I believe they mean is: when you buy two years, you're credited&#xD;
for those two years in advance. Because of this, you won't increase&#xD;
anymore until those two years finish. Since you're credited with what&#xD;
you have paid for, you can't get more credit until you pay again, and&#xD;
you can't pay again until what you've already paid for expires.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
(and quite frankly, I wouldn't give much weight to what CS says. They&#xD;
aren't perfect, and they certainly don't know everything about the&#xD;
game. I give much more credit to the thought-out and researched&#xD;
comments posted by Kytherea and the Devs than any off-the-cuff comment&#xD;
by&#xD;
a CS rep. If nothing else, consider the CS rep you chat with has to&#xD;
respond right away off the top of his head. dev/halfling posts on the&#xD;
other hand are made with enough time for them to reasearch the facts&#xD;
before responding.)&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
As for the "problem" with folks who renewed in late May... I don't see&#xD;
that as much proof, or even suggestion, of any problem. The sticky post&#xD;
is quite clear they only update the veteran entitlements once a month.&#xD;
It doesn't say what day of the month. Until a full month has passed&#xD;
since the day you got charged for your renewal (and note I say the day&#xD;
you got charged, not the day you changed your options), you can't&#xD;
really claim there's a problem.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
For example, last week changed one of my accounts that was monthly to&#xD;
2-year. However, the existing month doesn't expire until June 28, 2006.&#xD;
I won't get billed for the 2 years until that date. At that point, I will&#xD;
be eligible for 2 more years of veteran rewards. However, it could take&#xD;
up to a month until I get it, because I don't know what day of the&#xD;
month they run the update on. If they run it on the 27th of every&#xD;
month, I'll have missed it by 1 day and have to wait until July 27th to&#xD;
get the update.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
I think a lot of the confusion comes from players not realizing that&#xD;
this doesn't happen instantly or a few days after you change your&#xD;
subscription options. You need to pay attention to when your account is&#xD;
going to renew, and factor that, along with the monthly update, into&#xD;
your figuring about when you'll get your vet AA's.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
As for expecting acknowledgment from SOE.. Well, I wouldn't hold my&#xD;
breath. Unless you've got some solid evidence that it's not working as&#xD;
they claim here, I think you're going to be faced with them being tired&#xD;
of repeating themselves endlessly. Searching these forums there's a&#xD;
whole lot of threads just like this one. I can't speak for any Sony&#xD;
employees, but I know I'd get awfully tired of answering the same&#xD;
question over-and-over again despite there being a stickied post about&#xD;
it.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
If you've got solid proof of a CC being charged and 31 days elapsing&#xD;
without the account getting credited for the extra time, post it and&#xD;
give SOE hell about it. If you know someone who renewed in late May,&#xD;
check back with them in late June.. and when you do, ask em what day&#xD;
they got charged. (ie: make sure they aren't working from they day they&#xD;
changed their options.).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Yup, they fixed it yesterday.&amp;nbsp; Kytherea posted about it in this thread :&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Veterans&amp;amp;message.id=242143&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seems there really was a problem after all, and it is now fixed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks again Kytherea&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Your rewards are based on (A) the total of time you have &lt;U&gt;paid&lt;/U&gt; for previously and (B) the amount of time you have pre-purchased.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Taking a year off doesn't count to your total when you come back.&amp;nbsp; The free month people got when they first bought the game doesn't count. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;If your character is 4 years old now, the only way you would get the 5th year Vet AA is to pre-pay far enough into the future&amp;nbsp;(like a 1-year plan) to make your account qualify for the 5th year.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; For you, it would mean having paid for EQ through May 2007 at least. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The easy way to check is go into game and type /played, and it will tell you how many years you have credited to your account according to SoE calculations&amp;nbsp;(Mine is 7.4 years)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Zacatac_BB on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;06-13-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;05:24 PM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;While I agree it is confusing that no dev has commented one way or the other on if paying in advance will gain you the rewards in advance, the one year and two year subscriptions still offer the best reason to go that route: lower monthly subscription fees, plus a garuntee that you won't be charged more money if SOE raises their rates in the interum.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Getting the Vet rewards in advance is a nice bonus to that, but if that is the only reason why folks would do that, then people out there have a lot more money to waste than I do.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Hahaha --- we have established that I have way more money to waste than you do --- so what?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;This is from the Veteran Award FAQ:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Veteran Rewards are based on the entitled time on your account: how many paid days your account has been subscribed&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;*You can see an ESTIMATED time for how much time an account has by typing /play in game. This will give you the time in years, but it is rounded so there may be some discrepancies.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;*Veteran rewards are updated once a month, therefore if your account rolls over to another year of rewards in the middle of the month you will not see a change until the next month&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Sorry folks I missed this thread somehow when it started.&amp;nbsp; Yes there&#xD;
was a database problem that was causing VR entitled time not to update&#xD;
properly and VR were not being awarded as they should have.&amp;nbsp; This issue&#xD;
has been fixed.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;This statment means pretty much was a PP said.&amp;nbsp; If your account expires on say June 30th&amp;nbsp; showing you have 2.3 years of eligible time and you renew with a 2 year subscription, when the VR updater is run in that first week of July you will be credited for the two years and I believe your account then shows as 5.3 years eligible.&amp;nbsp; You will not see increases in time from month to month.&amp;nbsp; The next increase in eligible time would come after your current subscription ended and whatever new subscription you may choose starts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Veteran Rewards are based on the entitled time on your account: how many paid days your account has been subscribed&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;*You can see an ESTIMATED time for how much time an account has by typing /play in game. This will give you the time in years, but it is rounded so there may be some discrepancies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;*Veteran rewards are updated once a month, therefore if your account rolls over to another year of rewards in the middle of the month you will not see a change until the next month&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*If you bought a year's subscription your account will be credited for that year&lt;/strong&gt;. Your entitled time will not increase until that entire year has passed and you sign up for another subscription (be that a 1 month, 3 month, or year plan).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;I doesn't mention the two year plan, and CS/GM's are both saying they are no longer doing this for any prepaid type plans.&amp;nbsp; THIS is the part that needs to be clarified, but so far the clarification request is just being ignored.&amp;nbsp; I wish I understood why.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How about:&lt;br&gt;Yes, you will get vet rewards&lt;br&gt;no, you will not get vet rewards&lt;br&gt;-or-&lt;br&gt;We hear you and will look in to it&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Any of the above is beter than ignoring us and these conflicting policy representations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>My total time played has been 3.6 years for... a year. I have prepaid until May 2007 and it is still at 3.6 years.&lt;br&gt;Petitioned and was told 'you have so and so many days played that's all you get'.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I *should* have 4.6 years played, if the pre-paid time still counts, but it has not been updated and the India GM's are clueless it seems and can only fire back canned responses without ever actually reading the petition.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have the same issue on two accounts. Neither one of them had the time updated when the payment went through.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am not going to waste my time arguing with them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;BTW - I *know* they don't read the petitions. If they did, then I wouldn't get a reply about a NAME issue in response to a VET AA petition on one of the two accounts.</description>

      <description>I just hope we can get some kind of a clarification without needing a 20 page thread to get an SOE employees attention.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once a thread slips off to page two or three, it is a dead issue and won't even be read.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Have the Veteran rEwards been updated yet for the month of June?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;My own subscription automatically renewed for one year in the middle of May (the 18th to be precise).&amp;nbsp; However, the "total time entitled on this account" that can be seen when hitting /played in game, has been sitting at 5.6 years for what will be 13 months this upcoming monday.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I'm guessing that it hasn't been updated for June yet - despite the claims (if memory serves) that it would be early on in the month that they get updated.&amp;nbsp; If it has been updated already, let me know so I can fire off an in game petition :P&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Yeah - I guess "paying in advance" doesn't get you anything any more.&amp;nbsp; I just did the two year plan and I have played since the game went live in 1999, and they told me I don't rate the eighth veteran award yet ---- the whole thing is pretty confusing :(&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;hr&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Because paying $8.34 a month instead of the normal rates = nothing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;While I agree it is confusing that no dev has commented one way or the other on if paying in advance will gain you the rewards in advance, the one year and two year subscriptions still offer the best reason to go that route: lower monthly subscription fees, plus a garuntee that you won't be charged more money if SOE raises their rates in the interum.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Getting the Vet rewards in advance is a nice bonus to that, but if that is the only reason why folks would do that, then people out there have a lot more money to waste than I do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;The confusion is the issue, we all realize that the main bonus for buying a one or two year plan is the cost savings.&amp;nbsp; The confusion is that there is a post in the sticky section of this forum stating that vet rewards are based on PAID time, not played time.&amp;nbsp; This position has been repeated many times by by&amp;nbsp; SOE Community Service Manager, Kytherea.&amp;nbsp; This appears to have changed according to CS reps and GM's.&amp;nbsp; We have asked repetedly in these forums for clarification, and haven't gotten a reply.&amp;nbsp; A reply with clarification is what we are looking for, not a handout.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, we are being told that we will recieve no further vet rewards until AFTER our two year billing has ended.&amp;nbsp; I hade 4.2 years paid and played time when I switched from monthly billing to the two year plan.&amp;nbsp; I am told I will be stuck at that same 4.2 years for the next two years with no further vet rewards.&amp;nbsp; Had I stayed on monthly billing, I would become eligable for year 5, and year 6 before that two years is up.&amp;nbsp; As it stands right now, I will not receive these rewards when they are due, but will have to wait an additional 1.2 years for my 5 year reward, and .2 years for my 6 year reward.&amp;nbsp; I will receive my 5 and 6 year reward at 6.2 years played time.&amp;nbsp; We just want to know if this is the case, or if we have been misinformed.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am not asking for anything extra for paying for 2 years, but I do expect to at least be treated the same as you monthly subscribers.&amp;nbsp; There was nothing indicating I would have a second rate account for buyng 2 years vs. having a first rate account for paying monthly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
