<P>How many of you people complaining have a maxed LDoN Charm aug? I was the first person on my server to finish the Wayfarers charm - and I did it in a mix of guild groups and pick up groups. I have no problem with having a new charm aug that is attainable to everyone, regardless of tier.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I was the top Ranger in the top guild on my server when I did the LDoN aug - and my closest competition was from non-raiders. We might need to redefine "Casual and Raider" into "Hardcore and non-Hardcore" players. I know tons of hardcore players who never raid. I know even more raiders that play extremely casually. </P>
<P>EQ is a social game. Devs and content designers want to see players interact with each other. That is why this game was created, and still exists. Meet people, work together for a common goal, and gain the rewards of that teamwork. Don't be offended if an aug is added that is doable by non-raiders as well as raiders. One aug isn't going to suddenly close the gap in risk vs reward for your overall gear profiles.</P>
<P>You can still use guild-only groups to achieve the reward - you don't have to socialize with new folks if you don't want to. But having the option to do so is nice, and that option is&nbsp;the foundation upon which this great game was built. </P>
