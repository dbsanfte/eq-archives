      <title>Questions &amp; suggestions for the progressive server.</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Progression&amp;message.id=1232#M1232</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;Questions first, will the Warrens, Hole, Stonebrunt and Jaggedpine be avalible on day one of the server? Will the Qeynos Badge of Honour quests be in the game, will the Greenmist quest be avalible when RoK is opened? Will there be GM events?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Suggestions next, please make this server with the FV rules set, TLC on all zones and everthing can be traded save epics once intoduced. It cannot hurt to model this new server on arguably the most successful concept expansion server that SOE has introduced to date. Also i would like to see the drops from the halloween event  ( at least i think it was over halloween ) the game as long as we are headed back in time.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>I'm sorry but I must disagree with you, Daelaan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I love playing on FV, but that has everything to do with the community and roleplaying, and nothing to do with the mechanics and removal of the NO TRADE tag.  I also realize that while FV is my home, I would be willing to lay money that it is among the least populated servers, and probably the least populated server in the game, period.  It is only a success in that it gave the RPers a home; I don't believe anything other than the attraction of RP had anything to do with the relatively mature and friendly playerbase.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

Dont forget Temple of Solro, SolC (forget its real name), Nedaria's Landing as well.</description>
