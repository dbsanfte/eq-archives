    <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I dont remember the exact amount, but I got a demi+ ranger with 2.0 and omm 1hb same setup as me to do a test on test server behind lvl 70 npc with only 50% haste, same accuracy, same cleave, same fero, max offensive aa equivalent CE and I got about 440 dps and ranger got about 410 or so.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;add kicks, you get about 30 dps&lt;br&gt;add dragon fang you get about 40 dps&lt;br&gt;thats about 70 more dps&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;add nukes to a ranger, and thats a lot more than 70 dps and thats my concern, they keep getting more and more nukes/focus and disc that give them more dps and monks are stuck at a base level with barely any increase but petty 5% weapon upgrade each expansion that doesn't really give us much of an upgrade.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;lot of things come into play on dps tho, laziness, lag, among other things, some people are just not very **SMURF** about their dps and may not always click their nuke or kick or whatever when its up so that does affect your dps somewhat...&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;btw for any rangers that may read this I have no problem with your dps, i'm not asking for it to be nerf'd I just feel that monks need a little bit more love.&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Nedrom on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;04-18-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;08:09 PM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;In the recent top 10, several people stated that they thought DPS was our biggest class issue.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;What do people feel are some of our issues with regards DPS ?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The unlinking of some of our DPS discs so they are limitted by Endurance and their own timers (cf. Speed Focus &amp;amp; Inner Flame)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The none-scalability of our special attacks with content and items.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The lack of itemisation available for our special attacks (ie, +FK)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The availability of monk weaponry (ie, HtH). An example was DoN where there is not a single HtH weapon in the expansion (&lt;em&gt;except for crystal purchased&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;Remember when discussing DPS and providing parses or figures to include all variables, as without context a parse is meaningless.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I believe the only time I feel a total waste of space is when the raid leader says “this is a range fight only”. There am I with my summoned fangs getting hits in the 20’s and the rogue next to me is spamming me with 300+ crits I think to myself I might as well FD and go to sleep.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>1 messed up patch to correct the incorrect flurry/ramp message issue&#xD;
doesnt mean theres tons of ae rampage mobs out there that screw with&#xD;
our dps.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
There is a fair amount, but every one allows max melee range to avoid&#xD;
it (well, devlin is an utter **HALFLING** for that - i can never find the&#xD;
proper spot).&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
I hardly think that we should be pressing for increased range dps.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

      <description>he selected that one to stay so my statement was correct.&amp;nbsp; He orginally only reconized less than 12 things in game that this effected.&amp;nbsp; Todate my count so far is now up to 16.&amp;nbsp; From what I have seen on the few 2.0 fights I have done since patch I would bet that a large number of 2.0 fights and perhaps 1.5 fights are also waiting to be added to the list.&amp;nbsp; If people don't do those fights and post them this week they will likly be there for good that would also count as selectivity in changing them back.&amp;nbsp; IE only changing back the ones people complain about/notice int he first week or 2 of the change.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>I'm not sure why people want ranged DPS so badly. I don't recall really fighting a mob with "ranged" DPS since Fennin Ro back when he was hard. Even then, I remember going in and meleeing a few times with a designated druid healer. Point is, you can certainly do melee DPS on AE rampage mobs, if you guild can adjust accordingly. I know some guild may be stubborn to do so, but it would be in their best interest, as their raid DPS would go up on said mobs, dramatically.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, I understand that it is currently rough on mobs like Harrier, Vangl, etc. (I haven't done them in a while, but I imagine it would have been rough back then when we were doing them). However, these mobs that it is truly a hinderance on, it is being fixed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for monk DPS, I am always in the top 5 on both "all night" parses (trash mobs) and single fight parses. On our Deathknell raid the other night (no trash, just bosses/events), I came out #1 in the all night parse. Usually I am behind a rogue or two. Parses for us are something like rogue, rogue, monk, monk, rogue, monk, berserker, monk, rogue, wizard. Yeah, I'm BSing a bit with the exact order because it changes nightly, but it is usually something along those lines&amp;nbsp; with people moving up/down 1-2 spots. Point is, rangers and warriors are almost never in the top 10. I don't know if your warriors are Gods in the making, or if your DPS classes are just slacking, but your parses seem to be off.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'd be happy to post a raid/event parse sometime if you'd like.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>At the equivalent gear level, the class that's most out of whack with&#xD;
Monks IMO are Berserkers.&amp;nbsp; They can snare, stun (making them great&#xD;
offtanks), and have all sorts of offensive discs.&amp;nbsp; In my last&#xD;
guild they didn't do DPS groups too often, so my numbers may seem low&#xD;
compared to some, but with 2.0/Shyra Fangs, 136 ACC, Cleave V, Fero 5,&#xD;
all offensive AA's, 8% overhaste, I'm usually somewhere between 550-600&#xD;
sustained DPS, on named fights I'm usually somewhere between 600-high&#xD;
700's, with Intensity and IF and whatever I have left somewhere between&#xD;
900-1000 (once per day, assuming the fight doesn't last much longer&#xD;
then the Vet AA lasts).&amp;nbsp; But in general I'm going to parse under&#xD;
700 DPS on most nameds clearing someplace like Tacvi or even CoA where&#xD;
I don't have IF up for every fight.&amp;nbsp; Our 2.0 Zerker with 91 Acc,&#xD;
Fero V, Cleave V, no clickie overhaste, is over 1K every fight, and&#xD;
I've heard him break well over 1200 (and mind you that's not in a DPS&#xD;
"group", and that's no Vet AA).&amp;nbsp; He outdamages our 2.0 Rogues&#xD;
pretty much everytime we've parsed (I don't recall ever hearing him be&#xD;
#2, and I realize our Rogues could use a little more work.......but&#xD;
they aren't that poorly equipped).&amp;nbsp; While it would be nice to&#xD;
compare to Rogues, they hold agro even worse then I do, their DPS from&#xD;
the front isn't that spectacular, and they don't bring much else to the&#xD;
table other then CR and DPS.&amp;nbsp; But for F's sakes, there's no&#xD;
justification for the DPS gap between Monks and Zerkers.&amp;nbsp; Oh and&#xD;
on AE Ramp ranged fights he doesn't do 30 DPS like I do either.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Am I asking for Zerkers to get nerfed?&amp;nbsp; Not at all.&amp;nbsp; But in&#xD;
any kind of class balance discussion involving melee classes,&#xD;
Berserkers are the people we are the furthest behind as a class.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
There's not much pulling skills involved anymore, even in the majority&#xD;
of group content.&amp;nbsp; Which is faster, splitting a Nest mission, or&#xD;
letting the tank pull 2-3 at a time?&amp;nbsp; It's not even close.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
Rogue DPS can vary widely, it's not uncommon for me to beat most of the&#xD;
Guilds rogues.&amp;nbsp; But I don't recall ever hearing the numbers for a&#xD;
fight and beating the Berzerker, in fact on nameds the only way I can&#xD;
come within 200 DPS is using Intensity of the Resolute.&amp;nbsp; Given all&#xD;
of their other abilities, that seems out of whack.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

      <description>Honestly, TR has a main berserker and another one applying right now, and I really don't see their named or trash DPS being that high. Back when we had a main zerker in Anguish (he ended up retiring), he was always near the top of the list, especially on fights like AMV. However, in Demiplane and PoR, I have not seen this happen at all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Perhaps their itemization has sucked and they have fallen behind where they once were? I don't know. All I can tell you is that our main berserker rarely even breaks the top 5 in any sort of parse. Those spots are all occupied by rogues and monks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, with Warcry, it's a completely different story. It's an invaluable asset to any raid, and I'd keep a zerker around for that ability alone, even if their DPS sucked. :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Hi! Remember this thread? We will not be able to compete with rogues&#xD;
and berserkers in our primary role EVER until we have our special&#xD;
attacks scale somehow&amp;nbsp; and our weapon ratio advantage is given&#xD;
back to us. When is something going to be done? I'm seeing outrageous&#xD;
numbers being thrown out by a class that was never supposed to&#xD;
outdamage us in the first place, yet here we sit with nothing done. &lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Now its warriors and rangers we compete with on parses and they many&#xD;
times outdamage us. So bards pull, warriors and rangers DPS, what&#xD;
exactly is it monks are good at again? Oh I know, we got FD and mend&#xD;
right?&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Sick of this **SMURF**.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

      <description>On DP fights I compete with rogues for top total damage slot, so I'm not sure what you're doing to be around warrior level dps.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Well, I'm not doing anything much different than you were 2 months ago&#xD;
when you agreed with what many of us&amp;nbsp; had to say in the DPS&#xD;
thread. I guess you got a few new pieces of gear though so all monks&#xD;
must be balanced DPS wise. &lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;I've never competed with warriors for dps even when I was an applicant to an Anguish+ level guild.&amp;nbsp; Even as an APP I outparsed a lot of people.&amp;nbsp; I think a lot of it has to do with playstyle and how determined you are to better yourself as a player.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Non raiding monks require a dps boost of sorts and easier access to weapons.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the top end however, monks rely too much on itemization, and AA's for DPS but once you reach that level you're sitting pretty.&amp;nbsp; Things like this have to be carefully balanced.&amp;nbsp; We don't rely so much on endurance for dps like Rogues and Berserkers do and the last thing I want is for that to happen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;I've went over all of this and i have a question though small it might seem.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Why is the "excuse" of rangers being a hybrid class not valid anymore? &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I'm only in tacvi so i'm not going to discuss parse's, etc. (Though i will say zerker dps without 200aa's&amp;nbsp;at least and 2.0 is sad, so they are not really very well balanced at all either)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</description>
