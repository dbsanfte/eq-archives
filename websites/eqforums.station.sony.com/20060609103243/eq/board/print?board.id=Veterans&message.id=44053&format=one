				<P>I just discovered this old thread and can't resist waking it back up...<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Keeping the flag requirement for elemental planes&nbsp;(below Time) is a sad anachronism in todayâ€™s game.&nbsp; Since Earth, Fire, Water and Air yield loot that can be single grouped elsewhere, why would ANYONE want to put in the time to do this?&nbsp; This does not even consider the fact that you have to go into servitude into some uber elitist guild to get it done.&nbsp; I am by no means a "casual" player.&nbsp; I have an entire stable of 66+ characters that I leveled from scratch and play daily.&nbsp; I do not however enjoy taking part in what I consider to be the hassle and loss of individual skill that comes with committing to&nbsp;large guilds or large raids.&nbsp; Right or wrong this is just a statement of&nbsp;fact about&nbsp;my preference and not open for discussion here.&nbsp;What is important to discuss here however is the viability of the elemental planes with the advent of GoD and OOW.&nbsp; <BR>Whether or not I need the planes, I personally do not see why any person in their right mind would mess with the hassles required to get into EP now.&nbsp; All my characters are EP level geared and not a single one is EP flagged.&nbsp; We have TONS of content yet left to explore.&nbsp; We can do it ALL with 12 people or less (half of which are twoboxed)&nbsp;and most with 6 or less.&nbsp; All it takes is intelligent play (for every member of the group - no weak players tolerated) and a little guts.<BR>I suspect that very soon there will be less and less people in the elemental planes and that&nbsp;EP will die unless most of them have their entrance requirements re-thought.&nbsp; I would not argue if they created single groupable quests to get it done and might even do them during the boredom hours in the middle of the night.&nbsp; They should however consider just opening them up based on level and moving on.&nbsp; That is a better alternative than leaving some nice zones to die through attrition.&nbsp; Since the content in those zones is not particularly friendly (in most cases) to weak guilds, what would it hurt after the intial zerg rush of tourists?<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>I realize the raids give many weak players a short path into uber gear and areas by riding on the skill of the others in the raid, but maybe we should put our foot down and make people EARN what they get.&nbsp; Requiring large difficult raids also allows just a few elitist guilds keep their egos pumped up, but who cares besides them?&nbsp; If the planes empty out due to the good players heading to&nbsp;PG and KT, all that will be left in the planes will be the weak players.&nbsp; That would be sad.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Please do not consider this a flame.&nbsp; While I'd like to see an elemental plane just because I have never been there, I have no burning desire to do so..&nbsp;&nbsp; Given the illustrious and uber legacy of EP, it will however be a shame to see them waste away.</P>
