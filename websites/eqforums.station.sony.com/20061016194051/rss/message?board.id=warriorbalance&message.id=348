    <title>Removing Defensive/Evasive from the game</title>
    <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=warriorbalance&amp;message.id=348</link>
    <description>&lt;DIV&gt;There are very few things in the game today that are as unbalancing in the game as defensive and evasive.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;These two abilites are so powerful, content in the game is balanced in the game specifically so that it is challenging, WITH the use of defensive and evasive. Along with clerical complete healing, it has been breaking the game for years now.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Nowhere is this so apparent than with the recent GoD issues. With content being designed FOR the use of defensive, the other two tanks are in danger of being marginalized in favor of warriors. This situation is exacerrated by the ever more commonly placed defensive requiring mobs that are placed in new expansions.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Defensive is overpowered and unbalancing. In their quest to make new content challenging, the devs are breaking the game. Content that is challenging for knights to tank, is trivial to a warrior with defensive. On the other side of the coin, content that is fine for warriors with defensive to tank, is excessively difficult for knights to tank. Defensive is breaking the game.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;What is on the lips of many players of the game, is giving a lesser form of defensive to knights, so that they may be given an improved ability to tank mobs that are balanced for warriors with defensive. I feel that that is the wrong approach. I believe that for the health of the game and for the ultimate happiness of the players, it's time to get rid of defensive and evasive in its entirely. These problems are just going to keep occurring over and over again until the problem is fixed.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Here's how I feel it could be done.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;#1: Give warriors a permanent further increase in damage mitigation and avoidance, so that the remain clearly the best choice for tanking nameds. Not nearly as much as defensive and evasive give, of course, but enough to offset the fact that defensive is gone, but that this increase is on a permanent basis. I feel that a 7.5% bonus to mitigation, and 5% to avoidance, is a balanced amount to give.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;#2: Rebalance named mobs by reducing the DB and DI. Reduce these numbers by about 25%, so that while they hit a little bit harder to a warrior with no defensive or evasive but improved mitigation and avoidance capabilites, that is offset by the fact that they will still be getting hit for that 3.5 minutes later, when the pre-changes warrior would have defensive wear off, and be taknig the full force of the mob's attacks.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;#3: Compensate the loss of defensive/evasive from the warrior's ability set by giving them some abilities that allow them to contribute to the group in places where the warrior's superior ability to take damage is rendered irrelevant and useless. After all, in most groups, as long as the tank can take damage "well enough" to not die, they don't really care HOW much better he is than the next guy. This is why you hear beastlords, rangers, and monks tanking in groups in content that is considered trivial. They tank "well enough", but they add significantly to the group in other ways.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Specific suggestions for the warrior ability sets are short duration (think bard song) affects that are endurance based and add some&amp;nbsp;affects, alone or in combination,&amp;nbsp;to the group:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;War Cries:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;-minor attack and/or v3 haste buff (Warrior's getting the morale of the group up with a rallying cry)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;-minor HP and mana regen buff (10HP/tick, 5mana/tick) (warrior causing the hearts and minds of his compadres to race and flow quicker)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;"Called Shots" with a heavy endurance cost, possibly replacing the melee attack for that round with a single hit)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;snare (IE, tendon slicing, charley horse, smash the kneecap)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Short duration stun (boot to the head, smash the solar plexus)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;armour smash (no damage, but AC reduction)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;etc, etc.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Removing defensive/evasive from the game in favor of a permanent, lower bonus to mitigation and avoidance would mean that content could be balanced much easier now, and in all future expansions. Warriors would still remain the undisputed king of taking damage, without taking it to such extremes. Mob damage would be kept down to sensible levels, enough that they can still take the damage being put out if they are required to. The extra abilities given to warriors would give them a reason to be in a group that doesn't really care about having the beefiest tank possible. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;These aren't firm or complete numbers and ideas that I'm putting out, by any means. What this is, is an initial idea, subject to lots and lots of ideas, balancing, and testing, but ultimately to the betterment of the game.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I don't believe it's even too difficult to rebalance it, when put up against the fact of exactly how much it can do for the game. You're only, after all, changing the NAMEDS by probably very close to a set amount for each, not every mob. Probably don't even need to adjust all of them either.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Defensive and evasive has been breaking the game for years. for all of it's usefulness, it's time for it to go, I think.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>""I can tell you that one time and one time only that I've been in the #1&#xD;
guild on our server have I seen a Warrior MAing a raid. When I did it&#xD;
for Hanvar, I had to make an Assist Me key - I didn't even have one. It&#xD;
certainly doesn't indescriminately announce "Assist &amp;lt;insert Warrior&#xD;
name here&amp;gt;" I've seen Warriors MT Mastrugs back in the olden days,&#xD;
&#xD;
but that's tanking a hard hitting mob, not acting as the raid's MA."&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
I'm often the one making tanking assignments on raids, and while I&#xD;
usually use a knight MA on trash, anymore there's not a huge difference&#xD;
in using a warrior, I've even assigned 'em to add tank on boss fights&#xD;
on occaision.&amp;nbsp; For plow tanks the award usually goes to the first&#xD;
person to respond to "Josahd tells the tank channel:&amp;nbsp; who's gtg?",&#xD;
be it warrior, pally, SK.&amp;nbsp; On hanvar specifically I don't think it&#xD;
makes much sense to have a tank calling the assists anyways, the person&#xD;
tanking is generally whoever gets aggro first, and the person calling&#xD;
assists is usually a rogue or necro.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#6633ff&gt;As a shadowknight with about 700 AAs, I have NO trouble tanking regular group content less perhaps 10% of the regular group content mobs.&amp;nbsp; Again, this is reasonable, if I wanted to tank EVERY group content mob out there I would have rolled a war.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#6633ff&gt;The knights gimped Defensive gave us a slight edge that allowed us to tank perhaps another one percent of the mobs that we previously could not.&amp;nbsp; As a knight I am at the tanking level I should be.&amp;nbsp; Nothing is broken.&amp;nbsp; Nothing needs fixing.&amp;nbsp; War Defensive and Evasive is as it should be.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You know BB a regular monk can beat you up, so haveing a Platemonk outclass you only makes sense.   Course there would be the weight problem and agility problems of wearing plate that would be a really big hinderance for them. You know that of course yes?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for mana and agro. Bert, I have not once run out of mana in any raid fight except on the very rare ones that have massive mana dots. Those fights are designed to test mana reserves and mana useage strats. Other than that I can cast agro spells pretty much for hours with out haveing to med. So while my agro maybe tied dramatically to mana use, I don't have a lot of mana issues.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Hehe, then we'd all use drunken gnomes with jester pets...&lt;span&gt;:smileyhappy:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There's always been content with situational advantages. It's something intentionall in a stae of flux. However, our knights are not marginalized in any signifcant manner in DPOB. They can get pushed to the rear of a raid stuffed into a little hallway and drag multiple mobs back to them through the raid inluding stunning bats and annoying vampires, so I dunno. The do the same stuff in many places and are seldom compromised the way warriors often are by debuffs to their ability to lock down targets fast. Not so it shows anywhere near as signifcantly. I'd sat if anything they are better off now then they were in sme GOD content where they were more likely to simply die. Most of the trash is relatively light dps and just needs good fast control. Some of it blows peopoe around, some spin stuns while out of range, some just tends to get pushed and a lot of the areas we are in are cramped. I can tank one mb and turn and have to try to plow through the raid to the next mob.  My knight firends turn, tgt, cast and they have it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don't see where nights are signifcantly marginalized in DPOB so far. We're only tier one though. Even if they are marginalized somewhere it's nothing new in EQ, it happens to all classes. It's not like SOE is permenantly designing content to marginalizeKnight off tanking. Our concerns and what brought me here are about long term ramifications to our class design. Not one zone's tendancy to favor us.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If al the offtank trash required warrior discs to tank I could see a real problem if there was reaso to believe that was going to be a future design trend. Has it is our knights are doing great in DPOB /shrug. Almost every trash mob is locked down by one of our knights on approach. Exceptions would be mid raid spawns and excessive numbers. Even then some knights will have 2 aggroed and locked down before they get to the raid and warriors will pick up one or more of those from them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I've seen that basic stuff everytime we've gone to DPOB. On top of which SKs are handy running around on the sisters event$.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;You're right. You did repeat it over and over and over. Which was really thick headed since I was never arguing that point with you to begin with. Yes, those advantage are there. No, they do not have a major impact on MA'ing (ie standing in front of the raid and locking aggro on trash mobs, not calling targets, not non-damage offtanking, or anything else you want to claim I said) in the described zones. DP, among other zones, does not offer the same benefits to knight MA's as previous end-game zones such as CoA. Why is that so hard for you to accept?&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by BertyB on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;05-17-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;09:59 PM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

      <description>I'm not the only one you manged to fool. Obviously, your point was not clearly made if you agree with me that knights do have the advantages i listed in aggro control. Knights themselves thought you were making the same argument I saw. In any case if you agree with those points then there's no point in continuing really. I kinda find you tiresome anyways and i'm not sure why you're hanging in the warrior forums except to cause trouble hehe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite what you say they CAN have a major impact on MAing, I've seen it and been on both ends. thats subject to a lot of other conditions though and is not the subject of my argument. Our knights still show those very same aggro advantages to good effect in DPOB. So, i don't know why it's a problem for you. This is highly situational stuff, but, i still see knights locking down trash and forcing that trash to move to them EVEN through the raid every day we are in DPOB. You say thats not possible /shrug.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

It is also harder around mezzables to generate the same aggro as a knight as quickly. Partly due to the fact a knight starts generating aggro when they tgt the mob. Suggesting that are classes are equal at this basic component of offtanking is totally false. Situationall we may be advantaged, but, in general knights are stronger at this and so they should be. In fact for actual aggro control a ton of classes are better than warriors hehe, it's just most of them can't tank it. Rangers and beasts are actually more effective at locking incoming mobs and sometimes they can even tank them well. Of course tha's due to the light dps on a lot of DPOB trash.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yeah, if there are enough tanks compared to mobs and everything is going perfectly well anyone can stand out front of the raid and aggo single incoming mobs np. Thats never been an issue. It's when things are more stressful that abilities like strong ranged aggro come into play. It's also not true that knights do not have an advantage on aggro control with mobs like orcs. it's just the advantage is smaller with some mobs and greater with others. It's still significant.  When orcs and undead come towards the raid I am often doing nothing these days, just manging stuff and chatting. While i am doing that it has always been my habit to flip through incoming targets and watch how the aggro is handled and how the tank fares. I often stand at the front of the raid while doing this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If aggro actually manges to get close to the raid with a puller, or, non capable tank (dps wise), I will generally toss an aggro disc on it until someone peals. it's not much aggro though and easiliy taken by a mez attempt, or, healing. See on a mezzable mob that hits hard I will be quickly forced to turn on attack to prevent the healer from over aggroing my weak disc while keeping me up. That can get messy. In any case, it is totally normal for me to do that to an orc and immediately see a knights name overwrite mine on HOTT. Then I watch the orc run past me and to where ever the knight happens to be atm. Thats normal stuff even in DPOB in my experience. It's also the way I have always understood knight /  warrior interplay. It's a good thing. I have not seen a weakening of Knight control in DPOB. It may be there, but, it is not signifcant enough to place them on equal footing with warriors by any means.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That doesn't mean I can't stand out front of a raid and aggro singles all day. that's really not the point i was trying to make.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>You may be right that devs won't listen. However, where else should one post? I've posted here and on steelwarrior. I really have no interest in debate outside of the future of the warrior class and well EQ. i could say nothing like i generally do, or., I could post here. I'm not aware of a better option?&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Correct me if I'm wrong, but is Maddar now trying to pass off that mobs who have endurance drains that take a 30 minute recovery time, and mobs that have insanely high damage shields don't favor knights?  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Demiplane is THE most knight friendly trash clearing zone in EQ. &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;It hampers which mana regen?  The FT20ish you get from AA, FT etc?  Or the other 20 mana regen you get from C6?   Or was it the 9 you get from Oak/Crusader/whatever?  Or the 10 you get from SA?  If I'm LUCKY and don't get poisoned wine from that damned jester, I can buff 3 end regen per tick.&lt;/div&gt;</description>
