				<DIV>I really like the Task system.&nbsp; A lot has changed in it from beginning of Beta to now, and I think the changes are all for the better.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I've mostly been working on tasks from level 20 - 35.&nbsp; Last couple of days I've been leveling up a couple of babies to 5ish to try the first tasks (can't betabuff under 20).&nbsp; Have done human, iksar, and now working on a gnome.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I agree the water is absolutely awesome.&nbsp; I was running a 20 beastlord task from shar vahl and came out of Paludal at the Hollowshade side and was completely mouth-dropping WOW moment floored at the sight of the water.&nbsp; It was a complete surprise to me, didn't know the water had changed.&nbsp; It is not just in new zones but in old zones too.&nbsp; Have seen it in North Ro, Field of Bone, PoT, Abysmal, Natimbi, and Hollowshade.&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I currently have shadows on.&nbsp; It is nice for the novelty but I will probably turn it off for real play.&nbsp; I do however like the shading on the characters.&nbsp; Still old models but they look better.&nbsp; I found the hot steamy barb breath in halas to be rather disconcerting at first but have gotten used to it by now.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I have been to two of the new zones.&nbsp; One was outside and quite lovely in a sort of Luclin/GoD cross kind of way.&nbsp; The other a dungeon off that zone,&nbsp;it was ok.&nbsp; Ice wasn't transfered so I was a betabuffed 60 shaman.&nbsp; The dungeon was a bit...challenging... for two players at 60 but as soon as we added others (we went from 2 to 6 in a fairly short amount of time)&nbsp;&nbsp; The zone seemed rather small, at least what I saw on the map, but it was good for a couple groups.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>To stress, this expansion is NOT more GoD, you don't even go anywhere near GoD to get there.&nbsp; This is primarily a small grouping expansion and soloing at all levels (up to 65 anyway) by the task system.&nbsp; Also different than GoD the betabuff characters were I think much more "average" than the GoD betabuffs, especially the lower level characters.&nbsp; I think that made for more realistic tuning than the GoD characters.&nbsp; (and yes, I know... some people looked at the same character and thought the gear was awesome, some looked and thought the gear was junk.&nbsp; All depends on what you have as a frame of reference.)</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Warning to those that don't plan on getting it, there are new NPCs and new mobs in old zones.&nbsp; Some otherwise previously empty and unused zones might have a surprise or two that will get you if you are not paying attention.&nbsp; &lt;keeps her grumbling about a certains plains dragon to herself&gt;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I will admit, I haven't figured out the voice macros and would love some pointers on them.</DIV>
