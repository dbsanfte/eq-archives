				<div></div>Tonight (6/5/06) on the FV server, in Ruins of Takish a group of folks were obviously ghosting. They were taking down Criwea Strongbow without taking damage... blinking in and out of sight.&nbsp; As luck would have it there were 3 guides on, so I sent a tell to the highest level one. Long story short, according to the Guide they are not allowed to travel around for investigative work.&nbsp; I was told to submit a /report.&nbsp; Umm... How exactly is a non-exploiter expected to get close enough to a raid mob to /report someone ghosting?<br><br>Heck, speaking from experience, even when a GM does get on in time they do nothing. I petitioned against some folks who were ghosting in PoF about a month ago. Within maybe half an hour I got a response saying they had no evidence. The kicker is, the exploiters were STILL in the zone, still ghosting! So I petitioned again, telling if they actually looked instead of saying there's no evidence they'd have their evidence.&nbsp; Those folks are still around; nothing has been done.<br><br>So I have a few questions:<br>1- Why doesn't Sony trust their own Guides to go look and see if someone is exploiting?&nbsp; Why tie their hands like that?<br>2- Why do Guides tell players to submit a petition when by the time a GM sees it the exploiters will be gone anyway, but if the Guide simply went and took a look they'd see it first hand?<br>3- Why do Guides and GMs frustrate players by asking for a /report, when they should know full well that (1) a report won't prove ghosting and (2) it's basically impossible to get close enough to a raid boss to do a /report anyway?<br>4- Why do GMs say there's no evidence instead of simply going to take a look?<br><br>If proof of any of these claims is needed I can provide numbers for the petition responses, and screenshots/logs of the Guide conversation.<br><br>Thank you.<br>-Nashwan<div></div>
