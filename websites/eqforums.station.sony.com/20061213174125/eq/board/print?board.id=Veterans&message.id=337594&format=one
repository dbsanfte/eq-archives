<P>Simply to give raiders the option of purchasing the items. Every single item in EQ has raid equivalent items that are superior to single group, solo items. Personally I see no reason to drift from this trend especially since there are items presently in the game for charm slots from raid encounters.&nbsp; Subsequently flagging additional charms would not be overpowering. In reality this would help players plan their gear a lot more effectively as well as potentially ease some of the headaches for those responsible for itemization. I know I would appreciate less frustration as a player and assuredly would feel likewise if&nbsp;I were responsible for itemization.&nbsp;<BR></P></DIV>

<DIV>To reply to the second quote; In order to even raid the end zones of TSS requires TONS of grouping and solo tasks. This is yet another valid point to introduce raid level charm augs. Especially since the best charm aug to date, minus the Queen Sendaii and Emperor Draygun augs,&nbsp; was from LDoN which is how many expansions ago? <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-tongue.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0></DIV><p>Message Edited by MythSR on <span class=date_text>12-12-2006</span> <span class=time_text>09:36 PM</span>
