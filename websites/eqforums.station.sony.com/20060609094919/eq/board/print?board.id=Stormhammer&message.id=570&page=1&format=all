				<DIV>&nbsp;The calander is empty of events, shouldn't someone be posting the events for the rest of the month already? This months events should be full and next months worked on now.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;I also want events to start giving a start time.&nbsp; Having to logon for several hours to hurry-up and wait&nbsp;is not any fun. So what if many more people show up for events, isn't that the idea? that people pay more for events and&nbsp;know when they start?&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>When we login to stormhammer the next event should have the start time and zone announced with the "welcome to stormhammer" text.&nbsp; I want to be able to set a few hours aside in my rl work for events, 2 hours online not 6 hours online,&nbsp;please.</DIV>

<DIV>RE: Monday 62+ event<BR><BR>Believe me, if you were there at the beginning this started great, but overall was NOT a fun event. It had the potential to be one of the best ever, but just was a disaster. For those who joined it FROM THE START!!! not three hours into it (which added another hour to the overall time) they know what I am talking about. Overall the worst event ever attended and most frustrating for people who put the entire time and effort into an event.</DIV>
