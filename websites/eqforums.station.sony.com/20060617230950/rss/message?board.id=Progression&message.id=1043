    <description>&lt;div&gt;Get it?  Zero tutorial.  The only purpose of having a classic server is to see folks running about the old world and trekking across continents.  Having everyone spend their first 6 to 10 levels in a tutorial only keeps Everfrost, Freeport, Kelethin and other places pretty empty.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;What sucks about present EQ is basically two things:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;1)  Plane of Knowledge and its teleports&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;2)  In-game tutorials&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Both of these things have destroyed the original low level experience.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;I absolutely agree, NO TUTORIAL ON THE PROGRESSION SERVER.&amp;nbsp; If new players want to play on the Combine, they're free to start character on other servers to get a feel for the game (getting to lvl 10 in the tutorial takes what, 2 hours now?).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Have some fun &lt;EM&gt;playing&lt;/EM&gt; the game for a change, not just trying to beat it!&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;It's the &lt;EM&gt;journey&lt;/EM&gt;, not the destination: and it's called Ever&lt;EM&gt;Quest&lt;/EM&gt;, not EverGrind.&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;I didn't bother reading the thread, but Tutorial and PoK wont be available at openeing (both of which has been stated in non beta forums). Read the stickies (at the very least) before you post anything. Or punch yourself in the mouth repeatedly until you realized you should do some research before posting an idiotic topic. Whichever you prefer.</description>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;That's certainly clear... otherwise you would have noticed the original post date of the thread compared to the original post date of the stickied "unofficial" FAQ -&amp;nbsp; 4/16 and 5/6, respectively....&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;So, perhaps heed your own advice,&amp;nbsp;understand the conversation you're entering,&amp;nbsp;and remove foot from mouth&amp;nbsp;after jumping all over the OP and coming across as a bit of a dunderhead yourself.&amp;nbsp; :smileytongue:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;On topic - I hope they stick with the current plan and don't include the Tutorial until much later to correspond with the expansion around when it was introduced. Coming back to EQ recently, while I found the Tutorial to be genuinely informative... it wasn't a very "RPG" kind of experience and fosters very little sense of character history or community, compared to starting out in&amp;nbsp;the racial cities.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>Just skimmed through this thread, first of all, this ain't a classic server.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That being said, there will be no tutorial until GoD or so, and no PoK until Planes of Power.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kinda silly arguing about something that's already been confirmed.&lt;span&gt;:smileytongue:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Yeah, the Tutorial should definetly be banned from the new server, and PoK just made all of use lazy Sacks of *BEEP* where si the time of the boats between continents and that fun sailing song i loved that sailing music you got on the boat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;***Memories, LA...LA...LA, Memories***&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>I agree that the tutorial doesn't really fit in. Maybe enable it later, but not from the start. Let people explore the lands around their starting city, instead of jumping into a tutorial and coming out at level 10.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Nolrog dropping people off (in their hometowns) at level 10 would not be even close to the same effect as them starting there at level 1.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We will spend quite a bit of time killing mobs CLOSE to our city (unless we relocate ourselves) for exp. We will also have to run into town to sell our loot in most cases. We will see and/or meet other players of our race, and since there will probably be a TON of people hunting one area, we'll likely group with them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You underestimate the time it takes to level from 1-10 without the tutorial, PoK, or twinking.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;Another thing, when you start out in your own home city, you learn to appreciate the diversity of the different races. Most of the races have their own shortcomings, group wise. Barbs and Dwarves don't have INT casters, for example, large races don't have clerics, High Elves and Erudites don't have warriors, druids, or shaman, so if you want a well rounded group, you have to recruit party members from other races to fill in the gaps. &amp;nbsp;When you start in tutorial, PoK becomes your home city, and there is no shortage of different races and classes available to group with. Tutorial and PoK change the nature of grouping in the early years before you can wander very far from your home city in more ways than you realize. It also affects character progression. I remember starting my first human character and killing everything in the newbie yard of Qeynos until it all turned green and then advanced into Qeynos Hills until I outgrew that, and then ventured at times into Blackburrow and West Karana. Starting in a home city with no insta-porting via the books limits how far you can range from your home town simply because you don't have the levels to wander very far without dying, so you learn more about the zones, mobs and quests because you end up spending a lot more time there levelling. Yes, it is harder, yes it sucks sometimes, but you get a greater sense of accomplishment when you finally make your first cross continent run. What sense of accomplishment&amp;nbsp;do you get when you click the Qeynos book then run over to the Freeport stone and click that? You miss out on huge portions of the game world with these shortcuts added. If you want to know why so many zones seem to be empty all the time, blame the PoK books for removing the need to travel through many of the zones.&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Vegeta-X on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;06-10-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;03:21 PM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;From a business standpoint I could see them aiming this at the more veteren players as a pilot server.  If it worked and was popular enough they could make new game boxes that advertise experiencing the game from the beginning and boast how long EQ has been going to hopefully attract new players.  Right now mostly just veteren players even know about this,  in order to truely get new players they are going to have to advertise to them with a new sales pitch.  The main problem I see with attracting new players this way though is with graphic elitists since old world EQ isnt exactly the prettiest of game worlds anymore.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;I agree with you that the tutorial should not be there.  A problem with having the tutorial like it is that players dont truely establish a home city like we did in the original game.  Sure they end up going there after level 10, but by then they would be away from the city already.  Also it will just be way too overcrowded unless they instanced it. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Dont mistake this server for a &amp;quot;classic&amp;quot; server though, it's not their intention even though a classic server and a new progression server would be similar until the first few expansions were unlocked.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;What sucks about present EQ is basically two things:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;1)&amp;nbsp; Plane of Knowledge and its teleports&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;2)&amp;nbsp; In-game tutorials&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Both of these things have destroyed the original low level experience.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;Did you ever truely play back then? PoK is one of the greatest inventions in the game... in game tutorials are great also. Have you ever played in it? I played through the newbie tutorial a number of times and anytime my main server is down i tend to go mess around in it on another server.&lt;BR&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;I DID play the game back then. I remember finding the fleshy orb on the rabid wolf in Qeynos Hills and bringing it to the priestess in the temple of life and being told to travel to Freeport to get a piece of fine steel. It was a REAL quest because of the distance involved and a piece of fine steel was still considered a worthy upgrade back then. Now, with the books, it trivializes this quest and other quests that involved a lot of travelling around. I also remember making my first Trueshot longbow and taking the boats to Freeport and Sister Isle to get some of the needed bits for the combine. Long distance travel was an important part of the game back then. It made you put off finishing some quests until you were strong enough to survive the long trips. Without the travel, you can shortcut many quests and end up with items at a lower level than was intended when the quests were originally written.</description>

releasing a brand new expansion that is a stand alone game, including a&#xD;

Because that's what is going to bring them in more profits. People are&#xD;
sick of digital downloads, they're sick of an expansion that only&#xD;
appeals to 2% of the everquest population ( level 70 + )&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here's the facts&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Population spread from level 1-70 across all servers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Level 1-9 25%&lt;br&gt;Level 10-19 29%&lt;br&gt;Level 20-29 14%&lt;br&gt;Level 30-39 10%&lt;br&gt;Level 40-49&amp;nbsp; 6%&lt;br&gt;Level 50-59&amp;nbsp; 8%&lt;br&gt;Level 60-69&amp;nbsp; 5%&lt;br&gt;Level 70&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 2%&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Notice&#xD;
the 2% of the level 70's that make up the population of everquest? for&#xD;
the past 4 expansions, they've tried to appeal to the last 4&#xD;
percentiles ( 40-70 ). It's been failing with each new expansion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;so, to re-emhpasize:&amp;nbsp; those statistics include every character that exists... Not the ones that people play, and not even just the ones that get logged on once a year.&amp;nbsp; All of them.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
I personally have 4 characters at 40 and under.... one is my trader.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
the other 3 are alts that I havn't logged in since my wife stopped playing 3 years ago except for loading them up with tradeskill and quest junk for storage.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
the other 4 characters are&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
1.&amp;nbsp; my lvl 70 main&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
2.&amp;nbsp; A mid 50s wizard that I log on to port people to sky an hate.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
3.&amp;nbsp; A low 50s monk that I havn't logged on since the kunark fableds (I logged him on for the clicky earring)&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
4.&amp;nbsp; A upper 50s cleric that I play every other month or so.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
99% of my play time is on a lvl 70...&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
