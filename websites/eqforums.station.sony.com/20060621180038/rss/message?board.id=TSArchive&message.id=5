&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Greetings, &lt;/FONT&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;My name is D. Scott Mattson and I am the Executive Director of Customer Service for Sony Online Entertainment. I have 15 years experience in the Customer Service industry with an emphasis on Call Center Management in the high tech arena. Before coming to Sony Online Entertainment I worked as Director of Player Relations and Product Management for the Electronic Arts Company. I had the pleasure of launching multiple MMOG titles at EA as well as managing the day-to day operations of the in game staff of all the online game titles for EA. I am thrilled to be at Sony Online Entertainment and wanted to communicate to you the many new improvements that we will be providing to our customers to enhance our quality, streamline our operations and improve our response times. Please let me have your attention for a few moments to outline these improvements. &#xD;
&lt;P&gt;First, we have been working on our knowledge base for the past few weeks so that we can establish a solid foundation for our Tier 0 support (Tier 0 support is where the customer can run a query to find their own answer). As we are finding that people are familiarizing themselves with search engines, we feel that our knowledge base is a user friendly tool for our customers to seek answers on their own. We have recently completed a full audit of solutions for all of our games, so any solution that you find should be up to date. Of course there will be situations where you will not find your answer, this is where you can help us make our database be the best it can be by letting us know that we need to add a solution or make a modification to an existing FAQ. We feel strongly that the knowledge base will be the cornerstone of our service and as such we will focus resources there in partnership with you, the customer. Of course there will be cases where you will need to contact a Customer Service Representative, but we are confident that the majority of your answers can be resolved through our knowledge base. Currently, you will find our knowledge base at our website and inside Star Wars Galaxies through the Holocron interface. Our plan is to implement access to our knowledge base inside the game client for all of our online products. By doing this, we are confident that the majority of your questions will be answered immediately rather than waiting for a CSR to respond. &#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Secondly, we have expanded our support into other areas in the world. The United Kingdom has been providing support for all of games for the past few months as well as outsource partners in India. This has helped us immensely during the off-peak hours, holidays and during regular business hours. With their support, we are able to provide a much more robust service around the clock utilizing a "follow the sun" support model. &#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Finally, we are actively improving our current tools to respond to our customers quickly and effectively. We understand that it could take some time to receive a response to your petition, so we are enhancing our petitioning tool to make it easier to respond to our customers quickly. As we integrate better tools to help our customers, the response rate to your questions should significantly decrease.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;These are just a few of the high level enhancements we are making to our In-game Customer Service to make your experience a better one. Thank you for your patience now and in the future as we work hard to offer better and improved service. &#xD;
