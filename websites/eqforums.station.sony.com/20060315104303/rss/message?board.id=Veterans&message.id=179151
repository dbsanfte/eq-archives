      <description>How many times have you encountered someone with an attitude that has made you regret logging into the game?&lt;br&gt;One thing I do not like is others downing another player, or kicking them out of a group or raid for making an innocent mistake; or seeing an &amp;quot;important someone&amp;quot; pitch a fit and others bowing down to them due to others not having enough backbone to tell them to chill out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Have you ever felt the need to stickup for your friends when others were giving them grief?&lt;br&gt;I feel depressed today because of something similar to the above that happened last night. &lt;br&gt;I fear I will only see more of this as I progress futher into the end game, what is your experience?&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

There is always the possibility that they are morons and are just trying to show off but to me this is not elitism.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now for kicking people out if you can't get to a task zi on your own I chalk up to impatience. How is sitting in a zone waiting for some one that never bothered to download maps let alone familiarize themselves with content they wish to play on elitism? If I ask someone if they wish to join my group and they don't know how to get there and need to be &amp;quot;guided&amp;quot; I will tell them how once. If they can't get there then and just keep dieing I will politely ask them to drop since its obvious this person needs to do a few more exploration tasks first. We play to have fun and not to babysit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The so called worst form of Elitism in your eyes if people that don't invite lower level toons into their groups? This isnt Elitism but it does sound like Powerleveling. Why would I invite someone into my group that has spells that wont land or slows that wont hold or who's melee that is more misses than hits? Again you are confusing Elitism with something else.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also on your last point, some content does not require CC or a cleric or this class or that class. If you keep it simple you can do almost anything without one of the Trinity in your group. I usually use my druid in almost every experience camp I do. I don't need CC if I can single pull mob. I don't need a cleric if the content which I am fighting isnt beyond my means. If someone joined my group and noticed I was healing myself with my druid and they demanded I invite a cleric or enchanter they would not be in my group for very long. This is again not elitism, this is a personal choice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Yea I agree that some should take the time to get maps and even explore routes to zone lines...But, "exploration task" dont teach camp "nick names", most of&amp;nbsp;that comes from trial and error,&amp;nbsp;just getting there and doing it,&amp;nbsp;(example)learning where "statue" camp is, or "perfect" is.. a twisty turn place with see invs mobs like MPG, RSS, Can sometimes for someone new to the zone, will&amp;nbsp; have troubles, If they are up front and say they are not sure how to get there, I will say wait at zi i'll come get you show you the way... IMO those that will "explain" the route once, then drop them if they fail,&amp;nbsp;isn't eliteism its asshatism...&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Rather anyone likes it or not, people are moving up in ranks, and levels. People on their first mains. They too need to learn these places just as we did, Just as someone higher then or more experienced then us showed us, we dont HAVE to show them. But I have absolutely no problem helping these new people learn the zones, and camp names. The group can wait five mins...go pee pee or somthing while someone fetches that lost new player trying to make it....At least they are trying... and funny part is usually the ones I have to go get, or help get there, are so happy to be in the group they will stay there forever.. whilist others waste our time getting there&amp;nbsp;that know how, just to say they have to log in 15, or they afk every 5 mins..&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I doubt anyone here can say they zoned into a place their first few weeks of working a new zone, and shout ooc, or answer a tell and knew precisely where every camp was...They either for the first or second (or for some even more) had their hand held.. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;For most part I rarelly see people NOT help a new group member to a camp, if&amp;nbsp;they say they are not familiar with that one.. Having a couple of family members starting to&amp;nbsp;venture&amp;nbsp; those zones, Im glad to hear they have not met an asshat like that&amp;nbsp;to often.. &lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I guess where im really upset about this whole line of comments that started was, they sterotype ( anyone ) that has experiance and equipment. Newsflash guys and gals ya dont have to be a nicely equipped person to be an asshat and also you dont have to be an elitist to be mean to people. But I guess what my point is, if i can go out get equipped really spend alot of my time and energy to build my charector. Get a good name and reputation, spend my time and work for a guild progress thru the eons of bugs and twitchy quests. Why should i then have to let somone leach xp off me to prove im a ( nice non eletist ) Because the defenition of eletist that is commonly used is in fact innacurate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If somone says im sorry bud, 67 is really not what the group was looking for in a ranger, for snares. Then coming back and saying that elitist bleep bleep, really isnt true and only hurts you in the long run. They give a reason, you can choose to accept that a total stranger has no reason to lie to you. Or you can belive the conspiricy, that you would be uber 70 and the mackdaddy of your server only if the &amp;quot;elitist's&amp;quot; were not keeping you down. Newsflash, most of your well geared players dont go to riftseekers, they dont fight for camps. And if they do step foot into riftseekers its because there is a freind that needs a rune/aug. Or they want to kill chaliak, which is one groupable by them, but there giving the gear to a freind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The elitist's you meet are usually just asshats and even more common, there not even geared that well. They have a big head because they got something that they feel makes you drool. When they meet really well equipped folks, generally they talk big a few moments till the well geared person puts them in there place. Also a issue you reach when you get to where you want game wise, is your freinds whom you really want to see progress will not allow you to help them in any respect. I have a freind, my first guild there progression hasnt really ever took off. No matter how hard they try, somthing always happens to knock them back a year. I would help them and there entire guild to the planes in a month if they would let me. But they wont, Im not even allowed to just merely dps the emperor in ssra. Because they veiw my pressence as to cheapen there victory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So in the end we loose our own freinds in some respect because of the way others veiw the cape on our back or the sword in our hand. So yes we go to our instance's and we keep to ourselves, make freinds along the way and try to enjoy this game just as the ones that call us elitist everyday.  But the difference is, when somone slights us, we call them an asshat or a jerk, because thats what they are. But any person of a good guild will be called an elitist, its a mark than none will be free of, even if your not aware you are being called it..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lord Chriten Dathemiere&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dark bane of saryn&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1038135"&gt;http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1038135&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Keep in mind I was tanking bastian of thunder at lvl 55 because I knew people who took the chance on me. But that was because I was freinds with them, if they hadnt known me at all. I wouldnt even dream to say that it would have happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Another instance of elitism on my server at least is when some people do dodh missions they will kick you out of group or make you get corpse dragged if you cannot get to the living bridges&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well I can understand if a person got killed 4 times getting there, i might start to wonder but if there kicking you there must be some frustration to start with.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the most annoying instances of elistism is when people decide they are so uber they can charge in and try to zerg mobs.  And then they wonder why people get killed&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well this is a question of perception, when somone is very well geared, they lose perspective of what is dangerous to others. I half grouped the monk epic 2.0 final fight, it was a long encounter but I knew the people there were capeable of doing it. If i have that same perception on an encounter that is a 1 groupable normal named I might just go in and kill it. Most of those encounters I dont even use defensive, just start out with furious for the slow and then fellstrike it dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basically, this whole attitude that if i choose not to group with somone is because I feel there gimp is really and completely iritating. Maybe I just dont like your personality ? Maybe I dont feel like grinding xp for 3 hours just because you are really excited at the thought of another 10aa. Maybe the experiances ive had with you, were really not that good or a freind tells me of a bad experiance. Or quite possibly, I dont feel like spending 3 hours in a group with somone I feel im, handing them the xp. You know elitism, does exsist, ive seen it alot where people treat another player as a subhuman, dont even give them the rights to the named there setting up for to kill. Just charge in and take it. People who dont veiw anothers camp as a camp. People that sit arround insulting you when you really dont deserve it. But the cold hard fact is, im not logging on to make another person more powerfull unless I like that person or in someway it benefits me. Because its my 2 hours, its my 2 years of my life or 5 years of my life to get to this level. Im not required to power level you nor am i required to give you my time, tank your epic or be called racist comments. Because thats what alot of this is being used as.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this game you choose how powerfull you become, anyone can get to anguish,time,tacvi, or demiplane of blood. The old addage is, you hammer a nail, you dont make excuses of why it cant go in. You line it up, take aim and hit it really hard until its in. If you dont want to take the time to get there and be insutled day in and day out till you arrive at where you want to be. Thats your problem and not others who simply dont have to work as hard anymore. I remember raiding and working with 2 hours sleep each day for years. Dont tell me then I have to hand you spoils or give you my time because your lower level than me or not as powerfull. Thats insulting.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>As a paladin with less thank 12k buffed hp, i encounter elitist attitude all to much, it's actually made me dig through alla's quest database to find things that were fun. 9/10 a person sends me a tell askin hp, i reply &amp;quot;what for?&amp;quot;, and when they say a place i know for a fact i can tank in i simply reply &amp;quot;oh i can handle that&amp;quot;. Then it starts, they run a line of tells about how important hp and aa are, totally forgetting that a paladin can heal, and with some skill in timing those heals, can make up for lower hp. In the end the result is almost always the same, me sitting there finishing whatever quest i was working on, while they barrage me with tells about how much a newb i am.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But i do bear a bit of an elitist attitude myself. But for a good reason in some places. I won't accpet a cleric or druid anymore with less mana than me in a place like RSS or it's difficulty level. That's simply because i know my bounds and what it takes to keep me floating after playing for so long, and that a cleric with less mana than me no matter what thier ft and spell conservation is at, is going to be medding ALOT. When a cleric meds alot, people loose faith in the group and tend to make fake reasons to leave, causing groups to break up rather quick and just be a waste of plat spent on invis potions to get to without enough reward (xp, loot, fun, whatever your fancy is in reward, mine is fun and challenge).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maybe once per week do i get a group where everyone is willing to bear with it and treat it like a game. Never throwing a harsh word, and just enjoying ourselves. Do thier attitudes make me regret logging into the game? Hell no, i don't give a jack what you act like or think about me, because i'm playing this game to have fun, if i can't do that around you, **SMURF** straight i'm gunna look the other way when you send me a tell. Is what i consider fun elitist in itself, sometimes, but most the time i just look to try new things (which rarely gets done if it's not solo'able). Really i find elitist attitudes hilarious, because it's that narrow sightedness that turns eq into more of a job than a game.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Am I an elitist? Naw. I do take pride in the work I put into my character though, and as long as I get to train Firpy once a day it keeps me from getting mad and yelling at people! :p Sure I might like well geared tanks and hot DPS for groups. But sometimes it's fun to group with people that don't the raid gear, don't have the aa's, where a low exp boring grind group for you normally is filled with death, chaos and a feeling of 'Dayum, we might actually die.' On that note, PM me Firo you slactastic War~&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The only thing i personally consider an elitist attitude, is when folks find some reason to start linking all there gear in group. I can understand when somone asks hey whats that item you have on, I personally send them a tell with the link, but when they say oh thats nothing link this and that and then the next person links back another item.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This is how i feel about it, if your a cleric heal, if I never dip below 30% I know your good at what ya do, if your a monk split, if i never get more than 1 mob in camp in a difficult zone i know your veteran. If your a slower slow, if the mob is slowed and debuffed before 10% is knocked off its hp I know you have skill. If your an enchanchter mezz, If I have a bunch of mobs in camp and dont have to offtank 3 mobs at once I know you have experiance. Now when folks have some feeling that they are superiour and base it off factors that mean nothing it confuses me. I really dont care what items you posess, your guild is not you, a recruit can brag about there guilds accomplishments just  as well , as somone who helped get the guild to that stage of progression with the same sincerity.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;As far as what somone said about people sending you a tell with how much hp you have, I get this dailly and its really freaking anoying. Im not even lfg and i get request's to join there group, then they ask how much hp do you have? Like this really at this point matters,  I usually respond with why does it matter ? They always come back with because I want to see if your good or not. At this point my intrest is gone i respond with well, I buff out over 18k, but well I think i'll just continue to solo mpg for abit or fire. People label you as an elitist, just as much as folks are labled any number of nasty sterotype's. If my crime is only that I have accomplished something you havent and choose to go elsewhere or dont want my cut of a 50 plat split, then your the one with the problem.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If a person tells of there accomplishments and others take this as bragging aswell, this completely mistifies me. Bragging is when somone doesnt shut up about what they have done. Yes a true veteran will always have tales of those fights and times they are proud of what they have been able to do. Most of it though is either they got lucky and figured out somthing or they just got lucky. Yes to give a background, ive 1 tanked vishmitar on a few occassions, ive 1 tanked tunat on a few occassions. Ive never sucessefully 1 tanked OMM nor has my guild killed OMM. But it doesnt really matter either way, because even though i lived in those situations i possibly shouldnt I dont take full credit, I have **SMURF** good clerics, awesome shamans and  uber guildies and enchanters to let me not have to worry about my surroundings as much as others might. I personally am **SMURF** lucky to have had the chance to be guilded with people who show skill and grace at there accomplishments. People who have level heads in bad situations, Yes there were times i felt we were going to wipe, alot of times you say POWER THRU, in raid just to give them focus when times get bad. Other times you say were going to wipe but god dam* lets make  him earn killing us. Luck and skill are brothers, some people never realize this others do.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So drop the elitist tagging of every person that doesnt want to group, or split because sometimes, they just have no reason to xp at all, I know many that are max aa and maxxed bank aa. They play merely for the enjoyment of the group at this stage, for the fun of it all.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Lord Chriten Dathemiere&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Dark bane of saryn&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

I carry a rusty dagger around for these events.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now as to the OP's original comments. Well, I probably run into one of these jerks about twice a week. I just chalk it up to someone being insecure and trying to prove something to themselves rather than me. If I run into the same person often enough they go on my ignore list. I also have on occasion run into the opposite side of the coin. People that demand I strip off my gear and hand it to them and get upset when I say no. These poeple wind up on my ignore list the first time I encounter them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The point is, that there are annoying and immature people at all levels of play. These people are bothersome and can sour a day of playing but are not really of a high enough percentage in the game to be totally disruptive. Pity them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On one end of the spectrum are people that group with anyone, on the other the snobs.  What you consider 'elitism' depends purey upon where your own sensibilities lie.  Moreover, regardless of where everyone claims to lie in the spectrum, they believe themselves to truly be in the center and label others accordingly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;P R O M I S C U I T Y                         E L I T I S M&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;-----------------------------|-----------------------------&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;^**SMURF** ^Affirmative Action   ^Pragmatic   ^Snob           ^Racist&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Isn't it funny how the judgement of others always takes the same form.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;edit: my extreme left got smurfed lol. pragmatic is supposed to be the middle&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by FennyX on &lt;span class="date_text"&gt;02-10-2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;08:52 AM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt; We all have our standards of what we want to group with. If some one is messing up then yeah the group could use some modification. Having high standards if you have high goals is by no means uncalled for and I look forward to meeting those standards as I progress my skills and equipment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   I'm not sure of anyone else's deffinition of &amp;quot;eliteist&amp;quot; is but to me it's someone that's lfg but won't accept a group invite from anyone not in there guild or not level 69 or 70. In my not so humble opinion when you reach the point when you're not willing to help others becuase of what MAY happen then you're being unreasonable. You know that MPG group you turned dowed down a few days ago didn't happen and because it didn't happen someone didn't reach a goal they've been striving for for the last few months?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Everytime I think of elitest I get a picture in my head of some lfg 13K tank or maxed AA shaman sitting back watching general chat while some poor 66 toon tried to put together an epic 1.5 mini-raid. That type of stuff burns my butt. If you're not busy then help others, I'm sure they'de appreciate it and maybe you can help them reach your &amp;quot;standards&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by rter on &lt;span class="date_text"&gt;02-10-2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;05:15 AM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
