    <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Black Watch Guild -&amp;nbsp; Leader moved to another server, new leader disbanded guild&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Some moved on to form a new guild, others moved on to join established guilds and some moved to a brand new server to try again.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>Remember all those guilds which came...and went?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was in Warphoenix back in mid-2001 and I was there until the guildtag actually vanished, which was a long time later.  I remember lots of nice people and I see some from time to time still online.  Shortly after I joined the population started decreasing and it lingered for a long time with very few members.   At the peak there were over 100 warphoenixes of a wide range of levels: 15-52 IIRC.  Many of us, myself included, were new to Eq.  I'd been playing (lightly) for over a year and only made level 20.  I suppose the main reason for the guild to fail was that we couldn't really group together effectively. Within a couple months people were leaving - the top went first as there were very few above level 40 or so thus they really didn't have many others to group with.  I got the feeling most left just to go join another guild.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What other guilds have passed away in the annals of Terris Thule history?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I imagine it could be easy for this thread to turn negative because of personal things, but I was more interested in when did the guild exist, how many people, what achievements (at that time - I know this will be dated), etc.  Sort of a little history.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lastly, I imagine some guilds still exist, despite many, many people leaving.  For example, I'm currently in Summoners of the Realm, so called because originally it was to be a "guild" in the normal sense of the word: a collection of people practicing the same art who come together to share knowledge - so it was going to be all Magicians.  We've expanded to allow other classes (way, way before I joined), but now we've contracted.  We have perhaps a half dozen consistent players.  Our last great wave of people who left went to Spirtwalker.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Not sure if its been mentioned yet, I didnt see it atleast, but back in 2001 was the guild Majesty. I think they merged and they became Nocturnal, but I'm not positive, I know atleast a few of my friends from Majesty migrated to Nocturnal. All I remember is joining up with Majesty, taking about a 2 month break, coming back and&amp;nbsp;that guild&amp;nbsp;was no more, anyone have any information as to what happened with Majesty?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Ale Trained Fighters... The reason I switched to Terris-Thule from Prexus in March of 2004...&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;To me this was the best guild, however, it disbanded in like October or November due to lack of people, and EQ2.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Since I'm not a long-time player on TT, a lot of these guilds I do not recognize, however, I'm sure they were all great in their own right.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>Four years ago, when I first began playing everquest, the "world" was filled with wonderous guilds.  As a new born cleric, they seemed to high and mighty to want the likes of me.  I was equipped with armor I managed to loot from gnolls in Black barrow.  Then at the tender age of 5 I was invited to join Defenders of the Frost.  At the time, the guild was filled with mighty and hot tempered barbarians whose primary goal was to kill all gnolls.  That quickly changed as our membership grew. There was guild chatter all the time, it was heavenly.  Defenders of the Frost is still a guild on Terris Thule, and so is not long lost.  But it is a ghost of its former self.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shuacat</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;So far, in my career, I have witnessed the downfall of like 3 or 4 guilds due to drama between members. I wish people would remember this is a game, and to have fun.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3&gt;Howdy Terris, I am sadened to hear of so many of the "uber" guilds of my time from TT have fallen. I have moved on to greener pastures after a 6 month hiatus in my play time, I am now on Morden Rasp.&amp;nbsp; Let's see, where did my days as a youth take me on terris.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3&gt;I started my youth in a very old pre-kunark guild Legends of Power, a small friends and family guild, not a very big player pool, but a very close knit guild.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3&gt;After LoP fell, most created a guild called Obsidian Elite, which I hear is still around today, but under very limited numbers, once upon a time under the wonderful leadership of our fearless leader Xana, we raided a few times a week and had guild numbers over 200 for awhile before the inevitable drama strike and half the guild moved on. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3&gt;After Obsidian Elite's demise I did a short stint in Reavers of Fate who to my surprise I hear has fallen =(.. again. RoF had its up's and downs but for a short time we where doing very well, i think RoF took me up to about the Luclin time frame or so.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3&gt;After parting ways with RoF, i moved back into Obsidian Elite to be back in with my true EQ friends. We shortly spawned off because of problems with the new management. And me and 2 very close EQ friends started the guild Legends Over Time. LoT started as a friends and family guild, moved to a small raiding guild taking out luclin raid mobs.. etc.. nothing big, think our best member base was close to 50 online at any given time.. close to 300 memebers but that was alot of alts and people who rarely logged in. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3&gt;I miss all you guys on TT, had alot of good times with alot of great guilds. If you do remember me send me a ;tell on Morden.Aendiile, I enjoy seeing how you guys are doing over here and who of my old friends are still around. or just reply to this thread, ill check it.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;SU was pretty much purged of anyone inactive by a couple of the new officers a few months back to try and revive it.&amp;nbsp; Since it's no longer a raiding guild, I've been reinviting people just as a social guild, since it's one of the oldest (if not the oldest guild) on TT I would like it to still be around even after the server merge.&amp;nbsp; If you are a main or an alt that was a member, or just want to be tagged in a social guild, send an in game email to Aaee.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I recall the end of the guild the Mongrel Horde, whose last few members formed the Warphoenix guild at the arena; I needed protection by Runtt just to get there &amp;lt;lol&amp;gt; for the formation.&amp;nbsp; I had a character in Obsidian Elite that has almost faded to nothing. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;A few members of warphoenix joined True Valor, which has since merged with One Fellowship to form True Fellowship. I expect there will be more guilds disbanding or merging since all of the competition from new online games like WOW and EQ2.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;Nocturnal did not disband, did not die....Nocturnal retired from EQ. Go check WoW, Nocturnal lives and is PVP this time.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I also used to be in War Phoenix back in the day. I think I joined sometime in the summer/early fall of 2001 and stayed 'til Xarnya handed it over to RL brother of Nooga Nooch who was a good friend of mine. Runtt was GL before Xarnya and Danthol. Xarnya stepped down because of RL things taking control. Tahoe, if you still look at these boards, send me a tell sometime (Moonfinder tis the char I am on most the time) . I don' recognize your name off hand but, I'm sure we knew each other. Xarnya put me second in command after her and Danthol.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;As far as other guilds that have disbanded... Champions of the Realm kinda sorta disbanded. They aren't what they used to be. Last I heard, it went to nothing but, alt guild. I only see one person on in the guild anymore and I don' even see her on much anymore. Another's Oblique. Disbanded earlier tis year. I was only in the guild five weeks when Odmonte disbanded it and I created a new guild for any Obliquians who wanted to stay together.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>Personally, I'd love to hear a little more about all these guilds.  Bloodehorde, if I am not mistaken, is a roleplaying, evil race guild.  In Summoners of the Realm, we had a Summoner's ditch day where a bunch of us played hookie and screwed around in Eq for a day.  Fun times.</description>
