      <title>Pathing Update</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=DevCorner&amp;message.id=12330#M12330</link>
      <description>Hi everyone&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;As you may know I've been at fan faire for most of a week but now that I'm back I'm&#xD;
deep in the pathing system which is where I was when I left. Well I did take a little while this morning&#xD;
to organize my notes from FF about various code things we need to look&#xD;
into but after that I started getting back to pathing.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;Here's the current plan with pathing:&lt;br&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Figure out what's wrong&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Figure out options that will solve the problems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Extract the current pathing system into a standalone project (a 'static library' for the technical types) and modify the zone server to use this reorganized form of the current code. This will allow me to do focused unit testing on the system, as well as easily swap between the current code and new code should any problems come up later.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have QA confirm that step 3 didn't change the behavior of the system, bugs and all.&amp;nbsp; This is done on my personal dev box to isolate Test server from major problems before we put it there.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Put the reorganized code on test. Note there aren't going to be any actual fixes at this time, just reorganized code to allow fixed to be done in an isolated, modular manner.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Implement changes that solve the problems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Put the fixes on my dev box and have QA check things out there. Work with them until known issues are solved.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Put the code on test.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br&gt;So where am I now with all this? I've been working on it with most of my time here at work for a while now, and here's the checklist:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) I believe I understand the problems at this point. I did find one major bug that was a big part of why warping occurs, but we're going to not only fix the bug but also make general improvements which we believe will substantially reduce the zone's CPU load due to pathing while also improving the end result. Not a bad deal, assuming we're right. I am optimistic at this point.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) If you've followed the threads you have seen the options discussed so I'll just get to what has been decided. Pathing will be implemented such that searches will be a series of smaller searches, each with a search budget smaller than what it is today. This will cause search failures to not stall the zone as NPCs burn huge amounts of time for no solution. They will follow their partial solution until they determine they are stuck. When this happens, the NPC will warp somewhere between the target and the NPC and the NPC will be guaranteed to reach the target from this warp location. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3) I finished the extraction before I left for fanfaire and had my server tested by QA while I was gone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4) Today I was able to get confirmation that everything works as it did before in this newly reorganized setup.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;5) We haven't put this code on test yet, I just got confirmation a few minutes ago. I need to update various people before we can do that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;6) I had implemented some of the fixes before the reorganization, but the invasive nature of the fixes is what prompted me to extract the pathing system into a module. I reverted my fixes before doing the code extraction, but I saved a copy of the changes to allow me to go through and put them in again which is a lot easier than doing it from scratch. When I was testing these changes before, I had to do some pretty extreme stuff to get any warps to occur at all. Like fly around outside the world. Not saying that it's perfect, but it was much much improved and I didn't see any problems with warping at all. There are a few things that need to be done in addition to what I already experimented with but I've already seen it work well enough that I'm confident it will make a huge improvement when it's done.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;7) I'm about to start putting the fixes on my dev box. I need to get the current code prepped for Test server and checked in before I can do that though.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;8) Going to be a while before we get to the point of putting the actual fixes on Test, probably a week or two is my guess. There are just too many things to regress to expect it any sooner.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyways, hope this helps answer any questions people may have or concerns that it's not being worked on. It's definitely being worked on actively both by myself and the QA department to make sure we get it right.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cheers,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>The new pathing code is on Test today. A bit short on time to answer the various questions in the thread right now but I'll try to respond as soon as I can. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please let me know how it works out for you all on Test. First feedback has been pretty good but who knows what will happen once a lot of people start hammering it. I'm keeping my fingers crossed :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;After trying to both /bug and /petition for the awful pathing regarding pets in pretty much all OOW zones (Pet would get stuck between pathing nodes while trying to chase mobs, running back and forth 50 times like mobs do on bridges in Karnors) I was redirected to this forum and also this specific topic. I should note that it took me 2 petitions as the initial petition got nothing more than a bot auto reply/close saying I should search the KB *shrug*. (Why are the only human GMs from Stormhammer?)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In any case... I've been toying with pathing in test programs for a couple days now to hopefully assist you with this problem. I also wanted to improve current movement behaviour by smoothing out the path followed by NPCs. For as long as EQ has been running... every single NPC has always been attracted to pathing like a magnet, turning around instantly at corners etc etc which is hardly realistic. So I came up with this solution:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://x.lanfanatics.nl/fluent.html"&gt;Fluent Pathing&lt;/a&gt; (animated javascript)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I dont know if it can be implemented due to cpu budgets and such, but on my system it dont seem to have much effect on CPU usage (about 2-4%) and this is javascript, far from optimized and nowhere near the performance of C/C++ so it can only get faster.</description>

&lt;P&gt;I didn't want to publish a pathing related exploit so tried sending you a private message.&amp;nbsp; Send me a message with your email or send me an in game email and I will send you more info.&amp;nbsp; Its related to my last post and I think might be a good thing to test.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>Did some of your pathing changes for testing escape to the live servers? Seems like there's been a lot of wonky pathing all around lately; more so than normal at least.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Like the long bathroom line someone posted in Trak's Teeth. I noticed on Luclin as well there seems to be a black hole located at the underwater entrance of the tunnels near the arena of the Ruins of Illsalin; it has drawn about 20 mobs to that particular point. (Including a few red mobs that I didn't want to mess with).</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I went to Skyfire, there was a giant conga line from one globe to another with every mob in the zone going back and forth. And yesterday all the mobs had vanished, i could only find 4 or 5 wandering around the middle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Old stuff such as Natimbi, Dranik Scar which look like they should be good quad zones (with my Wizzy) turned out to be a nightmare, the mobs seem to refuse to move within 10 feet of each other and seem to think that running back the way they came is the fastest route to me &amp;gt;&amp;lt;, I havn't a clue how coding is done for pathing but have a feeling that Line of sight has something to do with it, in these zones there are a lot of dips and rises which block LoS for spellcasting, could be related?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I spent a &lt;A href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Veterans&amp;amp;message.id=212047" target=_blank&gt;tremendous amount of time hunting Tanglefeet mobs in Arcstone&lt;/A&gt;.&amp;nbsp; During that, I noticed some serious warping/pathing issues which I will try my best to describe.&amp;nbsp; This is very reproducible, so it might be a good place to run some tests:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;If you approach the Tanglefoot area from the Arcstone side, the ramp to Relic will be on your left, the falloff to Freeport on your right.&amp;nbsp; As you first approach the Tanglefeet, there will be two static mobs in front of you and a third roamer will approach from the left.&amp;nbsp; Staying back from these mobs is where you set up camp.&amp;nbsp; On your left is a sheer cliff wall going up.&amp;nbsp; Label this Cliff-A.&amp;nbsp; You can climb this cliff but its steep and slow.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;If you go out past these three mobs, hugging the wall on your left, you can pull other tanglefeet to your camp.&amp;nbsp; At this point, the terrain has eased up and you can head higher if you want.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;If you stay high up on this wall and pull a tanglefoot, it will instantly warp to the cliff wall.&amp;nbsp; Now, to avoid adds, try pulling your target UP the hill and then run back toward your camp along the top of the ledge (on even elevation with the Relic platform) then jump down Cliff-A to your group.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The warp happens as you pull your mob up the hill and more importantly when you run to Cliff-A.&amp;nbsp; Your mob warps instantly to Cliff-A (and is there before you are) every time.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Give it a try.&amp;nbsp; Its a good way to test some pathing issues with elevations changes.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Some good info there. Have one question though. Is all this pathing work you are doing also include the mobs in RSS? Last night i had a decent group there at the fountain camp right outside of the queens room. Puller tried to pull one of the chimera's from Chailaks room. By the time the chimera got to us at the top of the stairs we had already killed 4 other mobs, and when it did come it brought a friend with it. I have never seen that happen before PoR, dont know if PoR being released is the cause of all these new bugs but it does seem to have something to do with it.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Grum,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Are these pathing bugs the same ones that are affecting arrows not hitting mobs that are up against an object or wall?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I've got a large thread going in the Veteran's forums that details this bug/exploit if you get a moment to check it out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is a bug/exploit that is repeatable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To test it you can go to the Freeport Militia House in East Freeport.  Outside of the door to the Militia House are two guards.  If you stand in front of them and hit Ranged Attack, your arrows will not hit them.  You don't register a miss or anything, simply nothing happens to them, you just keep firing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you do not move from that original location and cast a spell on one of them to aggro him, as soon as he steps forward all of the arrows that should have been hitting him, will register a hit all at once.  If you move even the slightest bit from your original location no hits at all will register when the guard moves.  It is important to note that these invisible arrows that don't register actually create an invisible wall that other players cannot even walk through.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are many examples listed and locations given in the thread on the Veteran's board.  Thread is titled &amp;quot;UPDATE to the bug with arrows not hitting mobs?&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I would give you a link, but I don't have that capability yet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thank you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>The two worst pathing zones I've ever known were Plane of Storms (desert area) and Highkeep (basement).  Crushbone was never that good at it either but at least the mobs got to you.  In Storms/Highkeep you could get a mob running towards you, step a couple feet to the left and the mob would *turn around* and try to approach from another direction.  It was kinda like a ghetto mez if you knew how to use it right &lt;span&gt;:smileytongue:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If the mob warps to within melee range of its target, could you add a 1 sec stun or post-warp delay of some sort?  Otherwise known as the &amp;quot;Gimme three steps, mister&amp;quot; rule ... ;-7  Just a thought ... I appreciate the feedback on this subject and knowing what is coming.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;One other question: does the agro blur failure for FD on mobs with no fixed spawn point have anything to do with pathing, or am I bothering the wrong developer?  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And yes, pathing has always been broken in EQ ... to some extent.  This is no suprise.  The developers have continued to add twists like mobs which path back to spawn point, even though snared and agro'd on a player, after a FD (depending on distance between mob, spawn point and player apparently - very noticable in DoN/DoDH zones).  Some zones FD splits just don't seem to work very well (Devastation being one of the more notable) - as mobs don't reset agro easily. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Grumbuk, thank you again for your willingness to listen to the community.  I may not like the solutions you've chosen, but at least I can understand them and why you've chosen them.  Good luck on getting this fixed.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Grumbuk:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Great explaination!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;However, I'm curious about one thing. Is the pathing code also used by the /follow function? I've noticed that group members who are on /follow are now showing some crazy movements that seem oddly like the movements seen by NPC affected by bad pathing. While it's always been there, it seems to have become worse after PoR and magnified if the character following is on a high speed mount.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Thanks in advance.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>The /follow function is entirely client side and unrelated to pathing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The next patch is for a bunch of other stuff, also unrelated to pathing. Don't forget there's a bunch of folks on this team working every day, they have stuff that needs to get out too. The pathing changes need more time to take care of it properly and we just can't rush it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cheers,</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pathing does include the Find command though, right? Or is that client side too?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will these pathing changes mean that our pets will take longer to cach up with us? Currently they benefit from the warping by popping next to us when they get stuck (sometimes anyway). If they are going to get slowed down by the pathing changes, could you see about giving them the same run speed modifiers (AAs, and spells) that their owners have?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Pathing in Sverag, Stronghold of Rage and inside Razorthorn tower is extremely poor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sverag = mobs will not follow you down the tunnels that go around the outside of the zone, instead they warp to the inside area and bring a train.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Razorthorn = mobs will not path correctly down the ramp to the higher levels, they kinda pace back and forth on the ramps like they cannot determine where to go&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Sounds good. Another week or so to wait. Wonder what the current patch is for then? Anyway, I was also wondering why warping only works one way? My pet gets as confused as much or more than any NPC. Why doesn't he ever warp to his target???&lt;/div&gt;</description>
