    <description>This is a GREAT idea for a forum, considering the buzz surrounding the Progression Server idea.&amp;nbsp; But, it is already difficult to follow the discussions considering the variety of topics being thrown around on here.&amp;nbsp; If "classic server" discussion is not allowed then please update the rules and kill some posts.&amp;nbsp; Also, if SOE is NOT entertaining a PvP version of this server could you please state that in the rules as well to reduce the confusion and proliferation of PvP posts?&amp;nbsp; Maybe put a sticky at the top explaining which topics are considered "off limits"?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thank you!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Not at all, the majority of people here know what they want and could easily form a consensus.  There are a few that are absolutly terrified of this server and what it will do to them.  They are here to do one thing and one thing only.  Introduce as much FOG as they can possibly introduce..  Obfuscate everything they can possibly obfuscate.  Bury as many posts with ideas as they can under tons of meaningless crap.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The chaos you see is at the hands of the very few doing everything in thier power to ruin it for everyone else.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;It'll never hapen because no one is happy with what they are getting.. or know what they want still, so there will be PvP, Classic, Classic PvP, PvP with classic overtones, Progression server with a hint of classic with new races, Server with everything but X, Y expansion, Timed servers, progression server .. ect threads from here to eternity.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>If they smash it hard enough, then yes it can happen.&amp;nbsp; There are not nearly so many classic server threads on TNZ since they started squashing them and referring people to the official thread.&amp;nbsp; It would work here, too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>I'll add that if PvP or "classic" discussion is supposed to be here, then please move some of the other threads to here, like the classic server thread on TNZ.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But, I'm kind of hoping that this forum becomes "Progression Server" only. ;)&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
