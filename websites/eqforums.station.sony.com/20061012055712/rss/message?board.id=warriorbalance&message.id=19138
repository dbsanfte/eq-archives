    <description>&lt;div&gt;The simple answer is probably that Sony already burned us once on shield usage, and any fix to it is going to have to have some pretty interesting bells and whistles, as well as a name other than Furious Bash Suckers.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Taken from TenFon's exhaustive parses on &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=paladinbalance&amp;message.id=18854"&gt;http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=paladinbalance&amp;amp;message.id=18854&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;hr&gt;Hate by Bash is same as left hand weapon. For bash, Damage is same as Shield AC, but 22 is max of Bash Damage. Bash dose not have Damage Bonus, so Bash makes max 22 Hate with 22 or higher AC Shield. Low AC shiled makes lower Hate Bash. 2 Hand Bash (Knight AA Skill Bash without shield) makes 6 Hate. Furious Bash focus increse Bash Hate, but the value is random as same as Heal / DD focus. Shield with Furious Bash III makes average 25.5 Hate.&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Notice the part about 22 being the max, regardless of the shield AC value? Scaling, and then capped at a value so low that it hasn't be higher end for years? That sounded too simlar to the problems with taunt to be coincidence to me, so I started looking at bash hate without a cap, and several things suddenly made sense.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Furious Bash...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Vanilla 25ac shield from original EQ, with 25ac&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;22 hate (capped) = 22 hate&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Highest end FB shield from today's EQ with 110ac and FB7&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;22 hate (capped) x 1.7 (FB7) = 37 hate&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So, we've gone from:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;22 hate per bash cycle to compensate for the offhand agro generated by a SSotY or PGT, to&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;37 hate per bash cycle to compensate for the offhand agro generated by a Swiftcleave or Dual auged Epic2.0&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The bash difference being so negligable compared to the vast offhand differences, that you wonder why on earth the bothered with the line. But remove the cap:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Vanilla 25ac shield from original EQ, with 25ac&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;25 hate (capped) = 22 hate&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Highest end FB shield from today's EQ with 110ac and FB7&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;110 hate (capped) x 1.7 (FB7) = 187 hate&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Now you've got a much more viable comparision between the offhand agro generation increases since pre-Kunark times, and the FB line actually enough of a provides a benefit to make it worthwhile to look for shields with it on.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Then I looked at the shield block AAs warriors got, which always confused me as a shield is very situational and hit with the double whammy of huge loss in dps coupled with huge loss in agro. This didn't really tally with the other two tank classes who suffered a much lower dps reduction, and very little agro reduction. Remove the cap on bash hate and suddenly the agro reduction is reduced greatly. We still suffer the major dps reduction but some of our offhand melee and proc agro is compensated. This would make shields a much more viable alternative, although since it would benefit knights to the same degree you'd have to establish whether 'agro with shield' between the two classes would remain balanced. Knights have already been agro balanced assuming they're using a shield while tanking, whereas warriors are assumed to be DWing where agro is a concern, so bash hate seems largely ignored.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Removing this cap has the potential to open up shield use to the warrior class as a viable alternative to DWing, and without the need for any sort of complex 'shieldmate' itemisation. Obviously balance would be needed to check the extra agro makes enough of a difference, whilst at the same time remaining a compromise, as well as agro balance versus knights since they're assumed to use shields whever they're tanking already. The existance of this cap however does seem to explain a lot of the inconsistancies I feel exist with FB and to a lesser extent, shield block&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So my question to the devs is this: Does the cap on bash hate (as parsed by TenFold) exist, and was it overlooked when creating Furious Bash, the subsequent extensions to the line, and shield block AAs for warriors?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;If you think 187 hate per bash is going to offset dual auged 2.0 in any way shape or form(and actually its Dual aug-ed 2.0+ the difference between DBoW/BBoB and dual augged 2.0 since when going to shield you move 2.0 to primary...) You're in for a shock.  You get 2-3 rounds of combat with your offhander per bash.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Shield bash Hate really can't be altered to give value to shields, because it can be too easily swaped in and out to bash when needed, so it can be used in the other configurations.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

For two, unless you time is perfectly you will almost certainly experience a loss in swing agro and a degree of proc agro by bandoliering a shield in and out so frequently, offsetting the potential gains. For three, if you arewilling to go through all that for miniscule agro gains I think you deserve them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The thing is the hate cap on bash has made it fail to scale in hate generation the way it should. What is the point of making furious bash focus etc. when the gain is so small it's not even worth mentioning.. Of course bash isn't going to totally offset and agro offhander, it's not supposed to. It could be a lot better then it is without becoming overpowered.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bash right now is less then 400 agro per minute, if the hate wer uncapped it would with SoLL+30ac aug 135 x 1.35 = 182 agro bash or ~1800 agro per minute. No 1400 agro per minute isn't replacing your offhander but it's not a gain to be scoffed at either.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I would think removing the cap on shield would be a good idea.  Really the amount of hate it generating now looks way to small.  Also if someone want to go to the work of swaping shield in and all the time even if you say its no extra work is it really that big a deal?  Just my thoughs from the side lines.</description>

      <description>Removing any caps on bash hate generation wouldn't make shields equivalent to dual wielding for aggro generation (hence there'd be little motivation for bandoliering out every 6 seconds for a bash), but certainly would give people a reason to hit the bash hotkey, and may make shield use a bit more practical.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It may also be reasonable to consider increasing the damage cap on bash, not just hate... it was revamped a very long time ago now to its current limit (scales with shield ac to I think 15 ac, and is capped past that), making shields essentially a 15/60 weapon, unhastable, with no double attack, which is of course a rediculously small amount of damage output in today's EQ.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm glad SOME people actually understood what I was saying. I never intended to suggest making bash interchangable with dual wielding - there are more than enough stupidly unbalanced suggestions on these boards already. I was merely wondering if the cap was overlooked when creating Furious Bash, because it seems to add a meaningless focus to a meaningless amount of extra hate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the three tank classes, all have shield block AAs but only one is heavily penalised by using a shield. I'm not suggesting removing though penalties, just reducing some aspect of the double whammy of 35% loss of DPS in addition to 35% loss of agro warriors suffer, compared to the significantly smaller penalties knights have when using a shield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description>

Not sure why, I'd think some guy smacking me in the head with a heavy shield would tend to piss me off a bit. I suppose they would rather have complicated fixes that more easily lend themselves to becoming overpowered then more simple fixes with less chance to become overpowering.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
