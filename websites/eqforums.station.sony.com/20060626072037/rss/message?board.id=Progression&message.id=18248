      <title>A retired Enchanter's posting...</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Progression&amp;message.id=17869#M17869</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I am coming out of retirement for this.&amp;nbsp; I left EQ for EQ2 - it was superior graphics, but the lore etc. just lost me.&amp;nbsp; Now I look forward to starting this server with you.&amp;nbsp; I have a few statements and a question or two...&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;First question:&amp;nbsp; I recall back in 1999 that my enchanter was not too wanted for grouping etc. until the day I got Clarity.&amp;nbsp; Breeze did NOT exist at the beginning of the game and was only added well AFTER I had Clarity.&amp;nbsp; Please, please, PLEASE tell me Breeze will be in at the get-go....&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Second Question:&amp;nbsp; I recall starting in Erud and walking out to Toxx.&amp;nbsp; I recall walking forward about 30 or 40 paces and getting my butt handed to me by something I never saw.&amp;nbsp; That part has little to do with the question except this:&amp;nbsp; Back then an Erudite had VERY poor night vision and since Toxx was a heavily atmospheric affected zone and deep in the jungle, you couldn't see 5 paces in front of you.&amp;nbsp; Has this been changed?&amp;nbsp; Will it be a "hot and steamy jungle" that you can not experience at night without some risk?&amp;nbsp; On the one hand, the fact is you can no longer lose your corpse there as it is now.&amp;nbsp; on the other hand - it was friggen fun&amp;nbsp; : )&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Enchanter Spells:&amp;nbsp; Will I need to run all the way to Highkeep to get my pet spells like it was at first?&amp;nbsp; I recall running to those rotten dark elves and conning my way into buying some imbue spells as well.&amp;nbsp; They still gonna be the only source?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Enchanter gear:&amp;nbsp; Ok - I think I will need a Stein of Maggok, a Crude Stein, a GBS, Robe of the Ishva ftw!, and, and, um...I seem to have forgotten the names of every other low-level (er, pre-kunark era) item in the game.....&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;No - this is Original Neph from MithMarr.&amp;nbsp; Back when EQ released things were MUCH tougher for a Erudite Enchantress and worshipper of Quellious to boot.&amp;nbsp; I caught SO much crap about NOT being agnostic.....&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Back then there was no such thing as breeze.&amp;nbsp; You got Clarity at twenty-something - and once you had that any group would take you - but until that point - you were OK for crowd control etc. but were not considered a very strong groupmate until you had the brain candy.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Heh - not wanting to wait for the release, I went ahead and started a new chanter on the old MithMarr server (ok, ok, Saryn or whatever).&amp;nbsp; OMG.&amp;nbsp; It has been so long that I HAD to do the tutorial just so I could learn how to walk, talk, kill, etc.&amp;nbsp; I have used nothing from my old enchantress - but the 5k plat was tempting.&amp;nbsp; Everything so far has been on my own and I would just like to mention something.&amp;nbsp; 2 days of playing and I have YET to see a single other player in Erudin/Toxx.&amp;nbsp; What has happened to my EQ?&amp;nbsp; You know what EQ needs?&amp;nbsp; They need an End-Server event.&amp;nbsp; That's right.&amp;nbsp; After a certain point, a person can do some elaborate quest etc. and destroy the whole friggen universe.&amp;nbsp; End Server.&amp;nbsp; Server gets wiped, and two weeks later starts all over.&amp;nbsp; Naturally, there should be a RL prize for being the person to kill a server....&amp;nbsp; maybe a real plat/gold coin, Hummer (I MEAN the vehicle), rename the server after them, etc.&amp;nbsp; Use your imagination.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Any word on the newbie armor quests yet?&amp;nbsp; These were NOT in when we went live and the gear is VERY damned nice compared to what we had....&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I could go for that if the token or event or whatever it was that caused the wipe was different everytime and had a 3 year spawn timer.&amp;nbsp; I think a real cool idea would be a bridge between EQ1 and EQ2.&amp;nbsp; Call it EQ 1a or something.&amp;nbsp; Have the world get wiped but let us keep our chars.&amp;nbsp; Every patch a new cataclysm could occur, war could be launched or battle fought.&amp;nbsp; Old zones would gradually change, some would dissappear, other new ones could emerge.&amp;nbsp; I think it would be a blast to play in a dynamic, truly changing world.</description>

&lt;P&gt;Everything so far has been on my own and I would just like to mention something.&amp;nbsp; 2 days of playing and I have YET to see a single other player in Erudin/Toxx.&amp;nbsp; What has happened to my EQ?&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff9900&gt;The newbie zones had already been in decline for some time and WoW and EQII served to hasten the process.&amp;nbsp; The introduction of the tutorial zone made things worse and essentially put the newbie zones out of business.&amp;nbsp; Looking for groups ther is going to be pretty rough.&amp;nbsp; From what I hear, most folks go from the tutorial to FoB/Kurns and from there to Paludal Caverns and on to either Neth Lair or unrest.&amp;nbsp; Been awhile since I played at that level though so this is mostly all hearsay.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff9900&gt;For that info you are gonna have to join the beta or wait until the server goes live :)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;They debating them, but i highly doubt&amp;nbsp; they make it in as they are now, if at all (stats stripped most likely)&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The server wipe idea sounds kinda cool, but i think it would get dull after the 2nd time you have to start all over again.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>1. Breeze is in, it may be harder to get when the server goes live than is currently the case on the live servers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2.&amp;nbsp; Erudite/human blindless is much better than it used to be.&amp;nbsp; Visibility in general is much better.&amp;nbsp; So take that however you will.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3.&amp;nbsp; Pet spells after the first couple are still in highkeep.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4.&amp;nbsp; You might also keep an eye out for useful focus effects; since this is a progression server rather than a classic one, the items that had focus effects added to them still have them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;re: thread derail&lt;br&gt;meh... if you can deal with bankers being able to instantly transfer&#xD;

them being able to transfer stuff to someone else just as instantaniously?&lt;br&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;I'm happy to group with a chanter at any level; Mez roolz; so does haste and slow and debuffs.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I agree, shared banks make a lot of things a LOT easlier.; I'd rather they were not in too.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>They are going to be leaving in shared banks. With this you can create a halfling and run over to HHK and buy your spell, then put it in shared bank. So shouldn't have to do much extra running. You shouldn't have to worry about dying to the mobs in HH since they should be perma camped.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;lt;WARINING THREAD DERAIL FOLLOWS&amp;gt; I understand as far as customer service tickets they want to keep the shared bank in, but I don't like it from a RP'ing stand point. I know I know I don't have to use it, but my laziness is stronger than my conviction :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Welcome back OP!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Breeze will be in but may be harder to get. Time will tell.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Except for the L1 and L2 pets, your pet spells are in HHK.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Groups should not be that difficult to get for an enchanter. Breeze at L14 and a strong pet does a lot for you. Your pet tends to be 2-3 levels higher than you when you first get it. Also, the lack of twink and overpowered gear makes lull and mez excellent abilities to have in a group.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Yes, Maddoc has stated that Breeze will be made available with no additional details.&amp;nbsp; As far as vision for the human types, it used to be that being blind really meant you couldn't see, but that's pretty much gone now.&amp;nbsp; With gamma settings and what not, its a thing of the past, sadly enough.</description>
