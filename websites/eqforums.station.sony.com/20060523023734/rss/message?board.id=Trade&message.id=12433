    <title>Question about sow potion</title>
    <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Trade&amp;message.id=12433</link>
    <description>I was just wondering if they'd discontinued the sow potion for alchemists, I'm on Tunare server and it seems to me that not many alchemists are making these anymore. I was on the bazaar earlier looking for it and when I found it they were grosly over priced, was like 8k for a 10 dose vial whereas when I was playing a couple months ago a guildie friend of mine was selling them for 75pp for a 10 dose vial.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;New potions, new names.  Those are collector's items, no longer made.  Philter and distillate are prefixes for searching the new ones.</description>
