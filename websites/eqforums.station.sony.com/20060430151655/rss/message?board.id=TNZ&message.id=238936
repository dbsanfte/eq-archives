    <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;i just did a cleric with a druid 46 druid.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Do kurns until about 15 or so.&amp;nbsp; PC weaker area till about 23.&amp;nbsp; Head to sol A till it slows down (think it was 30 something).&amp;nbsp; Head to gulf of gunthak beach until about mid 40s.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Kurns is obvious.&amp;nbsp; pull trains. let mobs&amp;nbsp;pound to death on DS.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;PC i started the normal areas but found the DS worked better in the weaker water areas north of the normal areas you hunt.&amp;nbsp; Lots of low con blues up that area and i would just DS me and the druid and pull trains.&amp;nbsp; 5 or 6 mobs at a time pounding themselves to death on the DS.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Because of the way DS works on powerleveling a plate class twink i found just pulling completely ridicolous trains and then healing the twink worked better with lower cons in some situations.&amp;nbsp; This was one.&amp;nbsp; Plus up north of the normal area i was all alone and had unfettered access to all the mobs i wanted.&amp;nbsp; It turns out there are areas of level 16ish(?)&amp;nbsp;mobs in PC that nobody ever touches!&amp;nbsp; Hordes and hordes of mobs to pull and nobody ever goes there cause its just better to do the level 18+ mobs unless your pulling trains unto a damage shield =)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;One thing a cleric has that a paladin doesnt is an AE spell so that i could get the 1pt of damage needed to get exp.&amp;nbsp; So youll have to work a little harder to get the 1pt of damage in.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Sol A is great while they were yellow+.&amp;nbsp; I think that will be more valuable as a hot spot then chasing undead.&amp;nbsp; The DS from your druid will work better that way.&amp;nbsp; Again same strat.&amp;nbsp; Pull trains keep twink alive until DS kills the train.&amp;nbsp; Do some minor damage with twink.&amp;nbsp; Cleric actually saved my 46 druids butt here a couple times on overpulls but alas you shouldnt have that problem with a 61 druid.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The beach in the gulf of gunthak is &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;1) low hp&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;2) undead&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;3) a hotspot&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So I stayed there all the way until 46!&amp;nbsp; Which was about 2 levels to long for that beach but i wanted to push to 46 where my main could take over the leveling of the cleric.&amp;nbsp; The reason it worked so well was the cleric could dps undead so much better then live mobs.&amp;nbsp; You might want to leave that beach sooner but in the low 30s it should serve you nice.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;After 46 I just grouped the cleric with a 70 rogue and went to town exping in hotspots.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;All and all i wouldnt chase undead at the start.&amp;nbsp; Your chasing low hp hotspot zones where you can pull trains onto the DS and kill things that way.&amp;nbsp; Thats far more efficient then chasing undead.&amp;nbsp; The kinds of buffs your casting are skins, heals, regens and damage shields.&amp;nbsp; The paladin is set up to tank.&amp;nbsp; Your focus is on pulling the most that you can still heal the paladin (or your druid)&amp;nbsp;fast enough to keep him alive.&amp;nbsp; Thats how your going to cruise to 50 the fastest.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Im not sure i would skip out on hotspots in the 50s just to chase undead either.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;div&gt;I started a Pally last night and think I'm going to try and power level him up. All my other alts have had the slow grind. I'd take them out and do all the newbie quests. For a change I'm going to twink this toon a bit and try to get him some levels a little faster. I was going to work on 1Hs and 2Hs and skip the 1Hb and 2Hb. At least for now. I'll 2box this toon with my 61 Druid for awhile then use another alt later. Any advice since I've never power leveled a toon before?&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Get a massive dragonclaw shard as a weapon. It's bazaar buyable, no recommended level, and the ratio will make up for the lack of a proc. Fill all his slots with the best gear you can, get him a temperance, hti him with thorns and regen, and start pulling stuff. Just make sure you hit each one at least once, and the druid does no damage, so you get credit for the kills.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I would not really worry about weapons skills (other than 1hs)&amp;nbsp;until 40ish. From 40-50 exp slows down a bit, and all skill caps stay at 200 for 10 levels, so it's a good time to catch the skills up.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Well this weekend was a blast! One of the best weekends yet. I did the tutorial to 10, one quick stop to do a newbie quest with just the pally to gauge his skills. I've done that quest with every toon I've created. Went to Kurn's Tower till 15. Alternated PC and Unrest till 25 then when to Iceclad Ocean. At lvl 30 I shed the Gloomingdeep armor and got what I could in the Bazaar for 7k. Not great but upgrade again in another 15 - 20 lvl's. All skills are improving nicely, except bash. No matter what I do it doesn't seem to move up. What's the secret in getting the bash skill up?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I'm lvl 32 now and I'll probably stay in Iceclad till they turn Dk Blue, just a few are now. I've been picking on Frosted Ice Giants, not sure what lvl they are. I bow pull the mob and start whacking it, switch to Druid and snare, heal and buff when necessary. I buy spells 10 lvl's at a time. So there in no down time at all. I never really knew how powerful the Druid DS was till I did this. You'll never see my Druid without this. The Pally is progressing nicely and can't wait to get him into his forties so I can 2 box with the Druid and they both can get exp.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Tower of frozen shadows is in iceclad, and is a great spot to level. Try it out, for the dungeon bonus, and mostly undead population. Plus some nifty loot.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The zones listed below would keep you busy from level 10 to 50, and you can fight undead the whole time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kurn's&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unrest&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kaesora&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Karnor's Castle&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lower Guk&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;Get a temperance (virtue when 46+), and use the Druid for ports, damage shield, regen, strength, and heals.  &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Main advice for powerlevelling a pally is UNDEAD.  Go to unrest and kill everything until 35 or so.  Great pally zone.  If you get yourself a ghoulbane and the instrument of nife spell(undead proc spell at 26) you won't even need the druid.  Just a suggestion.  I flew through the levels without any help in urest with my pally.  I even did it self buffed.</description>

Might hit PC for a couple of levels (11-13)  then head directly to Unrest. The Druid will be there just to buff and heal if necessary. Hope to get in a group and will then buff the group.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Kurn's Tower until 18 or so.  Lots of Undead and pretty easy zone.  Good XP.  Then Unrest.   After that Lower Guk or one of the Hot zones.</description>

      <description>When PLing with a druid, it's simple. HP Buff, Damage Shields, snare or root mobs. 71's zone progression looks like the best way to go. PC isn't reallly needed as Kurn's &amp;amp; Unrest prolly give as fast xp with the benefit of fighting undeads.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
