				<DIV>We have representatives for classes, but we don't have any for races...&nbsp; When we have a race related issue (such as Drakkins and their armor dye disabling) what can be done aside from constantly posting on threads that no Devs pay attention to?&nbsp; There has to be some dialogue involved for such occasions or some precedent for a race to have major issues with Devs decisions about them, doesn't there?</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>How many of the Devs are playing Drakkin mains?&nbsp; How many have a character running around in the 70's that they can't customize further than name?&nbsp; How many of you have tried to roleplay a Drakkin Necromancer in a bright orange robe with purple and gold highlights that look like something out of a jester's closet?</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>How many angry posts must there be on one subject before the community resigns themselves to the fact that the Dev team doesn't care less what we as consumers think?</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Tell me there's a method to the madness here and that this particular issue is being re-thought or has been discussed already and a final decision has been made and WHY.&nbsp; Tell me there's a pot of gold at the end of the new character models for all races rainbow...</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Tell me anything really, just tell me my $25 a month and loyalty for 6 years means something to the current Dev team...&nbsp; Don't we deserve an explanation for preventing one race from using a major feature of the game?</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>If we had a Drakkin representative that interacted with the Devs from time to time I'm sure we'd have a solid answer at least, even if we didn't like it.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Better than wondering everytime I log in whether or not this will be the day I see a patch note mentioning this issue.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Is anyone even paying attention to us?</DIV>
