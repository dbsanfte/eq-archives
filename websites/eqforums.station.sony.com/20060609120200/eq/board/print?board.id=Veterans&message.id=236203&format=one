<P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">Wow, what a thread and what a great variance of comments. I take full responsibility for the revamp of VP. It was my first zone project as a designer on this team when I started. Keep in mind; I did this revamp right after LDoN was launched. I'll give you some insight on what the VP revamp entailed:<namespace prefix = o ns = "http://www.lithium.com/unique/URI"></P>
<P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">1) Ripped out all of the old, horrible pathing in the zone and repathed the zone.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">2) Changed the placement of base population in the zone and made it more varied, as well as more dense in specific hallways to make you crawl to specific rooms and use those as safe points for pulling the rest of the hallways. A good example of this is the "safe cubby" which was used in old VP as a place to pull Hoshkar to kill him. In the current VP, that's a good place to place a group and pull hallways of NPCs to.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">3) Increased the difficulty of the base population of the zone and changed the drops and added rare NPCs that drop new loot, as well as the old loot off the old dragons. I felt that, it would be unfair to take away something like the Robe of the Azure Sky from players. So the rares, which, I tried to give mimic the old dragons in terms of abilities, dropped the old loot.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">4) Added quests to the zone - 1 per dragon. Looking back, if I had more time, I would have probably had some anti-dragon quests that occurred outside of the zone that gave players an additional benefit to killing in the zone. The quests in the zone were extremely popular at the time, which was great. However, killing in the zone wasn't popular because everyone wanted to "save" their faction.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">5) Changed the key quest. I felt under the old key quest, getting access to an elemental planes level zone (in terms of difficulty and reward via exp/loot) would have been too easy. I added in a "gateway" dragon that was roughly as difficult as a tier3 god in POP would limit the access to players that was on the verge of being elemental flagged. I wanted to make a "faster" access pathway into the zone instead of camping the old key mobs, so I introduced an alternate method of getting the items needed for the key, which was a faster method, but required a group. Initially I got good feedback on this. Not sure how people feel about it in today's game.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">6) Changed all of the dragons in the zone and made them "elemental mini" difficulty. I tried to shoot for around the same difficulty as Arch Mage Yozanni in Plane of Fire. Phara Dar was tuned to be around Xegony difficulty.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">I took 3 long (~70 hour work weeks) to design, implement, and test all of the content in the revamped Veeshan's Peak. This includes the itemization (I am/was the item's guy back then too, heh) and adding in spell requests for the various spells each NPC casts. At the time, there were a glut of Elemental guilds on a lot of servers, and my goal was to remove some stress off those 4 zones and offer an alternative place to hunt. I also wanted the quests to be decent rewards for players who could put in an amount of time outside of raiding, especially after having to kill an elemental gateway boss, and do a good amount of factioning.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">VP at the time was one of the least used zones in the game. You definitely could go into VP and kill all of the dragons solo. Once one group did that zone every week or maybe every week and a half, there was no other zone usage of the zone. I wanted more out of the zone - I wanted it to be a place that's used more. And for a good while after the revamp (I'd say up until Omens or so) the zone usage from the reports I saw showed that it was used more after the revamp than before.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">Of course however, like every old zone, the usability of the zone reduces substantially over the years. The original poster thinks that there's disconnect between us and the players, but in my opinion, the original poster really doesn't seem to see why this zone isn't used anymore - it's because realistically, things from Gates of Discord and before are rarely used because there's newer, better, more rewarding content in each and every expansion we put out. It's simply going to happen in a game that now has 11 expansions and is pushing an 8th year of being Live. You could replace this VP thread and say the same thing for the Solusek C, Cazic Thule, or Siren's Grotto revamps. Heck, you can probably say the same thing for zones that don't have the revamp, such as <namespace prefix = st1 ns = "http://www.lithium.com/unique/URI"><place><PlaceName>Dawnshroud</PlaceName> <PlaceType>Peaks</PlaceType></place>, Crypt of Decay, or Riwwi.</P>
