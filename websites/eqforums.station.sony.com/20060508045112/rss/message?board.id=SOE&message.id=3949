      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I was in charge of writing and running the Live Quest for EQ at the Atlanta Fan Faire.&amp;nbsp; In case some of you who did not attend Fan Faire are interested in seeing what a Live Quest entails I thought I should post it here.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Groups of 10-12 formed and then the group selected a group leader and a team name.&amp;nbsp; They were given 2 hours to comeplete the quest and then were told what the quest was.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;******************&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Marsha Stonepenner of North Kaladim had recently been thinking about writing for the Mining Journal instead of just selling it. She knew she needed a big story to break into the writing business.&amp;nbsp; So she decided to send adventurers on a Journey across Norrath.&amp;nbsp; She selected 14 certain high profile NPCs across Antonica and Faydwar that she wanted the adventurers to come in contact with and each of these individuals would provide a quest token to the group as proof of their contact.&amp;nbsp; Each NPC&amp;nbsp; required a task of the group in order to provide a quest token.&amp;nbsp; To complete the quest and win the prize, 14 quest tokens were required to complete the quest and claim the prize.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Zordak had 20 trivia questions.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;________________________&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Gynok Moltor – Due to a curse from long ago by the gnolls of Blackburrow, the mummy Gynok Motlor had been haunting Befallen.&amp;nbsp; He had grown tired of his endless days of walking the undead halls and longed to be laid to rest.&amp;nbsp; Gynok heard a rumor that if he could solve a hidden message he found on an unfortunate adventurer who found her demise in Befallen, that he could lift the curse.&amp;nbsp; He asked for the aid of adventurers in figuring out the message that he hoped would end his cursed existence.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Gynok had a drop down puzzle which does not easily translate to the forums so I will just post the message his puzzle translated into.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;"Your family is curse as you well know,&lt;BR&gt;For crimes against gnolls from long ago.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;A platinum ring you now possess,&lt;BR&gt;Return it to us and perhaps you can rest.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Refuse to return that which you have taken,&lt;BR&gt;And forever in the halls of Befallen you will awaken.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Signed,&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The Gnolls of Blackburrow"&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;Shady Swashbuckler - The Shady Swashbuckler was dying for a good game of dice.&amp;nbsp; He offered to give each group a quest token if they played at least one game with him.&amp;nbsp; He and the group leader each got one roll of the dice and whomever had the highest roll wins.&amp;nbsp; The bet was one plat per roll and they could play 5 times, win or lose.&amp;nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Kizdean Gix – Kizdean had injured his writing hand and needed to write up his status report about the West Commons happenings for Neriak.&amp;nbsp; He asked each group to help him by writing the status report for him but there was a catch… it had to be in some creative form such as poetic verse or song because Neriak was running a contest for the most creative status report.&amp;nbsp; Kizdean is not much for creativity but he did want to win the contest, so he gave each group a quest token for writing the status report for him. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Roror - Roror had been spending the day forwarding Cazic Thule's wishes by cursing hay all day and sought entertainment. He asked each group to entertain him with a song, dance, joke, etc. and he gave them a quest token in return.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Ambassador Dvinn – Ambassador Dvinn set each group to the task of “backstabbing” people passing nearby.&amp;nbsp; They needed to successfully backstab 3 people without them noticing.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Mina Glimmerwing - Mina was a faerie and as all know, faeries are very fond of fun and games.&amp;nbsp; She teased and played with the adventurers setting silly tasks for them and in return for doing her silly requests, she gave each group a quest token. Silly tasks were things like doing a headstand, walk around clucking and flapping like a chicken.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
