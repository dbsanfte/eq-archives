&lt;P&gt;The main point in the change was to start introducing death penalties while players are still in the relatively safe area of Gloomingdeep.&amp;nbsp; The penalties start out really low, though, and you lose next to no experience at level 6.&amp;nbsp; It slowly goes up from there.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face="Comic Sans MS" color=#993300 size=3&gt;What is the reasoning for lowering the death penalty down to lvl 6? What was wrong with respawning with full gear until 10 and no exp loss untill 11?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;font face="Arial"&gt;I dont understand what people whine about there are aloot of people still playing that styarted back in 1999 when when you hade to run to your corpse from lvl 1 and /consent name gave the consented person the right to loot your corpse, sure it was chalenging back then but the chalenge made it fun it was what gave you a reason to get back in to the game.&lt;br&gt;And yes i have tried the tutorial number of times and find it booring, where is the chalange to run up to a mob solo knowing you just spawn at bind point with all gear if you get killed?&lt;br&gt;EQ isnt WoW or EQ2 and isnt meen to be any of them either, we who have played it since 1999 stay here becouse its EQ!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS. sorry for the spelling English isnt my main language.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;the reason people whine is for the majority of the people currently playing weren't around in 99.&amp;nbsp; they've grown up with having no worries to level 10, and change is hard for a lot of people.&amp;nbsp; if people stop responding to this it will go away.</description>

&lt;P&gt;I think 'we' are loosing focus here. 'we' are not in Tutorial anymore. and IF we happen to pass thru it&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Its generally with an Uber-equiped toon, that carries at least a Blade of Carnage. or something similiar&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Dont forget that we are having this discussion in 'Newbie' area of this site...&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Shouldnt we instead make a new non-equipped toon and actually go to Tutorial, and see if we can find some&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;true 'newbies' that we can help?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;after all we have the knowledge &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Teach them how to position around a mob, tips on pulling, tips on making plat.. (bows etc from barrels)&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;'we' could even go as far as to make a /join newbie channel. where nice patient people can answer all kinds of questions&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;(not give plat or armour mind). only help given atm when entering Tutorial is a http for SoE homepage&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;And most importantly BEG SoE to move tutorial away from PoK. what can you learn about dieing and careful pulling &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;when someone just told you to zone out, and beg for a Temp? to make you near invincible&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;at least put a lower level limit on Temp..!&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Can still gate in at 42. Most of the time you get auto-zoned into POK, but once in a while it lets you stay. I had to run to the escape tunnel once last night.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Rashere said:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;To help smooth the transition to incurring death penalties for new players (losing experience and leaving a corpse), the level when you start to incur death penalties has been lowered from level 11 to level 6 and the amount of experience you lose when you die now starts at a very small amount at level 6 and slowly ramps up from there. These changes will be going to the test and progression servers later today.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;I have heard it was something they had been discussing for some time.&amp;nbsp; People were leaving gloomingdeep with no clue as to what happened when you got killed at later levels.&amp;nbsp; This is supposed to help prepare them for real eq where everything is not as simple and safe as the tutorial.&amp;nbsp; They are aware of possible problems from multiple tutorial instances and are working to solve them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Comic Sans MS" color=#993300 size=3&gt;Wait, does that mean you start losing exp/levels in Gloomingdeep? Which, imo, is stupid seeing how Kren/OL usually results in 2-3 deaths before you manage to take them down&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Comic Sans MS" color=#993300 size=3&gt;If people are too stupid to read the pop-up message when you get to lvl 10 that warns you about your gear remaining on your corpse and the message at 11 warning about losing exp as well then they should not be playing (the message also gets emailed to your ingame mail-box)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Yes, you loose your corpse, and experience, now, in Glooming Deep. Which is something I have personally advocated ever since the tutorial came out. I have said the tutorial is NOT a good example of what EQ is like, because there is no death penalty, and no corpse retrieval. I note they put in a corpse summoner, just like in the guild lobby. He summons corpses for free. I think this is a nice touch. Very well done.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Again, I think it was imperative they change the tutorial to better reflect the actual game, and it needed to have a death penalty, and corpse retrieval, or the people who play it have not a clue what EQ is really like. This is especially true for people who&amp;nbsp;play just the tutorial to get some idea of what the game is about. To me it practically amounted to false advertising.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;honestly, they still are better off than original eq.&amp;nbsp; what they have probably seen is people just keep dying and dying and dying and reusing that dps from the previous death to take down mobs they shouldnt be attempting, because there is no penalty.</description>

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;That used to work in 1999, but kids these days! A little hardship and the give up completely!!....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;FYI, /em grouchy talk...&lt;br&gt;I lost my gear at level 5 in Everfrost (or whatever the place noob barbarians sprout). Dang snow panthers ate me and spit me out and I couldn't find my way back through the maze and mobs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;BTW, when I think about it; there are no real corpse runs nowadays. Most of the time people rely on rezzes, if theres no rezzes available, they go get a corpse summon in Guild Lobby. If they are poor, stingy or misinformed - they quit the game. Haven't seen a real classic corpse run in years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;I disagree.&amp;nbsp; What it teaches them is to be a little more careful when fighting.&amp;nbsp; Yes, we all die and we die repeatedly at the lower levels.&amp;nbsp; It was a hassle to get your corpse.&amp;nbsp; It was a hassle to have to re-mem your spells.&amp;nbsp; It was also made you learn to find better ways to do things.&amp;nbsp; Remember when you couldn't simply summon your corpse to the GL and start over?&amp;nbsp; It made you explore a bit.&amp;nbsp; And there was indeed excitement in it.&amp;nbsp; I can remember many times running naked through east and west commons trying to avoid becoming bear or griffin bait AGAIN.&amp;nbsp; It made me learn how to go about things and made me learn how important it was to avoid dying in the first place.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I agree that the raising it to 10 before corpse runs and such was a mistake.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Losing your gear due to loss of internet is a rarity these days.&amp;nbsp; And if you do die to things beyond your control like you said, it isn't that hard to get your corpse these days.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;I disagree.&amp;nbsp; What it teaches them is to be a little more careful when fighting.&amp;nbsp; Yes, we all die and we die repeatedly at the lower levels.&amp;nbsp; It was a hassle to get your corpse.&amp;nbsp; It was a hassle to have to re-mem your spells.&amp;nbsp; It was also made you learn to find better ways to do things.&amp;nbsp; Remember when you couldn't simply summon your corpse to the GL and start over?&amp;nbsp; It made you explore a bit.&amp;nbsp; And there was indeed excitement in it.&amp;nbsp; I can remember many times running naked through east and west commons trying to avoid becoming bear or griffin bait AGAIN.&amp;nbsp; It made me learn how to go about things and made me learn how important it was to avoid dying in the first place.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I agree that the raising it to 10 before corpse runs and such was a mistake.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Losing your gear due to loss of internet is a rarity these days.&amp;nbsp; And if you do die to things beyond your control like you said, it isn't that hard to get your corpse these days.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The most disheartening thing to happen to me in over four years of playing this game was in the first week.&amp;nbsp; My warrior that I had painfully levelled to the giddy heights of level seven, with various bits of raw hide armour, rusty weapons, even a bow dropped by a mob in QH, ventured into Blackburrow and on pulling going to engage a gnoll fell down the inside of a tree, got swamped and died.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;No way to get my corpse back, I knew nothing about invisibility, corpse summon spells, rezzes etc,&amp;nbsp; I hadn't discovered the bank and lost all my equipment, what few gp I had accumulated, my weapons, everything.&amp;nbsp; I nearly quit.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Corpse runs under level 10 serve no purpose other than to make genuinely new players want to quit.&amp;nbsp; I abandoned that toon, remade my wizard that I had given up on after drowning in the gloom (hadn't discovered the gamma setting) in Felwithe and losing her guild note (I thought that without that I couldn't start the game properly) and decided I was going to give it one more try before cancelling my week old subscription.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;So no to corpse runs under level 10 thank you.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;hr&gt;Corpse runs under level 10 serve no purpose other than to make genuinely new players want to quit.  I abandoned that toon, remade my wizard that I had given up on after drowning in the gloom (hadn't discovered the gamma setting) in Felwithe and losing her guild note (I thought that without that I couldn't start the game properly) and decided I was going to give it one more try before cancelling my week old subscription.&lt;hr&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But back then there wasnt a Tutorial to run through.  Maybe there should be a lesson on corpse recovery, ie using the /corpse, /corpsedrag/drop commands and an invis, set duration potion that works/exists only in the tutorial and only pops on the cursor when that particularly lesson pops up, or be told to obtain it from a particular vendor.  And the mobs that killed the toon rotate/marches in a pattern, forcing the toon to invis up, then /con the mob to make sure it is not a See Invis mob.</description>

&lt;P&gt;i don't feel it ever should have been bumped to 10/11.&amp;nbsp; all these people who never had to go find your corpse (in half an hour because your corpse used to poof that quick at that level) in west karana because some evil cat ate you at level 3, making you cry cause all your hard work to get the (crappy) gear might be gone and nice shiney GP you just earned, don't know true hardship!&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;What does a new player learn from losing all his gear except that he doenst want to play anymore, Its not like getting your corpse is hard anymore. Besides losing all your gear because you died and some other factor like a lose of internet is just stupid not a "hardship".&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;he learns to be careful, and to not die.&amp;nbsp; what difference does 5 levels make?&amp;nbsp; gimme a break.</description>

&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;You didnt answer my question what does anyone learn from losing their gear this hasnt been possible for a some time now so why even bring it up? Yes they do learn from corpse runs but people learn nothing from losing gear except to not take any risks at all anymore.</description>

&lt;P&gt;Wrong.&amp;nbsp; They do learn to be more careful because there might be the RISK of losing thier gear.&amp;nbsp; Of course, you don't even LOSE your gear anymore with ShadowRest so all you lose is a little exp and time.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;What do I know though, personally I think they should raise the lower limit on Temperance to around 20 or 25 too.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;i agree, but also give a lower level spell that is designed for lower level people.</description>
