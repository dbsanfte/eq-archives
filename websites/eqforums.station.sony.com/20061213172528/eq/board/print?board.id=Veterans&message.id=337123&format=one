<P>"As for pet push.. I can sit on one side and&nbsp; bear on other and it will not move at all.&nbsp;"</P>
<P>Do you have all the pet flurrying AAs?&nbsp; Near as I can tell those are the ones generating the push.&nbsp; How about those swarm pets, such cute PUSHY little buggers, lol--I USE them to push some places because they're so good at it.&nbsp; But of course I have also finished all pet AAs,&nbsp;I didn't used to notice it as much, must be something in there then that makes push go over the top.&nbsp;</P>
<P>I know mage and bst pets push like crazy, anyone who doesn't have their pet AAs all finished probably can't speak to this as well as those who have finished them can--pet push is extreme.&nbsp; Bst can control theirs because they're right there on the mob--mages need to stand still far away, not doable for them-pet off is what you have to control push basically.&nbsp; Not talking about cornering or walling, I'm talking about when you have a mob you're killing for a while in the open that needs to stay where he is.&nbsp; Pets are bad in such cases, period.</P>
