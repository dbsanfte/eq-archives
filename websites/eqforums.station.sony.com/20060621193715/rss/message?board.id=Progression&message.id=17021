    <description>As someone who joined EQ too late to really catch the "magic" I think this is awesome. I started playing EQ on October 31 2003, with all the people as living eyes. Since then I have played on and off trying to get somewhere. The problem has been that I'm too behind the bandwagon to really group mainly and I always get discouraged and quit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, I have seen glimpses of the magic and where veteran players come from when they talk less about newer content. I've always loved hunting in the older zones, XP may not be as streamlined but it's really cool to think back to "So cool, 7 years ago people were fighting in this camp." The old game also seems to be more loaded with character than newer content as well as the zones from newer MMORPGs. It appears like they designed the world around being a living world then put monsters in. I dislike when it seems an entire zone was designed simply for ideal XPing camps with little risk. I love the risk. I think I'm rambling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway, I'm excited and thankful for a chance to finally catch the magic of the old school EQ, I've always wanted to since I got the game a few years back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
