My first thoughts were 5 variables for each character (flags if you will) (and I am a computer geek too), each time you do a mission if would put the mission in newest variable. The variable would be from last to oldest run mission. Each time you get crystals from a mission it would move the variables down (rotating the older missions down or out) so that it would keep track of the last 5 missions done and in what order.<br><br>Each time you got crystals it would check the varaibles and for each instance of that mission reduce the crystals by 10%.<br><br>As I thought about this, some concerns came to mind. One was time between missions and the other, is that the code idea above was bulky.<br><br>Then I remembered tasktimers. Which could be modified to add "Mission Name: 10% (24 hours)" each time crystals were given or added 10% and 24 hours to a timer already there. Right before crystals were given it would check the timers and modify the reward. This could probably work for anytime loot is generated.<br><br>Anyway, just my brain working when I am actually trying to fall asleep.
