    <title>Do the gods have limits to their influence on Norrath?</title>
    <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Lore&amp;message.id=11237</link>
    <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Most of my curiosity towards this came from the story of how Solosek Ro "arched the spine of the serpent mountains" which ultimately caused the destruction of the Eldar forest. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;What Im wondering is, why, if Solosek Ro can change the shape of mountains, cant Tunare? When he did what he did, why couldtn she undo it? Perhaps she wasnt paying any attention? But wasnt that the time when all the gods eyes were on Norrath? Or did she not care? But why would she leave her most precious creations to destruction? Or was she not able to react? If she was not able to react by simply undoing what Solosek had done why not do something else, or get another god to? She might have convinced Karana to give the area more rain to compensate, but she didnt, or he wouldnt. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Why didnt she take out her revenge on his own followers? If Innoruk hated Tunares creations so much, why didnt he open a portal into the Eldar Forest, like had happened in Kithicor, and spill his hatred out onto it and destroy everything. Also, we have seen&amp;nbsp;many a gods creation go extinct. Why doesnt the god simply recreate them, or improve upon the original designe and reintroduce them?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Gods seem as though they can do whatever they want to us mortals whenever they want. Are there any guidlines they must follow or do they have a limit to their influence? &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Basically, most of the gods know how to play the diplomatic game amongst themselves. Solusek Ro, as evidenced from the PoTime Phase 1 emotes and PoP storyline, is a whiny little emo SoB, and doesn't.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;Depends on the power of their influence I'd say. Growth can overcome alot, but life does have it's limitations.</description>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;Any action by one god inevitably leads to another god acting elsewhere. The principle reason most of the gods came to Norath was to keep their other gods who came there in check.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The goals of the gods then is to establish the balance of power. If Innoruuk simply destroyed Tunare's creations, she woudl in turn destroy his. Both sides would in the end loose their position in Norath. Instead Inny establishes the balance of power. He gains a position in Norath while keeping the balance of power between them stable. If he went too far and outright destroyed all of Tunare's creation, she would be forced to create more (thus regaining her power) or outright destroy his, or both.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The Elfs migrate to the Faydwar, Ro gets his turf in the mountains, the humans appear. Despite the change, Tunare's original purpose remains and her creation survives (the Elfs seem to be doing well)&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;You bring up some good points, but one thing you have to remember is that not only do the gods have greater power than mortals, they also have greater foresight.&amp;nbsp; It may well have been that Tunare decided that it was the Elddar's destiny to fall, and thus did not interfere.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;'The tale gets somewhat sad at this juncture. The elves watched the outer edges of the Elddar Forest wither and die and it was progressing faster. The druids of Takish-Hiz used their most powerful magic to try to stop the advance of the drought. They would call for rain and protection from Tunare. &lt;STRONG&gt;They received neither. Solusek Ro's grip was too strong&lt;/STRONG&gt;. &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I would like to point out that in Kithicor, Innoruuk did not get up and go of his own volition.&amp;nbsp; He was summoned there by Laarthik K'Shin using the Blue Orb.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Furthermore, I believe a god's ability to directly affect mortals is likewise directly affected by that mortal's worship of the deity.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The more people worship a deity, they more he is able to impact that society or culture directly.&amp;nbsp; If an entire culture refuses to worship Innoruuk, he's not able to "get into their hearts and souls" per se - but likewise, they are unable to receive his blessings.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Thus he could not simply "lay waste" to the elves without messing with the world, and while Innoruuk and Tunare may dislike one another, one needs to accept that the gods are responsible enough not to constantly up mountains, dry rivers, or unleash immolations every time they have a quibble with a god.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;So fine, Innoruuk hates Tunare: Why risk such long standing negative consequences by constantly playing with the world's terrain?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;It's kind of like nuclear war: the option is always available, but the situation needs to be rather dire to use it.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Besides, were there any widespread Solusek Ro worshippers prior to his creation of the Desert?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;And finally, if Tunare is a "Good" deity, why would she lead a reprisal against Solusek's followers, and not just Solusek himelf?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Ezedriel on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;06-01-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;04:29 AM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Yeah, there were Ro worshippers before the Desert of Ro was created.&amp;nbsp; I refer to the cult of Elddar elven worshippers of Solusek Ro that have been revealed with PoR.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;That's a good point, Gukkor, and I have far too little knowledge of that new lore. I am not fond of PoR. :smileytongue: Is there anywhere I could read the lore or would someone be so kind as to post it?</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The ting about nuclear war is it's mutually assured destruction. If Inny wiped out Tunare's creations, she would have no choice but to retaliate or be forced to quit Norath altogether. The resulting conflict would likely end up with inny and Tunare neither gaining any headway.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;As it is, Tunare's creations in Norath are successful. The High Elfs have founded a good city and are influential throught the world, the Wood Elfs also have a good city and a founded operation in surefall to restore the forests. Their existance has had a huge influence on mankind, as they were in a position to give aid to the Marr's girl which led to the civilization of man and thus ultimately thwarting the plans of the gods imprisoning Mithanial Marr.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Had she actively opposed and retaliated against these orriginal threats, the Elfs may have been completely destroyed in the cross fire and their current position in Norath would be gone. The race of Man would have never reached it's current pinical, etc. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;In short, subilty and maintaining the balance of power is far more effective for the gods then moving mountains.&lt;/P&gt;</description>
