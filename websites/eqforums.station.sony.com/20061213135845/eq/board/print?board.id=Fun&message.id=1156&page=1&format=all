<DIV>I met a girl by the name of, well, names aren't important. Let's just call her Jane. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Jane and I met for the first time in Sept. of 01.&nbsp; She had been a long time member of a guild I had recently joined back in July. She had stopped playing back in March of that year, and came back in Sept. after she seriously hurt her back and had to stay in bed for a couple of weeks, so needed something to do. She'd posted on the boards what was going on, and I had responded that i hoped she got better. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I saw her ingame a couple of days later, and we started talking. Her druid was near my level, so we started grouping together. From then on, anytime we were on together, we grouped together. We grew to be great friends, both in game and out. We learned about one another, our likes, dislikes, our quirks and our foilbles. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Sometime around mid december I realized that I had fallen head over heels for her, but didn't want to mention it, since she was married. I didn't tell anyone about how I felt, except for person. Unknown to me at the time, but she had told this same person that she had fallen for me too. He kept pestering me to tell her how I felt, to take chances, etc. </DIV>
<DIV>I finally did tell her in mid January, and that's when she told me she felt the same way.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I felt guilty about this, since she was married and all, but then I found out her husband treated her like a slave. He never complimented her, always ordered her about, constantly insulted her, etc. She didn't tell me this, I found out from her brother-in-law, who really didn't like his brother doing all that. When I asked her about it, she confirmed it, and said she had been planning on leaving him long before she met me. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>We got married ingame that following April. Shortly after that I stopped playing my druid, and started up a necro. She had started a necro previous to that, to group with my shadow knight. Our necros quickly became our mains, and they hunted together from level thirty all the way up to 65. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>In July of 02 I flew from GA to Jersey to meet her. We spent 4 glorious days together, when she wasn't busy with her harp thing. (It was some kind of convention.) I really ddin't want to come back to Ga after that, but I had responsibilities here that I just couldn't abandoned on the spot.&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>In Sept of 02 I proposed to her ingame, but this time to be married in real life, not just in game. I had been planning on waiting until we got together in real life agian before proposing, but I couldn't wait any longer. I'd been planning on doing this shortly after getting off the plane in Ga. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Her first response was no. This left me very crushed. Soon as I saw the no I /q out of game, signed out of all the messenger programs, and took my phone off the hook. (Yeah, very immature of me.) A few days later I finally talked to her again, and after getting chewed out (which I did deserve) she explained to me what she would've said if I hadn't been such a child. She wouldn't marry me right off the bat. She wanted us to live together first, and to get to know one another's family, etc. So we were engaged, with no idea when we'd be getting married. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>In April of 03 her daughter needed help moving. Her boyfriend was being abusive, and she wanted out of it. Jane came down to Ga, and we spent the night together. The next day we left for St. Petersburg, Fla to help her daughter pack up and move. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Needless to say her daughter didn't like me, and certainly didn't like her mother dating a man younger than her youngist daughter was.&nbsp; That was the beginning of the end for us. They went back to CT, and I stayed in Ga. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>In June of 04 we started talking, and our relationship ended. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>There was far too many things in our way for us to have a good relationship. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>One was her being more than 35 years older than me. I wanted children, and she simply couldn't have anymore. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Another was our families. Neither of her daughters liked it. They considered me to be a gold digger, even after I explained I could care less about money the such many a time. They seemed to think I wanted to be put as the sole benifit thingie if she died. Which I didn't. I constantly said not to ever put my name on anything like that. Most of my family didn't care, as such relationships weren't unheard of in our family. My one sister was a real bitch about it though. She told each of us lies, called Jane a cradle robber, etc. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Something else was where we wanted to live. She wanted to be up north with her family, I wanted to be down south with mine.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>After all that, and a few other things, we just decided to end the relationship. We both still love one another, care for each other, talk on a daily basis, but our relationship is over. </DIV></DIV>

				<DIV><FONT size=2>My wife got me into the game. I was very sceptical of the whole online thing, never having had much fun playing other games on the internet.&nbsp; While I still may gripe about SOME players, by wife and I have found it to be a great way to do something together every night while I am away. I have spent the last year working out of state and living in a hotel room, so for 4 nights a week there is an opportunity for us to interact, albeitly through our toons.

				<DIV>Well, where to begin.&nbsp; I have had several rather interesting encounter with romance outside of Everquest from meeting fellow gamers.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>My first time I decided to go on a date with this rogue gal, she was quite courteous and insisted that we went to several very public areas while she paid the way. We visited several expensive restarants, drank several bottles of wine and generally had a great time.&nbsp; I was kinda curious where she got what seemed like 20 wallets or so especially since she was not carrying a purse and she had about 30 credit cards.&nbsp; Well, later on that night we ended up going back to my place, one thing led to another and we made our way to my bedroom, she could do some unbelievable things with her hands, but eventually I fell asleep with her in my arms, quite romantic. When I woke up my T.V. and she was gone. If she ever comes back I just might throw in a DVD player as well.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>My next dating exprience from in game was with this cleric gal. She also was quite courteous and generally we spent alot of time together. She always insisted on displays of affection where she would constantly massage me, whether I wanted it or not. Every time I insisted on doing something for her she would get quite upset, so I let it be. She was kinda prudish, so one night I got her to eventually let some of her inhibitions go as she agreed to go with me to this awesome druids grove party at midnight. She was kinda edgy seeing all the nude dancing and stuff but, eventually I managed to get her to sip on some elderberry wine to relax her. About an hour later her clothes were off and she was screaming at the top of her lungs and making out with half of my coven!&nbsp; When she came to the next afternoon she was wondering what the heck happened last night and why was she walking so funny and why was she sore from head to toe.&nbsp; She never called back.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>My next dating exprience was with this ranger chick.&nbsp; She was quite a handful. She was really passionate about lots of things&nbsp;and she liked to hang out by her lonesome alot.&nbsp; She was very aggressive when it came to love making and such and was once saucy little minx. Eventually she stopped coming by, but a year later I received a letter requesting child support. She had been living out in the woods away from everywhere and anything raising a child by herself so, I decided I would do the right thing so I went to visit her. She was in this village filled with wild women, wearing lots of fur bikinis. I think they did not care for men to much as pretty much as soon as I got there they were chasing me flinging spears and firing arrows at me. I barely escaped with my life.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Yet another dating exprience was with this bard chick. She wanted to go be a singer for American Idol. One night she got up and was doing some Karoke.&nbsp; The next thing I remember was a piercing shriek and the neighborhood dogs were howling in pain. I had a sudden urge to put down a horse. Sweet gal, couldn't sing or play an instrument to save her life, last I heard she got in trouble for lip syncing on Saturday Night Live and got booed off the stage from the Orange Bowl.</DIV>

				<DIV>My next exprience I decided to meet with this enchanter "lady". We had several nights of talking dirty late in the night while playing Everquest. So, we met and to my horror, she was a he. I never talked to him again the sicko.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>So after awhile of chatting with this necro lady, we decided to meet in person.&nbsp; I do not remember much after that as I awoke in a hole in the ground in the basement of some house being hosed down with a water hose. Apparently, this lady was a man as well. He lowered down a basket with lotion and instisted, " it puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again." After being tormented like this for a week or so the cops finally burst in busting the guy for kiddie porn, and rescuing me in the process. I swore I would never meet another person again after that.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>But, then I never was very good at keeping to my guns on stuff like that so I met up with this shaman lady. She was fun and carefree, about the only problem was she had allittle bit of junk in the trunk, after some exercise and less sweets she was definately top shelf.&nbsp; With her new found hotness there was a whole new world to explore so, we parted ways but still remain friends.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>My next date with an Everquest gal, was with this Warrior lady.&nbsp; Well, she kind of screamed and shouted at everything was really aggressive.&nbsp; Very athletic and strong. I gave her a try for a bit hoping she would chill out some. It was constant&nbsp; the oh no she did not just did not wear that shirt with that skirt and shoes, like she was better than everyone else. Eventually I tired of her outlook on life and went my seperate way, but, she came up to my doorstep crying in a bikini begging me to take her back saying she could not do anything alone. So, I slammed the door on her face.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>After a long break from dating in game ladies, I eventually met up with this monk gal. She&nbsp;had quite a package on her and she wore loose clothing that kinda hinted at what she had but never really revealed anything.&nbsp; She had a sparkling personality was quite fun and entertaining to be around. And the lovemaking, can you say tantra, I think you can, quite amazing.&nbsp; Then one day out it came she wanted to do everything, and leave nothing for anyone else to do. She wanted to be the star of everything, and everyone else could burn to death as far as she was concerned.&nbsp; So after what I thought could have been the one I had to let her go.</DIV>

				<DIV>Yet, my next dating exprience was with this Paladin lady. She was quite elegant and extrordinary. Quite terrific to be around, kept you honest.&nbsp; But after while she set out to destroy all my bad habits.&nbsp; I could no longer do anything remotely fun like hang out with the boys in the druids grove. She called it hedonistic debauchery, the nude dancing and multiple partner free love thing. She said something about the beauty of monogamy or some such drivel.&nbsp; She was very articulate so some of what she said was just ridiculous to me.&nbsp; Very righteous high and mighty type of girl.&nbsp; Eventually, as she stripped me of my civil liberties by threatening marriage and other such activities, I had to go.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>So, I left her for this shadow knight gal. I must say there is something about an evil lady that is extremely sensual.&nbsp; She was always pretty straight forward about stuff, even to the point of rudeness.&nbsp; We had many wild nights on the town, getting evicted from place to place.&nbsp; She loved the druids grove the wild parties us druids throw every full moon and such.&nbsp; But eventually, and ultimately the paladin lady had changed me and I just did not fit what this lady wanted from me, which was fun and excitement, police officers at our door and such every night, so she dumped me.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Well, after having my heart broken, I took up with this druid girl. She was quite outdoorsey, really meek and mousy. She was kinda skittish, but I liked her. She was really quiet but smart and witty, really nice attractive personality.&nbsp; Well, our first night we were going to get down, it turned out all that was a charade, she was quite the freak tying up and abusing me all night long, not going into to much detail except, my baby bottom hurt so bad I could not sit down. I could expect stuff like that from the girl I previously been with but this was weird.&nbsp; Eventually, I had to leave.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>On yet another, misadventure I went out a few times with this wizard girl. She was really smart but absent minded constantly changing the subjects while we were talking. Eventually as we heated up to each other, she kept forgetting things like going to T.G.I Fridays to hang out eat and socialize with friends and stuff. I had the last straw with her when we were in the movies she had to use the bathroom and ended up taking my car to an ice cream place, I had to walk home that night because she forgot about me.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>And my last misadventure with an Everquest gal was with a mage. She was ok other than the whole domination thing treating me like her slave, but other than that she was aight. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Well, I hope you everyone learned allitle something about some of the weird quirky Everquest player romances as often the classes they choose to play often fit their personality.</DIV>

				<DIV>Offtopic perhaps... but I met my wife online in 1997 on mIRC, we moved in with eachother in 1998 - she moved to me in The Netherlands in 1998, we got married in 1999, I started playing EQ in 2000, stopped playing in 2001. Moved to the United States in 2002 (she is American, I am Dutch), I played EQ for only a few months in early 2003, and then quit completely till Feb 2004. Its now January 2005, I have a lvl 60 chanter, and am still happily married.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>For the record, I value my real life a heck of a lot more then the game, thats why it took so long to get to 60 <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-wink.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0> - and possibly why I am still married and very happily so! <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0></DIV>

				<DIV>In July of 2000 I created an Everquest character Summerfawn so that I could be in the game and chat with friends. I had separated from my husband early in 1999 and had a lot of new time on my hands. In August while fighting with a Ranger named Simone, she invited a little blue dwarf warrior named Oskar. After the first night of fighting together we ended up sitting on the Kelethin platforms talking until 4:00a.m. the next morning. We continued to fight together, getting to know each other and having fun on the game. I knew soon after playing with him that I was feeling more than just friendship but at the time was very negative toward men and relationships in general. I did not want to tell him I was in love with him so I told another player who in the end told him. He loved me too, that was the good part. In December of that year he travelled from Kansas City, Missouri to Florida to meet me in person. We went to Disney World for a week and just got to know each other, then I took him to meet my then teenage son and all the friends he had been talking to in game that were my real life friends. Our characters married in the game on January 6, 2001. Oskar proposed on the shore of Lake Rathetear. We dated for three years travelling back and forth from Missouri and Florida or meeting in different places. On January 6, 2004, we married in real life. The same day our characters married in the game. We had an Everquest wedding dressing in costumes that looked like our characters and having our ceremony at the Excalibur Hotel in Las Vegas which is a medavial castle. Recently, we celebrated our one year anniversary. We still play Everquest, having 12 accounts between the two of us. We love the game and love each other very much. You can look at the wedding pictures if you like by going to our guild page at www.heartsofesprit.com/wedding/</DIV>

				<DIV>Well, I didn't meet my fiance through EverQuest, but through a mutual friend.&nbsp; Little bit of a rub, I live in Kansas, and I met him while he was visiting this mutual friend while over on a holiday from the UK!&nbsp; Anyway, we hit it off right off, and I decided to get an EQ account to keep up with him better.&nbsp; We'd chat every day through EQ (not to mention the phone calls, lots of international trips, etc.)&nbsp; Over a year later, I'm now a 56 paladin, and getting married to my 56 Enchanter in April!&nbsp; ;-)&nbsp; </DIV>

				<DIV>I play on Solusek Ro and I met my boyfriend in real life almost a year and a half ago.&nbsp; I started playing eq&nbsp; about a year ago.&nbsp; It all started after I went home from his house one night.&nbsp; My little brother had just got an eq account and I was upset that whenever I was over at my bf's house he paid more attention to eq than he did to me.&nbsp; So at first I made a mage and played it for a little while, then decided I wanted something that could cast sow and the sooner they got it the better, so I made a shaman.&nbsp; I was a total noob.&nbsp; I didn't research classes or anything lol.&nbsp; I just wanted to run faster.&nbsp; Anyway, I started playing my shaman with my bf and at that point I couldn't group with him because his rogue was too high for my shaman.&nbsp; Eventually I caught up.&nbsp; My shaman is now 65 and his rogue is 66.&nbsp; We are still together and I think if I hadn't started playing, we probably would have broken up, but I think eq strengthened our relationship.</DIV>

				I began EQ in July of 2000 with my RL hubby.  We only had one account so we had to play without each other.  We got most of our friends to play also.  Within a few months we split up as he moved in with my best friend. He took the account and I quit playing.  I picked EQ back up two years later in early April 2002 but couldnt play much as I worked constantly.  In 2003 I broke my leg and hand on vacation I had little I could do around my house so I started playing again.  Once I was able to go back to work EQ was put on the back burner.  In Oct 2004 I started playing EQ again.  All the friends i had made had moved on and I was soloing and really bored.  I was more than ready to put EQ on the back burner again when one of my old buddies Logged in.  He was now divorced and happy to be back.  We talked the first morning he was in game for a few hours and grouped up.  After that however we didnt talk much.  I decided to make a toon something like my first one and asked if I got her to his level could we group.  So I started on a quest to get my girl to his level.  <br>   I leveled to ten in a matter of hours and headed to CB.  I was soloing her good with a few buffs.  One of the Orcs laid into me pretty well and I hardly made it out alive.  On the other side in GFay was this high elf.  He healed me and buffed me.  He told me to zone thru and he would help level me.  I got a level and logged for the night.  The next evening I hunted for him and couldnt find him so I added him to my friends list and set off to get levels.  Once I got 14 my friend from the past and I grouped up for an evening, he had leveled up a few levels so he was ahead of me but it was fine.  Over the next few days I had no contact with either of them until one day in PC I see my cleric friend is there also.  I send him a tell and we talk for a few minutes and he invites my 16 rog to group with him outside PC as he was 25.  So we head to MS and he helps level me with his SK friend.  Out of the blue he tells me his name, age, marital status, and where hes from.  I was shocked but glad he did.  I returned his tell with my stats.  Since that day we have played the game together and talked almost nightly.  Our Toons are to be wed this weekend Feb 13!! and I am heading to AK to meet him in person later this month.

<DIV><FONT color=#ffffff>I have to totally agree with the first reply in this forum.&nbsp; "Chanters will break yer heart like no ones business."&nbsp; </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#ffffff></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#ffffff>I never thought that I would meet someone online, much less in a MMORPG.&nbsp; But it happenned.&nbsp; I met her one night at a randomly gathered Butcherblock LDoN.&nbsp; We ended up doing quite a few that night, we talked throughout most of them and I told her that I would not let harm come to her...even if I had to sacrifice my ranger so she could gate.&nbsp; This ended up happening more than a few times as LDoN was fairly new and we weren't the best at these adventures.&nbsp; We ended up grouping together consistently and talking well into the night after the fighting was over.&nbsp; Turns out that she was living with her bf who played a necro on our server, but she was very unhappy with the way he ignored her.&nbsp; We grouped and talked for about 20 more levels and then we started talking to each other on the phone from time to time.&nbsp; By this time we had a really good bond and we felt a deep connection ( I thought).&nbsp; She seemed like minded so we finally shared pictures of ourselves...and she turned out to be gorgeous.&nbsp; She seemed to be just as interested in me and we continued to talk.&nbsp; Things were here and there for the next few months, mainly because I had work moving that I had to do and then get set back up on EQ.&nbsp; I was supposed to meet her on vacation in about a month and I was really looking forward to it.&nbsp; I even overextended myself financially to make the trip.&nbsp;&nbsp;A week before the trip she tells me that her bf has really started acting nicely towards her and that their relationship was turning around.&nbsp; I couldn't bring myself to go see her...I thought that I had felt something for her....as strange as it would seem.</FONT></DIV>

				<DIV>EQ Romace?&nbsp; How revolting!&nbsp; LOL j/k</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I've met some women on here who've become really close friends of mine, but none I'd date.&nbsp; I find it hard to trust very many ppl I talk to onilne lol.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Probably the closest I got to it was when I was grouped with a Warrior on Bertox.&nbsp; She had just got done helping me kill Maligar.&nbsp; We were having some problems within the guild and we were both pretty mad since we were officers.&nbsp; She logs on her Druid and we group again.&nbsp; She ports us to Grimling Forest and we sit down and just have a long conversation starting with problems in the guild.&nbsp; Then it goes to RL stuff like problems we're having with our significant others or whatnot.&nbsp; Was kinda cool...I never really connected with someone in game like that.&nbsp; But like I said before, we're just satisfied with being good friends since we both have someone we're seeing RL.</DIV>

<DIV><FONT face=Verdana>I started playing in mid 2000 with my then boyfriend, and he was always deciding "when, where, what" to play in game and would get upset if I logged on to get exp. without him.&nbsp; So, still being relatively new to the game and wanting to explore more, I began a new character, a shaman.&nbsp; She rapidly became my main, as I realized I utterly and truly loved the class. It wasn't long before the boyfriend sucked me into his small&nbsp;guild where I made several new friends.&nbsp; As I leveled up and researched more, I was very hopeful that I would&nbsp;to be able to do my epic quest.&nbsp; I tried to recruit the help of some guildmates but everyone was busy and uninterested so I decided to go it alone (being always a very solitary player).&nbsp; Now, back before maps&nbsp;I was <STRONG>constantly </STRONG>(geographical dysfunction is my specialty)&nbsp;getting lost, and when it got to the part where I had to go to Rathe Mountains, I had no idea how to get there, so late one night I asked a fellow guildmate that I did not know well for directions, a ranger about 20 levels higher than myself.&nbsp; </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Verdana></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Verdana>Said ranger and I kept talking and became friends, really seeming to connect.&nbsp; Shortly thereafter, the guild had some problems and&nbsp;fell apart, and I was sorely disallusioned with the leader, who was also good friends with the ranger.&nbsp; After I left guild, the ranger and I&nbsp;had a miscommunication -- I thought he was angry with my comments to the guild leader and so I sadly gave up and stopped talking to him.&nbsp; In reality, due to RL situations, he was offline a lot and didn't get time to explain.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Verdana></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Verdana>Many months later, I bumped into him running around with some mutual friends, and he had changed guilds.&nbsp; We chatted a bit and cleared up the miscommunication and I always had a warm and happy feeling while chatting with him.&nbsp; He had a habit of sneaking up behind me in random zones and&nbsp;"ninja hugging" and running off. &nbsp;At the same time, my relationship came apart at the seams and ended.&nbsp; </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Verdana></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Verdana>One night he bumped into me and said he "was about to go get eaten by a dragon" (hehe) and&nbsp;we kept chatting....and I made a naughty statement, and the conversation rapidly took a turn for the&nbsp;personal.&nbsp; A few nights later,&nbsp;as we were continuing to get to know each other, we moved the conversation to the phone.&nbsp; Over the next 2-3 weeks, there were very few nights where we&nbsp;couldn't be found on the phone talking the night away and coming to realize that we both were completely and endlessly in love with one another.&nbsp; He made me laugh and every moment spent talking to him were the happiest of my life.&nbsp; A few weeks later he mailed me&nbsp;his air force&nbsp;ring&nbsp;as a token of his&nbsp;love.&nbsp; Almost exactly 4 months after we professed our love to one&nbsp;another, he moved to where I was living at the time.&nbsp;&nbsp; We had never met in person before he moved but literally spent over 13,000 minutes each month talking to each other before he got here.&nbsp; The phone company was&nbsp;glad when he moved.&nbsp; We spent every spare moment together as I finished college and graduated, and 3&nbsp;months later we got married&nbsp;in Vegas.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Verdana></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Verdana>He&nbsp;is&nbsp;the light of my life and we are&nbsp;looking forward to celebrating our 2nd wedding anniversary in a couple months.&nbsp; We love each other more each day, and our characters still play together to this day.&nbsp;Truth is stranger than fiction, and when I found my soulmate,&nbsp;it was&nbsp;just <STRONG>right</STRONG>, and everything&nbsp;fell into place. </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Verdana></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Verdana>I never would have thought to look for love in EQ but it found me in the form of some excellent directions to Rathe Mountains.</FONT></DIV><BR><A href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1095662&amp;resize=true" target=_blank><B>Ladikennoch Mactiretreibh</FONT></B></A><BR>Barbarian Prophet and Mistress of Alchemy Quellious Server<BR><FONT color=#800080><B>"....be nice to me and I'll take off this chain armor and show you my frosty nips!"</FONT></B><BR><A href="http://thenoob.keenspace.com/d/20050207.html" target=_blank>"With all due respect, but you, sir, are a twatwaffle!"</A>
