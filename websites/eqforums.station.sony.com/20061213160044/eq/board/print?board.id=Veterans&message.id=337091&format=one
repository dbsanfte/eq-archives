				First and foremost thanks a bunch for the post Merloc-Dev.<br><br>Second, I hope you'll reconsider the time it takes to cap.&nbsp; I think it would be way more useful if it capped at 1 hour maybe 1.5 hours, even it started lower than 25%.&nbsp;&nbsp; I do my best not to get eaten while raiding, but as a fact it happens alot.&nbsp; Knowing that unless I am farming gear out of a trivial zone like DK is most likely the only reliable times I'll see it capped makes me very sad I took the hit and looted it over keeping my Echo charm.&nbsp; Im not saying its horrible but I do think its a bit much at 2-3 hours.<br><br>Thanks for the post again, and getting it to work! I do hope you'll consider changing it again.<br><div></div>
