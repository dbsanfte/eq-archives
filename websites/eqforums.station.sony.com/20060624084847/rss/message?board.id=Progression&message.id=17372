    <title>My only concern</title>
    <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Progression&amp;message.id=17372</link>
    <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I got this from the Un-offical FAQ thread up above and here is the link to exactly what I am refering to, second paragraph under Q: What is the progession server?&amp;nbsp; &lt;A href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Progression&amp;amp;message.id=12113" target=_blank&gt;http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Progression&amp;amp;message.id=12113&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;My concern is this, if Nagafen and Vox are the unlocking mobs for Kunark to open up.&amp;nbsp; Once Nagafen and Vox are dead and quite possibly by a single guild I think there will be a mad rush for 60 for Kunark.&amp;nbsp; Because I would imagine that the level restraint for Vox and Nagafen will still be enabled at 52 and once again leaving people without the joy of farming Fire Giants,&amp;nbsp;the joys of falling in the pits headed for Vox etc. &amp;nbsp; Thus leaving Nagafen and Vox killed once maybe twice.&amp;nbsp; I think Cazic, Inno, and quite possibly last island in Plane of Sky should be the unlock point.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I hear some people talking about hard coded time restraints, this would be nice, but haven't really seen anything offical yet.&amp;nbsp; One other possible idea over time restraint is this mob has to be killed x number of times etc. before any unlocking can be done.&amp;nbsp; *shrug*&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;The problem with that though is I think 99% of the people are going to have Kunark enabled on their accounts and after Naggy and Vox are killed for the first time they are automatically going to start gaining exp towards 60 because&amp;nbsp;kunark will be enabled from that point on&amp;nbsp;and will most likely get 52+ before their guild can attempt Naggy or Vox.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Thats why I think Cazic, Inny, last island in sky should be the unlock point for Kunark, I mean they went all live before Kunark became avail. anyway.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;@Nolrog &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;IF you guys would wouldn't have taken away my old Nro and Oasis so I COULD kill in the orc highway, I would have seriously considered enjoying the old world at a leisurely pace. But nooooooo you guys had to eff it up. (Take this as a light hearted post btw. I understand every game has to progress or it gets stale =)&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Apparantly they are going to put in some sort of time restraint on how fast people can unlock things. Even still, Naggy and Vox loot will once again be considered uber on this server so I would venture to say that they will be attempted many more times than you mention... I would also venture to say that PoH and PoF (I can't remember if PoS was pre-kunark or post-kunark, but perhaps even that too) will have something to do with unlocking kunark. Plus they might even make people clear the hole (again, not sure), which would make since. There's alot of really tough things to do in classic EQ and I don't think people remember how hard it is to try and kill/ clear some of these places and things with a level 50 cap. I mean it was allooootttt different. I know that some of the tutorial armor might change things, but I remember a time when bronze armor was still being worn by level 30+ people, and it was pretty expensive considering people just didn't have that much money. Also, you have to remember that while, yes there will be uber guilds, many other guilds will still WANT to do naggy and vox just because of the nostalgia factor, and it may take them much longer to reach the point to where they can.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;I'm not sure it's a time restraint, as much as it's a fail safe.&amp;nbsp; Maddoc expects that it will never be triggered.&amp;nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As for Naggy and Vox, well, even with Kunark opened up, they will provide significant upgrades for most (if not all) players.&amp;nbsp; I can see them being raided every time they are up.&amp;nbsp; At least for a while.&amp;nbsp; Also keep in mind, that not everyone is joining so they can race to 50 or 60 or whatever.&amp;nbsp; They want to enjoy the old content, get a Crushbone Throne Room group, or a blackburrow group, or just camp the orc highway like they did when they first started.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
