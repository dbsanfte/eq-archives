      <description>Take whatever &amp;quot;balanced single group&amp;quot; you can make up and make them level 70 with NO AA's.  What is the toughest mob they could take out in the current world?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I realize this is a perfectly subjective question that will get equally subjective answers, but what I'm trying to understand is how much of a difference AA's make.  You're a lot tougher at 70 with no AA's than you are at 51 with no AA's, obviously, but what can you take out as a full group at level 70 with no AA's?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Opinions only please, no facts. :P&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;P.S.:&lt;br&gt;A similar question would be, what is the toughest monster that has been taken out with a single group of characters in today's world?  What, in theory, COULD a single group take out?  At what level (given the current rate of power increases) could the toughest mob in the game today be taken out by a single group?&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

As for &amp;quot;raid&amp;quot; encounters one group could take out, Chailak in RSS, the Aneuks in Txevu, the Zoo event in Qvic, and the whole of Vex Thal are on the list.&lt;br&gt;I don't think the highest level encounters of today will ever be one groupable, they all require a little more than raw strength, and most of all, they require you to be enough in raid to trigger the instances.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;I would tend to agree with the S Wall - WoS being tops..  Cant see them doing MPG, and I doubt WoS would be a cakewalk either..  Probably more along the lines of Murkgliders in NC.  I 3box (all 70's) PAL CLR ENC at S Wall without problems... but Ive been around for awhile :)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>I used to single-group WoS with a pair of friends, one of which was 4-boxing (one of his characters was the cleric, the other the only tank).  The best we had was bazaar-bought gear and we xp'd there all night with no problem.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lets say no gear other than what they got gearing up in MMs.  I am sure that a group of level 70s with no gear&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warrior, Cleric, shaman, wizard, necro and monk could beat Lord Bob.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
