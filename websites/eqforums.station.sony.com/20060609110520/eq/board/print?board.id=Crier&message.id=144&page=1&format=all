<DIV>Well it's the end of day 3!&nbsp; Today was Community Summit day...&nbsp; I started off bright and early so I could check out of the Sahara and perma-movelog to the Hilton.</DIV>
<DIV>I was at Ballroom E a bit before 9 AM to get badges sorted before breakfast started at 9:30...</DIV>
<DIV>We get everyone checked in and now it's breakfast time.&nbsp; There are several tables of EQ and EQ2 summit attendees.&nbsp; Members of both development teams are scattered among the tables and small light hearted discussions have already begun.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Here is a picture of the room we were in.<BR></DIV>
<DIV><IMG src="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/forum_images/community/LVFanFaire2005/Breakfast_Summit.jpg"></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Breakfast ends at 10:30, they break the EQ folks into 2 groups Melees are in group A and spell casters are in group B.&nbsp; I tag along with group B, our first session is titled "Live Discussion," the designers sitting in are Absor, Maddoc, Prathun, Keridon, and Oshran.&nbsp; We have 2 programmers Nome, and Rapaz.&nbsp; Zorillius is leading the discussion, the topics range from the New Tutorial, cheaters and hackers, Veteran Rewards, Customer Service and various other topics...</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Here are a few pictures of this particular panel.&nbsp; I will get into what we actually discussed in depth on Monday.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>It's now noon and time for Session 2.&nbsp; For Group B the title of this session is "Class Discussion."&nbsp; Again I am not going to go into detail on what we discussed but the hot topics were DPS, Pets, NPC resists, utility, Manaburn, and Druid stances...&nbsp; This time our group had Vahlar, Rytan, Prathun, Gordish, from the design team.&nbsp; Tanker and Grumbuk were our programmers, and Lead Designer Rashere led us in the discussion.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>

<DIV>Rapaz was the moderator for this last round...</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>

<DIV>So we are back at SOE offices today and I still don't feel like myself.&nbsp; I think I could use another few days of not doing anything <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-wink.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>As you can see after Friday morning I didn't get time to do much on the forums...&nbsp; So I am going to start at Thursday evening after the Summit and tell you all about my crazy adventure...</DIV>
<DIV>After the Summit was over I ran over to the Baron room...&nbsp; This was a Grand Banquet room.&nbsp; Here is a picture of Brenlo, Blackguard (he has my job but on EQ2), and Smed!&nbsp; This was taken before the masses came in.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><IMG src="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/forum_images/community/LVFanFaire2005/Brenlo_Blackguard_Smed.jpg"></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Someone shouted that they were opening the doors, so I rushed to the doors and snapped some photos of the horde rushing in...</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><IMG src="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/forum_images/community/LVFanFaire2005/Horde1.jpg"></DIV>
<DIV><BR>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><IMG src="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/forum_images/community/LVFanFaire2005/Horde2.jpg"></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>While standing at the door I ran into the Guardians of the Throne bunch, here they are coming through the door.<BR></DIV>
<DIV><IMG src="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/forum_images/community/LVFanFaire2005/GOTT.jpg"></DIV>
<DIV><BR>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Then it was time for opening announcements.&nbsp; Brenlo our MC for the event welcomed everyone.&nbsp; He riled up the EQ players, the EQ2 players, the EQOA players and the PlanetSide players.&nbsp; Then we all had cheering matches...&nbsp; I don't know who won but it was sure fun...&nbsp; I am still jealous that Brenlo did all of that yelling and talking and didn't lose his voice!&nbsp; Blast him...</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><IMG src="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/forum_images/community/LVFanFaire2005/Brenlo_Welcome.jpg"></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Now to my favorite part of the evening karaoke!!!&nbsp; I did get up and sing Shania Twain's "Man I feel like a Woman," but I think the most memorable event was when Smed got up on stage and sang "Welcome to the Jungle."</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><IMG src="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/forum_images/community/LVFanFaire2005/Smed_karaoke.jpg"></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>There were a few people that got up and sang their own lyrics which made us all laugh...&nbsp; We also got up and danced during the evening...</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>This is Kytherea doing the Chair Dance...</DIV>
<DIV><IMG src="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/forum_images/community/LVFanFaire2005/Ky_chair_dance.jpg"></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>After karaoke a bunch of us headed to Quark's where I shared a "Borg Sphere," I think I mentioned in another thread that I was quoted as saying <EM>"I can't walk very well, and I can't feel my face."</EM></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Brenlo and I made our way to the Paradise Cafe to eat something real quick then we parted ways to get some much needed sleep...</DIV>

<DIV>Friday was a busy day for me... At the end of it I was wishing for an order of sleep and a pair of new legs...</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The day started off with the Best of the Best Tournament.&nbsp; Brenlo played the announcer all day.&nbsp; He did play by plays, heckled the contestants and the crowd.&nbsp; This started at about 10 AM and went on until just before 5 PM...&nbsp; And again he didn't lose his voice!</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>

<DIV><IMG src="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/forum_images/community/LVFanFaire2005/BOTB_Spectators.jpg"></DIV>
<DIV><BR>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>After stopping by the Best of the Best, I ran over to the Dev Brunch...&nbsp; I didn't get to hang out and listen but I did take a few fly by pictures.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><IMG src="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/forum_images/community/LVFanFaire2005/Dev_brunch_Zorillus.jpg"></DIV>
<DIV><EM><FONT size=1>That’s Zorillus in the blue shirt, seated next to him in red is Rapaz and that's Gordish on his other side.</FONT></EM></DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>After the Dev Brunch I ran over to help Kytherea with the EverQuest 2 Live Quest.&nbsp; I snapped a bunch of pictures of that but since it's EQ2 I won't bore you with them.&nbsp; I did give them to Blackguard to post so if you are interested you might be able to find them over there...</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Halfway through the Live Quest I was asked to help out with the Best of the Best so I jumped in and prepared computers for the folks that were setting up.&nbsp; Here are some folks setting up...</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><IMG src="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/forum_images/community/LVFanFaire2005/BOTB_Set_Up.jpg"></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Look it's Grunts, our Ranger correspondent.&nbsp; I think this was right after he participated in the tournament.<BR></DIV>
<DIV><IMG src="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/forum_images/community/LVFanFaire2005/Grunts_BOTB.jpg"></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>During the tournament quite a few of the participants played Shadowknights and rogues and hid until the end of the fight.&nbsp; These 2 gentlemen gave us, what I think was the best fight of the day...</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><IMG src="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/forum_images/community/LVFanFaire2005/Best_Fight.jpg"></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>There were panels through out the day and sadly I only had time to sit in on the "EQ and EQII Community Discussion."&nbsp; We discussed the boards and we briefly touched on the Top 10 Issues lists...&nbsp; We talked about class re-envisionement, and Ky and I are going to look into taking the list found <A href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=64032" target=_blank>here</A>, and marking what's been done and in some cases the status of what is being worked on.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>After the panels were over I headed over to the Phat Loot store.&nbsp; I worked behind the counter before it was time to head to the Banquet.&nbsp; Before I headed over there I ran across Firiona Vie…<BR></DIV>
<DIV><IMG src="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/forum_images/community/LVFanFaire2005/Firiona.jpg"></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>NOW it was time for the Banquet!!&nbsp; We all ate some delicious food and Brenlo gave out some great prizes.&nbsp; Brenlo had random contests through out the evening like "Who has a New York Driver's License," and other various US driver's licenses...&nbsp; Or who traveled the furthest...&nbsp; A group of people lined up on the stage and told us where they were from.&nbsp; We had someone from the Netherlands, someone from Australia, and the winner was from China!!&nbsp; Brenlo gave prizes away to the best impersonations of Antonia Bayle and Lucan D'Lere as well.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>After a ton of fun on stage it was time for the Costume contest...&nbsp; Here are some pictures of that...</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><IMG src="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/forum_images/community/LVFanFaire2005/Costume_Contest.jpg"></DIV>
<DIV><BR>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><IMG src="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/forum_images/community/LVFanFaire2005/Costume_Contest2.jpg"></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>A panel of SOE employees acted as judges.&nbsp; They couldn't decide on just one, so they picked 4.&nbsp; Here are the winners...</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><IMG src="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/forum_images/community/LVFanFaire2005/Contest_winners.jpg"></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Once the contest was over most people headed off in their own groups to hang out...&nbsp; There must have been a ton that went to Quark's because when our group arrived it was standing room only.&nbsp; We grabbed some tables and talked and laughed and had a good time.&nbsp; I waved good night to everyone and went to bed early...</DIV>

<DIV>I was able to get a much later start on Saturday.&nbsp; I even got to have breakfast.&nbsp; The Hilton has the best buffet!&nbsp; My plate was piled high with shrimp cocktail, eggs, bacon, and a banana...&nbsp; I know I am strange <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-wink.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>There were tons of people who had the same idea...</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><IMG src="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/forum_images/community/LVFanFaire2005/Sat_Breakfast.jpg"></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>After Breakfast we all headed over to the Bazaar. The EverQuest 2 Mob Madness was going on, as was another Dev. Brunch.&nbsp; I headed out to wait for the NPCs that were participating in the EQ Live Quest.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I took lots of pictures for the Live Quest but Kytherea is going to tell you all about it and post the pictures...</DIV>
<DIV><BR>After the Live Quest, I took some time to go watch the Depths of Darkhollow Sneak peak... And my first thought was WOW!&nbsp; I didn't take any pictures because it was on a projector and I didn't think the pictures would come out very well.&nbsp; But I will tell you that I saw some neat pieces of concept art, we saw new werewolves, new orcs, a dracnid, an adorable looking mushroom, there were others as well...&nbsp; Then they showed us a video that had Nektulos Forest revamped.&nbsp; It looked AWESOME, the new graphics are amazing.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>After the video was over EverQuest Producer Craig Knapp got up and welcomed us, he made is very clear that the EQLive team will continue to be innovative.&nbsp; He then asked Rashere to stand up.&nbsp; Rashere told us about the new features, which I am sure you've already read about in the various other Fan Faire write ups&nbsp;that are out there on some of the Fan Sites...&nbsp; But I am totally excited about being about to be an NPC, this works in a Dragons of Norrath style mission. You will be able to experience the Lore through the NPC's eyes.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>There will also be Spirit Shrouds in the world that gives you the ability to transfer your soul into a creature up to your own level.&nbsp; This will allow you to aid your lower level friends.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Other features include evolving items, new Alternate Advancement abilities, as well as new spells.&nbsp; As I mentioned earlier Nektulos Forest will receive a revamp.&nbsp; We were told to pay close attention to Nektulos Forest through out the summer.&nbsp; This expansion is number 10 for EQ and will launch September 13, 2005.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>After the sneak peak I went to work behind the counter at the store before the Saturday version of the "EQ and EQII Community Discussion."&nbsp; The Live auction had ended while I was in the sneak peak so the winners were coming to collect their banners.&nbsp; It was pure chaos!!!!!&nbsp; Kytherea and I ended up being a half an hour late for our panel... Boy was Brenlo scowling at us <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-tongue.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>This time around the panel was much smaller.&nbsp; We discussed the top 10 issues lists again.&nbsp; We talked about the Community Team's relationships with the developers.&nbsp; Station exchange was brought up and Brenlo let everyone know that there aren't any plans at this time to bring this service to EQ.&nbsp; We also discussed Brenlo's world and he promised to have a new edition up soon.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>After the panel I worked behind the counter at the store some more.&nbsp; Then it was time to eat a quick dinner and head to the beach.&nbsp; Our group decided to walk over.&nbsp; The beach was open to just Fan Faire attendees from 9 PM to 12 AM exclusively.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>A bit after midnight I stumbled back to the Hilton and slept...</DIV>
<DIV><BR>--<BR>Sunday<BR>There weren't any events Sunday morning so I don't have any pictures, but we did have to break down the store.&nbsp; That took us a few hours and then a bunch of us headed to the Strip.&nbsp; We went over to the Aladdin and had lunch at "Cheeseburger Oasis," the food was alright but the company was fun.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Everyone tagged along with me while I went into the "Build-a-Bear Workshop," to make a bear for my daughter.&nbsp; It was then time to hit the road...</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>This Fan Faire was awesome.&nbsp; I don't think I've ever had so much fun.&nbsp; A big thanks goes out to Jen and Lauren, they organized the event.&nbsp; A special thanks to Brenlo for being a fantastic MC, he kept the crowd thoroughly entertained all weekend long.&nbsp; The biggest thanks goes out to all of YOU!!!&nbsp; You folks make Fan Faire what it truly is, a Community gathering!&nbsp; </DIV>

<P>I am not as prolific as Ashlanne is (I keep telling her she is full of hot air) so be warned. Just about everything Ashlanne reported coincides with my experiences so I will focus on the Live Quests. </P>
<P>The EQ Live Quest story... </P>
<P>Xanise Furrytoes was planning a surprise birthday party for her brother, Dynon Furrytoes. Because she was trying to keep it as a surprise she needed help placing orders with the merchants around town so that Dynon didn’t figure out what was going on. She had a list of 6 merchants she needed things from for the party. She asked the adventurers to go talk to each of them and return with each merchant’s signature on the party planning list. </P>
<P>Shion Irontummy asked each group to collect some ingredients she needed to make cake and ice cream as well as place an order with Pertabi Treebender for an ice cream churn. </P>
<P>Kelawe Irontummy, who was making the food for the party, also needed some ingredients picked up so she would to be able to make the food. Because she wanted a new party dress, she asked the adventurers to place an order with Kalryyn Goldenneedle for a dress while they were out and about. </P>
<P>Olderi Irontummy had the pleasure of brewing up fine drinks for the party, and much like her sisters, needed some ingredients collected to be able to do so. She was also in charge of obtaining transportation to the party for her sisters and herself so she asked the adventurers to speak to Miale Travelquick. </P>
<P>Gnomish Fireworks were the plan for party favors and these were to be ordered from Thersden Sparkleshot. Thersden, who was taking a class in History &amp; Lore needed some help with a homework assignment so she would have time to create the party favors. </P>
<P>Of course all good parties also need good entertainment which was to be provided by Miskey Silvertongue. Unfortunately Miskey was troubled by writer's block and needed assistance writing a song for the party and then asked each group to perform their masterpiece for him so he could "See" the song. </P>
<P>Xanise, trying to make this a memorable day for her brother, wanted to give him a unique sculpture as a gift and so she sent the adventurers to Cheque Amberhaze, a well known and much recommended artist. Unbeknownst to her though, Cheque was a fraud who offered to buy a sculpture from each group so he could continue living his lie. </P>
<P>Pertabi, who the ice cream churn was ordered from, agreed to make the churn in return for dancing lessons from the adventurers. </P>
<P>Kalryyn needed assistance with a puzzle in order to obtain some patterns from an acquaintance after a freak accident occurred in his shop (in a fit of anger one day he tore up all his patterns). The puzzle was given to him by the acquaintance who did not really want to help and though the puzzle would stump him. </P>
<P>Miale Travelquick had recently taken a blow to the head and could not recall the spell for teleportation. He had the spell in his spell book but could no longer read the magical script, so he asked the adventurers to help decipher the magical runes. </P>
<P>And then there was Ancer Arrowspring who was desperately in love with Xanise Furrytoes. Being shy he was not sure how to express his desire to Xanise that she attend the party as his date so he asked the adventurers to help him come up with way to ask threatening to tell Dynon about the party and ruin the surprise if they did not help him. To complete the quest, each group had to get signatures from the 6 party merchants who each had their own tasks they needed help with. </P>
<P>Each merchant was also willing to give "platinum" for good RP interaction. Ah yes the "platinum" I nearly forgot the Shady Swashbuckler who was nearby and urging the fine adventurers to wager their hard earned plat in a game of chance. He managed to make quite a killing in his endeavors to part the adventurers from their coin too! The winning group was determined by completion of the signature list as well as having the most platinum by the end of the quest. Each member of the winning group received a gift card for $100 to Best buy. </P>
