startling fact. This farmer stated that ever since he ran from the&#xD;

more than 5 pies a day.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p **SMURF**"margin-left: 20px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This&#xD;
of course greatly concerned this reporter and in the effort to find the&#xD;
root of the cause, I went to the greatest pie chef in the vale, Grandma&#xD;
Gubbin, for dinner and conversation. Dinner was scrumptious albeit&#xD;

sitting and enjoying a nice evening of star gazing we got down to brass&#xD;
pie tins. Grandma Gubbin was of the firm mind the pie shortage was&#xD;
entirely Mayor Diggs fault. Somehow the upstart from Underhill, had&#xD;
done something to the pie supply. She profusely apologized for only&#xD;
serving me 3 pies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mayor Diggs, responsible for the pie&#xD;
shortage??? How could this be? I again visited the displaced farmers to&#xD;
get their opinions. These down to the earth folks were so honest and&#xD;
full of song (and had a generous Jum-Jum supply). As we sat on the&#xD;
empty carts that once were so busy bringing goods from the farms&#xD;
discussing the pie shortage, these Halflings were of the firmest&#xD;
opinion that Mayor Diggs was totally at fault. Somehow he was hoarding&#xD;
the pies all to himself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now of course, once I was sober enough&#xD;
to walk, I went to Diggs Hill to see what was up. I walked right in and&#xD;
there was Diggs himself sitting eating a pie!!! Case closed, I thought.&#xD;
To be a fair reporter, I gave him opportunity to defend his conduct. He&#xD;
seemed mystified at this so called pie shortage and denied any part.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Being&#xD;
a hungry Halfling (of course there is no other type), I proceeded to&#xD;
steal Mayor Diggs pie and ran here to Bobble-By-Water to escape the&#xD;
deputies. I will suffer no pie shortage that's for sure!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;To follow up on the story, I arranged an interview with Mayor Diggs himself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://newsletters.station.sony.com/images/eqoa_frontiers/en/032706_digssinterview_lg.jpg" target="_blank" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)"&gt;&lt;img **SMURF**"float: left; margin-right: 10px;" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;When&#xD;

while also engaging in counter attacks. The Pickclaw have been taking&#xD;
citizens and travelers alike as prisoners. Why I wouldn't be surprised&#xD;
if Lord Pickclaw himself is responsible for the alleged missing pies.&#xD;

balancing has been in the works for some time now, and is heading to&#xD;
live servers soon! Here is a peek at some of the class balancing&#xD;
changes the EQOA team has been working on:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Everyone will be able&#xD;
to benefit from some of the stacking changes being made to buffs.&#xD;
Instead of picking which one buff is the most effective, you'll be able&#xD;
to use a variety of different types, including self-buffs, targeted&#xD;
buffs, group or area affect buffs, and buffs that include an illusion&#xD;
change. What this means is that you'll be more appreciative of folks of&#xD;
different specialties in your party, as you'll get different benefits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In&#xD;
the priest category, damage has been improved overall, druid abilities&#xD;
most significantly, clerics are now much more fearful to the undead,&#xD;
and level 60 epic shaman pets are a bit better at their offensive and&#xD;
defensive jobs. Clerics have their path heal recasts decreased, so they&#xD;
can heal more often, as well as recognize improvements to both master&#xD;
classes. Druids have had too many changes to list, but also have seen&#xD;
improvements to both their master classes and some CM cost reductions.&#xD;
Shamans have seen a few CM cost reductions as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our casters&#xD;
have had some significant changes as well. Wizards should notice that&#xD;
their damage is heavily modified by their dexterity stat, and their&#xD;
power should come flowing back to them much more quickly. Magicians and&#xD;
necromancers, with their care and attention, will find their pets&#xD;
improved (but not if left alone for long durations). Necromancers can&#xD;
now increase their healing power with training points into charisma,&#xD;
and can increase their damage by increasing their dexterity. Enchanters&#xD;
will notice that they have a whole lot more ways to give their party&#xD;
power (directly related to the stacking changes) as well as having&#xD;
their charming abilities improved. Alchemists will find that their&#xD;
potion making skills have improved to casting 3 potions at a time, and&#xD;
much, much more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tank classes overall will be receiving an&#xD;
upgrade to their strength modifier to taunt, smoothing out their buff&#xD;
lines and generally increasing the durations overall, and we're looking&#xD;
into each class to make sure they are effective at their jobs in the&#xD;
ways that their classes should be. Paladins will enjoy changes to heals&#xD;
to make them more useful while tanking, the undead proc line has been&#xD;
upgraded, as well as some other class defining abilities. Shadowknights&#xD;
should enjoy significant increases in most of their "tap" lines as well&#xD;
as improved damage by decreasing the resistance to some abilities.&#xD;
Warriors will enjoy a bit of increased damage in their special&#xD;
abilities, and many abilities scale more appropriately while you level&#xD;
up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Melee classes have been improved overall to allow their&#xD;
statistics to more significantly affect their damage output, and&#xD;
improving the class specific abilities that make them unique. Rogues&#xD;
can enjoy significant reduction to the recasts of many of their damage&#xD;
dealing abilities, as well as the revamp of some that don't make much&#xD;
sense (Assassinate, Caltrops, and more). Monks' bodies are more like&#xD;
the temples they should be, with increases in their healing&#xD;
capabilities, and increases in their ability to modify their stats with&#xD;
Class Mastery points (namely, hit points, AC, and power). Rangers&#xD;
should be able to make more use of their bows if they have chosen the&#xD;
bow path, and have seen improvements to both their offensive and&#xD;
defensive capabilities Bards will enjoy the stacking changes which will&#xD;
allow them to be an improved support class, and improvements have been&#xD;
made to many of their abilities, rewarding them with increased&#xD;
effectiveness with attention to their stats.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Again, these are just a few of the many changes we've been working on. For more details, please visit our forums!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;hr size="2" width="100%"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

while also engaging in counter attacks. The Pickclaw have been taking&#xD;
citizens and travelers alike as prisoners. Why I wouldn't be surprised&#xD;
if Lord Pickclaw himself is responsible for the alleged missing pies.&#xD;
Who is the source of this story? Where is this refugee?" &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nothing further to report on this incident at this time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;

balancing has been in the works for some time now, and is heading to&#xD;
live servers soon! Here is a peek at some of the class balancing&#xD;
changes the EQOA team has been working on:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Everyone will be able&#xD;
to benefit from some of the stacking changes being made to buffs.&#xD;
Instead of picking which one buff is the most effective, you'll be able&#xD;
to use a variety of different types, including self-buffs, targeted&#xD;
buffs, group or area affect buffs, and buffs that include an illusion&#xD;
change. What this means is that you'll be more appreciative of folks of&#xD;
different specialties in your party, as you'll get different benefits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In&#xD;
the priest category, damage has been improved overall, druid abilities&#xD;
most significantly, clerics are now much more fearful to the undead,&#xD;
and level 60 epic shaman pets are a bit better at their offensive and&#xD;
defensive jobs. Clerics have their path heal recasts decreased, so they&#xD;
can heal more often, as well as recognize improvements to both master&#xD;
classes. Druids have had too many changes to list, but also have seen&#xD;
improvements to both their master classes and some CM cost reductions.&#xD;
Shamans have seen a few CM cost reductions as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our casters&#xD;
have had some significant changes as well. Wizards should notice that&#xD;
their damage is heavily modified by their dexterity stat, and their&#xD;
power should come flowing back to them much more quickly. Magicians and&#xD;
necromancers, with their care and attention, will find their pets&#xD;
improved (but not if left alone for long durations). Necromancers can&#xD;
now increase their healing power with training points into charisma,&#xD;
and can increase their damage by increasing their dexterity. Enchanters&#xD;
will notice that they have a whole lot more ways to give their party&#xD;
power (directly related to the stacking changes) as well as having&#xD;
their charming abilities improved. Alchemists will find that their&#xD;
potion making skills have improved to casting 3 potions at a time, and&#xD;
much, much more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tank classes overall will be receiving an&#xD;
upgrade to their strength modifier to taunt, smoothing out their buff&#xD;
lines and generally increasing the durations overall, and we're looking&#xD;
into each class to make sure they are effective at their jobs in the&#xD;
ways that their classes should be. Paladins will enjoy changes to heals&#xD;
to make them more useful while tanking, the undead proc line has been&#xD;
upgraded, as well as some other class defining abilities. Shadowknights&#xD;
should enjoy significant increases in most of their "tap" lines as well&#xD;
as improved damage by decreasing the resistance to some abilities.&#xD;
Warriors will enjoy a bit of increased damage in their special&#xD;
abilities, and many abilities scale more appropriately while you level&#xD;
up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Melee classes have been improved overall to allow their&#xD;
statistics to more significantly affect their damage output, and&#xD;
improving the class specific abilities that make them unique. Rogues&#xD;
can enjoy significant reduction to the recasts of many of their damage&#xD;
dealing abilities, as well as the revamp of some that don't make much&#xD;
sense (Assassinate, Caltrops, and more). Monks' bodies are more like&#xD;
the temples they should be, with increases in their healing&#xD;
capabilities, and increases in their ability to modify their stats with&#xD;
Class Mastery points (namely, hit points, AC, and power). Rangers&#xD;
should be able to make more use of their bows if they have chosen the&#xD;
bow path, and have seen improvements to both their offensive and&#xD;
defensive capabilities Bards will enjoy the stacking changes which will&#xD;
allow them to be an improved support class, and improvements have been&#xD;
made to many of their abilities, rewarding them with increased&#xD;
effectiveness with attention to their stats.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Again, these are just a few of the many changes we've been working on. For more details, please visit our forums!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;hr size="2" width="100%"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
