<P><BR>&nbsp;</P>Actually, I think that turning in the books is a great idea providing that there are enough folks out there that want to play the pvp game.&nbsp; It would certainly show the Devs that there is enough interest to make a new server for it worthwhile and if there really is enlough players that want to PvP in combine then the red players will still have no problem finding grps with other red players.&nbsp; Therewould only be problems finding grps if there are not enough players to make it a viable way to play the game and that seems to be the crux of the issue.&nbsp; So make a statement, when combine goes live, all the pvpers should turn in their books and see if there are really enough of you to warrant another server.
