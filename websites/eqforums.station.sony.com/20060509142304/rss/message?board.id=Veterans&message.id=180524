    <description>&lt;div&gt;I recently have gotten my enchanter 2.0,and was at a loss as to which type of aug to place in the Type 4 slot.I recieved many ideas from fellow guild members,yet all of the replies centered around what would be sub par mana/hp augs with the exception of course to the BiC aug which is too time consuming to undertake imo.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Melee have a plethora of augs to choose from for the type 4 slot on primaries,from drops in zones,LDoNs,DoN wayfarers,DoD.Yet the number of augs which are caster specific is amazingly low,and when these are apparent,they are for type 7/8 slots.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;My suggestion would be for a line of Focus Effect augs which could be placed in the Type 4 slot,or even make a line of focus effect augs which were item type specific but for the &amp;quot;Any&amp;quot; slot.And not just the type V focus effects(Such as mana pres V),but augs such as Murams Vengence,Discordant Ice,Innoruks Irony,etc.This would make items for all classes more unique,giving them a sense that they were tailored specifically for each individual casters needs.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This also helps the non raiding,casual players needs more specifically as many of the focus effects they seek may not be available to them outside of zones they cant enter.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Combat effect augs for the type 4 slot may in many cases seem nice for some casters,but lets be honest,wizards were not meant to tank mobs that hit for 4k.A 125 point lifetap aug does not help this person stay alive against a mob that will one round them.So either they find the rare 40-50-60 hp aug that can be placed in that slot,or they find a +10 to all resists,or specific stat booster for it.Bic augs are nice,but they are not common,nor are they easy to get outside of a raiding guild who will concentrate on it for each person in guild.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot of the replies to this post have gone somewhat astray from what I was originally suggesting.I did not suggest a changing of aug,their placement,the concern of where a BiC aug could be placed,etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My suggestion was for a line of focus effect augs usable by casters that could be placed in the type 4 slot on weapons or primaries with that slot available.Casters have little use or benefit little from weapon procs and a line of focus effect augs would be considerably more useful.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Slipgear is Charm only.And im not sure there is a type 3 aug although there is a type 2.If I remember correctly,the type 2 was supposed to actually be an aug that could be used in any slot EXCEPT type 4,8,and Charm.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I agree whole heartedly with Zajeer in that the epics should not be somethign that needs replacing even in the near future.My entire point to this post was to bring up the possibilty of an aug that will benefit casters more than a proc could.And in saying this I meant it for the type 4 slots on ANY item rather than being aimed directly at the epics alone.Proc for casters are fun when soloing weak mobs the caster know he can survive against,but once in a group or raid that proc is near useless when they need to concentrate more on casting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Melee classes benefit from proc augs because that is their life - to fight and get weapons to proc for whatever effect those augs may produce.Casters dont have that same option against the same group or raid mobs - the proc we may have placed on our items is wasted unless we melee.Thus my idea to have more useful augs for our items be it an epic or not.IMO a 20-25% mana pres or a 40% damage foci would be considerably more useful to us than a 125 point lifetap proc against a mob that can one round most casters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You are right in saying that melee dont have innate procs  on their epics,Naubi,and for that reason you have shown a degree of shortsightedness.Melee can add 2 innate procs to their weapons with augs.My point was to show procs be they innate or not do not benefit casters as they do melee.Casters need foci to help in casting just as melee need procs to help in additional damage or hate generation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naubi I realize why melee have 2 slots on their epics.I was trying to rationalize why we as casters have to depend on weak augs or combat procs for that same slot when we could easily have a line of augs that would add focus effects which are considerably more useful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kamion7,as to your statement there is no 40-50-60 type 4 augs,yes there are and they are rare as stated such as these - &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=25386"&gt;http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=25386&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=26047"&gt;http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=26047&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=33287"&gt;http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=33287&lt;/a&gt; , and I believe the old type 2 were actually considered an &amp;quot;any&amp;quot; slot aug as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My point was to have a line of augs that were useful to casters that could be placed in the same aug slot melee use for weapon procs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I agree the BiC is more than worth the effort considering the results even at the 1/2 way point,but as I stated this quest is too time consuming,and finding the people to help on mobs that cant be soloed would present a problem unless you find someone who is also working on that particular stage of the BiC as well.Guilds moving into anguish and dreadspire keep find older content boring,and GoD mobs are no cake walk for even well geared toons.As my guild progresses into Anguish,and as we begin forays into DoD raid content,Tacvi is slowly becoming a shimmer of the past and the days when we do venture there,we see more and more items being handed down to alts or flat out rotting.This doesnt bode well for anyone wanting to undergo the BiC quest as the content has become stale.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

DoN proc augs are up to par with anguish-2.0 content as far as 1handers go, but DoN foci augs are no where near anguish foci level.&lt;/em&gt;  Also, Since 2 / 4 class specific anguish weapons are for knights, I think that's part of the compensation ya'll get for not having up to par 2h procs on your 2.0s&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;At the time we did the epics, items could only hold 1 spell (worn, activated, or proc) and one focus effect. However, sometime shortly after Omens launch, we changed the system for items that have spells on them, to allow an item to carry multiple spells (multiple worn or multiple procs, and an activated) and to allow for multiple foci on an item. This led to us revising the effect on the necromancer epic, so that they were allowed a worn spell (their worn effect is not a focus, fyi) and a clickie spell on the same item.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;We could have gone back and removed the type 4 augment from all epics and added a proc, however, at the time, I felt that it wouldn't gain us any approval from players since most of the players with either a 1.5 or 2.0 already had their type4 slot augmented. Moreover, we would have had to make unique 'epic' style procs for the weapons, which I imagine would have garnered complaints from casters for losing a type4 slot, as well as seeing their melee counterparts "compensated" for it with a proc.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;It was a sticky situation, and that's why epics are what they are right now. I still don't approve of some of the bigger, more powerful augments being type all (like the BiC and others) since there are items I want to create that use a specific set of augments, but can't, since the type-alls can go into any set and throw off the intentions of that set. It was never really intended for an epic to have more than 500 hps or mana, making it very hard to replace for a good many expansions.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I had considered doing this before the DoN armor type9 augment additions. Consider if I had did it back then; augments like the BiC wouldn't fit in type 9, 11, or 12. I would wager that as soon as a new augment slot went in (such as the type 9s in DoN or the 12s for tradeskills) I would have gotten requests/complaints that the functionality of their previous 'type all' BiC augment now won't fit in these new slots. Now, I could still change them to work with all slot types we've currently been using (including 9 and 12), but the negative feedback on the handful or so type-all augments will be a lot bigger than what you'd expect, especially when new slot types are introduced&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

Consider if I had did it back then; augments like the BiC wouldn't fit in type 9, 11, or 12. I would wager that as soon as a new augment slot went in (such as the type 9s in DoN or the 12s for tradeskills) I would have gotten requests/complaints that the functionality of their previous 'type all' BiC augment now won't fit in these new slots. Now, I could still change them to work with all slot types we've currently been using (including 9 and 12), but the negative feedback on the handful or so type-all augments will be a lot bigger than what you'd expect, especially when new slot types are introduced&lt;/P&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;P&gt; &lt;/P&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;P&gt; &lt;/P&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think for the future of the game and your sanity with regards to itemization at least, it might very well be worthwhile for some short term pain (by removing the "All" option on the augs) for the long term potential gain. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Still it probably should NOT be done until you have armor with the new slot types (whatever they may be) and new augs of the appropriate slot type available, complete with augs similar to the former 'All' augs. That should take some of the sting off losing being able to put BiC in that new slot. (Subsequant new slots beyond that new one may not need the BiC/Tipt equiv augs for them since it will be old news by then.)</description>

      <description>I think as long as you don't go as far as making only new armor that doesn't allow the current all slot augments it wouldn't be that much of an issue. People would only get upset when they get to a point when they only have access to armor that they cant put their BiC, etc into and have to use lesser augments.</description>

I still don't approve of some of the bigger, more powerful augments being type all (like the BiC and others) since there are items I want to create that use a specific set of augments, but can't, since the type-alls can go into any set and throw off the intentions of that set. It was never really intended for an epic to have more than 500 hps or mana, making it very hard to replace for a good many expansions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Isnt it possible to change all the existing augments that are type all to existing aug types ( type 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12 etc ) and simply add those types to the augs. That way they will keep thier usefullness for those of us that allready have them, and give you a chance of creating new augment types for new armor?

      <description>The fact that the Epic 2.0 can compete thru now a 3rd expansion, is not something you should consider a problem. I would hate being &amp;quot;forced&amp;quot; to replace such a unique item cause it wasn't up to the standard of the upcoming loot table.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that's the point of an Epic, Zajeer. First the quest for it should be difficult (and some classes do truelly pay for it in difficulty) and Second the item once obtained should give you the feel that it shouldnt be replaced for a VERY long time. If the thought is, it's epic and it will be replaced with the next expansion or two, why do the quest just for the sake, I did it. The EPICS should convey the feeling it was tough, hard quested and not get the feeling it needs to be replaced the next expansion because it is lacking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ten&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>The reason the hybrid/melee epics have 2 aug slots is because other weapons have 2 procs and only having one would make the epics underpowered relatively (which is hardly the idea).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The reason it's not 2x type 8 slots is because this would allow for more than one +dmg aug (which would be overpowered). So they have type 4 instead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
