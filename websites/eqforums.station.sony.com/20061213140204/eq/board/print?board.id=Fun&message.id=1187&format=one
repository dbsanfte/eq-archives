				<DIV>I play on Solusek Ro and I met my boyfriend in real life almost a year and a half ago.&nbsp; I started playing eq&nbsp; about a year ago.&nbsp; It all started after I went home from his house one night.&nbsp; My little brother had just got an eq account and I was upset that whenever I was over at my bf's house he paid more attention to eq than he did to me.&nbsp; So at first I made a mage and played it for a little while, then decided I wanted something that could cast sow and the sooner they got it the better, so I made a shaman.&nbsp; I was a total noob.&nbsp; I didn't research classes or anything lol.&nbsp; I just wanted to run faster.&nbsp; Anyway, I started playing my shaman with my bf and at that point I couldn't group with him because his rogue was too high for my shaman.&nbsp; Eventually I caught up.&nbsp; My shaman is now 65 and his rogue is 66.&nbsp; We are still together and I think if I hadn't started playing, we probably would have broken up, but I think eq strengthened our relationship.</DIV>
