				<DIV>The events that did occur were more fun and innovative than an average event (excellent content).</DIV>
<DIV>But, overall I have to give the summer festival a thumbs down.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Less events than on a normal week, imo.&nbsp; In fact, I felt there we a LOT less events than on a normal week.</DIV>
<DIV>Saturday and Sunday were especially low on events during a time many people expected the most events to occur (resulting in a very high level of&nbsp;disappointment).</DIV>
<DIV>No events were posted so people could plan for them (I don't count the guild recruiting as an event).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Overall,&nbsp;a normal week of events is more fun than the summer festival was.</DIV>
