      <description>&lt;div&gt;So I zone into Sverag to look for the progression mob, thinking now that they have fixed his spawn I can help the raid by checking if the mob is up or not.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I check the tracking window and I don't see anything new like the faction leader described in this forum.  So I let me guild officers know that the progression mob isn't on my tracking.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Understand how gimpy ranger tracking is when compared to MQ2, another toon dropped in to the zone and informed me that I was wrong and the progression mob is up.  I assisted off him and sure enough, it's a mob that's not on my tracking.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So with the standard use of MQ2, why does the dev think it's still necessary to make certain mobs not trackable by rangers?  At one point the Kess fight required ranger tracker because we can tell the difference between the spawns, but apparently MQ2 has that resolved too now because we are no longer required to single out the adds.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;At this point I am willing to spend AA so my ranger can track everything including mobs that shows up on MQ2 only.  But even our tracking range extension AA is current not working as advertised.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Is the amazingly rare bottleneck mob in Sverag for progression one of the newly trackable mobs?&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all need to leave out the stuff about &amp;quot;does your target leave tracks, if not you should not be able to track it&amp;quot;. Tracking in Everquest is a class beneficial ability. That is all it is, nothing more. It is like having to get a rogue to open a door with no key. The fact that the door is there and requires it to be picked means you must have a rogue to normally gain access to that content. Everquest is full of class beneficial abilities like this. Want an experience rez from a death? You need a cleric, necromancer, or paladin. Want to charm a specific NPC? You need an enchanter or bard or druid (if it is an animal).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That being said, the reason to have track it solely because you want to know if an NPC that is desireable for what ever reason is available without having to go directly to the spawn location. No one cares if a moss snake is up or not. But they would care if that randomly spawning highly sought after NPC that is part of their class's epic 1.5 task is up for them. Unfortunately, it is not the moss snake type NPCs that is immune to track, but that NPC used in the epic 1.5 quests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you realize that more half of the NPCs used in all of the classes 1.5 epic quests are immune to track? It is true. What about that group you got together that desides they want to work for that Cloak of the Spirit Tracker quest but have to compete with 3 other groups for it? These are the NPCs that are being tagged as immune to tracking. Making them immune is the equivalent as saying that if a specific NPC kills a character, they cannot be rezed by a cleric. Or a specific locked door cannot be accessed by a rogue with max skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there may be some small cases where specific content in the game may be enhanced with the addition of non-trackable NPCs, can we really be suggestion that NPCs like those used in the epic 1.5, the ones for the Arcstone Mark tasks, or the Ritesmaster Velok in Ruin of Illisan are truly needing to be immune to track? And guys, it is getting worse with each expansion. Back with Luclin, the number of NPCs that were immune could be counted on one hand. With each expansion, the number grows and does so not in a consent amount either. It is something more then an &amp;quot;accident&amp;quot; in coding can truly be explained. I have yet to find any &amp;quot;an_random_common_NPC_type&amp;quot; that has ever been flagged as immune to tracking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Wadin Pureheart of Quellious&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plainswalker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Oh for pities sake.. this is a ranger. Tracking could easily include noting subtle differences in the air, or in wildlife patterns, or simple area knowledge on the part of the character (as opposed to that of the player).&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;It does make sense that there are some beings that are immune to tracking, but they should be sparse and only exist with good reason. After all, as rogues, we are arguing that fewer creatures should see through our stealth... isn't that the same kind of problem? A class ability that we need to be reliable to be able to, well, rely on it?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I realize there is not a lot of love lost between ranjahs and us rogues, but this one we should be on the same side of. To be otherwise would be hypocritical.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

Those roles should, therefore, make sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Statement 1:&lt;/strong&gt;  Yes, I am aware that there are doors that cannot be opened by a max skilled rogue, and that there are NPCs that cannot be charmed by a skilled high level enchanter. For each classes and their set of abilities, there is always some counter to those abilities and classes. That is the way it should be. But the majority of those counters, have a logical reason behind them. Given each door that cannot be picked by a rogue, you most likely find that the specific content behind that door is designed with that in mind, i.e. must complete a specific set of tasks in order for the door to open. Furthermore, I am not suggesting that there should not be content that &lt;strong&gt;IS &lt;/strong&gt;immune to track. That make an specific NPC non-trackable can enhance that content. The Kess events is a successful prime example of such, IMO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I am suggesting though is that all the NPCs that I have personally found to be non-trackable has no reason for it. All of them are what would be consider a &amp;quot;named&amp;quot; NPC (e.g Ritesmaster Vekor in Ruins of Illisan). &lt;strong&gt;NONE &lt;/strong&gt;of them are what would be consider a &amp;quot;common&amp;quot; NPC (e.g. a moss snake). If many of the non-trackable NPCs presently in the game are an &amp;quot;accident&amp;quot;, would not probability state that it is more likely that the number be somewhat evenly distributed between &amp;quot;named&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;common&amp;quot; NPCs, rather then all skewed to &amp;quot;named&amp;quot; NPCs?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Granted, I know that there are some developers that say this is an &amp;quot;accident&amp;quot;, but I will point out that this issue is not a couple weeks or months old, but rather just about 4 years old. And it is an &amp;quot;accident&amp;quot; that has been purpetuated with every expansion even with the multitude of /bug reports. It is also something that I believe has been stated by other developers as being the way it should be. So give me a break if I do not believe the &amp;quot;accident and we will change&amp;quot; it line until I see the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can anyone explain what the rational would be for the 4 named NPCs in Arcstone that are a part of the Mark task that gives the Cloak of the Spirit Tracker be flagged as non-trackable? That is 4 occurances of the &amp;quot;accident&amp;quot; in tagging that seems to be a little to coinencidental. What about the Ritesmaster Velkor in Ruins of Illisan? There is an NPC that is not to far from the zone in, but cannot be detected by a ranger. Instead it needs rogues or monks to scout if it is up. The fact that it cannot be seen on track does not, from anything I have experienced, enhance the content of the event. Tracking has nothing to do with the event. It is spawn location is static. It does not move from its spawn location. It is not overly far from the zone in point. Yet, it is flagged as non-trackable? These are all examples of the current state of the game. They are not made up, but are personal true experiences as seen by this poster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Statement 2: &lt;/strong&gt;The reason I state to leave the stuff of attempting to justify gaming content and abilities with real life techniques is that it is an impossible and slipperly slope for anyone to use to win. If you make a statement, any statement, that attempts to point to rel life techniques as a reason it should or should not exist, you then open the door for everyone else to do the same. Dangon, you have already seen it and they justly had the right of it with the rogue &amp;quot;Slip into Shadows&amp;quot; argument versus ranger tracking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secondly, such arguments violate the first primary rule of all games (and all theatrical movies, btw). That rule being the &lt;em&gt;Suspension of Disbelief&lt;/em&gt;. Wikipedia, free encylopedia defines the &lt;em&gt;Suspension of Disbelief&lt;/em&gt; as &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;a willingness of a reader or viewer to suspend his or her critical faculties to the extent of ignoring minor inconsistencies so as to enjoy a work of fiction&amp;quot;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"&lt;/em&gt;Video games often require suspension of disbelief. Often, realism is compromised even in games set out to be realistic either intentionally to not overcomplicate game mechanics or due to technical limitations. For example, gunshot wounds are rarely disabling. Some games based on Spider-Man have the comic hero swinging around a city with his webs sticking to nothing but the sky. Another frequent occurrence in games is instant death upon falling into water (instead of giving the player a chance to swim out before drowning)...Role playing games such as Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons ask the players to use suspension of disbelief when deciding what actions their characters should take. For example, if the players know their Game Master has a history of putting booby traps on the more obvious solutions to obstacles they encounter, a player may have his character press the button labeled &amp;quot;Press me&amp;quot; even though he knows something bad will probably happen, because &amp;quot;it's what the character would do.&amp;quot;&amp;quot; - from en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_of_disbelief&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order for many of these mechanics of this game to work, we must suspend our disbelief. If we do not, we end up with a game that is not really that fun. That is why I say we need to &amp;quot;leave all that stuff&amp;quot; about realizism out of this. It is a losing argument to bring in to the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Wadin Pureheart of Quellious&lt;br&gt;Plainswalker&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;I actually liked having mobs untrackable. Now everyone will simply scan the zone for named mobs on track instead of looking where they pop like before.&amp;nbsp; I dont want to remove tracking but I liked a little variety and having some untrackables.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

Hiding isn't as hard as people might think, even in RL situations. Avoiding being picked up by animals, also isn't hard. Hunters do it to this day by masking their scent. If you pay attention to the flow of the wind, you can also avoid your scent carrying to an animal or other human (yes, people can track people through their scents, it's been done by humans before).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, here is where I get in trouble with my fellow rogues ... I actually wouldn't mind at all an area where hide didn't work. If it's a very big, open, well lit area that I couldn't find any shadows in, it wouldn't make me cry. I'd learn to navigate around it, or I wouldn't. Either way I'd still play a rogue. I wouldn't mind an emote here and there &amp;quot;As you step the floor creaks, revealing your position&amp;quot; which drops sneak/hide. Granted, as your skills advance and you get AA's this should be almost nullified by virtue of your skill, almost. It shouldn't happen often, but occasionally even a master can slip up ... just as mobs which used to not be trackable, should be trackable with higher skills, just not all of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don't tell me I am furthering my agenda, what agenda? Where is my agenda? Yea, I'm out to get the rangers, woohoo here I come! Come on. I don't bring up realism only when it suits my non-existent agenda to nerf rangers. I bring it up when it comes up. Realistically I think taunt should work more for warriors too, how hard is it to say &amp;quot;Hey B***, your mom was great last night&amp;quot; and get the thing hitting you? He's a level 70 warrior, but he hasn't taken that many blows to the head, come now. I think a squeeky floor or a bright lamp should reveal me. I think rangers should only be able to track trackable mobs. Yes, it is a fantasy game, but where is this rule that fantasy should be completely unbelievable. The best fantasy always allows for the suspension of disbelief, allowing the player/viewer/etc. to immerse themselves in this fantasy realm and &amp;quot;believe&amp;quot; it for the time being. As I said in my last post, above, I'd rather deal with a sensible hardship than some utterly ridiculous and unbelievable advantage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Dangon-Veeshan on &lt;span class="date_text"&gt;04-15-2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;06:49 PM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;An innate gift for spotting shadows it is not, after much training (up to 200 skill) and spending various AA (more training) we master the art of hiding.&amp;quot; &lt;/i&gt;-Dangon-Veeshan&lt;br&gt;-----------------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seriously man, listen to your hypocrisy. Let's swap a few words with what you JUST said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An innate gift for following footsteps, it is not. After much training (up to 200 skill) and spending various AA (more training) rangers master the art of tracking.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See how that works? You keep assuming that tracking is only about looking for footprints in the sand, but even in the real world that is only one part of tracking and it's been going on for thousands of years. It's about learning the places creatures tend to hide, it's about using visual and oldfactory clues, it's about looking at local vegetation and animal life to see where a creature would find its best sustenance. All of that is part of locating specific species, and it is why an experienced tracker in Africa can find animals which don't leave footprints at all because they use trees for travel, not the ground.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, when you consider that tracking in the *real* world is not limited to looking for footprints, is it SO hard for you to imagine that tracking classes in EQ are using various methods to track -- quite possibly including abilities given by their respective GODS.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To summarize for you:&lt;br&gt;Tracking in EQ does not have to follow normal logic and it's absurd to argue otherwise; but it actually is logical to quite a large extent. You're just being narrow-minded, both in real world terms and fantasty.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;I'd rather deal with a sensible hardship than some utterly ridiculous and unbelievable advantage.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rogue's shroud of stealth has provided a totally ridiculous advantage since its introduction, and you can't very well take back 4 years of virtually free roaming privileges throughout Norrath and beyond. Much more than just 'boss' mobs should see through SoS but they don't. You DO have an unbelievable advantage and you'll continue to have it. Stop trying to argue against the small advantage rangers have in being able to tell if a mob is up; tracking is not even a unique ability unto itself, and as others have described here, it's far from being inimitable by other classes who have their own methods of looking for mobs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Regards,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mahzz&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
Rogue's shroud of stealth has provided a totally ridiculous advantage since its introduction, and you can't very well take back 4 years of virtually free roaming privileges throughout Norrath and beyond. Much more than just 'boss' mobs should see through SoS but they don't. You DO have an unbelievable advantage and you'll continue to have it. Stop trying to argue against the small advantage rangers have in being able to tell if a mob is up; tracking is not even a unique ability unto itself, and as others have described here, it's far from being inimitable by other classes who have their own methods of looking for mobs.&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;This is a load of Mahzzian hogwash, not unlike the rest of Mahzzian hogwash you spew mindlessly for your hatred of any certain individuals or classes who might impede on your utopia.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Here's my arguement:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Most boss mobs shouldn't even be seeing through Shroud of Stealth - and when we're spotted, we deserve get away options that don't rely on shroud of stealth to begin with.&amp;nbsp; I should be able to sneak into a monster's lair, pop open a chest, steal their booty, and get away, while a ranger is still going "Hm, I think there actually &lt;EM&gt;might&lt;/EM&gt; be a creature somewhere in there...let me keep looking at his droppings and verify that they aren't just mud".&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;There should be a handful of see-SoS mobs scattered throughout the game, only ones that don't absolutely rely on sight, and I should &lt;EM&gt;still&lt;/EM&gt; have a chance to sneak past them.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I'm sick and tired of seeing bards and monks sneaking past creatures with relative impunity, and fulfilling the "stealth" parts of various quests, while I'm told to sit down and let David Carradine do it, because he's got feign death.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I don't necessarily agree that willowisps, as an example, shouldn't be tracked because they don't walk, because you can track their droppings or any residue they give off from their light stones.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;What you shouldn't be tracking are rooted mobs that don't move.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;You're a tracker, not a sonar.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&amp;quot; should be able to sneak into a monster's lair, pop open a chest, steal their booty, and get away&amp;quot; -Ezedriel&lt;br&gt;--------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And you're calling what I said hogwash? heh.
