&lt;P&gt;Monks in my opinion, &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Masters of Endurance, (dmg over time)&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Great Feats of physical and mental strength (impressive DPS, and survivability)&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;~A monk is not a hulking rippling mass of muscle, he is a focus, disciplined warrior, who knows what to attack and when, how to dmg something with the least amount of effort, to strike and move with Speed unparrelelled leaving a mob wondering how many times it was just hit, only to realise to late that it was fatal. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I love being a monk because&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I only die if i am not paying attention, or FD wants me dead.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I can provide impressive dps to a group.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;In most places even Rss/Nest i do not require heals if i play smart, saving cleric mana.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I love a monks survivability&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I LOVE pulling, because i get to ensure a group gets the mobs it can handle, and if you do you job right people will always remember you for more groups, a smart player is one that is remembered. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;A monk if played smart, tanks just fine. however would love more shielding on items&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Avoidance is $ cap is easy to obtain with 1/2 our items coated in it.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Working with other monks pulling for raid that require team work.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I can safely say looking at what we have been getting so far and the hard work our monk corespondent does for us and the open ear he recieves, makes me glad to play a monk. You guys know who you are, so from a monk to another Thanks Brother!&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>Monks&lt;br&gt;--------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Monks are pullers primarily, and also contribute to fights as great off-tanks and pure melee DPS. Our primary role is to pull mobs to the group or raid, by using our many skills such as spliting, lulling and feigning death. Once we get the required amount of mobs, we can bring them to the group for the main tank to use their defensive abilities on, while we off-tank any additional mob until another tank can get them, or a mezer can mez them. Once that is done we share high DPS alongside other melees, but never being able to get as much DPS as classes who's primary goal is to dish out damage, such as rogues and bersekers. We're at the crossroad of offense and defense, and our disciplines and skills include tools to do both, from pulling, survival and increased offense.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;This is my definition of a monk, what it was when I started it, what it is now and what it will always be and the way I play my character.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;As far as pulling glose it Situational&amp;nbsp;/player based. There are a ton of situation where a monk is more&amp;nbsp;reliable then a bard, and vis versa, the bigest issue that monk vs bard have in end game content would be ranged of monk vs that of a bard. Unless that monk has Ton Po's Pouch, he has to get closer to mobs vs that of a bard. There are some tricks we now can do with Imitate Death that are pretty sweet! Combine that with our Snare too hehe even better however some what risky some times! However i love living on the edge/pulling thats why i play a monk. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;That being said i would like to see in the Near future: More items like Ton Po Pouch, an upgrade to the pouch for those monks who are past this game content. (DONT Care about the Range DPS)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;More variety into the types of Hand to hand Weapons: Like why can't we get nunchaku, Kama's, Sai's, Kung Fu broad swords, Tonfa's and other items that can be consider Martial but look differnt and maybe act differntly, ( example:&amp;nbsp;Sai's could be use by monk as a martial skill however do&amp;nbsp;Piercing damage)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Bards cannot lull mobs over level 70. Their OoW lull is the same as ours, except they don't have the high recast. However, it is resistable and not instant.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;True, although 900 mana per Lull can get quite expensive. ;)&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>A bard is vastly superior to monk with regards to pulling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One if you have not noticed high end content mob almost have superior run speed to everyone except a bard.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  a) If you have had to pull in anguish raid, bards fly around out running everything. While monks have to take a beating (even with new run aa). So you pull use crippling strike, mend, potions, and/or earthwalk/dreamwalk. In contrast, bard will agro out run , get to camp and fade. If a bard gets in trouble instant fade (mana), DA song and even seen snare song used. Consequently, it is rare a bard takes a hit or 2 during the pull. When I pull anguish our guild expects 2 or even 3 trash mobs in camp at the same time. 1300hitters x3 on your back the whole time. I am not talking a short distance either.&lt;br&gt;  ---Advantage BARDS&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  b) Lets turn to places like QVIC.&lt;br&gt;    Once again run speed is a huge advantage. A monk pulls using alot of the same tactics as points a, just taking less damage than anguish. However it reasonable to use FD or ID to get a good split. Lulls work ok. (Remember 65 lull is pacify, reaction radius modifer vs 69lull is just a reaction radius modifer (oversite ?) Lulls are usefull in situation where you do not path a mob too close to another. Certainly, there are few more perks for monk in these areas. Turning to bards, they run up agro and 30 sec later a mob gets to camp. Almost the same a monk just far far quicker. Lets turn to splitting, while a monk has to use FD and smarts, a bard can lull, mez (heavily useful), Divine Aura (DA), snare (rarely used), fade (mana)and even agro a mob thru walls to get warps. &lt;br&gt;Example Common Bard strat: A bard runs up does the DA runs in agros a ton of mob (all between Mnet etc), keeps close enough to get all of them (lazy agro mobs). Once everything is pretty much outside of the temple and on him/her run a large circle thru the zone. Speeding up on the end and then Fades almost to Mnet. Then agros selos outside warps it (cheap bard agro BS)  thru the wall then runs back to camp with mnet before 90 pct of the mobs have pathed back. However, if they missed a mob just mez continue and fade to lose agro once at camp. Sounds simple enough does it not. &lt;br&gt;Example 2 (monks): A monk can do the tradition pull 2 by 2 to camp til you get to Mnet and hopefully beat respawn (varaible quality of players killing in camp (non raid cleric death= slow down), knowing the area (taking a short cut or 2, or/and cannot die during the pull process. Old fashion pull and kill method. Second idea is a make off of bard strat listed above. You use the same method however you can run and get as many as you can ( use voidance, earthwalk). Then you keep 15 to 18 mobs together without dying (cause your disc went bye bye). Go into to dreamwalk speed hopefully get them far enough away with 18 sec disc or is 12 sec anyways...Do the great circle as explained above get back to MNET (disc is gone bye bye far before you get there) ID (Imitate Death) clear all agro ..Agro Mnet get it outside with normal run speed before a boat load of mobs get back. Run Mnet to camp and if add comes camp has to deal with ( remember FD during this phase = Mnet warps home). Certainly somewhat doable however it takes alot more skill , and heck of lot more luck. Cannot screw up cause all discs will take 15 to 30 plus mins to recoil.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Comparing the 2 classes: Huge advantage to bards cause of 1) Time saver to raid (esp in the past if racing guilds) 2)Those little perks of speed mez lull fade da etc etc are huge huge advantage if used properly 3)Bards use some agro thru wall trick. Certainly weighing it all together it far far easier as a bard. &lt;br&gt; ---ADVANTAGE BARDS&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Other raid areas: Certainly there are some advantages in certain situation where a fd split in tight quarters is great advantage than bard fade. So without listing a huge list of raid strats, I will call this situational pulling. All in All it weighs out equal between the 2 classes. Advantage generally greater where Selos is enabled to the bard and where it is not then monk pokes slightly ahead. Certainly, I have a 'bag of tricks' that I use when I can to yield a small perk. Sadly, most take camping or fair amount of time to recover cause they are expendable. \&#xD;&lt;br&gt;Again NO ADVANTAGE TO EITHER.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So what can you take from this. First comment, new run speed AA would be better served if we were in the area of 80pct run speed (10 pct increase per aa). Certainly, not in the range of selos but it means that we are not totally covered in whelts on our back, once we get to camp. Secondly, Lull and Fade = Phanton series and FD (ID)...so thats a fair balance in pulling. However again turning to the perks, not even in the same ballpark. Mez'n, DA'n, etc is not even a balanced to what a monk can do. Sure you can say we have better DPS. However, most highend guilds do not consider monks good DPS in situations where DPS on one thing and killing add trash (you will find us on trash).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sorry I did not clean up this post, I have to run =( (but not run too fast=) )</description>

      <description>There seems here to be an lot of people mentioning how much better bards are at pulling than monks, how bards have all these fun abilities, how as monks they just sit about waiting on the bard to pull.... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**SMURF**???&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ok, so bards get innate skills to allow them to mez / lull / run fast / fade etc...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Get a grip.... I've played a monk for near on 6 years, I pull for my guild on raids constantly and I pull for groups all the time as well.....are bards better pullers than me?? Hell NO! Effective as bards can be and as quick as bards can be with their innate abilities to split mobs etc, I've never found this to be a problem for a monk.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maybe if you feel that you can't pull anywhere near as well or as fast as a bard, you shouldn't be a monk in the first place.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just how can a bard pull "faster" than a monk when as a mob is dying you're bringing another back to camp??&lt;br&gt;There are no differences in speed here.... chain pulling negates that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ok, so a bard may often be able to split mobs faster than a monk, so initially breaking a spawn may be slightly quicker if a bard is doing it... but there are also instances where monks can split mobs faster than bards...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's all about how you play your class and how well you understand your own abilities...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stop bitching about how much better bards are at pulling than monks, go learn something about your class and how to pull!!</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;Please explain again how monks are designated as the primary pullers by SOE Developers...&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I don't understand this, our Phantom Cry discipline works on mobs of up to level 70 which is the level of many named Gods.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Not&amp;nbsp;knowing a lot about Bards,&amp;nbsp;are you stating that they can lull mobs beyond level 70?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Our PCry reduces the assist range of a single target that is level 69 or below, &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;and is further restricted to a single mob at a time and also from most named &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;and most raid event trash mobs and a number of additional trash mobs as &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;well such as elite kyvs/ukuns/etc and a number of inanimate creatures and &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;undead as well.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Bards can lull multiple creatures up to level 72, &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;and can Highsun such mobs as the Elemental Gods.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;They also have their greater speed and greater range&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;and with constant instant self invis they can pull many&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;individual mobs across a full zone of mobs that cant&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;see invis.&amp;nbsp; They can charm lower level mobs and even&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Mez an add in addition to all that, while they still do other&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;songs for the group or DPS in the meantime.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;This is what HIGHSUN does to a target.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;"&lt;SPAN&gt;An odd tune that strips mystic enchantments from your target and causes them to teleport to their home point ."&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;I am in an Elemental Guild that is two kills from TIME.&amp;nbsp; I have yet to see a mob that this song did not work on.&amp;nbsp; This is not a "LULL"&amp;nbsp; but a way of manipulating a mob to return home.&amp;nbsp; It dose not remove hate but I have seen Bards highsun a Raid Named mob several times during the course of a fight.&amp;nbsp; Lets say the Bard is kiting three Named mobs that are all Raid level encounters,&amp;nbsp; the bard can Highsun one of them and your Raid has someone set up to snare/tag the named at its spawn point,&amp;nbsp; once it gets Highsunned,&amp;nbsp; tagger grabs mob and brings it to the Raid while the Bard continues to kite the other two named.&amp;nbsp; Once raid kills the first named the Bard Highsuns the second named,&amp;nbsp; tagger tags,&amp;nbsp; Raid kills then Bard can either Highsun the last one or just bring it to the Raid him/herself.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Monks have nothing close to this ability.&amp;nbsp; With this tool,&amp;nbsp; added to fadding memories that is based on mana and not a reuse timmer Bards can in many situations out pull a Monk.&amp;nbsp; We do have our niche though.&amp;nbsp; Our guild uses Monks to pull almost exclusively until situations arise where splitting will take too long.&amp;nbsp; Then our Bards pull.&amp;nbsp; An event that comes to mind is the final phase of the Vine Ring event in Plane of Earth.&amp;nbsp; Having multiple level 70 mobs crowded around one another and asking a Monk to pull singles to your Raid is just too dang time consuming.&amp;nbsp; Also for pulling The Rathe Council event in Plane of EarthB we use Bards along with Monks to Tag.&amp;nbsp; Highsun used with Fading memories is just too powerful to ignore using them on these events.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;Mingo_Djinn wrote:&lt;BR&gt;There seems here to be an lot of people mentioning how much better bards are at pulling than monks, how bards have all these fun abilities, how as monks they just sit about waiting on the bard to pull.... &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;**SMURF**???&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Ok, so bards get innate skills to allow them to mez / lull / run fast / fade etc...&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Get a grip.... I've played a monk for near on 6 years, I pull for my guild on raids constantly and I pull for groups all the time as well.....are bards better pullers than me?? Hell NO! Effective as bards can be and as quick as bards can be with their innate abilities to split mobs etc, I've never found this to be a problem for a monk.&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;It would all depend on the person behind the bard.&amp;nbsp; Just like not all monks are great expert pullers neither are all bards, it is just much easier for a non puller bard to pull just as well as a puller monk.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
Maybe if you feel that you can't pull anywhere near as well or as fast as a bard, you shouldn't be a monk in the first place.&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Well, as I stated above not all monks play them to pull or even with the intention of pulling.&amp;nbsp; This would be just like them telling you that if you can't dps as well as a rogue or berzerker then you shouldn't be a monk.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
Just how can a bard pull "faster" than a monk when as a mob is dying you're bringing another back to camp??&lt;BR&gt;There are no differences in speed here.... chain pulling negates that.&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Unfortunately do to the fact that the bard can run significantly faster than a monk can, they can pull faster.&amp;nbsp; Chain pulling has 0 effect on that.&amp;nbsp; It just means that the monk does considerably less dps.&amp;nbsp; The monk will have to leave camp sooner to get the next mob than a bard would have to so the bard's utility is active for the whole group longer than the monks dps would be on the mob.&amp;nbsp; Also by pulling faster there is also the fact that when a monk has to split mobs it can take a fair amount of time for a monk to split them that it would not take a bard of equal skill, or less skill at times.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
Ok, so a bard may often be able to split mobs faster than a monk, so initially breaking a spawn may be slightly quicker if a bard is doing it... but there are also instances where monks can split mobs faster than bards...&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Then by all means share these places with everyone.&amp;nbsp; I can't really think of anything that isn't a raid target where on average a bard couldn't pull it as fast or faster than a monk.&amp;nbsp; I am sure there are places where it is true, and I'm also sure that the monks more skilled at pulling can probably pull faster than many bards.&amp;nbsp; But in the same way most bards can pull faster than many monks.&amp;nbsp; Skill and experience in pulling are needed on the monk's part, but not always necessary on the bard's.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
It's all about how you play your class and how well you understand your own abilities...&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Stop bitching about how much better bards are at pulling than monks, go learn something about your class and how to pull!!&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;It's not a matter of people not understanding their class.&amp;nbsp; Until recently monks weren't even officially considered a pulling class, though they did acknowledge that we were used for it.&amp;nbsp; The bard however has always been and still is officially considered to be a primary if not the primary pulling class, thus why they have all the tools.&amp;nbsp; Anything that a monk can go learn about their class and pulling there is a&amp;nbsp;bard that can go and learn about their class and pulling.&amp;nbsp; Then in the content that is actively used by most people the bard with equal knowledge about theirown class and how to pull will 9 times out of 10 pull as well or faster than a monk who knows just as much about the monk class and pulling.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Besides in 99% of today's content run speed = pulling speed.&amp;nbsp; The bards just have a much faster way to get rid of their adds.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>I have one simple request that I really need before I can discuss re-envisionment of the monk class (or any other class).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can you please share what the developer's model of where they want the monk to end up? Describe (in general scope, not specific detail) how they foresee (after all the changes are done) monks in the lineup.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In years gone by, we had mission statement of varying degrees of detail. Things like:&lt;br&gt;We (EQ developers) want warrior damage to be the baseline. Rogue damage to be 1.4, monk to be 1.3, etc etc etc. (I'm sure they're not these numbers, years ago it ceased being accurate or meaningful).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We've had a more recent statement about order of 'tankability', warrior better than knight better than monk better than (etc etc), as the design template for luclin-&gt;Pop.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can you give us your 'plan'? How can we discuss reevisionment talking into a vacuum? If we're given what you want the end point to be, we can collaborate and assist you in reaching that goal (either by ideas that could accomplish it, or pointing out where things that've been attempted have fallen short or overshot the mark).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Roles and issues that seem to directly affect desirability:&lt;br&gt;DPS&lt;br&gt;'taking damage' (distinct from tanking, since tanking also involves aggro control to keep the thing from changing targets)&lt;br&gt;tanking&lt;br&gt;pulling&lt;br&gt;at-range roles (for encounters where being in melee range is nominal suicide for people 'other than tank(s)'.)&lt;br&gt;healing&lt;br&gt;slowing&lt;br&gt;crowd control&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I've probably missed a few. But I guess I'm looking to see how you think monks should fit in the grander scheme of things (relative to other classes), and obviously there are going to be things monks excel at (dps, hopefully) and are lousy at (healing, one presumes). I'd also expect the roles to be weighed with both xp groups AND raiding in mind, but that may be hoping for too much.&lt;br&gt;But we can't have meaningful dialog about how to reach a goal, when the goal is wrapped in sackcloth, locked in a chest, and stored in a pitch-black bank vault.</description>

      <description>Quote:&lt;br&gt;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;I am simply trying to figure out what the "vision" is of Monk in Sony's eyes from the changes they proposed will take place for our class.&lt;br&gt;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are 4 well defined roles for groups: Tank, Healer, Slower, DPS.&lt;br&gt;Any other devisable role is optional (CC, Puller, Snarer), as it's not always required unless SOE drastically changes the content.&lt;br&gt;Monks tank? Limited.&lt;br&gt;Monks slow? No.&lt;br&gt;Monks heal? No.&lt;br&gt;Monks dps? Yes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Basically, you can go by each class with those four options and know what they're for.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Quote:&lt;br&gt;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;But I tend to listen to what other people say on these boards, and when hundreds of monks have cancelled their accounts because their job now is to hit auto-attack and go afk, I tend to believe it's not just a fluke.&lt;br&gt;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hundreds of monks quit because they could not find groups anymore and where angry about the nerf along with bards getting some pulling tools. We mainly lost pulling jobs since the pulling role became pretty much a rarity. Had there been more demand for expertise pullers, then both monks and bards would've had plenty of jobs. The "rogue-lite" remark was just a medium to voice displeasure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fact is, we never got viewed as rogue lites by other classes, we where viewed as pullers still, but since they rarely needed a puller, we sat on our arse a lot of the time, as they usually didn't realise we can act as rogue lites as well...</description>
