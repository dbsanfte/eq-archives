      <title>Which pet is more dps-</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=necromancertactics&amp;message.id=958#M958</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Ok, just about to ding 56.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;So, which pet will do more over all DPS? The 53 rogue, or the 56 monk?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;I do alot of indoors undead fighting, and I tank and slow, pet is usualy just DPS (or a tank for long enough to slow). So, considering, I can usualy position pet in back for BS and all, which pet will I get max DPS from?&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>Grave Pact quest.</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=necromancertactics&amp;message.id=944#M944</link>
      <description>I just purchased Prophecy of Ro tonight.&amp;nbsp; Beforehand I was looking at the quest for the Grave Pact spell, and it all seemed extremely confusing.&amp;nbsp; When I went to the zone and got the tasks it all came more clear, but I was still a little confused.&amp;nbsp; Which task should I accept, which one is the easiest?&amp;nbsp; The first one I selected was the giant ears one, thinking they were all soloable, but come to find out the hard way, some of the giants summon.&amp;nbsp; So I went back and got one for kobold paws, I killed 3 kobolds with no paws, and then ran around the zone for 30 minutes without finding one kobold, and ended up getting killed by Ragewind.&amp;nbsp; Is there one that is easy to kite solo, and the mobs are rather common, or am I going to encounter problems no matter which one I pick?&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>New Necro - Have some questions</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=necromancertactics&amp;message.id=933#M933</link>
      <description>'ello everybody, I'm a fairly new EQ player and just started a necro (currently level 11 and levelling in Kurn's Tower).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have a few questions about soloing and general necro tactics:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. What spells are must-use and which ones should I stay away from when soloing?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. I've seen the term Aggro Kiting used a lot, where can I learn how to effectively "aggro kite" and are there any other tactics I should learn (and where can I read up on how to execute them effectively)?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3. Is there any low level must-have gear that is within reach for a new player?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm having a difficult time figuring out which spells are good to use when soloing and am still using junk gear from Gloomingdeep Mines, any help would be appreciated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Newly returned Gnome seeks guidance</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=necromancertactics&amp;message.id=931#M931</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I've only just returned to the game and WOW has a lot changed. I was AFK for over a year, almost two now that I think about it.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;ANY WAY, after spending a day or two getting my UI figured, re-aquainting myself with my spells and generally being a nuisance to all I've decided to get serious and start some questing and leveling. I have a 63 necromancer. I've tried to find leveling guides that go to 70 but they seem to be rather elusive. If any of you fellow necro types have a pointer or two about leveling to 70 I'd sure apreciate it.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;As a side note to this I'm about three expansion behind. I have everything up to but NOT including DoN.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=necromancertactics&amp;message.id=923#M923</link>
      <description>Quick overview - Level 70 necro here with 83aa, I have two of three ranks in my pet feign death right now and pet hold.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yesterday something came up as a first time situation for me, but I can see it coming up many times in the future, and I'm hoping some of the more experienced necros here with pet FD can clarify for me.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I was trying to feign split some&amp;nbsp; Illasin&amp;nbsp; Fighters&amp;nbsp; (sp?) in stoneroot falls last night, and we all know how pathing can get screwy in some zones and one of the mobs warped over to me instantly.&amp;nbsp; I didnt have pet hold going at the time, so my pet engaged. &amp;nbsp; I popped a FD, then did the same with my pet.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here's where I get a little confused. &amp;nbsp; I stayed down until it said my enemies forgot about me, then stood up...&amp;nbsp; no problems.... no aggro. &amp;nbsp; I was down for a good 3 minutes or so.&amp;nbsp; I pulled my pet back up, and the next thing I know, an army of mobs is running down the hill towards me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Does pet FD take longer to clear aggro, does it give some sort of indication when your enemies have forgotten about your pet, or does aggro clear at all once your pet gets it, and then FDs? &amp;nbsp; I'm really new to the pet FD thing. &amp;nbsp; Any strats or ideas will help... thanks for your responses in advance. &amp;nbsp;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kooltapper - lvl 70 necro&lt;br&gt;E.

      <title>How to Raise Evocation?</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=necromancertactics&amp;message.id=908#M908</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Greetings dealers of death&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;i started a necro and i'm loving it!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;i've managed to fly through the levels and get to 45 in the hotspots.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;However, now that i have ignite/incinerate bones, i find my evocation sorely lacking.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Is there any way to raise the skill other than nuking a bunch of low-level undead in Unrest?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Ive been able to raise my Abjuration by chain casting the shield spells in the Healing pool in GH&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;but ive not been able to cast any of my evo spells on my pet.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Suggestions, hints, advice anyone?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=necromancertactics&amp;message.id=906#M906</link>
      <description>What is this you might ask? Well for one thing Allakhazam's won't tell you and through some research of my own over serveral posts over the years I have discovered it is right under everyone's noses at of all places Kurn's Tower. Listen and learn.........&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most people who have played Everquest are familiar with the Quest: Skull of Torture:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Skull Of Torture: LORE ITEM&lt;br&gt;Slot: NECK&lt;br&gt;AC+2 INT+5 HP+10 MANA+10 END+10 &lt;br&gt;Classes: All Classes&lt;br&gt;Races: Iksar Ogre Troll Gnome Dark Elf Barbarian Erudite Half Elf Human&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is yet an additional item that can be obtained from the Skeletal Cook which is known as:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Glowing Bone Helm: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;AC+18 WIS+7 INT+7 MR+10&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To my knowledge it is usable to the caster classes only&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When you kill the Skeletal Cook he drops a:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hollow Skull (4 Slot container)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is a scroll that one can obtain in Kurn's mentioning a new Skull/Head to be fashioned and a few items are needed in order to do this:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A Dried Tongue - Drops from a Burynai Forager.&lt;br&gt;A Dusty Sealed Canopic x2 (They are Lore so the only way to tell them apart is that you can carry both) - Also drops from the same Burynai.&lt;br&gt;A Glowing Mask - This is a very rare drop from the Skeletal Cook.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once you aquire these items, you will need to travel to The Overthere Outpost and locate Galdorn Vok Nir who can be found at p3150, p2040. Ask him "What about the dusty sealed canopic jars?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When you do this he will take your Jar I believe one at a time, open them and return to you a "Preserved Eye." Once you have both eyes, you can take them and the previous items and combine them in the Hollow Skull for the Item listed above. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It seems to me that this might certainly be a nice item to obtain with very little effort as long as you can enter the OT safely. Any further input from people who may of done this is welcome and appreciated. I definately intend to seek this item out in the near future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Hiya guys,&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Im lvl 14 and my buddy is a lvl 70 druid with 1000+ AA's.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;He is trying to PL me and we were trying to figure&amp;nbsp;out the best and fastest way for him to do it.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Our plan so far is for him to area snare, draw 4-5 in, root each one and turn on his highest DS after I tag each one for some damage.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;We were thinking of trying unrest tonight, if you have a better way please feel free to share it with us.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;THANKS,&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <title>Soloing tips?</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=necromancertactics&amp;message.id=887#M887</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Hey all, &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I've recently come back to the game and decided that the necromancer is the perfect class for me. I can only solo due to RL and so far I've been really having alot of fun with my necro and am looking foward to leveling him to 70. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;But I'm level 26 now (dinged last night :)) and I've got a few questions. Remember I'm really new. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;First here's my Magelo. &lt;A href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1315183" target=_blank&gt;http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1315183&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;All my gear on it is current. I started from scratch with no help. So this was what I was able to buy after spending some time hunting silk. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I don't want to spend anymore time hunting silk. So I'm not interested in upgrading my gear if will cost me alot of plat. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I focused mainly on mana items. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So here are my questions. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;1. I have been able to level pretty quickly using the "hot zones" I simply pull with snare, send my pet in, throw in another dot which usally agro's mob, then I melee along with my pet and throw in my lifespikes. Then I sit and med and do it again. This works really well now but I know that it won't at higher levels. So I am trying to learn the different ways to solo. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;1. Agro kiting - I can't seem to do this right. I snare mob and throw in a dot and run...... I have my pet's taunt off and then I have it attack. So it hits on mob from behind while mob is chasing me. The only problem though, is that I've read posts saying that I run way ahead of mob and then sit and med. But I can't ever run way ahead of mob. Even with my darkness snare, I can never run so far ahead of mob to be able to sit and med. So basically I run around in circles while my pet hits from behind the whole time. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I don't really ever ask for buffs. So I don't ever get sow's. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;2. Fear kiting - Ok, the only problem with FK is that my fear spell only works for a few ticks. This is pretty annoying and I really don't like to Fear Kite. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The main problem I'm seeing so far at level 26 with both types of kiting is that my pet simply doesn't do enough damage to make either type of kiting valid. My pet misses I would say at least 80% of the time on Blue mobs. This is really discouraging. Is this normal? I'm like wondering why my pet who is the same level or even a level or two above my single pulled mob misses so much in melee? I have all the buffs that I can put on him all the time. ( I dont remember the names ) spirit armour and the other pet buff that helps with melee. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;But all I keep reading is Garn misses, Garn misses, Garn misses, Garn misses. So, here I am, trying to sit and med and fearing or running around in a huge circle waiting for my pet to kill the mob and it takes like half an hour because my stupid pet takes forever to land a hit. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So, that is why I've stuck to just pulling and meleeing and nuking. I land a couple of dots and then basically lifespike or tap which ever one for my level, I forgot. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Yes, I go oom after a couple of pulls, but waiting for mana to regen is almost as fast as waiting for pet to kill mob. So right now theres not much difference. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So anyway. There's my Megelo and the tactics that I've been using. But I know that after 30, I'm going to have to change tactics and so I would like to get it down to where I can get into a groove. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So any tips or suggestions would be most welcome. Thanks. &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Ignite Bones is a level 42 Necromancer spell.&amp;nbsp; It has two effects as I understand.&amp;nbsp; It decreases mob's hit points by&amp;nbsp; @@ 500 and for a brief while turns the mob into a skeleton.&amp;nbsp; It is this skeleton thing I would like discussed.&amp;nbsp; While the mob was is skeleton form, I cast a dd undead on it.&amp;nbsp; The spell did not take saying that it can be used on only undead mobs.&amp;nbsp; Well.... duhhh....&amp;nbsp; What is the function of the undead effect if it really does not take full elements of being undead?&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>Getting into Sebillis Crypt (Guide)</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=necromancertactics&amp;message.id=878#M878</link>
      <description>I've printed this guide in numerous forms before on necro boards but&#xD;
it's been lost over and over again so I thought I would post it here in&#xD;
hopes that it might stick around.&amp;nbsp; This tactic works for getting&#xD;
through plenty of locked doors but this seems to be the easiest and&#xD;
safest to practice on because of the low level of the mobs and volume&#xD;
of them.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
First head to Sebillis and bind outside.&amp;nbsp; You might die the first&#xD;
couple of times and the run there takes quite a while otherwise.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
Running down and getting your body isn't really an issue if you know&#xD;
the way.&amp;nbsp; I used to just train down to the crypt entrance and wait&#xD;
for mobs to reset before I pulled my body off to a corner and&#xD;
looted/rezzed.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Once inside I buff up and make my pet and suspend him.&amp;nbsp; (Not&#xD;
required, but I like to have a pet on the ready to hold off a mob so I&#xD;
can posistion if need be).&amp;nbsp; Camp check and make sure no one is&#xD;
camping the Necrosis Scarab or the Sebilite Guardian so you don't train&#xD;
them.&amp;nbsp; You can make this run in 2 flops or just one depending on&#xD;
how well you know the run.&amp;nbsp; Run on with Sow if you don't have run&#xD;
5 and go down the hallway thru the door and down the corridor and&#xD;
across the area with the broken floor.&amp;nbsp; If you don't think you&#xD;
have enough HP or speed, you can have a pet up to let him take some&#xD;
agro from so mobs to buy you some time.&amp;nbsp; FD in the area past the&#xD;
broken floor but before the Necrosis Scarab.&amp;nbsp; Wait for mobs to&#xD;
reset and look in 3rd person to be sure a wandering froggy isn't&#xD;
there.&amp;nbsp; Here, you can either start pulling mobs single, or train&#xD;
down again to the door to the crypt. If this is your first time, I'd&#xD;
recommend killing your way down so you have some room to maneuver&#xD;
in.&amp;nbsp; The first pull of scarabs will bring 2, so you can root one&#xD;
and let the other come, or snare one and fd and let the other reset.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Kill your way down until you reach the entrance to the crypt.&amp;nbsp; The&#xD;
mob we are looking for is Sebilite Guardian.&amp;nbsp; Be sure to do some&#xD;
damage to the mob so you get on the summoning list.&amp;nbsp; The tactics&#xD;
are thus.&amp;nbsp; Have pet tank the mob, stacking on dots but NOT enough&#xD;
to kill the Guardian, keeping snare on the mob.&amp;nbsp; When he gets low&#xD;
on HP he'll turn to run.&amp;nbsp; At this point, I pocket my pet, or /pet&#xD;
get lost to remove him from the agro table.&amp;nbsp; the snared Golem will&#xD;
slowly walk toward the crypt and warp through the locked door.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
Once on the other side of the door, immediately root him and he'll&#xD;
summon you to him. At this point you can either tap tank him down, or&#xD;
FD once again to let him reset.&amp;nbsp; I'd recommend killing him if you&#xD;
can.&amp;nbsp; He can wander off and won't reset for some time.&amp;nbsp; You&#xD;
can even get a second person through if you FD and they are on the agro&#xD;
list, they'll get summoned next providing they did some previous damage&#xD;
and the Golem is still rooted.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Once through the door, mobs are mostly undead and it's a necro's&#xD;
paradise. Work your way down for camping all the named and loot that&#xD;
still sells decently.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Enjoy.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

      <title>Essence Emeralds revisted</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=necromancertactics&amp;message.id=875#M875</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Not sure about anyone else but seeing essence emeralds for sale in the bazaar on Fennin&amp;nbsp; is a joke and abuse of our class.&amp;nbsp; They were selling for around 800pp a piece.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;No where have I seen any other have an entire spell series left to the abuse of others.&amp;nbsp; Given that many people will not even offer themselves to be sac'd unless its an old alt they want cash for or some account they ripped off some poor bugger.&amp;nbsp; It's at the point now where I have to over bulk cash for mass sac's at a time or sac's at offers over 400pp a go.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Given that any player can summon their corpse from the netherworld to the guildhall for 194pp or thereabout perhaps it is time to off the same price for essence emeralds.&amp;nbsp; At least it will give us some use back from our spell line even at only a perc of cleric rez.&amp;nbsp; As for the 1000 mana restore spell I doubt I would even pay that for a measly 1000 mana.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I combined words of spirit and words of materials in in the Book of Dark Binding and it said something like I had fashioned an item together, but I didn't get a spell. It was my 1st try at a spell and wanted Hungry Earth. What did I do wrong? I had trained with the guildmaster and it didn't say it had failed.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
