<P>Never heard of it.&nbsp; Doesn't really surprise me unless the 1st season is already out on DVD.&nbsp; I choose not to get AFN (Armed Forces Network, the only American programing available in Germany) due to the lack of commercials (programing is provided for free by the major networks as long as there are no commercials).&nbsp; To fill the place of commercial breaks, there is all kind "useful information" that I find quite boring.&nbsp; I just watch the German programs.&nbsp; They may be a little behind what is currently on stateside, but I can deal with that and the translations are usually pretty good with good voice comparisons as well.</P>

<P>Anyway, how do you lose a room?&nbsp; <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-tongue.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0>&nbsp; And can they make a whole season of trying to find this one room?&nbsp; I think that would take as long as one commercial break&nbsp; <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-very-happy.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0></P>
