      <description>Mujaki the Devourer even in PoN is currently bugged - It has been for the last month as advised by in-game CSR.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Basicly, you zone into PoN, get the emote that you should, go ahead and kill Mujaki like needed, and the shade will not spawn - thus not allowing you to progress with your epic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's been this way for a Month now, I have petitioned various times yet in-game CSR insists that there is nothing they can do about it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pretty annoying when a quest as substantial as the paladin 1.5 has been broken for over a month, and therfore not allowing players to complete their epic 1.5 and move onwards to the 2.0 !&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Yes, I've got all the flags.&amp;nbsp; I've got the (completed) "Rithnok's Soulstone", the container version of "Drema's Soulstone", and the "A Soulstone Shard" from the Coterie Corruptor in Tenebrous Mountains.&amp;nbsp; All of these items are on me (i.e. in my inventory, not in the bank).&amp;nbsp; The Coterie shard is even stored inside the Drema's Soulstone container and nothing else is in that container, if that matters.&amp;nbsp; I've also done all the quest "conversations" up to this point, including talking with Irak Altil initially in Halls of Honor.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I got the "zone emote" the first time I zoned into PoN with all this stuff, so at least part of the quest script is recognizing that I'm ready for that part:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;[Sun Nov 26 00:52:03 2006] You have entered The Plane of Tranquility.&lt;BR&gt;[Sun Nov 26 00:53:09 2006] LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...&lt;BR&gt;[Sun Nov 26 00:54:12 2006] You have entered The Plane of Nightmares.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;[Sun Nov 26 00:54:13 2006] Mujaki the Devourer's thoughts enter your mind, 'Fool, you have defeated my corruptor, but you will not defeat me!'&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Same thing happened to me last night, sigh...&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;We killed the regular "Mujaki the Devourer" easily, but then the "Shade of Mujaki" failed ot spawn.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;A related question:&amp;nbsp; The first time I tried this event (a couple of weeks ago on Nov. 26)&amp;nbsp;I got the "zone emote" as expected when I entered the zone ("Mujaki the Devourer's thoughts enter your mind, 'Fool, you have defeated my corruptor, but you will not defeat me!'").&amp;nbsp; But we failed to kill Mujaki (we had a hard time single-pulling him, took too long, and he despawned).&amp;nbsp; When I went back to try it again a couple of weeks later, I didn't get the emote again.&amp;nbsp; (And this time we didn't get the Shade, bah.)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Am I supposed to get that "zone emote" every time I enter PoN until I complete that part of the epic 1.5 quest?&amp;nbsp; Or is that just a one-time message to give you a hint about the next quest step, which doesn't repeat after you've seen it once?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I'm trying to figure out of if getting the message or not is a clue about whether PoN recognizes that I need the "Paladin version" of the Mujaki event.&amp;nbsp; If so, I'm not going to waste time on another raid until I start seeing the message again.&amp;nbsp; If not, I'll stop trying to figure out why I'm not getting it and may go ahead and retry the event again to see if I get lucky.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;(And yes, I'm the leader of my group when I zone in, and have Drema's Soulstone (container version) in my inventory, in my first inventory slot, and have the "A Soulstone Shard" from the Coterie Corruptor sitting in it.)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;Are you sure you are doing the even correctly?&amp;nbsp; There are like four or five waves of adds that you have to kill from the East, West, and I think South gravestones.&amp;nbsp; Once they are all dead, Mujaki becomes targetable and you can kill him to get the shade to spawn.&amp;nbsp; If you don't kill the adds fast enough, they reach his platform and become untargetable.&amp;nbsp; The key is to kill them before they make it that far.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;I agree with Royr, it sounds like you're doing it incorrectly.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; There is no "single-pulling" involved in this.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; You have 3 gravestones around the stage area.&amp;nbsp; You position 3 groups, 1 near each gravestone, and you kill everything that spawns so they don't reach the stage.&amp;nbsp; Eventually, Mujaki becomes targetable, and he is standing there on the stage alone at this point.&amp;nbsp; You run and kill him, then the 2nd one spawns in the same spot.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;You can have up to 4 groups for this event.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;There is single-pulling involved if you're doing it with a limited number of people.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;We were killing the gravestone spawns, but due to lack of DPS we fell behind while trying to eliminate the waves that spawn 2 mobs each (from each gravestone), and the next wave hit before we were done with the last.&amp;nbsp; Some got by us and joined Mujaki on the stage.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;When Mujaki became targetable, we didn't want to try to offtank his companions at the same time (they become targetable and aggro-able when he does), and didn't have an enchanter, so we worked at single-pulling him away from his helpers.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The first time we attempted this we had a few deaths (due to the puller being Feared then eaten), and by the time we were done rezzing and rebuffing and medding a couple of times, and were ready for another pull attempt, he despawned.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The second time, a few weeks later, we single-pulled him successfully on first attempt, and killed him easily.&amp;nbsp; But no Shade spawned when he died.&amp;nbsp; We'll try it again tomorrow now that the devs say they've fixed it.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;I've gone ahead and checked the spawning of Mujaki and there was indeed a bug with it that in some situations the Shade wouldn't spawn. I've gone ahead and corrected the issue and it should be Live as of tomorrow.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;Okay, we tried it tonight, and it's *half* fixed...&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Here's the text of the petition update I submitted a little while ago:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;###### start of inclusion&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;Update: &amp;nbsp;Okay, good news and bad news...&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The good news is that after seeing "Zajeer-Dev"'s post on this thread ( &lt;A href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Paladin&amp;amp;message.id=5896#M5896" target=_blank&gt;http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Paladin&amp;amp;message.id=5896#M5896&lt;/A&gt; ), indicating that the devs had fixed the spawning of "Shade of Mujaki" and pushed the fix live, we repeated the event and the Shade did indeed spawn as it was supposed to. &amp;nbsp;Yay.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The bad news is that after we killed it, I got the following message when I tried to loot the quest drop from his corpse:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;[Tue Dec 12 23:57:20 2006] You are not allowed to loot the item: A Soulstone Shard.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Oookay... &amp;nbsp;We tried everything to possibly make the game happy, including camping and returning, but kept getting that message until the corpse finally rotted.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;To clarify, I *could* loot the corpse and look at the "things to be looted" window for it, but got that message when I actually tried to "pick up" the drop from the corpse. &amp;nbsp;See screenshot3.zip and screenshot4.zip&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I Googled for this message, and apparently this message occurs when the game does not believe that the looter has reached the proper stage of the epic quest yet (in order to prevent twinking, farming/selling epic drops, etc.) &amp;nbsp;However, I *am* at the proper stage of the quest, I have done all of the steps leading up to this part of the quest, I have gone through all the quest conversations (including the initial one with Irak Altil in Halls of Honor), etc.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I strongly suspect that the game code for "can you loot from the Shade" was using exactly the same flag-and-item checks as the "should the Shade spawn when the regular Mujaki dies" checks. &amp;nbsp;This would make sense, you shouldn't be able to loot from the Shade if you're not qualified to spawn the Shade. &amp;nbsp;HOWEVER, as Zajeer-Dev acknowledges in that eqforums post, the Shade-spawning checks were screwed up. &amp;nbsp;If so, it appears that the devs fixed the Shade-spawning checks, but didn't at the same time fix the Shade-looting checks accordingly.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I and a lot of other Paladins would appreciate if you could look into this for us. &amp;nbsp;It's disappointing to complete an epic kill, then not be able to physically loot the required item from it. &amp;nbsp;Thanks.&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;##### end of inclusion&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A while later I got the following reply:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;Greetings again Stumppuller!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This is GM Gargnos following up your issue. Stumppuller, as informed to you by earlier GM, there is an known issues going with this NPC and it is not working fine. Unfortunately, we be unable to assist you at this point of time. Let the issue be fixed and once done, we will be glad to resolve the issue for you. I request that you please visit EverQuest Forums at &lt;A href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq" target=_blank&gt;http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq&lt;/A&gt; for any update on the issue. I understand it would be frustrating for and do apologize for the inconvenience caused.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Thank you for your time and patience. If you encounter any other in-game issues or questions please feel free to contact us again.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Good luck and Safe travels in the world of Norrath.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;#### end of inclusion&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Umm...&amp;nbsp; Am I the only one who gets the impression that this GM didn't really read my update?&amp;nbsp; Yes, the earlier GM had informed me that there was a problem with the NPC, but that was in response to the *spawning* of the NPC, and the recent post by Zajeer-Dev (which came after that message by the GM) indicated that the problem with the NPC had been fixed.&amp;nbsp; My update to the petition involved a *new* problem with the NPC, one I doubt the GMs or devs are aware of yet...&amp;nbsp; I'm concerned that the most recent GM didn't pass on that new information to the devs, since he appears to think that I'm talking about the *old* problem (which is now fixed)...&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;Sorry for not getting to this sooner.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I've gone ahead and checked the spawning of Mujaki and there was indeed a bug with it that in some situations the Shade wouldn't spawn. I've gone ahead and corrected the issue and it should be Live as of tomorrow.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;If you have any additional issues after tomorrow (on 12/13 or later), please feel free to PM me with your character name and server, and any reproduction steps that would help in tracking down the bug.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Thanks,&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Hooray!&amp;nbsp; Thanks for taking care of this, it was pretty annoying and there wasn't a good workaround (other than trying the event repeatedly hoping to get lucky on one of the attempts).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Much appreciated.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;And if this was in response to my petition (submitted in the early hours of 12/11/06, and included links to this thread and others as support), that's amazingly fast response time too.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>Did my 1.5 about a year ago (was working then) and didn't get an emote upon me zoning in...sometimes you'll get an emote, sometimes you won't..&amp;nbsp; It's not important as long as you have the soulstone container on ya as well as the shards you have up to that point for that container.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you do and it still isn't working, then it's bugged.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Let me rephrase that so it's perfectly clear:&#xD;
&#xD;
You have to be up to this point in your 1.5 progression.&amp;nbsp; If you don't have the container AND the shard from Tenebrous Mountains, you can't progress further.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Feel free to check the BIO in my magelo for a checklist and order of progression for 1.5 ( yes, my pally's gear isn't particularly good, don't laugh :P ):&#xD;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&#xD;
&lt;div&gt;We killed the regular "Mujaki the Devourer" easily, but then the "Shade of Mujaki" failed ot spawn.&lt;/div&gt;&#xD;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&#xD;
&lt;div&gt;A related question:&amp;nbsp; The first time I tried this event (a couple of weeks ago on Nov. 26)&amp;nbsp;I got the "zone emote" as expected when I entered the zone ("Mujaki the Devourer's thoughts enter your mind, 'Fool, you have defeated my corruptor, but you will not defeat me!'").&amp;nbsp; But we failed to kill Mujaki (we had a hard time single-pulling him, took too long, and he despawned).&amp;nbsp; When I went back to try it again a couple of weeks later, I didn't get the emote again.&amp;nbsp; (And this time we didn't get the Shade, bah.)&lt;/div&gt;&#xD;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&#xD;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;font color="#cc0000"&gt;Am I supposed to get that "zone emote" every time I enter PoN until I complete that part of the epic 1.5 quest?&amp;nbsp; Or is that just a one-time message to give you a hint about the next quest step, which doesn't repeat after you've seen it once?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&#xD;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&#xD;
&lt;div&gt;I'm trying to figure out of if getting the message or not is a clue about whether PoN recognizes that I need the "Paladin version" of the Mujaki event.&amp;nbsp; If so, I'm not going to waste time on another raid until I start seeing the message again.&amp;nbsp; If not, I'll stop trying to figure out why I'm not getting it and may go ahead and retry the event again to see if I get lucky.&lt;/div&gt;&#xD;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&#xD;
&lt;div&gt;(And yes, I'm the leader of my group when I zone in, and have Drema's Soulstone (container version) in my inventory, in my first inventory slot, and have the "A Soulstone Shard" from the Coterie Corruptor sitting in it.)&lt;/div&gt;&#xD;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;One time thing.&amp;nbsp; I went into nightmare once for&amp;nbsp; a TT backflag I needed totally forgetting about Mujaki, and then never got the message again, but was still able to spawn it (back before it's now bugged state).&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;While I can't say for certain for paladin,&amp;nbsp; I know for mages we got a yellow emote text for our epic&amp;nbsp;every time we entered the appropriate zones.&amp;nbsp; I''d assume the same *should* be true&amp;nbsp; for paladins.</description>

      <description>Same thing has happened with the wizard 1.5 (I think its been longer even).&amp;nbsp; So, I wouldn't hold my breath.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
