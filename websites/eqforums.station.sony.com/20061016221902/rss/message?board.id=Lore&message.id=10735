    <title>Prexus?</title>
    <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Lore&amp;message.id=10735</link>
    <description>Does anyone know what the deal is with Prexus or what happened to the Kedge? I know he is god of the seas but he seems to be out of sight out of mind at the moment. The only time I have even heard that he had influence was during the first pact between Brell, Tunare, and Rallos. He had no dealings with Zebuxoruuk and apperently all his creations are dead other then Phinny in Kedge Keep. If anyone could shead some light on him it would be much appreciated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

Bertox made a plague that spread throughout the water and killed them all. Estrella survived and took the surname Gloomwater. I don't know what Prexus is involved with now.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wrong, actually.  As far as anyone knows, Bertoxxulous had nothing to do with the extinction of the Kedge; that was Phinigel's doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kedge life cycle was unique.  When Prexus created them, he put in place a system that put a permanent limit on their population.  When a Kedge died, its spirit entered a dormant state until a new Kedge child was conceived.  The spirit would then inhabit that child, imbuing it with all of the knowledge and memories of its spirit's former lives.  This made the Kedge incredibly intelligent and powerful, but also rendered them few in number since no truly new Kedge were ever born.  Phinigel Autropos, who was the greatest magical scholar of the Kedge (and possibly the greatest of his era regardless of race), saw this limitation as a constant sadness that inflicted what was otherwise a glorious and prosperous race.  Thus, he began a grandiose experiment that he hoped would render the Kedge capable of true procreation.  Something went wrong, however.  Nobody knows exactly what happened, but Phinigel's experiment somehow backfired, and instead of allowing for new Kedge souls to be produced, it created a massive vortex of magical energy with Phinigel at its center.  This magical force ripped the souls of every living Kedge from their bodies, and sucked them into Phinigel's.  The last Kedge was suddenly flooded with the collective memories and accumulated intelligence of his entire race. Phinigel was driven mad by both this and the realization of what he had done, and ever since has spent all of his time desperately searching for a way to reverse his mistake, but his genius had been twisted by his insanity; even if there was a way to repair the damage he had done, Phinigel simply no longer had the mental faculties to find it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, Prexus has never been a particularly active god, at least not overtly.  He may have had some sort of hand in the failure of Phinigel's experiment, but that's just speculation.  If I remember correctly, however, either Prexus himself or his avatar appeared in the game once via a GM event.  I don't recall the details, however.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Note that this comes from the EQII lore dev, so it doesn't really apply. Still it is rather interesting in its view of Prexus.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;( &lt;a href="http://eqiiforums.station.sony.com/eq2/board/message?board.id=lore&amp;message.id=10168#M10168" target=_blank&gt; From EQII &lt;&gt; )&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;br&gt;The Hold of Prexus&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meaning:  Drowned, Lost at sea &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Origin: Seafarers, Pirates&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;During the Age of Turmoil the seafarers and pirates of Norrath begin to refer to those who either drowned or last at sea as being sent to or residing in the Hold of Prexus. The Hold of Prexus is a mythical fortress of the god of oceans, Prexus. This lair is deep within the crushing dark abyss of the plane of ocean called Kexia. It is said any mortals that were either summoned or attempted to find the Hold of Prexus were never to be seen again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Blackhook the pirate king was sent to the Hold of Prexus after falling overboard during a sea storm."  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>
