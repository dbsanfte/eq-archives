    <title>Upgraded Spells for the progression server ?</title>

    <description>A while ago, I think about a year and a half, all pure casters spells were upgraded to do more damage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Necro's dots now do 3x as much damage as they did prior to the update, wizard and magician spells are also on par. Will this effect old world leveling? I don't like to say it, but I think guilds are going to be made up of all necro's to power house dragons etc. etc. The update was to put casters at par with the new gear that was given to melee's, however now since melees are going to be stuck with classic gear, and necro's and wizards are going to be dishing out increidlbe amounts of damage, what's the point of even making a melee?&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Casters are going to be ahead of the power curve this time around 1-50. Everyone is aware of this.&amp;nbsp; Unless the necro or mage pet is going to be tanking&amp;nbsp; Naggy, Vox, Cazic, Inny etc. melee classes are still going to be needed.&amp;nbsp; Melees will start to catch up a bit in Kunark and then in Velious it will get even closer. At the end of the day, raids will still be tanked by a warrior and the rogue will still be the king of dps. Just not right at the beginnning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Master Sykyth&lt;br&gt;Tarew Marr&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;There are, however, core changes to the game that will affect game play. An AoW with only Velious gear would not be quite as comparable because of many of these changes such as (1) shorter recast timers on dots/nukes (2) no hard cap on AC (3) addition class defining abilities that have been retrofitted to lower levels.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;That's not a complaint on my part. I have the impression that the encounter(s) will still be plenty challenging.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>You missed the point. Caster spells were upgraded to compete with the new gear from new expansions. Now if the progression server stands as it is, these new spell changes will hold effect in the progression server, making casters very over powered and melee's using the same old crappy old world weapons.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>It's going to be a pve problem as well, while casters are going to out level every other class with ease. Melees are going to be on countless corpse runs and casters are going to be able to single mobs with 1 dot or 2 dd's with upgraded spells. People are really going to notice it, and it will get attention once the server releases.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

People nowadays tend to require optimal group composition to go kill a moss snake, so the melees could be hurting for groups. A valid concern IMO.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I think a valid point is being made here. Necromancers have always been the most soloable class in the game, even during those times when SoE was trying hard to discourage players from soloing by nerfing classes and gear that were considered too overpowered PvE. Now that caster spells have been juiced up far beyond the old world content, it is not a stretch of the imagination to see casters soloing or duoing content that they shouldn't be at their level, even using strictly old world gear. Healing spells are juiced up, as well, so the scenario of a 60 War/60 Cler duoing dragons is even more doable now than it was way back when before the level cap on Vox/Naggy raids was put in. I can also see casters grabbing camps that should be done by groups simply because they can and cockblocking people from doing content they need to progress. &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;yeah its a very valid concern and i hope they do find a way to lessen the effect of spells to keep melee classes in a job.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Rashere&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;First, this is specifically not a classic server. We are not attempting to revert EQ back to its original state.&amp;quot; Quoted&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;At its core, what we're doing is simply locking out expansions, similar to what would happen if you didn't own them at all, until some in-game criteria has been met.&amp;quot; Quoted&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simply put the game will play exactly how it plays today but as if you didn't have those expansions enabled on your account. You will have the same mobs, same drops, same spells and same spell damage. Same quests, same guards, same factions, same zones and basically same everything that is currently on any normal server with the exception of Veeshan's Peak and a few other zones such as Paw that will be rolled-back to their former pre-revamped state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since it will be just like any normal server where it would be just as if you never bought the expansion that means you won't be able to play Iksar, Vah Shir or Frogloks at launch nor Berserkers and BeastLords.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
