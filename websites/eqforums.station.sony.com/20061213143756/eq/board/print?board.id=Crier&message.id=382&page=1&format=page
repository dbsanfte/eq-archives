				<DIV>A few years ago, the guys from Penny Arcade decided to do something nice for kids at Seattle Children's Hospital. They put a call out to the gaming community to prove that all the ills of the world are not caused by video games. To prove, in fact, that gamers are pretty decent people. They asked for donations of toys, cash, and time to give these kids a good Christmas holiday. The results were nothing short of spectacular.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The Child's Play charity has grown to include hospitals around the world. Being in a hospital over the holidays is tough on these kids and it's our chance to help spread some good cheer to them. This year there are more ways than ever to donate to Child's Play. If you're not already volunteering time, gifts, or money to a worthy cause this holiday season, why not send a little joy to the world in this way? Nothing speaks more to the spirit of the season than putting a smile on a kid's face.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Check out <A href="http://www.childsplaycharity.org/" target=_blank>Child's Play</A>, it is a great charity!&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp;</DIV>
