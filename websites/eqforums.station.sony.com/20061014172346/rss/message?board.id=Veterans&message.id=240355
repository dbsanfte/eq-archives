    <title>CASTERS CAN NO LONGER CHANNEL</title>

    <description>&lt;DIV&gt;While being hit by a mob, the chances of channeling my 18 second heal have dropped from around 90% success rate, to under 20%. It is impossible to solo anything, or survive if you get agro. The game is broken. VERY broken. Test it for yourselves and leave feedback here. &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I understand all that has been going around from both the dev and players' perpsectives on the original channeling fix but my question is, why hasn't all channeling AA been refunded to those players who had them in the reversion process of this morning's patch?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The AAs don't do anything now, correct? And there really hasn't even been an ETA given yet on the next fix which could takes ages since so many people protested various and confusing points on this subject. Judging by the patch message which I will quote again for handy reference:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;"- We've reverted the fix to channeling made with the last patch. After much discussion, our general feeling is that channeling has been broken for long enough that players have come to rely on that broken behavior as expected gameplay. For the time being, we've reverted back to that broken behavior and will address spell interrupts in general at a later date"&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;... I take "for the time being" as meaning a while until anything even comes decided first as to how to handle the next set of changes, hence rendering the channeling AAs as useless for quite a period of time when they can be better spent elsewhere for some people.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;hr&gt;Rashere wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;I posted this in another thread, but will mention it here as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We fixed a problem with channeling that was causing it to basically be backwards.  If you had no AAs, you channeled through damage 100% of the time and as you got AAs, that decreased.  It now scales like it should, and like how it worked in the past, where you start out low, channel more often as you gain channeling skill, and your AAs increase that even further.  You're going to see more interrupts than before simply because you are no longer channeling 100% of the time (or close to that if you had AAs that were decreasing it).  Your chance to channel is still really high at high levels (it caps at 90%), though, assuming you have maxed channeling skill.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One caveat to this...channeling doesn't apply to being bashed, stunned, or moving.  Even with a high channeling skill, if you get bashed, stunned, or moved too far, you're going to lose your spell.  That hasn't changed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rashere&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm a little bit confused now.&lt;br&gt;You are saying that if you have no Channeling AA's spent, you channel 100% of the time, but if you have AA's spent, you channel *less* than you did before?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So if this was changed back, can I have a reimbursement of my channeling AA, since someone who doesn't have them now gets 100% but those who have... don't?</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;I beleive they try to avoid reimbursing AAs because it casues peopel too many problems, you'll note that it was said that they would be improving those AAs to actually work. I think fixing them would be better then refunding them.</description>

&lt;P&gt;You've been channeling 100% for a while now (or a bit less than that if you had channeling AAs, which were actively reducing the chances).&amp;nbsp; That doesn't mean you don't get interrupts, though, which is why this problem didn't come to light sooner.&amp;nbsp; You can get interrupted in many other ways than straight damage...you can get bashed, stunned, kicked, or pushed too far.&amp;nbsp; Any of those will interrupt casting and have nothing to do with channeling.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;For the AAs, they're no longer reducing your chance to channel, they're just not doing anything at all now.&amp;nbsp; I haven't yanked them yet because this patch only included critical data and that's not a critical thing.&amp;nbsp; I can remove and refund them for the next patch if necessary.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;Can I just check, are you going to remove and refund these AA's with the TSS patch? I seem to recall a problem last time with refunding AA's to people who already had the maxed 30 saved that they lost the refunded AA's when zoning.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Should I ensure I camp in an zone I can gain xp in to ensure I can at least ding 71 before zoning and having more choice on what to spend my AA's on?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;But they fixed the issue of going over banked aa awhile ago. You'll have 42aa and can zone just fine when you get them refunded.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>Seems to me that Rashere knows how the mechanic goes, and I have faith that he as a designer knows when to let numbers be numbers and change them around to make the game more reasonable to play, and more fun to play a caster.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I do not think he made this unannounced gameplay-hindering code change in any other spirit than to try and improve customer experience. I sincerely hope you can rethink and implement improvements to the channeling gameplay issues before next patch. Good luck, and take care !</description>

&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;One issue that no one ever mentions and which causes interrupts even with 100% channeling is the server latency. If mash your spell button right after a stun occured, the subsequent spell will not get a channeling roll, whether you get hit or missed during the spell casting process. You can test this easily.</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;Whenever you plan on looking at this system again down the road after the revert back -- Please keep in mind that Knights cast spells for agro means and any real "tinkering" to the channeling system without thinking of the whole picture&amp;nbsp;can in fact, break and gimp a Knights tanking/agro abilities via mass interupts. Knights are up in melee damage taking damage when casting spells and when we arent able to cast spells, bad things happen like us not holding down agro and people getting summoned or the mob turning on some non-tank.&amp;nbsp;Im not trying to be rude, but after what others and myself have witnessed about this recent channeling debacle - We do not want an episiode 2 of this happening to us again please sir.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;So, this new channeling code has been on test for a few weeks and nobody noticed? What does this tell you about the test server?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Here are the statistical possibilities:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;1) The players on test are not doing thier job and reporting problems....why? who knows. (this is not a slam on Test players, just pointing out the breakdown in the system)&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;2) There are too few players on test.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;3) The players on Test are too new to have any real knowledge of the game. (Again, not a slam on Test players, just a fact of life)&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;The bottom line is...the SoE testing procedures appears to be non-functional. It's not getting the job done.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Being sneaky about adding something as critical as this change contains questionable ethics. Didn't want any preconceived notions? Would you venture to guess what my 'notions' are now? Nobody likes being hoodwinked.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;Why are multiple years old 'problems' suddenly being fixed? Taunt and&amp;nbsp;Channeling are major components of the game. Why 'fix' both systems at the same time? Tracking results of a change on 2 systems at the same time is sloppy logic. In the real world of research and development you create a stabe test envorinment and introduce one new element and see how it effects the system. Adding 2 at once is foolhardy and dangerous. You can never tell which system is doing what. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Shoddy programming. A test system that doesn't report errors. Not informing paying customers. Altering multiple critical systems at the same time. What is your marketing dept saying right now? I bet they are screaming thier heads off.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I used to dread patches and fear expansions....now I will look at everything with a critical eye and wonder what deceiptfull trick is being pulled on me.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;So, this new channeling code has been on test for a few weeks and nobody noticed? What does this tell you about the test server?&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the statistical possibilities:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;1) The players on test are not doing thier job and reporting problems....why? who knows. (this is not a slam on Test players, just pointing out the breakdown in the system)&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;2) There are too few players on test.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;3) The players on Test are too new to have any real knowledge of the game. (Again, not a slam on Test players, just a fact of life)&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;4) There is so much random accourences on Test that something critical like this is missed in the frenzy of regular play.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The channeling bug fix was on the progression server as of 6/7 for sure.&amp;nbsp; A post was made about it on those boards, and Rash responded that channeling was now working correctly, and indicated that it was a bug fix for a bug that was currently on the live servers.&amp;nbsp; A big deal wasn't made about it then, because I think the prog beta has a lot of old school players in it, and they were largely in a lower level range anyway where an interrupt doesnt mean instadeath.&amp;nbsp; I don't think anyone realized how long this bugs been around.&amp;nbsp; As a beta player I couldnt say as I've been away from the game for the entire time that the bug existed.&amp;nbsp; I knew how channeling worked and was used to the 'old' method.&amp;nbsp; When I got back I realized that channeling was working way better than it ever used to, but I figured that at some point that had been changed as a "quality of life" deal to make lower levels easier.&amp;nbsp; My main is a 64 ogre beastlord, so I'm very used to channeling thru hits with him.&amp;nbsp; I just failed to realize that my Ogre beastlord had 100% channel rate since I'd come back, because he didnt used to get interrupted much at all before. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As to whether the fix was on Test as well as Progression Beta I can't say.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is nice that they're rolling the change back, but I wouldnt expect the free ride forever.&amp;nbsp; 100% channeling is now how the game was designed originally and minimizes some of the drawbacks that are supposed to be present when playing a caster.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;/em looks around for NDA lawyers to come take him away....&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by gavving12 on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;06-16-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;06:12 AM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Just to confirm:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Has this now been changed back?&amp;nbsp; Just asking so I know whether it's worthwhile logging in.&amp;nbsp; My 70 cleric died trying to solo a green -- interrupts prevented self-healing.&amp;nbsp; So I rezzed, rebuffed, and went back -- same thing.&amp;nbsp; Eight interrupts in a row, this time.&amp;nbsp; Not worth it to log in, at this rate...&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Now, I admit that I'm a little confused on MMORPG terminology, so please bear with me.&amp;nbsp; What is the difference between pushing a change out on live "in order to evaluate it", and beta-testing?&amp;nbsp; I mean, other than the fact that I am paying for it.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;Yes, it's been changed back.&amp;nbsp; The difference between live and beta is the sheer number of players.</description>
