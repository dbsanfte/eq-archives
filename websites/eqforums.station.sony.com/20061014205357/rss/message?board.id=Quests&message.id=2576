      <description>The Old World Way to raise faction in Freeport was a two step process, and it worked well for it's time and place.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Step one... Kill Bandits in East Karana to raise faction with High Hold Keep.  That took maybe 50 to 60 kills for the most despicable toon.  If you didn't kill High Pass guards that is, in your career.  If you did, you're in for a longer haul.  Much longer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Step two... Go to the basement of High Hold Keep.  There are pickclaw goblins and they are not kos to you regardless of race or class.  You will get exp from them from 20 (grouped) to finally solo doable at lvl 35-40 depending on class.  So you can get experience here in a wide range.  You will have a scout room, a warrior room and a raider room.  Aroudn 25 mobs total.  Kill them.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They will drop goblin ears that are no trade.  They stack. Kill for a long long time.  Get roughly 250 to 300 ears.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is a named guard that startes with a B... been a long time and I don't remember his name fully.  Of the two named guards by the basement and bank, they walk a little between the two, only one takes the goblin ears.  You can test it by handing one ear.  If nothing happens, it's not the right named mob.  If you get experience and Freeport Faction, that is the right one.  Turn them in unstacked, 4 at a time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you killed Lucan only once, or of a race and class that is kos to freeport, you're looking at 300 ears.  If you killed Lucan twice or more, forget it.  Make a new non kos toon and level him, it'll go faster.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The upside of all of that... High Hold Keep has merchants and a bank right there next to the basement.  If you get into trouble, run to guards and they will save you still.  The goblins also drop bronze armor.  That sells well to the vendor, and you can bank right there.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Points of Interest:&lt;br&gt;*  Gain Experience from 20 to 45 (Raiders grant exp for a long time)&lt;br&gt;*  Bank is very close&lt;br&gt;*  Merchants are very close&lt;br&gt;*  Goblin Ears stack (But are no trade so can farm for anyone, even yourself)&lt;br&gt;*  That elsuive Freeport Militia Faction and Merchants Faction during ear turn ins gives you money too.  The higher the faction, the more the money.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hope this helps&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oberdan</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Garlaanx,  If you max ally Freeport  Militia,, go to North Ro, find the npc alond the outter castle wall, he has the same last name &amp;quot;Elsai&amp;quot; as the npc in WFP  near the book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hail him, Grats new title &amp;quot;Of The Freeport Militia&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are 2 seperate npc's , the one in WFP gives u &amp;quot;Truth Bringer&amp;quot; title if you max faction with the Knights of truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Faction was easy for me,  real simple, pick on or the other titles you choose, then kill opposing guard patrolls, ei..  I was max kos to freeport militia,, by killing  knights for 4 hours, i went to max ally, yes im still kos with pallies  but i alwayays was before, it was a fast way to max  militia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hardest part is handling 5 mobs at a time, i could  only when my damage /defense discs were up,  otherwhise wait for bad pathing.  the patrols wander in groups of 5, occasionally  1 of the npc  gets caught on an item and laggs away from the rest of the pack and was easy to single pull.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also killing guards in the hall of truth *green cons only 5-6*,, OR  militia house if your working on knights of truth faction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I started Dubious in Freeport, (my time spent in EC as a youngster helped), did the elite giants once, ran the notes through Freeport a couple of times and then went back down to S.Ro and killed caimans. And then killed more caimans, and then I killed mor.....you get the point. 60+ cycles of caimans. (15-16 per cycle). Max Ally with Truthbringer came around the 50th or so. Max Ally with Freeport Miltia was somewhere in the 60's. If you're very bored, and have NOTHING else to do, kill caimans. I'll share you the bestest and mostest great tactic (with pet class at least) for doing this&lt;span&gt;:smileyvery-happy:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Start at NPC, run North along beach and Target caimans/crocs you run past, clicking Pet Attack with each mob. ( I used Shiny Bob or DC Elite sand giant) I'd usually sit at other end of beach and wait for Bob to show up, casting DoT on any nearby caimans/crocs. If I saw Completed msg before Bob showed up, I'd Back Off pet and run back to NPC and start it all over again. It &lt;i&gt;seemed &lt;/i&gt;the more crocs you killed the faster the caimans respawned. /shrug&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Darkryft of the Freeport Militia AND Truthbringer&lt;span&gt;:smileyhappy:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;It sucks badly enough to have to go through all these faction quests to raise faction so that you can take advantage of the new expansion, but it is total crap that you have to spend HOURS killing green mobs to do it.  I'm beginning to remember why i left EQ in the first place..........&lt;/div&gt;</description>

Course along comes this expansion and all these years later I still have good faction with everyone in Freeport. Hmm, for that matter I believe I still have good faction in Kaladim, Highhold, Queynos, and ally in Rivervale (as a dark elf). All done when I could xp off the mobs, all done when everyone said there was no point in working on faction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please, in future expansions continue to make faction in old world cities relevant. It should have never stopped having meaning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;There is a much better group mission near the temple of marr. Decent xps at 70 (not great, but decent), and a nice faction hit at the end.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description> In South Ro there is an NPC called Silentblade that gives 2 missions to kil elite sandginats and their named leaders. These missions give positive faction with all Freeport factions. The elites drop similar cash loot to the ice giants in ecerfrost so you cna makle some small change while factioning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

This does not allow others a chance to even get this mission. So if only 1 person is camping giants then that line of solo faction work is out. The Caimens to a lesser extent is the same though they spawn what seems a little quicker and you can actually hail the gnome to complete and while he is running hail him with the phrase to get another mission, there fore killing caimens while he is running to freeport&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would like some other single mission quests (new ones) that would relieve some of the bottleneck. I don't mind doing the quests just don't want to do the old ones that I wore out with other alts 5 years ago. And I will say there may be quests there that I have yet to find and don't expect them to be handed to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soulfyst&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;A few group quests to consider that also give you the multi faction hits. There is a monk looking guy at the book where you zone into West Freeport. He is standing by the wall. If you are KOS he will direct you to the 2 mission givers stated above, that being the Caimen quest and the 2 Sand Giant quests that are easily done solo at level 70. After doing 6 caiman 4 Leaders and prolly 6 elites (and 1 Theater - which I will address shortly) I moved from what I assume was max KOS to Threateningly. Once I hit that I hailed the monk looking guy who now says that it looks like I can walk the streets of freeport with out fear of a knife to the throat and then gives me a list of names of other people in freeport that need a hand. Note** even though he said I was a friend enough to walk the streets I still get attacked by everyone there.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;That being said I went to find these people. Right off the bat I recognized one of the mission givers as the guy at the bar in East Freeport on the docks drinking just outside the door. When hailed he comments on Ghosts at the theater. This and the other 2 I have done to date are Group based, and populated, I assume, to the level of the group. This is a really funny mission so I will leave the details for you to work out. With that I will give you a warning. This mission is like the DoDH &amp;quot;Spies like these&amp;quot; mission where you kill every NPC in the instanced zone. And like that mission if you have any pets and I assume Servant/jester/wards up when you kill the last mob, you will fail the mission by the fact (I assume) that there will still be a NPC up. I have failed both when pets were up and turned around and done them again killing all pets before the last mob and winning. I /bug'd both but you been warned..&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The other 2 missions were in instanced zones in the Sewers.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The first was to rescue 5 Guards that are missing. First off, this took an inordinate amount of time to complete. All mobs were level 70 and it is a long crawl through the sewers. My group was elem equipped and we almost did not finish in the 6 hour time frame, I want to think the were in excess over a 100 mobs to kill to get to all the guards that were scattered over the entire Sewer Dungeon. You will need a puller/CC'r or be prepared to offtank multiples. Was a nice xp dungeon crawl of old and thank god no respawns. Loot was not worth the effort (1 item) for either the time or the mob difficulty involved) much in line with some of the DoDH arc mission quest but mid stats like the 140 HP stuff.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The second was find the source of a rat infestation in the sewers. This was a quicker (not near the amount of mobs) but was kinda hard to determine what was to be done. so **Spoiler** you kill everything as you move thru the sewers, and a random?? page (no drop) will be looted, once you loot enough pages you will get a task update (DO NOT DESTROY THE PAGES). Pretty soon you will be directed to a stench (via a hot/cold approach that didn't work to well) when you do find the room (the room east of the red area on the map) there is a man there you have to give the pages too that will spawn a rat you are suppose to follow. Point one. I suggest not following the rat if you haven't cleared the red area yet or you gonna have a lot of mobs on you. I don't belive it will break the script if you don't. (I am a monk so Fd flopped with the rat and was coth'd back after Red mob spawned so not sure if it required or not) Point 2 if your not that brave, clear the red area first before turning in the pages. Once the rat hits the red area it will walk up to a chest and release a bard (pied piper) you have to hail the bard at which point he agros and you kill, Prolly RSS trash tough and no songs, straght mellee. There were adds that I attributed to not having killed all the rats in the red area and I assume he called to his aide, not sure anything 'spawned', but know we got rat adds. You loot a flute then take that back to the quest giver to complete. 1 loot was also on the bard with the same stats as the 2 missions above (DoDH normal mission chest loots 140 hp range) though both sewer loots were chain arms. Theater mision was some leather pants.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Summary. It did not seem that the reward &amp;quot;Faction&amp;quot; was worth the effort that the 2 sewer trials took to complete (still threatening after the missions thus still KoS) Had I Shrouded down and got the missions so it was green like Caimens (not sure this would work mind you like it did with the holloween mask quest) might have been more apropriaate for the faction recieved. XP wise I leveled my new PoR quest cloak up to level 2 on the 2 sewer missions and recieved 6 or 7 AA's from all the kill's (about 10 hours worth mind you) While the first time thru the sewers was ok but tedious the second time would have been worse other than everyone trying to figure out what to do or where to go (to the point we almost didn't finish when we hadn't even gotten the first update after clearing half the zone and people were wanting to drop it knowing there wouldn't be much of a reward and them not being KoS anyway)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I am hoping that there are different quest and all not sewers hehe. Also I am assuming that being an Iksar that took joy in killing softskin guards for the past 5 years that I was max KOS when I started and if I was that, then the Caimen/Sand Giant quests give the same Faction hits that these much harder quests give. I /bug'd this and hope it atleast gets looked at to insure the faction scales with the difficulty. Otherwise I will get 2 AFK people to shroud down get the mission unshroud and run it solo so as not to waste others time.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But over all they were interesting to do and the theater one was very funny, well to me anyway heheh. Hope this helps.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Soulfyst&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did the next Group faction quest in West Freeport called Drachnid Spies.. And first off, this is the best quest I have ever done. Whoever desinged this encounter &amp;lt;golf clap&amp;gt; great job.  I will not go into any details but to say this one is even funnier than the Rock Show in the theater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note wise it was a wave mission and you better have a way to CC, we had a really good Nec that would kite one while rest of the casters would med up. the waves were .... well ... exciting to live thru hehehe. Xp was ok, Loot was same as other 120HP 1hb for intcasters. Took a couple hours to complete but everyone commented on how fun it was. Faction was ...well I was still threateningly KoS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am lookin forward to the last one from Sorin the Sorceror tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soulfyst&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Omg. I don't mean to make anyone here feel bad, but sheesh, people whining that 7 completed tasks don't raise a faction they've killed in the past?? Do any of you recall at all raising faction for Velious armor quests? Or am I talking to the toned down easy conetent wishthiswaswow people?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Factions have always had consequences, and I for one am glad to be seeing faction being important once again in the game.Sure, i am going to have to work hard with my paladin to raise mine. But guess what? I personally don't want game content all handed to me on a silver platter. I killed my faction on Soulfire many years ago, and now I need to rebuild it...so be it. Work on raising your faction, or don't. It is up to you. But quit your &amp;quot;make this easier for me&amp;quot; whining. The game has already been toned down, noobed up, etc. I know, lets all just cry long enough and we can eventually call it WoW2.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
