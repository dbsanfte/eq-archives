    <title>EQ2 PvP</title>

    <description>Eq2 is releasing 2 US pvp servers, if you want pvp, this is where it's going to be SUPPORTED and Balenced as well as continiously developed. Leave everquest 1, because SoE is just going to dump it soon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why you ask? Because they just revamped the whole everquest 2 class system. You can now pick your class when you create your charecter, also it's alot more funner, easier tradeskills, and easier leveling. Great new system, feels like old eq 1.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Try it out for yourself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>not all of us have the super computer it takes to run eq2 eather, if i did i might be playing it. Im a starving college student. I think if they redid the eq1 pvp, and made it up to date with the other MMO's systems, eq1 would be alot more popular then eq2, because there is alot of people in the same boat as me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>actually, not just more popular then eq2, it would probably be one of the most popular MMO's out there. It already has great pve content, now just needs some tweeks on the pvp system. And BAM! all these people who love the content of eq but left for various reasons will come back for the pvp, and bam, all those people who can't run the graphic **SMURF** games will come to eq and love it. And all these people will tell their friends, cause when i find a good game, i know i do! i want them on with me, makes it all the more fun! seems to me EQ is only missing the pvp to be the whole package. Not to mention with the graphics upgrade that game DOES NOT look bad at all. and us lower end computer gamers can just turn all that stuff off, and be just as content. IMMA START THE REVOLUTION! if we get some good **SMURF** pvp going.....i think this game will surpass wow!&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>i'd even be willing to buy ANOTHER expansion, if it was dealing with the pvp, and making it work how it should. Maybe a Frontier lands, taking a page for DAOC, with castles to take over, and benefits for taking those castles. NO NEGATIVES IN PVP! u should only be able to be rewarded for pvping, not losing stuff for dying or what not. Some kind of point system u get for kills, every 10 kills u get on Kill token, and with these tokens u can buy all kinds of stuff from pvp venders or what not, maybe new spells, new stuff for tradeskills, armors, weapons. This being ONTOP of your entire guild getting + atributes for holding the most keeps, or maybe even 1 keep, depending on the situation. plus u could make it so whoever owns certain keeps has access to something like a special dungeon that is full of rare beasts, and rare drops. The ideas are endless, there is no reason for PvP in MMO's to suck, considering they are the closest thing to real life there is, not other game type has manage to get as close as an MMO. Look at us in real life, we have tons of reasons to fight! I want to PvP my neighbor right now for letting his dog crap on my yard. it should not be to hard to replicate. Give us yards, and disrespectfull owners of dogs, and we will be PVPing in no time!&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>one more thought. Certain highlevel zones that have great monsters in them and great drops, that u can only get into if u have a certain pvp rank! here is the senario: Im running by, and see this guy owning everyone/thing in his path, and im like &amp;quot;yo, where did u get that awesome blade at&amp;quot; and he is like &amp;quot;Dude yea, it drops off this monster in whatever land, im phyked about it, loving this weapon alot!&amp;quot; then u are thinking, dang.....i want me one of those, but the land he mentioned has a pvp rank req to get into :( fine, i will just have to pvp, ITS WORTH IT.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;sorry for posting a ton of times, i just get worked up over this stuff, i see PVPing in MMO's as one of the most important things an MMO can do right, and it seems pretty easy to do as well. EQ has taken care of the PVE, now just needs the PVP, they could do it so easily too. If PVP starts getting taken seriously and they fix/redo it, i will be playing this game for years to come, along with many, many, MANY other people who leave EQ mainly for that reason, u can only do PVE so much before your tired of it, then the game has nothing else to offer u, but with pvp it would.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>I wish they would spend the time and effort to make PvP in EQ as great as it could be... PvP is the only reason i PLay EQ anymore... beating mindless mobs gets old real fast...</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;having played eq2 briefly, i can say that it feels nothing at all like eq1, but thanks for the propaganda!Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for pvp, i'd love for pvp to be properly implimented in eq1, but i'd almost be willing to bet it will fail just as miserably in eq2.... a healthy pvp environment can not be sustained in a game primarily developed to support a pve method of play, and eq2 is still very much pve centric.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
