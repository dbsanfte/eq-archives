				<div></div><p>The only no-fail combinations I'm aware of are like the spider silk combines to swatches (and the no skill combines like final dodh augs)...  To the best of my information, there is a 5% risk of failure in doing even the most trivial combines unless that has changed recently.  If there is no risk in turning the mds into metal bars in the first place (and GDH into GM swatches), then all of the numbers are slightly overstated.  The advantage of being a non-expert statistician on this board (looks around quickly for a real expert) is that given the sample sizes on success/failure, I sincerely doubt anyone will be able to empirically verify my calculations one way or another - especially as I don't think the RNG characteristics in EQ are well known (i.e. anyone other than the devs know what is the resulting distribution curve from the in game RNG they are using? I know I sure don't.)</p><p>If you think my calculations are worth repeating on eqtraders or elsewhere, anyone reading this thread very much has my permission to repost it, verify it, ridicule it, etcetera.   If you'd like to review my work, send me a private message with your email address and I can forward you the excel file.  I will say the nastiest part of this problem is getting the salvage results correctly ... and I simply used a brute force (iterative) approach.  In other words, I assumed each piece recovered was immediately sent back to be recombined again.</p><p>I will also admit the problem I'm solving may not be the one everyone is interested in ... If you want to know how many MDS scales you will expend before the first success whereupon you stop, swearing that you will never try this combine again, that's actually a different probability distribution/problem then the one I was modelling.  The question I asked was given a large number of MDS/GDH, how many pieces of armor should, on average, be produced.  I then expressed my result as a ratio in expected scales/piece of armor or aug.  On the other hand, if this is a one time combine, the question remains why you bothered farming the books and didn't just find a friendly tradeskiller remains open ... ;-7</p>
