				<DIV>I commend Sony for having the Summer Festival, its a great idea.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>However, I would like to say that I much prefer having mostly scheduled events spread throughout the day...so you can plan your day and still have some unique fun.&nbsp; Dynamic events are fun, but not when you wait around hoping for one (to take the place of the normal morning events that&nbsp;were cancelled), only to find nothing seems to happen until after lunchtime is over for the west coast.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I would also like to see less of the speed-rush-to-kill events (scavenger hunts).&nbsp; Speed rushing to kill mobs before someone else&nbsp;is something that is expected on regular servers, but something&nbsp;I have come to not expect on the premium server - and one of the reasons I pay the premium price.&nbsp; 4/5 of the first events have been of this type.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Overall it is interesting and exciting, just had some&nbsp;feedback I wanted to pass along.</DIV>
