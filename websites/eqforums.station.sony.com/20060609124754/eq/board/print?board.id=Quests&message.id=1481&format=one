				<DIV>
<DIV>City Zones:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Cabilis:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>1. Brood of Kotiz-the iksar bandits are too spread out and take way too long to collectively kill off. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Sugestion- add a +Brood of Kotiz modifier to the goblins in the zone as well.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Grobb:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>1. Dark Ones-This one is&nbsp; impossible to raise for goods, since the only quest availible requires high indifferently. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>2. Shadowknights of Night Keep, again the most efficient way is blocked because of the high indifferent faction needed for goods. While not impossible, it requires ogre killing which in turn is somewhat too strong of a trade off. This is again true if you are evil as well. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Oggok:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>1. Shamans of War- the same &nbsp;deal, there is no way outside of being able to raise this faction even with an illusion potion depending on your religion it only goes as high as threateningly for good alignment.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Riverveil</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>1. Clerics of Mischief-The only quests require a high indifferent faction, which is next to impossible to raise thanks to religion</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
<DIV>Suggestions::</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>1. A citizenry quest that is progressionary towards becomming ally with all factions with the zone. By completing the zone's tasks, you gain a title such as "of Grobb" or apply for&nbsp;membership to a guild within the city for a specific title. such as Greenblood X or Dark One X and ect. Or a combination like:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Scaled Mystic&nbsp;Vjik of Cabilis</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>For races that have "bad" relationships with other races, especially the iksar, they could go on a special quest to fully "understand" what it means to be a certain race through a quest and thus be seen as one of "them" upon completion. Or otherwise an AA that gives a faction modifier to counter act race. But have illusion items and enchanter's faction modifier spells workible on these task masters to be able to skip certain tasks to be able to work faster along. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Different races for different things, such as the Paladins of Marr would look at a dark elf "redeeming" their soul or the iksar merely serving the mighty New Sebilisian Empire. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>This would be extremely usefull to adding in new quests and bridging expansions to older cities. Also, it gives a reason for people to go back to the old world cities more. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>2. A deity conversion quest- Just as it sounds, add in a way to convert to another faith or to agnosticism. Over the years some players have "converted" over to joining along with other faiths in collective goals and so forth. Also, multiple NPC's like the members of the Wayfayer's Brotherhood have abandoned the original doctrines of their faiths in order to work with peoples they are supposed to be enemies with. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I believe it should be something difficult, but not something rediculously impossible either. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>3. An evil race illusion quest for all/all, similar to the Crown of Deceit. Preferibly troll.</DIV></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Non City Zones:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Plane of Air- The faction there is impossible to raise period, if there is a way it is next to </DIV>
<DIV>impossible.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Suggestion: Make the mobs beta neutral faction or add faction hits to mobs within the zone. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Tunarian Court- This faction is again impossible to raise, while it does have quests to help raise it. Yet if you go KoS, you're basically screwed. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Suggestion: To Plane of Hate add a +Tunarian Court faction modifier and perhaps 1 or 2 quests in Felwithe. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Faerie-This is a faction that is impossible to raise period. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Suggestion-Add a +Faerie modifier to orcs&nbsp;and goblins. I stress goblins as well, because some of us like having the Indigo Brotherhood faction as part of being a "neutral" character.</DIV></DIV>
