      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was told,and have even read about it on these boards at some point,that Total Domination was disabled in a nerf to tone down enchanters ability to charm.Is there a way to find out if this is in fact true? If so can we push to have it reinstated or for a refund to the AA's spent on the ability?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for the charisma issue,if charisma does indeed have a significant impact on mezz and charm,then why not push for an overcap to charisma with our charisma buffs?I believe Overwhelming Slendour was our last at lvl 56 with a 50 point boost - why not make a lvl 60+ version(say 65) with a +75 to charisma,50 point overcap? This brings us to a max of 415 on charisma at the expense of a spell slot,and this is also considering the enchanter is maxed on charisma to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a side note,I have seen several referances to possible augmentations that may be used to help boost our mezz,charm,stun,effectiveness,by increasing their duration,lowering recast times,lowering mana consumption,whatever - and something I believe needs be added to this is the ability to have these augs able to be placed in either &amp;quot;any&amp;quot; slot or the type 4 normally used for weapon procs.I managed to get my 2.0 today,and was at a loss as to what I should place in the type 4 slot,and although I recieved several ideas from fellow guildies,they almost all revolved around semi weak hp/mana augs that didnt provide any significant boost to the item.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Melee have an enourmous variety of augs to choose from that are all placed in slot 4,yet casters have to actually rely on those very same augs unless they have completed a quest such as the BiC aug.Casters dont survive long in combat on mobs that hit for 4k - so its kinda silly for our primaries to have weapon procs unless we depend on that item to solo weak mobs with.Focus effect augs,augs that provide a boost to hp/mana,augs that provide regen abilities,are the types of augs we need for our slot 4,or &amp;quot;any&amp;quot; slot such as the BiC.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Total Domination wasn't changed, they just removed the 50 point resist adjustment to CoD and changed it to 10...which was/is a significant factor in charm duration (almost 2 mins in average duration)&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Just did the King event in Riftseekers,and the resists on that are somethign to be looked at.The ferans are roughly 71-72,and quite often I was recieving mezz resists after tash.One mob resisted mezz a total of 7 times after tash between 2 different chanters on raid.We won event,I managed to nab Kiranus' Tiara,but still the resist issue bites me in the butt.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Overcap on our mind buffs is something to address I fully agree.I think its kinda silly to see myself raid buffed with 450 on strength and dex,yet capped at 415 on Intel and Wis.The change may be minor for the added mana increase,but extra mana is never a bad thing.</description>

      <description>I think we should definately push for the overcap on intelligence/wisdom, I think its something we can win easily so will use very little of our political capita in this fight, its not really a significant amount of mana...but worthwhile imo to seperate our lines from the potion lines.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>I agree that overcap on Clairvoyance (Probably 20pts - rather than the whole 32, in line with the shaman Fortitude buff) should be an easy sell that will make us look good anyway.  And there's really no reason we shouldn't have it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>There's no reason we cant have the full 32. The mana per int/wis is pretty trivial, but honestly to me, it's the principle, and a glaring example of the lack of thought put into chanters. No devs thought of it before, or couldnt be bothered implementing it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I agree Lupinus,that odd lvl 74 mob popping up on a dod mission is a deal breaker when adds come a runnin.All GoD content,not Qvic alone,has high spots and low spots for resists.Tacvi trash mobs are WAY overdone on their resists,and some of the named are flat out rediculous at times when trying to land a spell of any type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I dont have too many bad things to say so far about DoD,my experiance there isnt that great and im still learning those zones,but the odd lvl 74 mob on the instances is a shock when trying to CC.I had 2 come into camp and both were immune to mezz,so in casting mezz I managed to grab aggro on one and stood there rune tanking it after a quick desolate deeds,until SK polished off the first - yes the druid back up healer was healing me but i never went below 50% hp while using all the tools at my disposal.I was familiar with this mission and was prepared for those mobs though and that was only thing that kept me alive - an unprepared chanter would have been so much Arcane Paste on the floor like I was the first time it happened.Overall im not unhappy with the content of DoD or the mobs/resists,and I think SOE needs to look at the success of this expansion and reflect back on ones like GoD and OoW so they can hopefully readjust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently my guild did Matriarch Shyra for the 4th time,this time with 42 people anguish/tacvi geared.We had a slow start trying to split adds away from Shyra,and during the course of this fight the room started to repop - within a few moments we had 8 adds,7 of which were locked down quickly with mezz and one charmed(haha yes for some crappy dps because a necro dotted it),and those mobs offered only a few resists when mezzing.Of course the average level add was 70,with only 2 yellow cons,but still the speed in which we managed to lock them down showed me someone in design has somewhat bent an ear to our complaints.I am hoping this will follow true on future expansions and possibly back again to the older ones.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Badly missing tool to make mobs forget us, sorta blur, and likewise, badly need tools to be able to park a mob if we can't mezz them. Hmm, wait. we have blur line and root line already.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If we talking about raid zone where stuff is hard to cc, let's talk about txevu if you want. But let's remain serious, qvic turned easy as soon as oow went live and we got felicity. On the other hand, chants who experienced it at lvl 65 perfectly know what off rooting and using proper hot keys mean. Maybe you could look first what you are doing wrong before bringing the conclusion that enchanter class need a fix because of such a situation.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;As for the rest, i already posted my feelings toward charm fix. I fear it will be a complete tune hence affect the old charm (CoD basically), which is prolly the spell i used the most (yes, our mezz spells changed) with tashania.  Anyway, since the vast majority is pleading for a change, np. Just not quite sure if this will be as efficient as they wish it could be.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Extra mana regen (if aura serves this purpose right) will not hurt for sure. The pet buff clicking idea is pretty nice as well. DPS wise, i think colored chaos should be pushed to 1800 base (we mostly have stuff mitigating slow &amp;amp; co nowadays so no reason to be that penalized because of the slow). We would catch back a bit in that department while remaining still way behind most nuke classes (something that would be easy to implement since it does not involve implementing a new spell).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Aa wise, i m sticking with the non kos illusion form (part of dopple line, bascially like FM without invisi and with a short duration), one charm immune group aa (working the same as for warcry more or less, reason being that i can't really accept the idea of being charmed myself as it happens during a few scripts now).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm not really having issues with mez so much anymore, altho I still feel that mezzes should be softcapped. I've completed my DoD spell arcs and a few other missions, most on hard, and have rather few mez resists, and even on those resists I survive more often than not now between dodging, Boggle, and Rune of Shadows. If, early in a mission, I notice issues with mez resists, I pull out Greater Fetter to improve my chances of keeping things under control. My 66 pet also serves regularly to offtank just long enough to give me a moment more time to get things in check or pull an add off of another caster (I keep him up and only use him to OT with in a problem pull, which will usually involve root anyways, otherwise he's dps and buffers will often buff him. Pet Affinity goes a long way in this). My only major issue with all of it has been that I'm still riding Forlorn... I could really use Desolate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have noticed, though, that I get mobs sometimes who are fairly easy to mez, but resist MR nukes and cripple. I sometimes think something has changed on the back end to make mezzing... specifically... a little easier in recent content, but not a global reduction in MR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mind buffs after KEI should overcap INT/WIS. I'd like to see them include a spell haste component too, or perhaps some spell haste in an aura, but that's just me. Our nukes need to be just a tad more competitive, and/or our dots need to be made at all competitive. Hooray for increased mana regen, I hardly ever even use charm anymore so whatever happens happens (and if it goes well I'll be happy about it), and we won't get FM so I still propose Advanced Spellcasting Subtlety for less aggro on all our spells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, while we still need work, I think some people have an issue with wanting to keep a single line of spells up all or most of the time. I've had to learn to be versatile again, and I do pretty well. My next step is to max Enhanced Forgetfulness and see if I can use memblur effectively during CC to further improve my survivability. I already mez, slow, debuff, nuke, buff, root, Mana Flare, NDT, and manage my pet, all as the situation calls for, with a comfortable degree of success... I honestly have less to complain about as far as versatility in groups than I used to. It just takes practice and patience. Raids, however, I cannot speak for at all since I almost never raid.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I'm pretty hopeful that the new spells with Prophecy of Ro will help with the &amp;quot;Resist, stun, interrupt, death.&amp;quot; on one add issues.  (I still get them from time to time and they tick me off. Though mine are more like &amp;quot;Resist, interrupt, Resist,  Rune of Shadows, Potion, tash, interrupt, death.&amp;quot; =P (That's pretty much the exact sequence of events I got on a single add in 69.4 Hard the other day.  Admittedly, the cleric was a bot, so I got no heals, but I really, really shouldn't need twitch healing for one add.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If they continue to serve us tasty content ala DoDh,  and give us a bit of spit and polish, we'll be doing okay until they can fix charm. =P&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I suggested a while back an inherent mana regen for the chanter class alone based on their level.1 point of mana regen for every 10 levels capping at 7 points for lvl 70.Inherent,not a spell,not an aa.Melee classes have damage mitigation,certain races have inate abilities,rangers die horribly,chanters should get a self only mana regen based on their level,not a spell that takes an additional buff slot.If the damage cap of melee classes can scale with their levels,then this also should not be a problem for the coding.</description>

      <description>Aura's per my interview with Rashere on Casters Realm (under editorials left hand side) don't take up a buff slot and appear in the Auras window (new UI piece).&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>What I really want.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sunday, some DoD hard mission. 2 mezz resists on an add = wipe.&lt;br&gt;Last night, Qvic (for crying out loud), 2 adds in camp. 4 mezz resists = wipe. 4....&lt;br&gt;etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I want that to stop being my normal night of play. I'm sick of it, fed up with it. It is embarassing, wiping groups due to strings of resists. I can not do my job. Only a madman would rely on mezz as CC. Pulling CC, sure. Mezz CC is a group wiper in hard content. The same content pulling CC has no problem in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What the smurf does sony have against mezz? Pulling CC will always be more reliable and mezz will always be backup, so why cant it at least be reliable backup.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;/rant off&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sorry, I just had to vent. It's gone way beyond ridiculous into insulting. I want to know if there is light at the end of the dark tunnel, coz I'm running out of reasons to log on my chanter anymore&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agree and disagree in a group sense . And that's the hard bit as every one has a different experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I live from a three to four add with mez at around 40% of the time with channelling and mitigation and a good team . Remove any of them or add another mob bang smash bye bye after about three minutes as a resist gets me out of the mezz rotation sufficiently that the next wakes and has me for tea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raids commonly die on mez's, tacvi the snake with the rocks add at 30%, and almost always due to someone not following instructions rather than an inability to do the job. That's my raids fault not SOE's.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You seem to have missed a big response on raid desirability which is in some ways a superset of group desirability . That's the buffing part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However on the fun part it's not related. Group desirability is fun , mez for me charm for a mate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Groups&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For charm it's a mix of Risk vs Reward and while Risk v Reward comes into mezz survivability it's really, in my view, a different skill. While both are riding the edge of destruction while adding utility the mind set is completely different, viz druids with the much vaunted switch between healer vs DPS. With us it's a similar switch between adding large DPS vs Party wipe or controlling a large &amp;gt; but != 3 add population with a survivability &amp;gt;= 60% . So the tools and the twitch are different and the requirements are slightly different. That's the rub in grouping as catering to both requires some lateral thinking, and until a Dev speaks to a wide subset of chanters from both camps separately it ain't going to happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raids&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;----------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raid desirability isn't going to be charm often, except where the script  demands, and likewise mez. A combo buff would be great , ie haste, C , god and a over wis/into and a over (Under ??) resist reduction as god is useless as such.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mana flare is somewhere there by adding to the DPS  /  survivability but I am not a wanna be Wizzie or a wanna be SK. I'm unique. The viral mez is sorta there but no modern raid leader is going to trust mez except where the script demands it . So an old idea of making mobs randomly demand charming or mezzability would be the go imho. Eg Ingenuity MPG trial the blue dragorns are charmable to add DPS but what if randomly , truly randomly , it was a sleep Emma or charm Emma and it switched between the red colors and the blues or the chanter had to channel something to the warrior to get the DPS. I  live on unpredictability and apart from Vish and to an extent Yar'Lir it's not their . Anguish , apart from OMM, is yawn etc etc etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My 2cp and if someone sat Unmei, Yakk and LordTed in a room with a Dev and made one raid, one group mez and one group charm with Nanyea as mod / contributor nothing will happen.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>The problem with this is, unless your algorithm has better kung-fu than I expect, it's going to run into all kinds of problems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For example, it's -easy- to have a discussion about enchanter survivability without actually using the exact term &amp;quot;survivability.&amp;quot;  It's -much- harder to do that with regard to charm.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Similarly, there are probably a number of posts that say &amp;quot;charm is fine&amp;quot; or just explaining the charm nerf, or whatever, which don't really have anything to do with what we want.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's interesting, but it's really just a toy, IMHO.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>first run I used ALOT of broad terms (almost 100 of them) then second run I coded by hand... reading each and every post that I had printed out and highlighted&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
