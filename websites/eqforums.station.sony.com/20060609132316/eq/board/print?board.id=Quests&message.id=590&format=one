				<DIV>Task is called Drolvargs and Drachnids, I received it as a 53 cleric, It is a long quest, I've pretty much completed it, and am on the second to last step. It asks me to explore the ruins in the center of the forest of the firiona vie zone. I have explored every set of ruins in the zone at least twice, and some three times. I had a similar problem with a task involving Karnor's Castle, but I can't remember the name of it. Just wanted to ask if anyone else is having a problem getting the confirmation that you've explored the spot in firiona vie zone. Hopefully when i log in tomorrow it will let it confirm but if it doesn't that's alot of work, these long tasks do take a long time when your doing them solo, to just abandon since it won't complete.</DIV>
