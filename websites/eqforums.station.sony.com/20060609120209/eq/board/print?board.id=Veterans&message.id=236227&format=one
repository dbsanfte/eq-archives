<DIV>One question regarding encounter design: do you tend to design a mob's abilities (and the other challenges of the event) with a particular solution in mind, or do you say "Let's give this mob a 3k dd, hatelist-based shadowstep, and adds that proc an aggro reducer, and see what the players figure out?"</DIV><BR>

<P>Depends on the encounter. Some of the encounters&nbsp;I start with an outline of what we want it to do (how difficult it would be, how much HP/AC it has) and then I try and figure out how to make the encounter interesting. Sometimes though, the idea of what the encounter is about comes first, and then I fill in the blanks on how much HP/AC it has, what spells, etc. A good example of this is when I wrote up the Suchun raid. The main idea in my head was to make the encounter based on keeping your mana/endurance above a certain point, and if you didn't, you die. I then worked around that idea and made it into a 3 wave event, with portals/adds, mini-bosses, and a final boss at the end. I then expanded upon that event during testing, when players said "hey, it would be cool to add this" and in some situations I added it.</P>
<P>Feedback during the beta process can be really cool if you get a good guild to test - a guild that wants to test and make sure everything is correct. I rely a lot on player ideas for a lot of varied things on events. Some of you guys that have tested with me on beta know - I'm pretty open about making an event more fun (as well as killing players in the process).<BR></P>
