      <title>GoM/AH issue</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Shaman&amp;message.id=5578#M5578</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;Not sure if there is a post around pertaining to this or not.I took a break in the summer and came back late fall from playing.When I left I had already attained max Gift of Mana and liked it.So when I came back I was surprised to find that it no longer worked the same way and that now I have abundant healing complete I been seeing some issues.I now only keep 1 spell memmed in a grp situtation that it can proc on and now only see GoM go off maybe once an hr if I'm lucky or if I'm rebuffing a grp and do grp regen(seems to go off on this spell 2 out of 3 times) and have NEVER seen abundant healing go off in the 2+mnths I've had the ability.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; Is this issue being looked at? Am I just having bad luck with it or just plain crazy? Seems like a waste of alot of AAs to spend and not get anything out of it.Compareable to farming pp for weeks to make breadcrumb trails around PoK,just to say you've done it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; If this has been discussed and is under a title not associated could someone link it /direct me to it.And has there been any discussion of refund of either/or and possibly both sets of AA points and letting us decide which we want more if they conflict?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; Wailin Ondem of Povar&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>
