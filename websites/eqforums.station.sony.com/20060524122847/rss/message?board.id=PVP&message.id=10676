      <description>Before you go and say "you got ninja looted", let me say this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have no petition about your ninja looting frinds Crazycloud, or yourself for that matter. And training was illegal but you still did it to us didn't you Crazycloud? In Qvic? So what does it matter if it is legal or not to YOU? You do it anyways.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What i have posted, is that i petitioned about training, and the first GM respond saying it was fine, I should have been prepared for situations. Then i petitioned again, asked for response from another GM other then the first one. This response I got, said if i have a problem i should email them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I emailed them, they said GM decisions are final and will never be reversed even if it was wrong. And that if a GM made a call, then it is the correct decision.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So what does that tell us? GMs are always right even if they are wrong, since the decision is made already.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And to the first reply, Kirban, I was not talking about ninja looted. I was talking about how GM covering each other's back. And the experiences I have was exactly about training.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;bla bla bla says &#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Ok&amp;nbsp; Sony so ninja looting isnt illegal. But I will tell you what is illegal. Warping yes warping. Our entire qvic raid we had Hate(Crazycloud,Midian,Harryfoot) zoning into qvic from kt acquiring targets from the zone in and warping up to the corpses then warping away. Is that legal? They are targeting a corpse all the way across a zone and warping to in in half a second.So where is this pvp soulution? Only solution is to run hacks also to combat them. Is this what CS want? If so just let the server know. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If you not gonna do anythign about ninja looting (which i see as harrasment) then atleast do somethign about the blantant use of hacks and 3rd party software.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Again Midian,Crazycloud,Harryfoot all running warp hacks to attempt to ninja loot corpse's.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;1) we didnt use Hacks 2) i got a video of Defiant Warp chaining on me and ill post it soon as i can get a host to post it on a site.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;PS: i didnt zone in through KT side once and how would you know there crosstargeting things? you must do the same?&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>I hack now?  Thats typical, gotta cry and moan about something I suppose.  Since ninja looting is legal, lets make up hacking stories, you guys are good at that!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Actually I just camped on and off every few minutes to see how you guys were progressing (guild can vouche for me heh, I logged on my alt), camped in a spot so i can just F7 to get someone on target and /assist them.  Once mob was dead I ran behind the wall and looted your items.  No hacks involved, unlike your guild who had rangers, chanters, etc popping all over me as I ran around Qvic.  Then when they got agroed they just disappeared.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have an idea, next time lets have a GM come and watch.  I'll bet anything at least 10 Defiant get banned and I don't even get a warning.  You guys are the most blatant warpers/hackers I've ever seen.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Our little guild isn't going anywhere buddy.&amp;nbsp; However, we won't stoop to Hates level.&amp;nbsp; Trash, Trash, Trash.&amp;nbsp; You ninja looted one muramite boot mold.&amp;nbsp; That's not hard for a bard with DA song and Fade to do.&amp;nbsp; Good Job, you got to&amp;nbsp; us, once!&amp;nbsp; Fool us&amp;nbsp; once, shame on us, fool us twice, NOT LIKELY!&amp;nbsp; If y'all do run all the other highend guilds offf the server, what will you do then? PvP yourselves?&amp;nbsp; Hypothetical question of course.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Defiant is here to stay, your trashy actions won't scare us or make us cry mommy, sorry! Try a new tactic and learn how to pvp without the use of trains, hacking, and hiding.&amp;nbsp; I think you saw by the pvp in RS, we're adjusting to that.&amp;nbsp; Grow up and play like big girls and boys or get off the porch.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

I have emailed there a few times and everytime they told me your GMs never do anything wrong, and if they ever do, the decisions are not reversable, so I should just accept and shut up.&#xD;
So far I have concluded if you want to break any rule, go ahead. Because there is no rule. Ninja loot? Well there could pvp you, so no souch thing. Train? Why, they could pvp you, like you know. rooted you even thou you are DA'ed. So, that's not illegal either. They were sexually harrasing you in tells? Well gee, pvp them. Done.&#xD;

&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Taking things to the extreme alittle bit aren't we?  So the GMs made the decision to make NiNjaing legal on SZ.  Does that mean that its legal to train and sexually harrass?   Probably not, but until you can show a post where a gm said it was legal to do those then please don't use those as an example.  =)&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;ninja looting was deemed legal.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;training was deemed illegal.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If training was legal also, your little guild would have movelogged off by now.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
