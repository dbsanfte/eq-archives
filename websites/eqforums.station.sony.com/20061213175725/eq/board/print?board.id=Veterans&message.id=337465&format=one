</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>Going beyond inane forced grouping, how about actually giving something for us to do group wise if you actually want us doing it. We haven't had real raider group content since gates and we all know&nbsp;how well that went over. The gear gap is just too wide, and you will never be able to give us real group content until a more dynamic version of ldon is figured out. Personally, I hate grouping. Its boring, its near mindless, and there's almost zero challenge even on *named* mobs unless something goes wrong.&nbsp;Aside from random augs here and there, or&nbsp;*progression*, there is nothing pulling a raider to group once the few meaningful AAs&nbsp;have&nbsp;been gotten.&nbsp;Give us back zones or instances more along the lines of original kod'taz, ikkinz, or even original AG&nbsp;and actual rewards to go with it, and I can almost garuntee you'll see a lot more interested in grouping again.</DIV>
