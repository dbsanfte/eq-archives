    <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn't a direct response to the creator of this thread, but simply my 2 cents about MM's &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MM's is in my opinion dividing the player base into 3 factions instead of 2.. The hardcore players, the casual players and now the MM players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hardcore players have skills, gear and levels/AA and can accomplish anything in Everquest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Casual players have skills, average gear/levels/AA and can accomplish quite a bit in Everquest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MM players have NO skills what so ever, are missing most their spells, have no clue how to play their char. The can accomplish absolutely nothing in Everquest&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is Everquest. If you want to accomplish something , you have to put time and effort into it. I can smell a player that did nothing but MM's to get to level 70  from far far away, and would rather poor acid into an open wound, than group with him/her..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you complaint about not having time to put skills and effort into your character, Everquest is NOT the game for you. WoW would be a much better game for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;I am just wondering why caster spells (int for sure but probably wis casters as well) cost so much in the bazaar?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;My problem is this... I have limited time to play this game during the week.  I enjoy the game, I like the game, I would like to continue playing the game.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So why on earth (or norrath) does SOE make caster progression so difficult at 65+ level??  I have managed to get into a few groups where the muramite runes 'supposedly' drop but, guess what, none have dropped.  I have this thing called a real life (or RL) in game terms and do not have the time to play like many of the other players do so I can't group every single day and pray that I get lucky and have a rune drop.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The other side of the coin is that I could go and buy them in the bazaar... at 15000pp the lowest price I saw the other night for a 'something' muramite rune.  I know that you can get lucky and I have heard of them selling for around 5k but I also do not have thousands of platinum sitting in the bank.  I guess SOE's plan is to help keep all those plat sellers in business even though they say that they disprove of the plat sellers.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So the end result is that I pretty much cannot get any of my 66 and higher spells what with being a casual player and lack of pp.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Fine and dandy... this is just the free market in EQ happening and I respect that.  SOE has greatly limited rune drops that folk can sell them at gross prices (some more gross than others).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The end result of this, in my case, though is that there is a new expansion coming out (PoR) that I have absolutely no reason to bother buying because SOE and certainly   a minority of a greedy player base have made it impossible for a casual player like myself to advance past 66.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Actually, thanks to double xp, I am now lvl 70 but with lvl 65 spells.  I could perhaps buy 2 higher spells if I can find some around 4k each at most.  After that, I either buy plat online or end up just giving up on EQ.  Its a shame really because I just came back to it after a year absence and was really enjoying it until running into this wall.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Its not like all players, not just casters, don't have other difficult goals to reach like AA's / Epics / etc.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Please increase drop rates, SOE, so casual players don't have to give up.  All I want are my basic core abilities as I level... I am willing to struggle for anything else!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

I am willing to struggle for anything else!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;EQ is not an entitlement program for anyone. Everyone enjoys playing or they wouldn't pay the price for the software or the monthly fees to play. Sure, some people have more time to play than others, but that doesn't mean that less play time = a stepped system where a casual player gets a leg up so they can keep in the race. (Let me qualify this by saying I consider myself a Casual player at this time and in no way support the majority of the Casual Vs. Uber debate in any way for any side). Sure, spells are expensive sometimes... I had to pay 20K for Wave of Marr when it was desirable so that I had the tool to use with my guild raids. I am a Paladin, certainly not one of the Plat Farming classes and have to eke out my plat like anyone else, with effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want the runes for the spells, go group for them. NC, WoS, MPG, RSS... all of these are easily reached at your level. An earlier posted suggested getting help from friends or a guild. If you don't have time for a Raiding guild, then join a family guild for grouping prospects. The point is, your experience in EQ is one of the few places in your life you will ever really have any serious input into how things turn out... put forth the effort and you will reap the rewards.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I don't think SOE has a plan or any specific intentions for anything.  Just give them some fast xp and phat loot and players''ll accept anything these days.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ok ill try and give a actual answer as to what to do now that you have rode the MM train to 70 and now want to improve your gear and spells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer is simple its called DoN head to lavastorm and put lfg on the wait is going to be longer then MM wait but thats just the way it is. Once you get a group do mission and receave your crystals you now need to decide what your going to do with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crystals will sale like crazy at  100pp to 120pp each so doing two are three mission a day will net you between 8k and 15k plat that should equal at least one OoW spell a day. After you have bought all your spells you need to look at both what items are for sale in bazaar and what item are for sale on don merchant and decide weather your better off saleing crystals are saveing them to buy items from merchants. You can get allot of 100-120hp/mana in the 15k to 40k price range these days in bazaar DoN merchants has huge amount of usefull augs with focuses and mama regen you will need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After you fill up on the 100-120hp/mana items and needed augs you are ready to take step up to next level of the much more costly DoN GM tradeskill armor atuneable 150-170hp/mana items plus type 9 augs off merchant. Once your gear path reaches the point where you are gearing up on these item your also ready to head into OoW to hunt down  nodrop 69 and 70 spells you werent able to buy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then its on to DoDH highlevel mission for 200hp/mana items and spells after you reach this point your done with spells and gear until next exspanion is released unless you want to take up raiding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This just rough outline but that basicly the path sony has laid out for nonraiders. Now in my view there is a difference between nonraider and casual amd casual path isnt as well laid out as the nonraider path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Runes should not really be an issue for anyone anymore with the exception of the level 70 ones which are still rare even in DoD. As was mentioned earlier there are some very nice rune camps in DoD where the mobs have at least a 50-60% drop rate on lvl66-68 runes. These same mob can also drop lvl69 runes as a rare and a nice aug as an untra rare. The only issue I see here is grouping, there is very little a soloer can do to get runes since nearly all of these mob summon.</description>

      <description>I got my runes prior to the monster mission expansion, and I don't really camp them any more, so I'm not sure what those zones are like for pickup groups now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One thing I did do differently than you, however, is wait at each level to get the important spells before proceding to the next one.  I'd farm plat to buy the runes or group and group and group until I got lucky on rolls in places like NC, WoS, and MPG, and later RSS.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It probably took me a couple months to get the important spells level 66-68, and a few 69/70.  Now with DoD out the runes drop like candy compared to OOW.  It's just a matter of grouping in the right places, or farming plat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;BTW, you could probably net 2k/hour just farming spiderling silks in the new froglok city.  They drop like crazy and tradeskillers love them.  Either sell them as is or comebine then into leather padding and sell those for even more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Prices on the spells are droppin on Saryrn Server slightly, however this has always been under discussion that the spells are seriously overpriced and we wish that sony would either do one of two things-Cap the prices Or give them away as rewards for leveling or have them vendor sold like they used to be.  And yes, probably the majority of the ones bashin you are ones that farm the living daylights out of them and charge an insane amount of plat to get them.</description>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A tank does not have to have a BoC.&amp;nbsp; There are cheap aggro weapons (~5k) available in the bazaar and DoN crystals will buy a better 1hs than the BoC for much less pp.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;OOW tier 1 armour (free) or DoN crystal armour (not expensive or free if you farm the crystals yourself) is good enough to survive in most zones unless your healer is asleep, you have no defense skill or no defensive AAs.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Aside from the orc legionaires in stoneroot that are always camped, where else in DoDh can greater shadowspine runes be obtained with a reasonable drop rate?&amp;nbsp; I spent a long time (about 48 hours total) doing the three nameds in RCOD around the monument and&amp;nbsp;had one 69 and one 70 rune drop in that time, which does not meet my idea of a reasonable drop rate.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;First I would like to say that my spells cost way more than 300k total from 1-70, my first spell over 15k was at like level 44 as a necromancer.  There are two of them like that when they were more rare in the 40s, group DMF which started selling on my server for 15-20k and One of the cold nukes which sold for about the same. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Second...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;hr&gt;LeanaSoulwarden wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;hr&gt;Sinestrae-Quellious wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would like to express my apologies for the trolls that come into posts because they think they are so elite that everything they do should be just as easy for everyone else...there are a lot of bitter elitists here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am also sorry that you are having troubles with getting spells they can be tough when you don't play often, I would agree that hunting orcs would be good, but you will need a full and capable group, they are not that easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for the person that compared spells to weapons..I can just about promise you that I have spent twice as much on spells as you have ever spent on weapons for your melee class, not to mention I still had to buy items for those slots to increase my mana pool and my effectiveness...so please talk only what you know about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;First off, apologise for yourself.  Apologies are only valid when they are sincere, and your apologizing for someone having an opposing view is less than sincere. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff6600"&gt;I'm sorry I thought you actually used your brain and read the whole thread before you started typing, perhaps you missed all the trolls talling the OP that he was being lazy and he needed to basically quit whining...?  Yeah here in reality we don't call that &amp;quot;having an opposing view&amp;quot; we call that being rude...guess you never learned that.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the only bitter people here are the people, like yourself, who are complaining.  I see others trying to explain how the game works and what the OP can do to remedy his situation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff6600"&gt;I don't remember complaining about how anything is too hard, I did agree that it isn't easy but for someone who isn't capable of reading much I can see how you missed that.  I agreed with those who were actually helping...but you missed all but those posts I guess...not surprising.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I see it, when you don't find the game to your liking, you basically have three choices:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Work through the framework the devs have provided in order to request that they change it. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Play the game as is and enjoy the things you can.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Piss and moan and call anyone who doesn't agree with you elitest trolls.  That's a sure winner.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff6600"&gt;Let's see, many things that are seen on these boards have been changed and the Devs read posts and use them for feedback fairly often.  The OP posted about his complaint and got flamed by some of the other players basically about how he needed to suck it up and stop crying.  These are the ones I refer to as elitist trolls.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff6600"&gt;As for pissing and moaning and calling people names when they don't agree with you, that isn't what I did, but then you didn't really read my post or the thread and that is blatantly obvious by your response.  However I get the feeling that you think it is okay for someone to be frustrated and to come here to the boards and post politely and in good manner and get blasted for it by people that think that if you're having a hard time then you are a poor player and you should quit or grow some male appendages.  That's a sure winner...as you said...&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, it really doesn't matter what I think, or you think or some elitest troll melee type thinks about spells.  It matters what the devs think .  They've made it clear that they consider it important that casters work for spells and focus items the way that melees work for weapons and focus items.  You don't like that, I know.  But, it's a fact if you plan to play the game, and you're going to have to learn to live with it if you don't want to always be miserable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff6600"&gt;Again I didn't complain about how it was too hard, it just isn't easy, and for someone that doesn't get to play that much, it has to be much, much harder for a caster to get spells or for that matter a melee getting weapons, but then your whole post is based on assumptions (probably after only reading the first paragraph of my post and maybe a few posts in this thread).&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff6600"&gt;And in the hopes that you actually read this time, let me recap some of it for you...&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font color="#ff6600"&gt;RhumbaKween wrote:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font color="#ff6600"&gt;&amp;quot;How have you done most of you leveling lately?

&lt;P&gt;Wow, that is reading a heck of a lot into what I said. Are you really arguing that getting 5k in EQ today is hard for a level 70? Notice&amp;nbsp;I was not rude, nor did I cast aspersions, as you seem to enjoy doing.&amp;nbsp; My comment was perfectly serious. If you cannot put in the time to play this game, it is not the fault of the developers.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;It's not a matter of "If I can do it" although I did have every 66-68 spell, and half my 69s, and 1 70, over a year ago, while I was still a realtively casual non-raider. It is a matter of, if about 80% of all the players, on all servers, can do it. A level seventy, with ZERO level 66 through 70 spells, is definitely doing something wrong.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Notice, that unlike your pointless flames, I actually suggested a reasonably easy place to farm 10k plus an hour, which would get him spells relatively quickly. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Treeslayer on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;01-25-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;01:10 AM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;hr&gt;Sinestrae-Quellious wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;First I would like to say that my spells cost way more than 300k total from 1-70, my first spell over 15k was at like level 44 as a necromancer.  There are two of them like that when they were more rare in the 40s, group DMF which started selling on my server for 15-20k and One of the cold nukes which sold for about the same. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is a difference between buying something that is essential to your class performing it's roles at the current level effectively and buying a spell just so you can say you have it at the level it says on the scroll. I have a 70 necro as well, but I never caved in to the urge to buy group DMF for 10k+ because it wasn't essential to me playing a necro. I waited until I got into my 60s and solo'ed Veksar for the research drops. As for the cold nuke, no one in your group at that level would fault you if you only had the version of a 500 dd nuke that turns a mob into a skeleton (cheaper version...much cheaper) vs. the same exact spell that doesn't have a skeleton illusion effect (expensive version....much more expensive). The only spell I spent a lot of money on as a necro was my 65 CoB pet (25k). I've never spent more than 2k on any other spell because I knew that if I was patient enough, I could obtain by other means, and, here is the important part, it wasn't affecting my current role in groups.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Now if you look at tanking classes and if they are at level 50+, they don't have the option to just hold off another 10-15 levels to go farm some aggro weapons or to get some high AC/HP gear. They need it then or they simply won't be getting many groups. A lot of the times spells are not essential to performing your roles at the level you can obtain them, but tanks need gear that is normally obtained at a much higher level than what they are capable of fighting. Just because you paid for some overpriced utility spells doesn't justify your argument.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;As for the OP's comments, I would have to reiterate previous suggestions to camp DoDH runes. They drop more often and you also have a chance at some other decent loots there that aren't too common in the bazaar yet. I find it funny that in the bazaar that Shadowspine runes are routinely cheaper than Muramite runes as if they have any lesser value. Good luck to in your endeavors :-)&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your argument would have been valid except that the cold spell I spoke of has a stun component which makes it pretty essential, not to mention DoN is quite full of nice weapons and aggro augments so a tank need not buy them at lets say level 50+, they can just do the missions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is it easy?  No, but it wasn't meant to be.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
