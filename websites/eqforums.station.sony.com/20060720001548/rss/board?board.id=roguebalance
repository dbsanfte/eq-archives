      <title>AA/Disc ideas for the new expansion</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=roguebalance&amp;message.id=4846#M4846</link>
      <description>Rare, massive backstab crits (a la 'slay undead') maybe call it... 'Assassination'&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
2 Backstab-specifc Crit AAs (one for frequency, one for damage)&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Chance for passive trap sensing/disarming.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
'Weapon Command' disc, shares timer with Daggerfall. Forces primary&#xD;
weapon's first-listed, 'combat' process. 3 levels, 30-90sec re-use.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Upgrade to Deadeye and Duelist. Less DPS, but more overall damage for 'long-burn' fights.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
AAs that give SIGNIFICANT re-use reductions to escape/hasty exit, 30-60sec re-use.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Changes:&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Move Twisted Chance to Deadeye timer&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Remove 'zone reload' effect from Hasty Exit&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Nerves of Steel - no spell/range attack should break hide/sneak at max level.&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Regardless of what you think of our Plane of Blood BP click now it occurs to me it wont age well at all for level 75.&amp;nbsp; I kind of like it now but its going to be very close to garbage when levels increase to 75.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Level based clickees are the devil.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Today in devestation I went to use escape for the first time since i had logged in.&amp;nbsp; It said "you can use the ability escape again in 0 minute(s) 1 seconds."&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;But escape was ready then i hadnt used it since logging in...&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>I have a quick question for everyone. &lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Why are the Time stars still summoning by 20's not 100's like the rest of the summoned throwing items?&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Imo this needs to be fixed in the next Patch.&amp;nbsp; I see no reason why this can't be fixed.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=roguebalance&amp;message.id=4800#M4800</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I play a 58 rogue.. I love my class. Im aware of all people say and stuff but no matter how bad people consider&amp;nbsp; the class, there is none like it for me. 1ce a rogue always a rogue. I play on the Zek server,&amp;nbsp; My guys name is Taedaven. Although im not greatly geared ( i dont have the oppertunity to raid constantly because of family) i do group alot... I just bought the POR exp and i was wondering if anyone can tell me what lvl do you get the traps, and where can i get them at? And how??.. I would appreciate any information in regards to this, im excited to try them out, and make them work for me no matter how hard.. Where there is a will, theres&amp;nbsp; a way.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Thank you guys!!.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;While the "Top 10 lists" are a thing of the past, I was thinking it would be in our best interest to make a Class issue list and sticky it in the rogue forums of Everquest live. Every couple of months we can review our list and contribute items to it. In order for everyone's voice to be heard, everyone needs to give their feedback. I know we have issues as a class and I want them to be Clear in line of site for Developers browsing the boards. So here is how this is going to work. I will start a thread On the everquestlive rogue boards located here.&amp;nbsp; This list will not be voted upon, I will select topics reword them for the list and Compile it to make sure all of our concerns are on there from the casual to the hardcore raiders. So don't worry about that. The most important thing you can do is go contribute to this thread in a positive manner and debate ideas without attacking eachother. This should not be a wish list and should only consist of current in game issues we have at all levels of play. Please take 10 minutes and give us your well thought out contribution to this thread. If you have concerns about this method please PM me about them or start a new thread, Do not post in this thread.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--  / message  --&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Dalnoth-Vaz on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;06-15-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;10:10 PM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

      <title>Did circle strafe backstabbing get nerfed?</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=roguebalance&amp;message.id=4773#M4773</link>
      <description>I quit a while back, and I'm not back into EQ.&amp;nbsp; I recently decided&#xD;
to play one of my old rogues.&amp;nbsp; I tried to "circle strafe backstab"&#xD;
some mobs, but found I couldn't do it anymore.&amp;nbsp; Did they nerf this&#xD;
(i.e. prevent it) or am I just screwing it up (it's been a while, so&#xD;
this is also possible)?&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
If you don't know what I'm talking about, it's a form of circling&#xD;
around a mob so that you're always facing it, but if you do it fast&#xD;
enough you can backstab mobs that are attacking you.&amp;nbsp; I used to do&#xD;
it before I quit, and I know a couple of friends who used to do it as&#xD;
well (but they aren't playing anymore either).&lt;br&gt;</description>

      <title>Rogue Utility</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=roguebalance&amp;message.id=4764#M4764</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Against the company line of we-only-want-DPS, here are a few&amp;nbsp;utility-type ideas I think would be nice:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Ability to /corpsedrag 5 at a time.&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Assassinate on demand up to level&amp;nbsp;70, non-named mob&amp;nbsp;on a once-a-week timer -- or maybe an assassinate&amp;nbsp;proc on a ranged rogue-only weapon with long distance?&amp;nbsp; The lone assassin on a hill kinda thing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Some kind of Doublecross ability to fool a mob that you're on it's side, functioning akin to escape maybe.&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Innate immunity or higher resistance to poison.&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Ability to apply poison to other players' weapons.&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Maybe a line of buff-like poisons you can use on your group to greatly increase one area while decreasing another, something like an adrenalin shot, that boosts attack and AC but will drain that target to hallf life and half endurance when it wears off.&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Ability to lock doors that aren't usually locked (would be handy as at least a slow down if you're trying to block other guilds/groups on the Progressive server).&amp;nbsp; The potential for pranks is high too. =)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Better thieving ability... maybe like a Swindle where you can steal something more valuable than what's normally on the mob's loot table.&amp;nbsp; The ability to gain&amp;nbsp;a higher level of loot for your group could really&amp;nbsp;help rogues LFG.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Make all zone lines a locked door requiring a rogue to picklock it open.&amp;nbsp; Okay.&amp;nbsp; Not all zone lines, but maybe half.&amp;nbsp; Okay, maybe one.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;What do you think?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>Anyways the way I see it is if you had an evasive disc for rogues that let others in group get less agression like clerics 2.0 etc.  This would up rogues DPS by uping the raids dps.  Every time you turn off attack and hit hide to evade that is loss dps, everytime a monk fd's that is lost dps.  Now the snare thingy does absolutly nothing, that's a fact.  However, if you think that making less agro for your group means less DPS I believe you are wrong, and all this about fake rogues.  I don't think this guy is a fake rogue, he just ain't as selfish as other rogues that like to laugh at the dead zerker beside him.  Now if you actually got sony to impliment this well they won't.  The guy who works with aa's is brand new and doesn't want to change anything till he "get's the hang of it" (which means he just wants to get paid for doing nothing.  The guy that does spells auras and such still have shaman group spells last less time then shamman single spells(because he was too lazy to look at the time on each spell and what they did.  And the guy that deals with aura's still hasn't flagged the healing wards to not be hit by mobs so that they die on anything that you might think about using them for.  So therefore, basically you have a whole lot of people at sony getting paid for nothing, and if you think that you'll actually get a good idea thru to change an aura your outta your mind.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Besides let me ask you rogues this.  Would you rather an aoe snare(that acts like aoe taunt) or would you rather an aura you'd keep up and make it so you'd have to take off your attack less along with others in group?  Either way you all agree to take off snare I would think.</description>

      <title>Xorne's PoR Aura idea for rogues.</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=roguebalance&amp;message.id=4720#M4720</link>
      <description>Problem : In the PoR expension SOE gave up a trap making disc at level&#xD;
55 and 70. The problem is, they are useless and just increased the&#xD;
community anger towards SOE.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Solution : Most people here and on other forums keep complaining on how&#xD;
SOE screw them over by not giving them a DPS upgrade with aura (or for&#xD;
the last 6754 expensions). Whaa whaa whaa, big babies. SOE seem to have&#xD;
put in their heads that rogue are overpowered and even tho we know they&#xD;
are wrong we can't do anything about it except try to find other ways&#xD;
to make them balance our class. Now this might sound odd, but DPS isn't&#xD;
what a rogue is all about. Rogue is also about stealth and evasion.&#xD;
Just like Thief Eye witch can be described as "the rogue give hints to&#xD;
his groupmate on how to be more accurate" we could also be used for&#xD;
"giving hints or teaching our groupmates by example on ways to avoid&#xD;
being notice by the enemy". Give rogues an aura that will give the&#xD;
group the chance to get less aggro from spell / melee, just like the&#xD;
cleric, chanter and other class have on their 2.0 as an effect. Of&#xD;
course, the power of that aura should be tested etc so it doesnt&#xD;
unbalance the rogues. &lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Now you will say : &lt;br&gt;&#xD;
- "Whaa whaa, that's not a DPS upgrade!" &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; No, it is not, but at least it is something usefull.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
- "lol, you are stupid sir because with this the tank will get less aggro on raid and group lol roflmayo"&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Yes, except tanks can right click the aura an add them to the block list.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Now, please link this to any dev or what not at SOE so we can get&#xD;
something usefull out of PoR besides Razorarc. You can also leave&#xD;
comments or posts proclaiming me as your new best friend or something.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Not sure if this is a bug or not,&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;When you have Steadfast Servant out, and use AA "Escape", the Steadfast Servant Disapears :(.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;It just seems lame, if it is supose to work like that. So I realy hope it is a bug, and gest fixed!!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>One thing I have noticed lately is the mobs back. Backstab is crushial on this. If you want to parse more look at the difference between 1st person and other angles. Then go for the top down angle, more times then not I was not behind the mob like I thought I was. Try a different angle to help your parses, maybe you will see what you have been missing.</description>

      <title>Nerves of steel</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=roguebalance&amp;message.id=4690#M4690</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;They ever going to fix this aa, &amp;quot;nerves of steel&amp;quot;?  I was told to look for post saying it was getting fixed in upcoming patch.  I see post most of them are 2004 2005.  These post say that the fix is coming.  However it's May 2006 now, and well with the aa maxed 5/5 I had sneak/hide break on me 25/25 in echo caverns.  10/15 times in Tower of Frozen shades.  I /petitioned and /buged both times.  A very nice CS guy got on, made a copy of my rogue and verified that yes it is very bugged per the aa description.  Anyways, I am not the best at searching these forums for fixes and such.  I was wondering if such fix is truthfully coming?  I'm getting real discuraged since most of the post that talk about this is 2005.  Also are other rogues finding this aa totally useless?  And maybe not just rogues are monks/sk's/necro's finding it useless as well?  Thou since I am a rogue I'm mostly worried about the rogue portion since we only get escape ever 37 minutes, and other classes get fd what every min?  maybe sooner(I don't know).  Anyways I am posting to see if I am the only one having this problem, and seeing if a fix is coming sometime.  25 aa's I could have put to better use then an aa that didn't work. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Please post if you have the same problem, or if there is a fix in the works and I missed it. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If not fixed in 1 month I will repost on the aa till it's fixed. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Thank you.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

Modified /con code to only tell rogues the NPC can see the rogue after running all visibility logic.&lt;br&gt;* Rogue: Ability: Shroud of Stealth: When a rogue is using Hide and Sneak with Shroud of Stealth, then uses the /autofire command, the he does not become visible - fixed.&lt;br&gt;* Feature request for cooldown time to not be incurred if action fails. To test, try taunting enemies from too far away and observe the action button to make sure you can try recasting immediately.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--   / message   --&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Our Weekly Question.</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=roguebalance&amp;message.id=4662#M4662</link>
      <description>   We are testing out something that would take the place of a top ten list, Which would be a weekly question to the Developer's in hope of getting a more in depth response . It seems to be going pretty well and think its a better route than top 10 lists. I'll let you all know more when its more permanant, but for this week here is the question I posed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;hr size="2" width="100%"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;The new Traps system that was implemented with the launch of prophecy of ro, for conventional &amp;quot;Old&amp;quot; Traps such as Velketor's Labarynth, Ssraeshza Temple, up to the current expansion has made the majority of the existing traps malfunction. The new trap system was not tinkered to these old traps yet the majority of rogues still have to deal with them on a daily basis and it makes  our daily routine in these zones very difficult. As it is now, you can get hit with traps before even having a Line of Site to disarm them among a ton of other errant bugs, Rogues are also not happy about not having sense trap turn you in the direction of the trap anymore as well. Is there any plans to go over the existing traps more carefully and cater them to this new system to make them functional again?&lt;br&gt;Suggestions for  slight improvements Sense-wise:&lt;br&gt; Make  sense face you in the direction of the trap once again and also allow you to sense the trap even if it is visible.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr size="2" width="100%"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
