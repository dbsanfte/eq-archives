      <title>Mergers: In related news...</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Brell&amp;message.id=71#M71</link>
      <description>In related news it has been revealed that the state of Texas will be merging with the state of New Mexico. The resulting state will be called New Mexico. North Dakota will be merging with South Dakota and will be known as South Dakota after the merge. The United States will be merging with Canada, the resulting country will be known as Canada.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh, and California will be merging with Delaware and will be keeping the name Delaware.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With as strongly established a culture as it has, Brell losing out to Cazic makes about as much sense as the above.</description>

      <title>Name Changes</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Brell&amp;message.id=70#M70</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I really have a problem with the Name Change Policy, that will be implemented on the Server merge. I created my Main within 6 months of EQ going live. If Someone on the Cazic server has a character that has the same name, the Character with the most "Played" time will keep the name. So if Someone has a merchant that they keep up 24/7 with that name, that they created a year ago, I will be losing my main's name to their Mule. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I think that the Oldest Character should keep the name. ie if someone created their character before I created mine, they should get the name.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;What will be interesting is when they do the next round of mergers....... I wonder what server I will be on then?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>Since I can not find anywhere in general on these forums to post, I am putting on the CT and Brell boards specifically since the impact hits us next.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Originally posted at http://www.brellrants.net/brell/viewtopic.php?t=9925&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[quote]My dislike( actually more like hatred) of losing my server title , made me have an epiphany. I know many of the other servers that are losing their names as well are feeling the sting too. And the letting us have server name as a title is a kick in the pants and a low blow. So I have a proposal to all. Everyone who plays from any server.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Though we may not be able to overturn name change decisions, We should be able to get them to make a new item. New item is a shield, wieldable by all levels, classes and races. Easy quest that even a level 1 could solo. On that shield will be a symbol of your server. Besides the community support to push the idea, there should be a contest that each server is able to decide a winner of the best symbol. Think of this as a family crest., your Heraldry. Show your support and pass on the word.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;heraldry&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;n 1: the study and classification of armorial bearings and the tracing of genealogies 2: emblem indicating the right of a person to bear arms[/quote]</description>

      <title>A possible way to preserve people's first name and remain database compatible?</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Brell&amp;message.id=60#M60</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Since&amp;nbsp;namechanges are being forced on seniority during the merge,&amp;nbsp;has it occured to anyone to allow an automatic namechange to &amp;lt;FirstName&amp;gt;_"Of"_&amp;lt;ServerName&amp;gt; so that we at least don't get stuck with some kind of a perversion?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Example:&amp;nbsp; Aragorn_Of_Cazic , Aragorn_Of_Brell.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Sure seems like it would be an easy solution in just about any database platform on the market.&amp;nbsp; The option of displaying your originating server is fine and all, but that doesn't fix the first name issue which must obviously be a database entry issue.&amp;nbsp; This solution would solve that problem and I personally think it's better than getting stuck with Aragorn and AraCornOnTheCob.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Thanks,&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Brell&amp;message.id=59#M59</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I soooooo hate this server merger idea.&amp;nbsp; ..... just like Grrrrrr...... Flaming .... heaving.... .... flames from the side of my head...... Rrrrraawwwwwr&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;My guild is gonna get totally hosed outta this merger.&amp;nbsp; We had to work our butts off to recover after the initial decline in the server population, and we went from having about 50 people on raids, down to about 30 or 35 and no we're back up to 60 again and can raid whatever we want to, and now we get to fight over spawns and butt heads with other guilds at our level and just above us.&amp;nbsp; Brell has like 3 or 4 active Time guilds and CT has 6 from what I hear and MV is gonna be breaking into time in the next 3 or 4 months probably so tack on one more guild to that soon and we'll all just get to live together happily?&amp;nbsp; There wont be enough room for all of us to stick it out together.&amp;nbsp; Not to mention all the heck that'll be unleashed from the name changes that'll happen because of this.&amp;nbsp; Brell IS DOING FINE WE DONT NEED A DANG STINKING SERVER MERGER.&amp;nbsp; We lost maybe 30% of our population? based on the number of traders in bazaar.&amp;nbsp; CT from what I hear is doing fine if they still got 6 Time guilds in operation.&amp;nbsp; So we'll have combined what? 150% of our original population on either server....... what part of the word crowded isnt understood?&amp;nbsp; I can understand if servers had a huge drop in populations and lost close to 50% of their populations and guilds couldnt function anymore...... but that's not what happened on brell so PLEASE JUST LEAVE US ALONE!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Sincerely angry,&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Brell&amp;message.id=45#M45</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Ok SoE.&amp;nbsp; Your money grubbing is getting very annoying.&amp;nbsp; The fabled Guild Summit was a hope for all that you would address many problems that people are haveing in the game. After the summit and the glorious appology that you gave out, it gave hope to many that many issues would be fixed. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Well? WHERE ARE THE D*** FIXES?!?!?!?!&amp;nbsp; Oh sure. You made some changes with a major update back in what? July or so? However some of the fixed were NEW content that was added. We expected this to be the first of many that we would see. But NO! You gave us some new pretties&amp;nbsp; FINALLY fixed the problems with the new collision code and did a few minor tweeks here and there. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; However MOST of the problems that were brought up at the summit were not addressed and you probably have no intention of devoting time to fixing them either. You are too engrossed in OoW (while I will admit came out very very smoothly). However .. hello ... dont forget GoD. That PoS expansion you through at us that you STILL havnt addressed. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; And what about FLAGGING in that damn expansion. What about making the game more challenging but LESS of a damn time sink?!?&amp;nbsp; Do you really have any clue how ANNOYING it is to have to flag over and over and over again for a few more recruits or members that you get?&amp;nbsp; WE BEAT THE D*** CONTENT! WHY DO WE HAVE TO REPROVE IT FIFTY MORE TIMES?!?!?!?!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This is just one of a many things that irk me and I am sure others.&amp;nbsp; PLEASE go over the guild summit again and address the REST of the issues that people were having problems with!!&amp;nbsp; After YEARS of $$ time and devotion to you, SHOW US SOME!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;I also got succored into the PAY MORE plan...SOE account so I could play EQ and EQ2.&amp;nbsp;Can you say post poned? I wonder how much money they made off that one, great business plan. Who do you have to sleep with to get into Beta? I guess BETA is only going to be a continuation of the same old story... that goes something like....SONY sucking up to the Uber ....oh yeah, the name was changed to protect the innocent.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Yeah, I'm fed up with all this crap. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana color=#0000ff size=5&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana color=#0000ff size=5&gt;My character has not been logged off once in this 79 hour period and I've not gotten a single reply. So I ask.. where are the guides?!&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana color=#0000ff size=5&gt;Please someone help me out.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana color=#0000ff size=5&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana color=#0000ff size=5&gt;Still Waiting,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I'am just wandering what happen to the eq that was on about 2 year ago? My dad played all the time i can over and he would be playing non stop , there where people in the tunnel you could find a group anywhere , people buffing you just for fun, he loved the interaction of it. He got to 56 pally.. then passed away .... Isold his comptuer and moved on then i thought what the heck i will buy it ... &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;Wow not anything the same as when i watched him ... i have a char on this server named rahhl a lvl 7 pally now .... all is diff .. i read updates and guides on websites but what happen to that fun factor&amp;nbsp; my pops talked about...... i stand&amp;nbsp; in tunnel in ec and ask a question and it takes 10 mins for people to say something .... I'am not&amp;nbsp; a twink ,though one char Minymoto took time out and gave me some things ,,, and spent a lil time with me buffed me ,,, And said if u need help give a tell ..... i was very lucky to meet him .....NOW please understand i dont want &amp;nbsp;hand outs&amp;nbsp; ... or things thrown my way&amp;nbsp;, i cant even join a group ..&amp;nbsp; no guild will touch me i'am to low .. no talks when sopken to ... I couldnt even get a sow with i know 4 casters in&amp;nbsp; 3 reach could have gave me one ...&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;Iam not whinning just thought it was different&amp;nbsp; i know times change but&amp;nbsp; being just courteous helps this kind of game go along say hi&amp;nbsp; dont have to give anything away are buff ... a Hi can make a newbie go a long way..... send all the hate tells u want i'am sure some want understand but its off my chest....................... &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ALL BE SAFE , PAPPY&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>Why SoE do you "seem" to ignore us?</title>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;    There are many issues in the game that are making the game for a chore to play than fun. The rushed content that EVERYONE in Beta said was not rdy, the new fixes that do not work and were not tested on the "test" server and the total lack of .. empathy that CS gives in regards to real problems. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;   Last night my guild was up for VT Rot. We were almost to the final 4 Bosses and had to click through a door with 8 mobs on the other side. Got rogue to count em and set up pretargets. We clicked in and suddenly mobs agroed from the floor below into the room. We had close to 20 mobs in camp due to a new bug that had mobs halfway into the ground.  Of course we wiped as this was our first real run into VT and are still learning.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;    We petitioned and was told a GM would be with us shortly (GM NOT Guide). The GM eventually comes (45 minutes later) and said, better luck next time. Not willing to help in any way with the broken content of even give an explanation as to why not. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;   Why do you persist in Ignoreing the needs of the player base? Why dont you atleast talk to us in some way as to the reasons these events seem to happen to tons of people on all the servers? Maybe some kind of reasons or responce ... or even maybe an appology? to help restore some kidn of faith by the player base. You bring in several Million a month on Game Fees alone. EQ is a Billion dollor game. BILLION! Could you not extend SOME sort of courtesy to us and NOT just to Stormhammer? &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
