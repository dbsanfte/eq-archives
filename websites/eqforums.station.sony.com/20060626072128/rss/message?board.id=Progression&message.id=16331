      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Next time I guess I'll have to make sure I use the &amp;lt;sarcasm&amp;gt; tag.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I thought some people would understand since we have a lot of WoW people returning and people rating posts sarcastically was done quite often on the WoW forums.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Sarcasm in text, on these forums, is practically impossible to detect.&amp;nbsp; We're used to people posting the most ludicrous and crazy things.&amp;nbsp; It's unrealistic to expect anyone to know whether you're joking or not.&amp;nbsp; If people did it on WoW boards, and then came here, its reasonable to assume they might indeed do it here, no sarcasm intended at all.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I really have to laugh at this post. I didn't start playing EQ until 2004 so never seen the old player models, but after logging into the combine to reserve my name I have to just laugh. I actually hope they put the new ones back in (not that it will keep me from playing or anything like that).&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

How could 1999 menus be better than the current ones; they aren't at all.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Too much drama.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You complained about it loading too slow, but you have some of the Luclin character models on.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you played during PoP, you would know how to turn the Luclin models off.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

I give this post an F.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Reasons:&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;ul&gt;&#xD;
    &lt;li&gt;Some people dont prefer elaborate layouts, just a simple one that loads fast and does its job.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
    &lt;li&gt;You dont know drama until you play WoW up to level 60.&amp;nbsp; Dont say he's starting anything.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
    &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
    &lt;li&gt;The game loads slow with or without Luclin models with a mediocre computer.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
    &lt;li&gt;The options interface has changed drastically since PoP/Luclin, dont jump to conclusions...&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;br&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;br&gt;&#xD;
"Dont argue with an idiot, they just drag you down to their level and beat you with experience."&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xD;

some kind of bug, but I turned off all the new character models&#xD;
(hideous) and it reverts most of them back to regular ones except&#xD;
human, dwarf, and a couple more, how do you fix that?&amp;nbsp; The new human&#xD;
models are completely unbearable to look at.&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;funny, I far prefer the new models over the old ones, especially the humans.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
that does sound like a bug though.&amp;nbsp; imo you should make sure it's reproducable, and /bug it with as much info as you can give, especially the steps and your system info.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;*Use a Custum UI if you wish by going to someplace like eqinterface.com .&amp;nbsp; Choose one that you like.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;*Tutorial will not be on The Combine.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;*You can turn the new models off very easily.&amp;nbsp; I think you click Options before you log in: before you put in your password.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
