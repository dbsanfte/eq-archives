      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Necromancers&amp;message.id=8832#M8832</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Haven't played in years and making a come back.&amp;nbsp; I had a necro years ago and was going to restart with an Iksar since I never got to see much of Kunark.&amp;nbsp; Figured if I start out there I'll get to see it from ground up. :)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Anyways, when I was playing before there were rules where if you dot'd a mob and started running (kiting) the dot damage would be decreased.&amp;nbsp; I read recently on the forums that was removed.&amp;nbsp; I'm just wondering if someone can confirm that for me?&amp;nbsp; I mean is it possible to dot up a creature and tow it around while your dots and pet are wearing it down without loosing your dot efficiency?&amp;nbsp; Is this what is being refered to as agro kiting now?&amp;nbsp; Back when I played I basically fear kited or just let my pet tank and keep agro; FD if I pulled too much and the mob came after me.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Thanks!&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>Necromancer in Full Plate :)</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Necromancers&amp;message.id=8828#M8828</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I understand that there are, oddly enough, various items available for casters that share a plate graphic.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Some of these are relativly easy to obtain, others are not. Sseru's legs are plate, All/all usable. I know of Golden efreeti boots for feet.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Are there any other items, that a necromancer can use, that have a plate graphic? I wanna find arms/Bracer... then wearing a&amp;nbsp; tunic, that would look so cool :) &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Maybe even a plate BP but I doubt it exists :0&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Please let me know!&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>HP Transfer Spells</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Necromancers&amp;message.id=8817#M8817</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Hi,&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I apologize if this question has been covered, but a search didn't produce anything specific to my situation. I'm just coming back to the game after a very long time away, and have a friend who's started a Berzerker. I was thinking about starting up a Necro to duo with him, but was wondering if the Necro's HP transfer spells were potent enough to do him any good in normal situations. I realize there's no way I'll keep us both alive in a dire situation where he's taking serious damage, but would like to be able to keep him upright in lighter, more normal fighting (because I realize that my pet won't be able to take, so he'll certainly end up with that role). Thanks in advance for the replies!&amp;nbsp; :)&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>pet hold issue on Tris Wallow</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Necromancers&amp;message.id=8812#M8812</link>
      <description>I've been having issues with pet hold during the Tris event lately.&amp;nbsp; She changes to human, put pet on hold. Just before she is ms wolf, she casts generally 2 ae stuns. First stun goes off, pet charges her, I re-hold pet, ae goes off again = pet attacks again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I talked to only 2 other pet classes the last time it occured. Mage pet behaved, the other necro pet was having the same issues I was. Any else having the same or can pet issues be looked into ?&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Just wanted to see if anyone has ever noticed this before.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I head into Dulak today to hunt the entrance area.  There are usually a few people pulling to the zone out to Gunthak.    I killed maybe 2 mobs and get a tell from another guy telling me that this area is camped.  I look over and notice that it was really only 1 other person fighting here and he had stacks of dead mobs everywhere.  All I knew was that he was red to me and guessed since his name was &amp;quot;Rapidfire&amp;quot; that he was a ranger.   I don't really think you should be able to &amp;quot;call&amp;quot; the entire front area, but I don't want to get into a discussion with this guy about it, so just sent him a tell saying ok.  I figured I would med up and just move out rather than argue.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At one point I notice that all my pet's buffs are gone.  I wondered what had happened, they shouldn't have worn off already.  Maybe one of the mobs I had been fighting had dispelled then.  So I stood up and put a spirit armor, and augment death on him.  I left the room, cam back and see that those are gone again.  So I stood up, cast spirit armor, and as soon as it landed, I saw it disappear again.  That's when I noticed &amp;quot;Rapidfire&amp;quot; was standing next to me dispelling my pet.   At first I didn't think this was possible, but I sent him a tell asking why is he doing this.   He went on about how he told me to leave and I didn't, claimed that I had trained him also?!   I just sent him a tell explaining that I had not trained him, and I was not interfering with his &amp;quot;camp&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I didn't mean this as a discussion about camps, etc.  But I was wondering if anyone else had ever noticed people doing this to them.  This is kind of crappy that these griefers can get away with stuff like this, especially if you had paid for the buffs on your pet and someone just walks in and pulls this stunt on you.    Is this a bug?  Or is there some necessary reason for this to be possible?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;thanks for any replies&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;It seems as though, the powers that be have appointed class correspondents that like to point fingers and say &amp;quot;we want what they have&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;they're too strong&amp;quot;.  Now, last I checked as a necromancer I know next to nothing about enchanters..a reasonable argument could be made to say the same thing about their class rep as it pertains to his knowledge about us..remains to be seen, but that's atleast reasonable.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We all know that fake tunat parse is a &amp;quot;perfect world&amp;quot; example of what we're capable.  keledrix, to a lesser degree.  Hell the ToB mobs along with a few in DoB parse nice too.  Just not *that* nice.  We all also know, except on a handfull a non-suck rogue is going to beat us as far as parsed dmg goes.  Some things are limited by script or a particular mechanic of a fight here or there, but for the most part on anything over 5mins it's a rogue and then us.  If it's a fight like vishimtar it's us and then everyone else. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;There may be 1-2 more like that, but I wouldn't characterize our dps as being rogue+, as it's not the norm.  To even approach rogue dps you have to be VERY well set with some pretty rare loot, unlike the rogue which can grab a 2.0, and dragonkill or notched blade along with other gear that's not too hard to come by, anguish patterns or even tunat's bp well into dodh and be fine.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Then we have to be able to land 3 different lines of dots and not be tasked with anything else even as trivial and mindflaying.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I'd would like to see correspondents taking a &amp;quot;higher&amp;quot; road in their arguments for their own classes, and stop posting BS &amp;quot;information&amp;quot; about what they &amp;quot;know&amp;quot; and start concentrating on their own class.  Leaving this class out of their argument entirely.  We've done quite well on our own and I'd like to stay there, in the shadows with a couple corpses to molest =).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Growth isn't optional for this community (you could argue any community), the second you stop growing you begin dying.  Stagnation leads to population decline faster then almost anything else, with the exception of an out right, massive nerf.  Our class needs to grow linearly with the content that is coming out as we have for the last 2 or so years.  With spell lines being extended, dps growing as it has been, our utility does need upgrading...our graphics on our pets needs to change!  Our aa's need fixing, and we need more of them. Detrimental spell haste needs to be more common..&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Once again, I know other classes read this.  Tell your correspondents to get some freaking class, and worry about how his own class is operating, and ignore the man behind the curtain.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Ok Rashere code fixed MW in the last patch... But as many people including myself have personally witnessed, its not fixed.  At this time Rashere needs exact information of every SINGLE mob MW is having an issue with.  Hopefully from that list he can see what is similar in coding between those creatures and troubleshoot the issue.  So please help us find which mobs MW isn't working on!  And be *sure* that currently that mob is immune to MW, not a guess or something you remember from when the expansion released, etc...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;-name of mob&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;-zone it was in&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;-message you got when casted (so we can catch any other things that might be going on)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And I passed along and specifics you guys gave me before.  Thanks for your help on this, lets get this fixed asap!!!!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Hi all, I'm returning from a little more then a year break from eq. A lot has changed and I have a lev 44 warrior but eh that bored me before prolly is whta cause me to quit. Anyways I've narrowed it down to SK or Necro just can't decide if I want to melee or sit back and cast but I'm here asking for your input on Necro's at the high end of the game, I know you can do a lot. Even better if you could compare yourselves to a SK. Thanks!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Six things every Noob Necro should know</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Necromancers&amp;message.id=8716#M8716</link>
      <description>Hi there folks,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have been playing EQ2 for the last year while my wife stuck with EQ1. Well to make long story short, I’m back spending some time in EQ1 and a lot has changed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I picked a Necro to start up because that is what I play in EQ2.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So here’s my sort of noob question. If you had it all to do over again as a Necro at lvl 1, what 3 thing would you do different, and what 3 things would you not change?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks in advance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Soloing Devastation for hides.</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Necromancers&amp;message.id=8695#M8695</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It seems red mobs only spawn in the craters(or does anyone know of a flat area where non-summoning reds spawn?). Is it just me or is it near impossible to get things solo with the pathing of these things? The pathing in and out of the craters for mobs is absolutly HORRIBLE. Pulling up the slope and 90% of the time they will stutter coming up the slope and then warp right on top of you. The agro radius is probably the highest I've ever seen, but I am ok with that, I like a challenge. I have mobs snared/rooted at times for a few minutes, getting up from FD only to resnare, waiting for the others to go back to their spawn points (which can take a very long time since the pathing is again, absolutly horrid..) so I can get up and root/rot and/or kite them, but they just...poof out of thin air half the time..&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;These bugs/pathing issuse are really getting frustrating, and the warping is happening everywhere (as I've posted before about this). Thanks SoE! /sarcasm&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;/rant&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>DE Necro newbie armor quest - deathfist scout scalps?</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Necromancers&amp;message.id=8688#M8688</link>
      <description>Hi Everybody,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My necro is working on newbie armor quests. I have everything but the gown, cap &amp;amp; bracer. I have all of the components except for embalming dusts &amp;amp; 3 scout scalps. I'm going to hit North Ro for the dusts (haven't found any off of the undead in nek forest). But those scalps... It took me awhile to find the scout (I've only found one) and I've been working that area waiting for spawns. I think I killed him for the 15th or 20th time tonight and I have yet to see a scalp. I've picked up swords, spears, &amp;amp; a bunch of small coin. But not a single scalp. And he has a big ponytail so there should be a scalp! :-)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anybody recently found a scalp? Does the scout still drop it? Is it just a really rare newbie armor component?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;TIA for any advice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
