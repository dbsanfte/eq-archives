    <description>&lt;DIV&gt;So there is one hot topic out there in the community today and it's not "Is Brenlo feeling better"&amp;nbsp; (I am thanks for asking).&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Server Merges.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;While I would say that I am shocked at some of the reaction to this announcement but you folks rarely shock me anymore.&amp;nbsp; I guess befuddled would be a better word.&amp;nbsp; One of our board posters expressed it well when he stated that in engineering they had a term for this, NIMBY (Not in my back yard) which seems to be the case.&amp;nbsp; Folks wanted merges, couldn't find groups, guilds were falling apart and the only way to save EQ, according to the many posters on this topic, was to merge servers NOW!&amp;nbsp; Well we watched and waited and decided that this was the time, some 4 months later and now the reaction is "HEY!&amp;nbsp; No one wanted this" which is far from true.&amp;nbsp; You may not have wanted it but many did.&amp;nbsp; Many on this forum and in emails, petitions etc . . . wanted servers merged.&amp;nbsp; I kind of liken this to a home that the owner claims is on fire.&amp;nbsp; He has called and called and called the fire department to put the fire out and when they arrived and whipped out the fire hoses, he is upset that they are spraying water on his furniture.&amp;nbsp; (Yes I know this analogy can be torn apart just as any other&amp;nbsp;but the analogy is not the point).&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Server merges are necessary for the health of the game overall.&amp;nbsp; They are inevitable my friends.&amp;nbsp; They are going to happen.&amp;nbsp; Our goal is to make sure everyone has a healthy server population to play with.&amp;nbsp; A good solid community to interact with.&amp;nbsp; Some servers were doing okay and to those servers we are adding the smallest influx of people from servers that were not okay.&amp;nbsp; Some servers were sort of inbetween and those servers we are putting together to bolster the community, add new guilds and more importantly potential new guild members.&amp;nbsp; More people to group with, more people to buy and sell, more people to tradeskill all of which you have been telling us you wanted and needed and we agree,&amp;nbsp;it is needed. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So now I will talk a little about legacy and heritage, which is the other argument that keeps popping up.&amp;nbsp; The legacy and heritage of EQ are not on some hardware that happened to have a name to make it easier to choose when logging in.&amp;nbsp; The servers could just as easily been numbered.&amp;nbsp; They are just hardware.&amp;nbsp; The legacy and the heritage of EQ resides in you and in me, in our guilds and groups and friends, no matter which box we log into.&amp;nbsp; The server name of Veeshan going away does not take away that FOH was the first guild to conquer Naggy and Vox, it does not diminish what Cestus Dei recently accomplished.&amp;nbsp; Those live on in each of us.&amp;nbsp; Those stories will continue as long as EQ is around and even longer, as long as we continue to tell them.&amp;nbsp; FOH could have been on any server and they would have still taken down those dragons and many other mobs first.&amp;nbsp; It was not the server, it was and is the people.&amp;nbsp; It is all of us that make the EQ community and not the hardware that hosts it.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Yes, I do agree that this can be upsetting.&amp;nbsp; The server I was first a GM on, Innoruuk, is going away.&amp;nbsp; The server I first played on, Veeshan, is going away but my characters, my friends and my stories are still here.&amp;nbsp; No matter which server I log onto tomorrow.&amp;nbsp; The same is true for you my friends.&amp;nbsp; The same is true for you.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I am off to get some coffee now.&amp;nbsp; Have a good day.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
