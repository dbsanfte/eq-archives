&lt;P&gt;It's always been because you can't limit the AAs by race.&amp;nbsp; But if you did what Gegolen suggested and made it available thru a quest that only Gnomes could get (which can be done in game), then you wouldn't have that problem.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The Gnomes would just have to either turn in the note they got as a level 1, or for those who already have turn in a cheap vendor bought item to their home city GM.&amp;nbsp; That would then add the Tinkering Mastery AA to the OoW tab at 0/3 at the cost of 3 AA each.&amp;nbsp; That way the AA could be on All races, but only be obtainable by Gnomes who can actually do Tinkering.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Yes.&amp;nbsp; There were other issues of not being sure that will work.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;It is on my list of things for the AA person to do :)&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <title>Tinkering Mastery, Time for it come one</title>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;I logged in my twink to pl him some aaxp's. He got 51 over the double exp weekend (thank you). So I figured I'll get my base 6 and bank 30 aaxp and then run him to 60 so i could get Tinkering master before I started my big tinkering push. Well was I shocked that gnomes don't have tinkering mastery. I thought was this a bug? So I log into EQTraders do a search and boom there's a post saying that they don't and they should, and your answer is, not going to happen anytime soon.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It seems to me this should have been in the game since Luclin came out(when shaman, enchanters and rogues got theirs.)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I can't for the life of me understand you all sometimes.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So how about move this to the top of the list and get it done finally.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;With this I'd also like to ask, how do you set your priorities to fix things in the game?&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;*raises hand* ooh ooh ooh&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How about.... quest or make a tinkered item, usable only by gnomes that allows you to increase your skill in tinkering beyond the current cap?  Maybe a special geerlok or toolbox or something like that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if nobody has the tinkering mastery AAs, then all the recipes can be designed with that in mind.  You don't need to buy the AAs because nobody else has them either.  So your level 50 gnome can be just as good at tinkering as the level 70 gnome.   You don't need to level up and spend the AAs in order to catch up to the guys who already bought them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Congrats on your AA's that you don't need to spend now!  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What you should really be arguing for is lowering the GM tinkered armor trivials down from 386 BECAUSE you &lt;u&gt;don't&lt;/u&gt; have the Mastery AAs, instead of asking to spend 18 AAs on the mastery. ;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Zacatac_BB on &lt;span class="date_text"&gt;03-30-2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;09:29 AM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The trouble is that this would be the first RACIAL aa.  They do not want to open that can of worms.  Not only is there the &lt;strike&gt;possibility&lt;/strike&gt; inevitability other races would demand an aa also, there is the risk that making a entirely new kind of aa will break something.  Personally, I like the idea but don't hold your breath. </description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;I appreciate that feedback but lets put it this way, this is the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;only &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;racial tradeskill in the game. Gnomes are the only race who can make this stuff. It should have been in the game since they introduced class specific tradeskills. This is not something that can't be fixed simply.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I can't see race specific skills. We already have the big tradeskills covered. What is left? Troll, &amp;quot;Garbage man&amp;quot;, enhance skill to find forage items which were dropped by rangers, druids bards and iskar all over Norath? &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Or how about ship builder? Cept ships don't work anymore in this game.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;How about architech? They build different dwelling. But this could be one everyone could do. Imagine Igloos in the Desert?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Sorry should be &amp;quot;person&amp;quot; cause any gender can do these jobs.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'd love racial AAs!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advanced safe fall for Vah Shir, forage AAs for wood elves, of course Tinkering for Gnomes, etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>The real issue is it's hard to code AA for race only, they can do class only AA.  Chanty get JC master but not other classes.  What do other classes get in place of missing JC AA?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Race only AA would require quiite a bit of work.  Someone (I think on EQTraders) suggested a quest where NPC will &amp;quot;take&amp;quot; the required number of AA in exchange for tinkering mastery if the toon is of gnome race.  Race specific quest have been around and it is doable.  All that's left is to see if the dev thinks it'd be worthwhile or if it's better to let gnome suffer.  In the end it's still about making money and adding tinkering mastery aa isn't exactly a real money maker.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;We don't really need Tinkering Mastery AA&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The way mastery works is that it adds the effect as if you have a higher skill in the tradeskill in question.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;End result: Mastery AA is mostly worthless at the moment for most people- The benefit is temporary till they hit the higher skill which would have provided the same skillup chance as lower skill with mastery aa.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Only a handfull of combines benefit at the moment from mastery aa at 300.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Devs have said they would work on making mastery more usefull by putting items with a higher trivial in game for which the aa will have an impact still.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So basicly the mastery will eventually be a top-up you need on top of 300 to do some combines with minimum failure chance.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;As long as tinkering recipes are made with the knowledge that there is no AA, there is no real issue/case for the aa except another path to get to &amp;quot;max tinkering skill&amp;quot;  (after aa modification). Seeing the difficulty of implementing racial aa and the issues it would cause for all other races that want something in the way of AA's, the pitfalls seem far bigger than the benefits of the aa.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I rather see development time go into more usefull projects&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;hr&gt;aamlaan wrote:&lt;br&gt;The real issue is it's hard to code AA for race only, they can do class only AA.  Chanty get JC master but not other classes.  What do other classes get in place of missing JC AA?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;Enchanters got this way way back. I think it was during POP but don't quote me on that. They got it to fill up the aa point distribution across the classes. Appareently there was little else to give them points for at that time.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;To give other classes the mastery AA, means that they need to get back to the drawing boards to figure out how to implement a suitable &amp;quot;replacement reward&amp;quot; for the enchanters because they would not benefit in their development if only the JC aa was introduced for the other classes. They didn;t get some other (non disclosed) alternative back then when other classes did get aa's to develop themselves. This seems to be a big issue with both developers and enchanters. Enchanters are mixed about handing out the aa to all and if so, how to be &amp;quot;compensated&amp;quot;. Developers seem to have an aversion of even discussing the merits of the case in regards with other tradeskills and balance across the classes. Maybe they just can;t come up with some aa that will satisfy the enchanters without pissing off  the other classes by giving the enchanters something obviously overpowered (like the ranger spell adjustments &amp;lt;sic&amp;gt;)&lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

Tinkering is a Race specific tradeskill. No other race has finger tiny enough to make the things. Tinkering is part of the original lore of the game. You'd have to gut the game to start over to give it to other races. You want that kind of game go play WOW or EQ2. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't see a large contingent of people pushing for Research to be something we all can do. It's a given and part of the game lore that only pure magic users can do it. Although it would be fun to have something like research for melees so we could get our new tomes, it is pointless because this is something that doesn't need to be complicated further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have race specific armors &amp;amp; weapons now. We had complaints about this back when they tried to introduce race made armors because certain races were left out, half elfs, trolls... It created 2 great problems, certain races had very sucky skill up progressions because of this. As for weapons there are some only trolls can make.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jewel craft mastery going only to enchanters was a point of contention. Of course enchanters had the inside line on jewel craft because they are the only class who can enchant something. There was a need to fill out AAXP's when Luclin came out. This was a way to do it. Of course this created more stress for the designers because everyone was jealous and coveted this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However even though alot of the progression tradeskill stuff became availabe with Luclin, there were still be gaps for all the other tradeskills when it came to recipes and the final quality of products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have within skills like fletching, recipes that only followers of Karana and Tunare can make the combines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't see where it's a problem and I don't see where there will be a big community out cry for balance in this. I bet 1 person will complain. But this is something that is not a controversial topic was other ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've been playing for 7 years. When I started Tailoring could go to 130 or 140'ish (reinforced leather armor). Before about ?Kurnak? or Velious?, they changes this to 115 (I got using quivers). When I started, Smithing went only to 175?, I htink, making banded armor. There were not other recipes. This was changed to 115(?) when a later expansion came out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can't remember trivials on jewel craft because i couldn't enchant stuff so it was pointless to start jewel craft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Point is this game has evolved a great deal since way back when it started. I think gnome aaxps are in line for future evolution.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;The issue is not that other races will ask for tinkering.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The issue is that other races will ask for other race specific aa's- Which opens a whole new bag of manure&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And i think we need to agree to differ on opinion what's needed or not :p&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;To rework the whole aa system to accomodate tinkers seems an exessive investment of resources. If it is possible within the framework of a new to implement system of race specific character enhancement in future expansions, it is another issue- which lets open the discussions about which race gets what enhancement. If it is a whole set  similar to when luclin was launched or the following expansions, then it would be far easier to work in tinkering than as a solo or limited enhancement (i can see all classes but gnomes getting non tradeskill character enhancements and gnomes only tinkering mastery- Boy wouldn't the non tinkering gnomes be pissed off)&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Of course they wouldn't have to give every race a racial only AA but people would still demand them. They gave enchanters JCM.... Chanters wanted real AAs added but other classes wanted some tradeskill AAs to. Every class had a problem with it for one reason or another.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Yes it would be possible to add one. Make it a racial quest that results in an AA upon completion like the trials in MPG.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But yes every other race would want something as well. To start with there would be some gnomes unhappy with how hard the quest was, or how much competition there was, etc. Then other races would start in. Vah Shir would want a safe fall AA or one to reduce thier above average consumption of beverages for example. It was suggested that you give wood elves an AA regarding forage... that alone would cause many problems as well. The wood elves would complain that well they already get forage, forage mod items, and forage AAs.... what good would it do. Non wood elves would complain that the wood elves where getting an unfair advantage in tradeskills that require foraged items. Furthermore then non wood elf rangers and druids and bards would complain, why didn't they get it to since they get forage. For that matter possibly iksar shamans as well.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Simply put anything you give to one race or class, the rest want as well.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Now for those that are in favor of a gnome only tinkering AA you might be in luck because Sony has in the past shown a willingness to implement things that completely change the nature of the game...... pure melee spells for instance..... but I wouldn't hold my breath if I where you.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;It's always been because you can't limit the AAs by race.&amp;nbsp; But if you did what Gegolen suggested and made it available thru a quest that only Gnomes could get (which can be done in game), then you wouldn't have that problem.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The Gnomes would just have to either turn in the note they got as a level 1, or for those who already have turn in a cheap vendor bought item to their home city GM.&amp;nbsp; That would then add the Tinkering Mastery AA to the OoW tab at 0/3 at the cost of 3 AA each.&amp;nbsp; That way the AA could be on All races, but only be obtainable by Gnomes who can actually do Tinkering.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</description>

Gnomes being an old school race, I can't really see how this won't be exploited in some way; apart from having a completely new faction tables for gnomes (gnome only faction but discounts religion and class).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I would think redoing a special class/faction tables for gnomes gonna cause huge headaches for the devs. Just a thought.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Woot!&amp;nbsp; I was waiting for this :)&amp;nbsp; I knew someone would be angry that someone else gets something.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;But seriously, it is within our consideration, and a possible reason it might not happen.&amp;nbsp; Nothing on this is set in stone yet.&amp;nbsp; I personally believe that it should be created, and that gnomes have not been getting "undue attention"&amp;nbsp; But I am not the last word, and the concerns of the other races do matter.&amp;nbsp; I think it is silly to deny Gnomes this AA just because other races do not have racial AA's.&amp;nbsp; But that is entirely my opinion in the matter, and I understand that other people do feel strongly about it, and that is also their prerogative.&amp;nbsp; I just happen to disagree that "They got something so I must" is enough of a reason to not give someone something.&amp;nbsp; I also disagree with the "My race sucks, fix it before you fix anything else".&amp;nbsp; For one, not all people agree that X race sucks.&amp;nbsp; I need to fix things I can fix, even if it only benefits a subgroup of the whole community, or even if it harms a sub-group of the community but will help the health of the community overall.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</description>
