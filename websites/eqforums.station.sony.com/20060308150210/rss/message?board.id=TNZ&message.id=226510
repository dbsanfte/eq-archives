Well now I recently dinged 53... but the Priest of Discord disappered in Neriak Commons :( where did he go... I know there are others.. but I want to use the one in my home town...... Can anyone shed any light?&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;The last time I was in Neriak...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;He was on the ramp by the waterfall as you come in from the foreign quarter.  I doubt they would have moved him.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This was Maelin server.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;It is possible someone agroed him and trained him elsewhere... the PoD is not KoS to anyone of the start, but he has quite the rep' and many a foolish mage have I seen who tried to solo the PoD just to say they did it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Best bet is to ask a ranger to zone into Neriak and track him, with any luck you can get a good laugh &lt;span&gt;:smileyvery-happy:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;yah - I wish I woulda known that they would make them unkillable with release of oow - or I woulda saved some of them in the bank - I ussually just gave them to some newb in zone when I used to kill pod.  Killing pod was always my cool down activity after raids and I got xloced back home to Gfay.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;For some reason he was moved from Neriak Commons to Neriak FQ when the Trolls moved in, he was up on the &amp;quot;hill&amp;quot; behind the LoY quest Tier'Dal Coraspondant npc, when they Revamped the zone during the Troll retaking of Grobb event both he and the TDC disapeared ... I've /feedbacked it a few times..and the TDC did make a reapearance,  but still have not seen the PoD added back.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I'm not sure if this works there, but does the use find button show list of vendors and whatnot? I thought the PoD showed up as well just not sure. That or the patch put him in hide and go seek mode and he has no idea where he is :smileywink:.</description>
