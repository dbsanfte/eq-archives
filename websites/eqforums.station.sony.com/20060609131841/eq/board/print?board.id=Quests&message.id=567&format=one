				The FM caves with the mobs from the old Droga/Nurga are South of Droga, West of Nurga.  Closer to Nurga than to Droga, in fact.  These drop salts and skins more frequently than in Nurga/Droga.  It is more fun to get your faction up soloing (or grouping) in Nurga/Droga, as these zones are well laid out and reasonably challenging for such relatively easy mobs.  You are never forced to make more than a two pull (unless much lower level), and the proportion of casters is very high.<br><br><em>Edit:</em>  you can also get Chardok faction in Chardok B, which is very conveniently placed in Chardok <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0>.<p>Message Edited by Borek-VS on <span class=date_text>02-17-2005</span> <span class=time_text>08:31 AM</span>
