      <title>some Combine Stats</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Progression&amp;message.id=17724#M17724</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Since we are now 3 weeks away and starting to get anxious, I think it would be fun to get some stats about how many people made there first toon on the Combine and the class and race breakdown. I personally am trying to decide between Cleric and Mage and never really played either class so need to research quests and other stuff depending on which class I will ultimately choose. I am leaning toward mage but if there are going to be a lot of mages I may play a cleric. I know that any stats right now would not truly reflect what the server would actually be like, but think it would be interesting to see anyway.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;ok i played a mage for 4 years and here's a few things you should know. at lower levels yes mages are fun, even all the way into the 60's. problem is most of the utility spells become useless untill you get the 65+ (forgot what level it is) sphere of air spell. also, i hope you like to solo alot because groups hardly ever ask you to join as a mage (at least that's how it was on my server), so i started a second account and played a cleric with him, and it was a blast. if you can box a cleric with your mage i highly recommend it. groups will be much more likely to ask you to join if you have a cleric with&amp;nbsp; you. &amp;nbsp;another thing to do is RESEARCH the class. there's alot to mages that most people don't know, such as which pets are best at what levels,&amp;nbsp; which spells do more damage in the long run since some are more mana efficient than others, etc. you also need to think about this in the long run: if you plan to do high end raiding as a mage you will feel like you've turned into a call of the hero bot. i didn't mind this so much at first, i was happy that my utility actually found some good use in a raid, but it does get very old. most guilds will reimburse your pearls though so it's not all that bad, just hope you like summoning people. all in all though mages are really fun to play. it's just kinda tough to set yourself apart from the other dps classes that offer more to a group. also, be prepared to deal with necros, they like to talk smack to mages for some odd reason.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>Mage:  Really nice underapreciated skillset.  High DPS, high soloability into the 50's, fun to play(I love my mage).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cleric:  Heals, and does it better than anyone else.  Groups love clerics.  can't solo well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Basically, if you want to be desired for groups, play cleric, if you want to be able to group or solo, but not be as highly sought after by groups, play mage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or best bet, try both and see which you enjoy more.</description>

      <description>To play a class based on 1-60 is pointless as the majority of your playtime will be 60 + &lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

are alot more convient and easier to play BUT they dont keep your&#xD;

then people wouldnt quit and be max level in a few months. If it was&#xD;
hard then people would rise tot he chalange and play for along time.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;Actually, I've played EQ since the release of Kunark... So you're wrong.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I understand that half the fun is the leveling, and hell it took me a year or so to reach max level as well the first time.&amp;nbsp; But you have to face the facts.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;1) the exploration factor... you're not going to hunt in a place that you have already hunted in and had bad experiences with it (therefore saving *some* time)&lt;BR&gt;2) the fact that eq has been out for what... 7 years? I suck at math, but 1 year out of 7.... I would say is the majority of the time.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Keep making your e-weiner grow by calling yourself an "old-timer" and what not... but remember that there are thousands of others who, odds are, have played longer than you.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Good day.... old timer.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;More than half the fun is getting there, every level is equally enjoyable as long as there are people to group with in sufficient quantity...&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;It is an impossible ask; to entertain someone who plays 16+ hours a day seven days a week when you only have five days a week to&amp;nbsp;develop&amp;nbsp;fresh content in. Average game takes what two to four years to develop and&amp;nbsp;400 hours&amp;nbsp;to max out in.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Loved Baldur's Gate series but once you've completed them once or twice at a push what is the point is replaying the same story? Everquest has thousands of quests and different stories to play though. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Content is king and progression is a great opportunity to enjoy the old content with enough players to make a group.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I'm sure there's not many people who were playing originally still playing they all seem to be on the forum most of the time!&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;If you want to bypass content then fine, but I for one look forward to playing through content I skipped first time around. I'm sure getting the last +20 gazillion hp augment so you can tank the latest alien invader is fun for some people but it gets samey and predictable after a while.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I'd like to be able to actually end a character's story, maybe complete a quest for immortality retire them for good in some hall of fame type thing and start over.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;Is it a violation of the NDA to say half my guildies are in beta (I'm not) and we talk about whats going in Beta on a daily basis ?;p&amp;nbsp;Oh noes! NDAs are always a joke, and the NDA on the Combine just killed some of the excitement people had going for it...now rather then waiting in anticipation, people are worried about all the uncertainties (expansion unlock times, newb armor, what npcs/zones are in/out etc etc ).</description>

&lt;P&gt;You guys do realize its a violation of the NDA to even admit you are in Beta? &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;To the OP, I played a DE Wizard, started four hours after beta came up.&amp;nbsp; Spent time in Nektulos, then Najena (zone trash), then befallen, then Guk/Cazic.&amp;nbsp; Fun stuff.&amp;nbsp; Clerics are hard to find.&amp;nbsp; I like playing a Cleric but was hoping to play a wizard because I am fond of research.&amp;nbsp; Yah I've done the chanter thing too; would never play a pet class since I'd feel like I was cheating LOL.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Jaybalard you must know someone in management cuz you sure like to troll; and I've never seen one of your posts edited; those who debunk you get edited all the time.&amp;nbsp; Like surely this post will.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;the trick is, you focus the attack on the statements, rather than on the people making them.&amp;nbsp; That lets you argue and speak your mind without worrying about censorship.&amp;nbsp; Debate, and even argument is ok, as long as you are focused on the debate, rather than personal attacks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just as an example... &lt;br&gt;1.&amp;nbsp; I disagreed with a poster, &lt;br&gt;2.&amp;nbsp; He made one of those "I've played since 1999" sort of posts... the kind that seems like they want to say "look at my e-**SMURF**, it's huge because I'm old school"&lt;br&gt;3.&amp;nbsp; With a brillaint usage of irony, I "agreed" with him about playing a different class since 1999.&lt;br&gt;4.&amp;nbsp; He resonded back with an attack on some player (I'm guessing me).&amp;nbsp; I wonder what he said?&amp;nbsp; I never read it.&lt;br&gt;5.&amp;nbsp; Sage either randomly read it, or someone reported it, so it Got edited&lt;br&gt;6.&amp;nbsp; Nothing I posted during this exchange was objectionable...so nothing of mine got edited.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If in step 3 I had responded with " YOUR MOM was playing&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;different magician class&amp;nbsp;from 1999 to the present&amp;nbsp;then..." or otherwise made some sort of direct attack at him, I would have gotten edited as well.&amp;nbsp; (although I'd probably have to insinuate something about her either&#xD;
clicking my mod rod, or making something dissapear *wink wink* in order&#xD;
to get that light of a statement edited)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As far as you getting edited alot... I'm just guessing here... but if other people read your posts the same way I do, I wouldn't be surpised if there aret people who see your name that just go ahead and click the "report abuse" link without even reading the post.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learn a bit more about debate, and you'll be able to post without censorship... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Edit: it was Sage, noy Ky&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Jayabalard on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;06-07-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;07:07 PM&lt;/span&gt;</description>
