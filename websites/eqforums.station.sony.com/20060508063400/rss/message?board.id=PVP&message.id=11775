    <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;pvp is lame now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;i read that they wanted to reduce the frequency that necro dots landed in pvp. why? another un-necessary nerf. a melee can eat up a caster or another melee in a matter of seconds, why cant a caster? the pvp system in eq is extremely unbalanced and needs to be changed, even on blue servers, please fix this, i love to pvp but not landing dots is very annoying. please please please un-nerf necros, or at least make it not so bad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. make resist check on necro lifetaps better in pvp, since sony chose to nerf them so badly this is basically theyre only defense, the lvl 70 ancient spell should be close to unresistable in pvp, like the mages and shamans debuffs, they get it why not necros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. actually make necro dots land, ive watched shaman dots land, why cant a necro's? scenario 1: necro says, oh hey watch me chain lifetap and land some lvl 40 and under dots, that do hardly any noticible damage. chain lifetaps are very innefficient in a duel against someone with high magic resists. i had a necro use theyre lvl 70 dot on me &amp;quot;dread pyre&amp;quot; i took off all my gear etc and my fire resist was around 50 or so iirc, he casted it 6 times before it landed, and it has a resist check of -100. i put my gear back on and had him cast ignite bloode and BAM landed first try with fire resists of over 400. the whole thing about necro dots not landing is etremely lame  and unfair and needs to change please.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. the bard mana drain drains alot more then its listed. and since they can run / cast at same time, this is an issue as everyones weak to bards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. the monk epic spin stun is extremely lame, monks are getting way to co^ky. and the unresistable nuke they have is also lame, as it shows as a non melee hit it should have a resist check.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. make casters spells land, i mean **SMURF** is wrong with you people? ok scenario 1: monk/ warrior/ ranger / any melee class, comes in starts hitting you, nukes you (monk), you try to nuke him, BAM resisted np, you get hit for about 3k more damage, you nuke BAM it does a fraction of the damage, while his melee is doing full damage. your dead in about 1 min or less, end of fight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;6. possiby undo any / all nerfs in pvp and let people whine about getting killed, if you dont want to die to said class dont duel them, its that easy, me as a beastlord i would not care if i went in and got nuked a couple times by a wizzy or had a necro lifetap do full damage and i died, i simply would avoid them. people complain way to much and are making this game horrible, nerfs are lame and should be undone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;7. make heal potions not able to be used in the arena.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;8. i can see having the nerfs sony has in a duel that you do in a zone other that an arena, ONCE you enter the arena it should be no holds barred, no nerfs no nothing,  all dots land as normal, nukes and whatever else. you go there for a reason, you cant win every time. you have to accept losing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;9. i agree about pets being able to be casted on so easily, this needs changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;10. rangers using bow while not facing you is pretty lame. and obviously the further away you are shooting an arrow the slower its gonna be going and should have a reduction in damage depending on how far away the person is. although not a huge reduction only a fraction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;11. no veteran aa's allowed in an arena.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;12. beastlord slow should have a higher success rate of landing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;13. not much i can say for rogues/ warriors they are just pure melee&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;14. if a melee can hit a disc and hit for over 2.6k ( this is highest ive seen on myself so far, aside from a rogue backstab) then why cant a spell land for more then a fracion of the damage, melee do full damgae hits why cant nukers at least do say 80-85% or so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;15.  a monk who uses the epic 1.5 / 2,0 clicky and gets you spinning and uses a disc your done for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;16. a monks avoidance / mitigation should not be greater then that of a good warrior with high ac. in pvp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;17. just a random ramble, why did monks get run 8? they rarely pull, and when they do its often sloppy, and yes ive grouped with some good monks it takes them to long to split a camp of mobs over lvl 70 perhaps they new a higher lvl pacy, bards own pulling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;18, i know it may seem i favor necros alot, but ive watched them get nerfed so badly. (keep in mind i am a beastlord)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;all this is adding up and adding up and honestly making me sick of playing eq, various nerfs, people complaining. Like i said make arena zones a &amp;quot;no hold barred&amp;quot; type area any / everything goes, except heal pots and vet aa's&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Monk epic and unresist nuke is way to powerful.&lt;br&gt;Zerker stun and snare rarely works, it normally take 12 attemps with snare for it to land. 12 sec refresh and stun about 1 in 10&lt;br&gt;very broken considering were dps and thats the only thing we have outside of dps in pvp.&lt;br&gt;Alot of classes are unbalanced, should be looked at.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've seen a warrior drop a 9K buffless druid in a few seconds flat, I've seen that same warrior destroy comparatively geared wizards with ease, I've seen him destroy two monks (non epic) and a pally at the same time and hardly break a sweat, then I've seen him lose to players only comparatively geared. There's a lot that's unbalanced, and honestly the lack of communication I'm recieving on the other end isn't helping one bit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm having a lot of trouble running EQ at the moment so I only log on sparingly until this problem is fixed (taking a break doesn't hurt)&lt;/p&gt;</description>
