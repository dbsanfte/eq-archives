    <title>Let's make tradeskills in the low to mid levels worth something again</title>
    <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Progression&amp;message.id=18441</link>
    <description>&lt;DIV&gt;No newbie armor quests and no bazaar please. These two things prevent many people from taking up tradeskills because it is unprofitable to do so when better gear then you can make is readily available. At first, bazaar may not have much, but once the powergamers have done a few raids, you'd be surprised how much gear will show up for sale cheap. The newbie quest armors pretty much kill demand for any tailored or smithed armor up to banded or reinforced because the newb armors are easy to get and have better stats. I would like to see tradeskills become more than just a money/time sink like they are now. &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
