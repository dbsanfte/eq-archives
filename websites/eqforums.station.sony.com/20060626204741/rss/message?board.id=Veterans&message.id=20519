&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;First of all, no_drop equipment is no_drop for a reason.&amp;nbsp; The character holding the gear should be the character who was there to loot the corpse, and was presumably also a participant in the battle that resulted in the item.&amp;nbsp; Got the Belt of Dwarfslaying?&amp;nbsp; You killed Dain.&amp;nbsp; Got Quarm's Hammer?&amp;nbsp; You killed Quarm.&amp;nbsp; Passing that gear onto characters that have never seen those mobs or those zones cheapens value of the accomplishment.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Secondly, allowing the transfer of no_drop items eliminates an important aspect of player progression.&amp;nbsp; If every alt on an established account begins their life with a Plane of Time gift pack, then they don't have a whole lot of gear upgrades to look forward to.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Most importantly, your proposal would allow the sale and trade of no_drop equipment.&amp;nbsp; It wouldn't take someone long to realize that they could load up a mule with&amp;nbsp;high end no_drop gear, and then&amp;nbsp;move said mule to another account.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;We currently have the feature of transfering items through our characters bank account to our other characters on the same account.&amp;nbsp; I don't understand why we can't transfer our no-drop items like this as well.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Lets look at the drawbacks:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;1)&amp;nbsp; Players can twink theyr alts easily.&amp;nbsp; Why is this bad?&amp;nbsp; The player in question already earned his items, he isn't "cheating" or buying it off of ebay.&amp;nbsp; I won't even play an alt without this feature.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;What we gain with this feature:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;1)&amp;nbsp; Players are actually able to use their hard earned items which are just rotting in the bank.&amp;nbsp; Just about any veteran in a raiding guild has a bunch of no-drop items in the bank which he has replaced with better items.&amp;nbsp; Hundreds of hours of raiding may have gotten him these items which are just rotting away in his bank account.&amp;nbsp; It's simply not right that the person can't transfer these items to another character on the SAME account.&amp;nbsp; It's not like hes twinking his friends, he's just having fun with a lowbie character with some of his hard earned stuff.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;There are already level caps on items, it's not like someones alt level 1 character would be able to get the full bonus of a drop from PoTime, as the level requirement on items there is 65 (which is quit overdoing it IMO, but anyway thats the way it is).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So Devs, WHY can't we do this?&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face="Comic Sans MS"&gt;&lt;FONT size=5&gt;&lt;FONT size=4&gt;To put it simply, there are TOO MANY items with No Drop attached. While I perfectly agree with keeping things like Time gear out of the hands of newbies/the unflagged, MANY simple things are a severe pain because of the No Drop tag. With the advent of recommended/required levels, all that would be needed is for the item to require flagging. If this is too resource-hungry, then, perhaps, a similar solution could be reached. Either way, there are far too many simple items that are No Drop.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=4&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face="Comic Sans MS"&gt;&lt;FONT size=5&gt;&lt;FONT size=4&gt;Example: I've been playing since SoV. I absolutely fell in love with SoL, and a Vah Shir Sham became my main. I spent 6 months hunting muckdiggers in PC for little to no XP, just to get through 1 stage of my newby quests. Just 1 item. The hearts to brew up a tonic for a turn-in.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face="Comic Sans MS"&gt;&lt;FONT size=5&gt;&lt;FONT size=4&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face="Comic Sans MS"&gt;&lt;FONT size=5&gt;&lt;FONT size=4&gt;This same example can be used for most of the Shar Vahl quests. I am STILL working on my SWB spear and some of the other little quests around there. (BTW, the HSM war still needs work.) All this time for a weapon that was outmoded for me about 20 levels ago. What if the classes could gather the ingredients for each other? Then I could trade all of these fish oil soaked rags I come across for some blackened salt crystals or sonic wolf brains. This was exemplified by the Guktan Initiate quests.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face="Comic Sans MS"&gt;&lt;FONT size=5&gt;&lt;FONT size=4&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face="Comic Sans MS"&gt;&lt;FONT size=5&gt;&lt;FONT size=4&gt;Most of the items for the froglock newby quests were tradeable. That way it was common for people to be broadcasting that they needed x and x and had y and z for trade. If you couldn't trade for it, you could actually find them on the vendors. (That's another thing: why won't vendors buy some things, like sonic wolf paws?) I see that the newest newby armor quests are all this way.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face="Comic Sans MS"&gt;&lt;FONT size=5&gt;&lt;FONT size=4&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face="Comic Sans MS"&gt;&lt;FONT size=5&gt;&lt;FONT size=4&gt;I don't know. I do know that I keep getting frustrated with not being able to do these quests from years ago, and I keep taking longer and longer breaks from the game.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Just had to stick my 2 cents in about something that's been bothering me for months.&amp;nbsp; I can understand having many top end quest and equipment drops being no drop.&amp;nbsp; But the no drop tags on many of the older quest items for example are a little outdated.&amp;nbsp; Wasp pollen for example is needed for many highelf newbie quest armor parts, and all the various pollens are no drop.&amp;nbsp; My paladin was looking for that final wasp warrior pollen for vambraces for 3 weeks before I decided to heck with it, I'm 20th level, I'll get something for 50 pp in the bazaar.&amp;nbsp; Now this was a streak of bad luck, but it seems silly that such minor items have the no drop tag.&amp;nbsp; I found most of my armor peices by yelling what I was looking for in ooc and having some kind soul send me a tell when it dropped.&amp;nbsp; And before anyone starts about the "challenge" the newbie quest should present, the newer armor quests such as for barbarians DON'T require no drop items.&amp;nbsp; No drop tags just seem to be uneven in distribution, at least to me.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;I wouldn't be surprised to hear that different people were involved in designing the different quests, similar to how different people work on creating different zones within each expansion.&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Now if no-drop items became no drop think about the click effect you would be able to pass onto your alts. Lvl 1 enc with ornate silklegs casting c4 not that i would hold on them but they would still in therory be able to cast it. Or the necro legs casting their i do believe best pet haste at lvl 1. no-drop is no-drop for a reason.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I can understand why you don'twant a character that doesn't have the level/skill to obtain an item that drops deep in some plane or dungeon. But what happens when you outgrow that item and have replaced it with some other no drop item which is even better? Does that item get stuffed in the bank and forgotten? Why could it not be arranged that those items be turned into the Tribute Masters and that way only the person earning the item will benefit from it but will allow a method of eliminating old outdated no drop items in such a way that the person who earned it will obtain one last benefit from it.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;&amp;gt;From a game design standpoint, it would also remove a major timesink, and allow guilds to equip themselves much more quickly than they do now (I'm all for removing large timesinks, but I suspect the developers feel differently about this).&amp;lt; (Front Page)&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Not to be rude at all here, but aren't we already losing top end guilds because they are blowing through the stuff too fast?&amp;nbsp; And then, when they get there, a few things are broken because the devs "suck" (nicely put term from what some of the higher end guilds have said about them).&amp;nbsp; If you allow for faster equipping of full guilds, you are asking for more patches and broken mobs/quests as the devs are in a rush to clean up their footsteps and knocking things over as they back up.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Im, interested to what "devs" are exactly. I have been DM'ing D &amp;amp; D for a little over 25 years now and have found when talking to other DMs they cannot see the ability to convert the game to the players rather they want to convert the player to the game. If items were all transferrable and droppable and there was not a level limit on items, what really would happen ? Newbies with time flagged items would be around and try to&amp;nbsp; kill small mobs quicker and easier? They even might try to kill big mobs (higher level) to go up even faster..This is a computer age where program writers are sortta like DM's (online) so I (if I were the DM or programmer in this case) just write programs to recognise these players that have the "extrodinary" items and adjust the level and treasure correspondingly of the mobs they attack. More online GM's is the ansewer for better interesting gameplay, fun here seems to be the issue. I can give epic items to my players at first and second levels big deal, they end up going out and killing themselves by&amp;nbsp; attacking mobs (creatures) that hit through the armor and avoid the epic items/weapons very well. Then they all nod and say "well, seems we have to re-think this a little."&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Why aren't guilds built to all help each other ? If my guild has players that have really good stuff why won't they all just&amp;nbsp;hand down their good stuff to the next generation of new guildies comming in? What if we make the items guild droppable only ? People would scramble to play in guilds that have the nice items and that are good enough to help ALL their guildies out. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I would like to see an all adult server.(18+) I would like to see a guild window that would show pictures of the real life guildmates. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>After reading this whole thread and the arguments i think i have figured out a solution. what we need is a few more FV style servers. add at least one that is pvp. and all those who feel no drop is outdated on items or that no drop should be done away with can go there. allow transfers for say one month. then close it down to tranfers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;i thought about making a joke about then shutting down those servers and reformatting. hehe. but really give em what they want in the limited fashion that will please them and lets all go back to playing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;FV is there if you want dropable. just remember that pesky trivial loot code and you'll do fine. you might even like it. you never know. i might try it myself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;but the argument on Sony padding its pockets? Duh. Welcome to capitalism. They are a business out to make money. they chose to do so by making a game we all like to play obviously or why would we be here posting on it? if you dont like the game dont play and good riddance. but dont villify SOE for doing what they are in business to do. thats just plain silly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;if you like EQ but have a problem then post constructively. Sony is not the devil so lets move on.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I have a related question - Why have the new Distiller Items - for removal of Augments without destroying them been made NO DROP?&amp;nbsp; The effect of that is that in addition to not being tradeable they cannot be sold to merchants.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I can think of no reason for this other that to create frustration among those who happen to purchase the wrong&amp;nbsp; solvent version (out of 18 variations) or by buying too many.&amp;nbsp; In either case you have just wasted your plat.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;It can't be, as they have done in some Expansion related quests, to make the quest available to only those that own the expansion - the vendor is in Butcherblock - a basic zone.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;This also happened with the imbue and enchant spells when they were initially offered in the EC Tunnels - they too were NO DROP and then (because as I surmise for these items also) they were changed to tradeable as there is no valid reason to have them as NO DROP.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If any of the powers that be at SOE read this please consider making this change to the Distillers also&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;The distillers being made droppable is the best idea on this thread so far.&amp;nbsp; I cant think of any good reason for them to be no drop.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;For those of you who claim that there is no problem dropping items on an RP-wise or real life standard, then go and play Firiona Vie. The reason there are hardly any no-drop items on that server is because you can only have one character. If your going to get twinked, it will be by a friend or buddy who has taken a real liking to you and given you the gear to earn your support or friendship. All the other servers on EQLive arent meant to be played roleplaying and thats because most people don't want to roleplay while they play. I don't consider standing in a castle killing thousands of darkelves while a druid buffs/heals you to be roleplaying, and unless you have a very good reason to be doing this, it isn't. Going to the cave in the Field of Bone and farming spiders for silks for hours on an end, that could be considered roleplaying, and i see no reason why it isnt. If you want your lowbie characters to have half-decent gear, then twink them, but there is no reason why you would need elemental or time dropped equipment to max out a toon's main stats. If you really have that kind of money then just buy them a couple of items and your all set. Otherwise we don't want to hear your complaining.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Lore items are different.&amp;nbsp; You can&amp;nbsp;pick up&amp;nbsp;the same lore item by the same toon and transfer it to a different one.&amp;nbsp; Repeat. And rinse.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Buying MQs or things that turned into no drop items has always been something for the rich&amp;nbsp;or the foolish or the careful.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The rich do it cause they can.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The careful do it occasionally cause they have an extremely well thought out view about the value.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The foolish do it when they arnt one of the above.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Almost always in EQ its best to buy a lesser version of something droppable then to MQ something.&amp;nbsp; The reason is you only "rent it" if your careful.&amp;nbsp; You ultimately get your money back.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; With no drop items if you buy them your coin is gone for ever.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Its a good way to get poor fast buying no drop items.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Should that change? nope.&amp;nbsp; No Drop items are good game play.&amp;nbsp; I like them.&amp;nbsp; Im not on FV for a reason.&amp;nbsp; As a rule though they arnt as much of a headache if you dont buy them =)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I am very much aware of that.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I found a NO DROP left by somebody else.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I could not actually take it because it was *also* LORE, but had I not already had one, I could have, easily.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;"It really hurts to pay around 100k plat for Ornate armor patterns in the bazaar..then you get an upgrade to it, and its worthless?"&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;This is how EQ has been since day one.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Simple answer.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Why even level a new toon?&amp;nbsp; Haven't you already put in the time for xp?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Sarcasm here:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If I have a level 65 toon, then I should be able to start my next toon at the same level.&amp;nbsp; What are you thinking EQ team?&amp;nbsp; Get it together.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;gt;Sarcasm here:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;gt;What are you thinking EQ team?&amp;nbsp; Get it together.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Exactly.&amp;nbsp; The sad part is that with the ability to level being so easy these days, there are entirely too many people who pretty much do this type of thing by leveling so fast.&amp;nbsp; It will never cease to amaze me how many people think that just because they can play the 65 Ranger they played up as thier first main, that they know how to adequetly play a 50 (let alone 65) wizzie or bard or .&amp;nbsp; Entirely too many seem to think that once you reach 65 you gain the ability to play other classes at that level by osmosis or something:-)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Ice was in an LDoN last night with just such a person, an enchanter.&amp;nbsp; To quote her "I don't know what he IS doing but he seems to not be doing much since I am slowing the mobs and hasting people since he apparently isnt."&amp;nbsp; There was also the issue that he apparently couldn't seem to mezz ANYTHING&amp;nbsp; =)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Oddly enough his name wasn't Castrofire, one on MT I have grouped with who had the exact same problem and was most concerned about his inability to nuke once his KEI dropped due to death (caused by him getting aggro via nukes for like 5 seconds).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
