      <description>&lt;div&gt;ok I'm pretty much a lurker,  I've posted a few times but I've been doing alot of thinking about the problems the enchanter community is facing and unfortunately the majority of the problems no ammount of class tweaking will fix.  most of our problems are not derived from our abilities, rather from the abilities and resists given to the monsters we face and no matter what they do to improve our class they are going to have to tweek the monsters by a comparable amount in order to keep the content challenging for everyone else.   there is no easy fix for our class unless you want to do a complete overhaul of the game.  atleast thats the conclusion I've come to, does it mean I love my enchanter any less, no it just means that I have come to accept that even though I'm unhappy with the way things are I understand that there is no easy solutions and my not even be a reasonable difficult one either.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I agrre with Unmei in that we havent rolled over and given up Nan,its just that so many of us have asked for the same thing over the years only to be ignored.We can ask again,make new posts,ask for these things all over again and reply to a very similar post to this in about a year when we are asked why we dont have a concerted voice.We do,it's just that no one listens.The devs are more concerned with popping out new expansions because SOE is riding the money train all the way to the bank by giving us a morsel after taking our plate away.Reinvisionment should have been COMPLETED.Instead we had some reinvisionment done which basically crippled us,and then it was forgotten.The devs accomplished what they planned by screwing us and then saying "well we arent done yet,wait for us to finish".When? How long do we have to wait to be made into a viable class again? When WoW and other upcoming mmorpgs take away a larger chunk of the community?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;We needed these changes before WoW hit the market,were ignored,and SOE paid for it by losing over 250,000 players.More games are on the horizon,and SOE is still bypassing the obvious and popping out expansions to a broken game.The question is not how many chanters need to raise their voices before we are heard Nan,but rather how many accounts need to be canceled before they realize there is a problem.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Tad harsh Glaeken the game aint broke but it is bent.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Don't woory about a community representative as it appears no-oe listens. Fly Unmei, Yakk, LLan and Nayea to California sit em down with someone creative, Rytan doesn't sping to mind, and come out with&amp;nbsp;an agreed list of changes that will be introduced within the next 3 months and another list that will come in 6 months. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Considering they can butcher up eqplayers in just over a 12 hour day imagine what they can do in three months.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Or of course they could read every post of the above people and the solution is there.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>I had a group in Ilsalin. I got 2 mezz resists on a single add. I died before spell gems refreshed, the group wiped. This is not an isolated incident. If I have to explain to sony what is wrong with that picture, then there really is no hope.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How hard is it to comprehend? We NEED to be able to RELIABLY lock down at least one add, especially in every day XP content. We should not be terrified of adds, they are our job. I hate adds now, I'm just a slower and terrible DPS, coz adds kill me, and that's just pathetetic, and embarrassing and an incentive to explore other avenues of entertainment than my chanter. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And the buffs, dont forget the buffs... Even with the 4-6 mana per tick of the new KoS thing, we STILL bring less mana regen to group than bards and Beasts and Necros. Make it 10 and people will care.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's my favorite item to preach, but we NEED a lure mezz, a long recast, high resist mod mezz. A lesser version of Stasis, somewhere around -50-100 MR and a 1 min recast. Even if it's only 3 ticks and cost like 800 mana. That cant be abused, but it would help us so much, I simply cant emphasise how much.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And FIX CHARM. Charm was integral to our play style, the core of many chanters and our only solo ability. Yet things like Turn Undead and Manaburn, only optional AA's not core abilities, get more attention? There are dozens of suggestions, heck, I'd even be happy with the ability to summon a wild pet that was charmable, as long as the OoW charm nerf didnt apply. You can even limit them per zone, I dont care, but I want to Wrangle again, and not just for specific raid events.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Actually, having a summon line that had us permanently fixed in their hate list would work. If they werent KoS to others, we could even use them on raids, and there would be no way to grief others, coz only us would be on the hate list.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enchanters are rapidly becomming the most boring class to play, as no group uses you for CC, they all get pullers, so all you do is slow and ghetto nuke and buff, and on raids it's even worse. We are emergency, backup CC now at best and that is just WRONG.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you want to get depressed, head over to the EQ2 forums, things there get addressed with comparatively lightning speed. And guess what, Enchanters are still the most borked class in the game, coz sony just doesnt understand them at all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Until Sony wakes up and realises that their flagship mmorpg is and always will be, EQ, then they will not spend the money to give the Devs teh resources to fix it. Until then, they will continue making juuuuust enough fixes to seem like they are listening, as such the pace of fixes will always be almost imperceptibly slow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Such a shame, it really should be in a better state than it is. So shortsighted...</description>

      <description>Playing an enchanter from casual to high end raids, from crap gear till top end, i am more than annoyed towards the idea of always wanting to make things easier. I am not a masochist, but dying has always been part of this game at any level and for any class (not only ours). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What's embarrassing is when we have people posting here that they have no solution to survive a bad pull. It has already been posted here &amp; there several times, between aas (MoM, stasis, doppleganger, etc.) to spells (blur, runes, hi-i-m-the-root-spell etc), passing by equipment and your groupmates, there are enough back-up at this stage of the game. I had suggested a timed aa illusion which would turn us into a non kos illusion to the environnement, sort of complement from doppleganger aa and yet i am not in high demand for this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The very one thing that annoys me beyond sense at this stage is the fact that we cannot benefit from a specific mana regen spell as we are a buffing class (i did not say a buff bot) and we only benefit from a universal mana regen spell. Charm has been partially answered with dictate upgrade (not using it that much though) and anyway CoD still work fine ( as a reminder, some of the proposition for changing charm were involving nerfing the whole line, including CoD etc something which annoys me quite a few). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway, as pointed out in nanyea's post, it's hard for everyone to speak on the same voice (exept for the mezz /ae mezz crap at least) as we don't have the same playtime/goals in one word satisfactions when playing this game. I would say being class correspondant or assimilated and having to pick-ip some of the propositions in order to lobby for your class is certainly not a easy mission. My wish in the matter has always been the same : not gimping our class.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I do agree that we need a concerted voice. Too many ideas and too varied opinions hurt us. Let's agree on the most important issue first and work downward. Perhaps one for casual exp player and one for high end raider.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I&amp;nbsp;also agree that we need a community leader&amp;nbsp;and make some stance. Someone that community respects.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Looking back, I also think that SOE is doing something good for chanters ... biggest being contents that are chanter friendly. So it is not all dark and gloomy but things are getting better.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>I hear you Nanyea, but most of the fight has gone out of me at this point.  I've suggested so many ideas over the past few years, to never see a single ounce of feedback on any of them (let alone any implementation of them) is all but heartbreaking.   A lot of the enchanter community, I think, feels the way I do - they've been talking and suggesting for years, and now they just wonder why they bother.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You say they're not going to magically include Enchanter_01.  That's fine, and there's no reason they should have to.   But they have to put a thumb on the pulse of the community in some way.   We shouldn't -need- a champion to crusade for us.   At most, all we should need is someone to gather ideas and plant them on the doorstep.  Which, incidentally, the top ten list utterly does not do.  The top ten list has been occupied by the same 10 issues for months if not years now.  Either the devs have read it more than once and have an idea of what our issues are, or they've never bothered to look at it and don't have a freaking clue.  That's only half the battle though.   While I respect the creativity of the dev team, a lot of the ideas that come down to us are half-baked "who on earth though this would be useful" sort of things (Virus mez leaps to mind.).  There are tons of ideas circulating throughout the community on useful ways to address charm, mez, utility, and everything under the sun... but no one at Sony ever appears to hear about any of them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And then, of course, we have the mez stacking debacle (I can't think of a gentler word); It's almost as though someone at Sony deliberately went forth to -punish- us for complaining about something, because, to be frank, if they had read -any- of my posts on the subject of Wake of Felicity stacking, they would have noticed that I included very precise instructions on how to fix it.  Instead, they've been fooling around with half a dozen different spells and generally leaving the whole system in a shambles.  The only possible alternatives here are that the devs are either impossibly poorly informed (and seemingly unwilling to become better informed) or that they have some sort of policy that requires them to -never- fix a problem in a way suggested by a player.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And then there is an entirely different issue - people like Bravor, who seem to believe that everything is pretty much fine, and that people who are dying to single adds are obviously screwing up since they have so many resources.  Unfortunately, most of those resources are on long re-use timers, or require the user to live through the casting time.  If we are ever to function as CC anywhere nearly as reliably as a monk or a bard, we need to be able to deal with single adds -guaranteed-, without using any resources that take more than a minute or so to recover.  The likes of Rune of Shadows, Mind Over Matter, and Color Shock should be reserved for pulls of more than two.  It's the "I don't want the game to be too easy! Please don't improve my class!"  faction that, in my opinion, has a difficult time discerning between "hard" and "random" and which sends mixed and confused messages to the dev team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So. To sum up.  I sortof agree with you, and I wouldn't even -mind- stepping forward to trying to make something happen.  I applied to the class correspondant post, but apparently only enchanters from Anguish+ guilds are considered for that sort of thing.   But I resent the implication that I, or, indeed, the community as a whole, have in any way rolled over and accepted what has been handed to us.  Certainly, we haven't trashed and railed and foamed at the mouth - in part because we are better that that, as a whole, and in part because we recognize that it doesn't really accomplish anything.   We've tried our best to be constructive, to offer useful suggestions, and to point out problems, but this effort has, as best anyone can tell, fallen on ears that either deaf or too busy working on the next expansion to do anything.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm not going to sidetrack this thread by talking about charm, or proposed solutions for it, or anything of the sort;  I'm just going to say that the devs need to show more honest interest in the ideas of the community if the community is to feel that there is a point in offering said suggestions.  And I think I'm a pretty moderate voice on this subject.  I'm not in the "You all suck because you can't hack it" camp, nor am I in the "Sony doesn't know what do with us! They're trying to eliminate our class! They hate us! And they're stupid and ugly and smell bad!" camp either. (Don't believe me?

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;First off,  you are right i should have precised i m speaking from a 11k5ish /12k5ish hp mana perspective.  Would have i other  opinions one year ago when i had like 7k/9k?  Most likely, but not necessary.&lt;br&gt;I  for instance boxed couple guildies  with low gear  (4kish/6kish)  in uqua to flag them for qvic back in the days (when we did not have the alternative  flag system). Was in harder? of course. Impossible? no.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I m  basing my views  from my game experience, that does not mean i m right, that does not mean i am  wrong. That has nothing to do with some oldschool versus  supposedly noobish arrogant attitude. Once again  just take what i m writing for what it is, you dont have to interprate it each time.  That is obvious that  the experience throught several years in an occupation  alter your opinion and your own experience/skills/feelings. No reason to be on the defensive about it. Main point here is that  making things easier for everyone would just trivialize content in the high end.  At least, that  is my fear.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Agreeing as a whole on fixing the biggest issues (mezz fiasco &amp;amp; so on) is important for sure. Tuning the class itself is a much different issue as i wanted to point out that we have a bunch of different play styles (and you perfectly know what i mean since, if i remember some of your post, you almost never use blur unlike i can tell you from my own experience a lot of us) from the cc'rs to the wizanters passing by the buffers or the multitask ones etc. And once a direction is given, it is pretty hard to 1. satisfy everyone, 2. move back to the previous state if it went too far.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

It's always been that way.    And it's entirely seperate from whether the enchanter class is properly tuned for gear appropriate content.  I submit that it is not, but that you don't really have a way to discern this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;hr size="2" width="100%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;And once a direction is given, it is pretty hard to 1. satisfy everyone, 2. move back to the previous state if it went too far.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;hr size="2" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;While I agree it's difficult to satisfy everyone completely, I think that there are some changes that would hit nearly all courts.  Additionally, as shown by the tuning of ranger buffs not all that long ago, Sony has -no- problems yanking a change if they decide it made us too good.  It's only when the changes make us too -bad- that it takes an act of god to get them to address it. =P&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Since it was brought up...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I've been an enchanter since June of 2000. I played without AA, without fancy spells, and I wore raw silk for a large portion of my enchanter's life. I used to be able to lock down six or seven mobs, with no resists. Even if they did resist, we had the tools we needed, namely stun, to get things under control and make us able to single mez the mobs.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We're lacking in those tools now. As was brought up, a large problem is that if we get large groups, we're limited in how to momentarily get them under control so we can lock them down. Plus there's the issue of resists. I don't want an irresistible mez necessarily, but there should be a much higher -to MR built into our mezzes.  We're supposed to be quick on the trigger, not Slowpoke Rodriguez.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I'll write more later. At work and break time's almost up.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I won't quote it as for the first time I agree with about everything you've said. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;My soluton really is for the dev's to read the work of Unmei, Yakk, Llan and a guy (from the fact his name has escaped me he must have retired.) and you &amp;nbsp;and then reply, in a locked thread if they need to with what they propose. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Really I'm passionate about the class but Unmei keeps proving me wrong , **SMURF** :smileyvery-happy:, and then suggesting exactly the right solution. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Bottom line all I need to be happy is around 70% success rate on multi pulls without dieing, multi for me is more than three as with three I can usually win, and raid and group desirabilility not based on buffs. I hate being a buffbot really . Others need the risk of charm to enjoy with appropriate reward. Both of these aren't going to happen.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Your slightly wrong about just accepting our lot, although when SOE wrongly removed effective stun to control AOE groups (And that still annoys me cause as with the over-reaction to the whiners about AFK experience the effect on others was minimal.) most chanters complained and then moved to charm. Charm was virulently opposed , sensibly&amp;nbsp;by the players mentioned above), but charm was always something the elite did cause they had the gear to survive. Unfortunately the whine fests about elite / non elite have been gathering apace again. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
