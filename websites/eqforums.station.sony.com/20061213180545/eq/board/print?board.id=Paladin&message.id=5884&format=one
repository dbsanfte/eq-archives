				Mujaki the Devourer even in PoN is currently bugged - It has been for the last month as advised by in-game CSR.<br><br>Basicly, you zone into PoN, get the emote that you should, go ahead and kill Mujaki like needed, and the shade will not spawn - thus not allowing you to progress with your epic.<br><br>It's been this way for a Month now, I have petitioned various times yet in-game CSR insists that there is nothing they can do about it.<br><br>Pretty annoying when a quest as substantial as the paladin 1.5 has been broken for over a month, and therfore not allowing players to complete their epic 1.5 and move onwards to the 2.0 !<br><div></div>
