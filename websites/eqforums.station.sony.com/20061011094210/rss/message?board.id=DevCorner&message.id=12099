    <description>This thread is to consolidate reports about line of sight bugs that have been popping up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Line of sight issues I'm interested in seeing more information about include:&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Targeting via clicking with mouse not working even though you are clicking right on it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spells that won't cast or land because you are blocked by something that really doesn't seem like it should be blocking.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Combat where you should be able to melee but can't see your target.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;The information I need in order for your post to be useful in tracking down this problem is the following:&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The zone you are in.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you were targeting, clicking, casting, combat, whatever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What race you are playing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you are shrunk or levitated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The exact coordinates you are at as shown by the /loc command.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The coordinates of your target at the time of LOS failure, which I know is going to be an approximation but as specific as you can get will really help. Within a unit or two.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The name of the NPC. This is because height affects the endpoints of the line segment used for the collision call.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Comments about what appears to be blocking the LOS to the target. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you are able, please do me a favor and take a screenshot of the situation and include a link to it in your post. If not, that's ok, I know it's a hassle to manage images on the web. The other information is most important.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you can provide the above information, your post will be very helpful in finding more cases to reproduce this problem. Without the above information, please refrain from posting in this thread, I need to solve this problem and I need very specific data to do so and would like to avoid off topic stuff in here. I've been working on other bugs (pathing, warping, etc) and haven't had a lot of time to investigate this yet so a set of good test cases would help speed this up for me quite a bit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One thing I have already confirmed is that some shrubs in qvic block LOS incorrectly due to a bug that appears to have been introduced about 18 months ago. The other day I wrote a tool to scan every model in every zone in all of everquest to find all models that can possibly cause an LOS problem due to this particular bug I found. While there were a fair number of models that met the criteria, the various reports players have posted about LOS problems included a number of other zones that I have confirmed do not include models that trigger this bug. So there is something else going on in addition to the bug I found.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There were some changes made to the LOS behavior which had to occur to support destructible object targeting &amp;amp; combat. It's likely the problems people are seeing are the result of that. I plan to do a test where I run the old code in parallel with the new code and trigger alerts when &amp;amp; if behavior is ever any different between them when dealing with regular targeting situations that don't include destructibles becuse that behavior should not have changed. With the data I hope to get from the players in this thread, I will test the various situations with this diagnostic code enabled and eventually figure out what went wrong. I have some locs to test already, but details are scarce and getting more info would be pretty helpful at this point.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks for any help getting details on this problem, it's appreciated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

      <description>Additional one I was able to replicate at will last night.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I frequently detroy eggs in Lavaspinners with rain spells. Usually I run away (being a cowardly mage n' all) after the cast so that if the egg spawns a drake it doesn't stomp on me immediately.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So anyway, rains now seem to be LoS for each wave. I cast, get the first wave hit, run around the corner (or over the bridge, whatever) and the second wave doesn't hit. I wonder what's taking so long, come back to check and the third wave hits - or I get no more hits if I've been slow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I definately don't go out of range (I usually only move back a few feet) and have been using this technique for eggys for ages. I can also replicate it in other situations - for example when pet-push moves a mob out of LoS just after raining, again I miss any waves that I'm not in LoS for.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On another note, bolt spells are nothing like reliable, but they are slightly better if you are above or below the mob - I definately land more fighting on slopes, but it's still crap and not really worth the potential mana loss.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So SoE - are there &lt;i&gt;any &lt;/i&gt;spells we are allowed to use?&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;wisestguy nameless server 71 mage i am haveing trouble with any of the bolt los spells in almost any zone i can be right in front of mob getting hit and not be able to land my 2 best spells, no resist message no you cannot see your target message they just use mana and do no damage this is extremely limiting my capabilities as a mage blade spells all land or give message no problem but do less then half of the damage that bolt line does. i have noticed this in acheva ruins, old sebilis, umbral planes, walls of slaughter, maidens eye and several other zones.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Hive (Instances)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Play a wizzy in human form, not shrunk, usually levved as it (seems) to help with LOS issues&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;sorry not better info yet, I will try and collect some to ammend or add to post.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the lowest part of the hive that has a large open area - next to the passage/canyon that is zone in area for The Hive 69.1 instance there are a large number of small plants on the ground.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These easily block LOS from multiple locs,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If GoM procs on wizzy (it lasts 18 seconds) it can expire whilst I try and find somewhere to cast from - very irritating.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An instance of trying to loot a mob (extemely irritating when have loot to collect from raid).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;u&gt;Citadal of Anguish.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stood over mob, changed position multiple times, cant right click loot, moved away from mob, various places and near and far clicked on mob to try and obtain a target..&amp;nbsp; Probably took five plus minutes to loot.&amp;nbsp; Was tempted to say 10 or 15 minutes but that is what it felt like, 5 is nearer to the time it took, eventually managed to get a target and type /loot&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another example:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;u&gt;Colbalt Scar.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am stood near the water by the otter camp nearest to zone to skyfire - there are rocks by where I stood. I am facing towards the otter camp.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Behind me, hundred feet, maybe more is the named dragon's corpse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When clicking on something to target (i use f8 and also cycle through targets in addition - but f8 is much less relaible than it used to be)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway I clicked on something to target and got the dragon's corpse in my target window - bearing in mind it is &lt;b&gt;behind &lt;/b&gt;me and I am &lt;b&gt;not &lt;/b&gt;facing it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I should be able to get relatively accurate locs for this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Was playing Human wizzy, unshrunk, on a horse, may of may not have been levved. (I prefer not to use lev, however in zones where LOS is an issue - general all to some extent, especially PoP onwards I do use it.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Old world zones are foar more target friendly than more recent expansions.&amp;nbsp; The instance with the dragon's corpse was a surprise, it has happened in other zones with npc/pc being targetted even when behind me, but this was a large distance behind me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I would guess that as they have far more flat planes and fewer 'clutter' on the ground to be one of the reasons why.they are more target friendly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;LoS issues are usually imo the result of 'eye candy' - but when a mob is a hundred feet tall and the eye cany can be measured in the inches, being told one is not able to see a mob is ludicrous, it spoils the whole immersion experience.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;u&gt;An example of F8 and LoS issues.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I know changes were made to targetting probably some years ago now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Before PoP was released I would multi-quad toilers in Maidens Eye.&amp;nbsp; The mainly live about the hill area towards Umbral Plains.&amp;nbsp; Running round on horse pressing F8 and using Flux Staff to pull would easily get me a pile of mobs.&amp;nbsp; Now going to ME (no I don't still experience there) and using F8 it takes longer to get the same numbers as F8 appears to require a more direct line from me to mob, and can be much more likely to trigger the 'you cant see the mob' note ( did I mention how silly that is when a hundred foot giant/dragon is stood in front of me?)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I remeber that the Flux Staff (favourite wizzy pulling item - instant click small debuffer) used to work even when the mob was totally out of LoS.&amp;nbsp; Other spells would not work but Flux Staff did.&amp;nbsp; Now Flux Staff requires the same LoS as any other spell (except pacification spells and collaboration and healing spells - maybe others).&amp;nbsp; It is these changes that have casued the issues of LoS to develope over the years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I suspect the spot of npc delegated for LoS is probably around the feet, I suggest moving it up, waist or chest hight.&amp;nbsp; This would be more realistic, as it would allow partially hidden mobs to be pulled (only being able to see 50 feet of a hundred foot mob shouldnt make it out of sight). An alternative would be to have more than one LoS spot,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Head, Waist, Feet, all three are checked, if one is visible, mob is in sight.&amp;nbsp; To save processor overheads on checking start with head, or waist and do feet last (if there is an&amp;nbsp; overhead with doing three checks).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So we see mob tag it and he brings any friends we couldnt see.&amp;nbsp; Sounds like more fun and mayhem, possibly a few deaths but that is a risk we take.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>I never noticed many LoS issues, but after the patch yesterday that 'fixed' them, I had real issues.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the fang-collection DoN quest, I had 4 bolts (molten slag) dissapear. Odd as I could stand in the same spot and rain the mob no problem.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thinking that it was just a mob-bug, I tested it on the eggs (you pop em open with a nuke to sometimes spawn an extra mob). Stationary, in front of the egg, plain view - on 5 egg-tests, 4 bolts went missing and I could rain everytime without moving.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These are a good way to test as the thing you are hitting is stationary so you can test it with different spells.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I've been in expeditions for ages, that was my first LS quest for a&amp;nbsp; long time, so I don't know if it's just the lavaspinners lair that's a problem. Certainly before yesterdays patch I was having no problems at all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kyz&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Confirmed. Bolt of Jerikor would not land for me in forgotten halls instance. hasn't worked since before the last patch. When levitating or on flat ground, while on horseback and casting at mobs (rats) directly in front of me &lt;i&gt;none &lt;/i&gt;of the "bolt" mage spells will land. Many of the Wizards I know are and have been complaining of the same issue since the last patch. I sent a /petition and was told bolts are working as intended. Also send in a /bug report with loc, mob I was fighting name and loc, zone, description and other info.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For an issue that was supposed to have been addressed and fixed on the last go around this sure seems to not be fixed. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On an unrelated note, I've sent in 3 /feedbacks asking why it isn't possible to institute a way to refund AA points for currency. WoW does this to try and take some of the currency out of the game and I think you'd find many people willing to do the same in EQ. Come SoE start listening. There are a lot of players that started early, left, and then came back to EQ1 since WoW and others couldn't deliver the goods. But if you aren't careful you run the risk of alienating even the die hard fans when you don't properly test and more importantly communicate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Demi Plane of Blood&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pulling by use of monk ranged attack&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Human&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shrunk&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I dont have any exact coordinates, but Ive had a general problem with a specific mob.&amp;nbsp; Whenever I try to pull Redfang from any of his various spawn locations, its nearly impossible to just simply range attack him.&amp;nbsp; Instead you have to get on an almost completely level plane with him in order to range attack him.&amp;nbsp; I think the problem is the windows he enjoys inhabiting, since screecher bats are pulled from along the same ramp area without this problem.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Its kind of annoying because you often have to run past where you would want to tag him in order to efficiently pull him.&amp;nbsp; More often than not you have to run past the area where you feel you should be able to tag him for a good distance, tag him, then geronimo off the ramp, or hope you somehow slip past him on the way down.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;My LOS issue deals with not being able to cast on a murkglider in WoS in the undead area.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Running through the tunnels I was at LOC&amp;nbsp; -2022.77,&amp;nbsp; 736.66, 81.81 looking almost directly WEST at a murkglider.&amp;nbsp; I had DMF on, and the entire murk except for MAYBE a few pixels of tentacles was in view.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Creeping up slowly he attacked me when I got to LOC -2022.94, 751.45, 82.36, which I would assume was full line of sight.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;This sort of thing happens elsewhere when I solo in the undead murk caves, but this is probalby the best and most visual example I can think of.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Thanks so much for asking for our input, I for one appreciate it.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;In Demi plane of Blood, just&amp;nbsp;three of the numerous LOS issues I have seen are:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Performer event, standing on the table in the dining room, the chairs block my nukes with my druid&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Sisters event, standing on the bed in Brenda's room, the bed posts block my casting, even with the mob inches away from me I can not cast on it.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;PoFire, when pulling the mobs off the platform just outside of tables area, same thing, I can see them clear as day, but a small pole is blocking my LOS&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;This does not include the looting issues with every zone I have been in....&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Thanks&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;The zone you are in. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Demi Plane but all zone&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;If you were targeting, clicking, &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;What race you are playing &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;70 cleric Dorf&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;shrunk &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Levitated on a mount - neither&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Unable to click on PC or PC corpses. It has always been bad, but after the Directx 9.0c it is all but impossible to click on someone via the mouse. Numerous times since the patch I have to circle and circle a corpse trying to find a spot that will let me click on it. During raids I don't have time to /tar people to drag and rezz. I have repeated had to crouch and almost go inside the person or their corpse to target them. This is happening raid wide and is really making things impossible. This is happening to us (my raid guild) in everything we have raided since the patch. I am not sure where the anchor point for PC or their corpse are or how that is configured, it needs to be addressed. I have been going into 3rd person mode and pulling back to extreme distance to target.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Thanks,&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>The P3 PoTime issue is quite new. I am a wizard and always used to stand behind the teleporter and cast. Not anymore.&amp;nbsp; I find the same if true of many small objects previously I could cast through them but now I cannot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However what I really want to ask is if small objects breaking LOS is intentional.&amp;nbsp; For example in the MPG trials the central platform is surrounded by many pillars. While these are quite narrow they can break LOS for my wizard spells.&amp;nbsp; Is this done intentionally to penalise guilds who can't hold a mob still or is it an accidental effect from zone decoration? &lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

Within a unit or two.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The name of the NPC. This is because height affects the endpoints of the line segment used for the collision call.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Comments about what appears to be blocking the LOS to the target. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you are able, please do me a favor and take a screenshot of the situation and include a link to it in your post. If not, that's ok, I know it's a hassle to manage images on the web. The other information is most important.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you can provide the above information, your post will be very helpful in finding more cases to reproduce this problem. Without the above information, please refrain from posting in this thread, I need to solve this problem and I need very specific data to do so and would like to avoid off topic stuff in here. I've been working on other bugs (pathing, warping, etc) and haven't had a lot of time to investigate this yet so a set of good test cases would help speed this up for me quite a bit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One thing I have already confirmed is that some shrubs in qvic block LOS incorrectly due to a bug that appears to have been introduced about 18 months ago. The other day I wrote a tool to scan every model in every zone in all of everquest to find all models that can possibly cause an LOS problem due to this particular bug I found. While there were a fair number of models that met the criteria, the various reports players have posted about LOS problems included a number of other zones that I have confirmed do not include models that trigger this bug. So there is something else going on in addition to the bug I found.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There were some changes made to the LOS behavior which had to occur to support destructible object targeting &amp;amp; combat. It's likely the problems people are seeing are the result of that. I plan to do a test where I run the old code in parallel with the new code and trigger alerts when &amp;amp; if behavior is ever any different between them when dealing with regular targeting situations that don't include destructibles becuse that behavior should not have changed. With the data I hope to get from the players in this thread, I will test the various situations with this diagnostic code enabled and eventually figure out what went wrong. I have some locs to test already, but details are scarce and getting more info would be pretty helpful at this point.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks for any help getting details on this problem, it's appreciated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;Razorthorn, Sullon's Tower.&amp;nbsp; Anywhere on the ramp that runs up to the top of the tower if you stand on one platform down and try to cast or throw at an npc up the ramp you cannot do so without levitation or if you run up and hit them face to face.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>There's an odd one in PoTime Phase 3 (Where Supernatural Avatar spawns at end) If you are behind the teleporter to P4, you can fire arrows at mobs on the other side, but cannot cast... same as firing arrows through doors...&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>I'm sorry I cant give specific locs, but something I have noticed across all zones is targetting a player on the new Horse models has become VERY difficult.  Even when on the horse it is difficult to target other players and npc's.  This issue began with the introduction of the new models, it did not happen with old ones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The other issue I have seen and can repeat it everytime, is with archery in East Freeport.  There are two guards outside the Freeport Militia house that I cannot hit with arrows, but any spell lands with ease.  I can stand there for 10 minutes firing arrows into them and no damage registers and they do not aggro me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Sorry, I don't have any locs, I just saw this thread today.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Zone: Plane of Storms&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Dates: 3/15-3/19/2006 (after fabled patch)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Action: Select mob with mouse click&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;PC: WE Druid, not shrunk, but levitated&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;MOB:  typhoon/hurricane loroks, but also many of the other forest side mobs&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Other specifics:  I use the &amp;quot;far up and back&amp;quot; camera view, hit F9 twice, then DELETE and ALT-UP_ARROW all the way.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In many cases, there is tree canopy between my view (but not my PC) and the mob.  Basically I couldn't target anything by mouse click.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I did all my targetting with &amp;quot;cycle nearby mobs&amp;quot;.  Casting worked fine.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I had never noticed this behavior in PoS before.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Tat&lt;/div&gt;</description>
