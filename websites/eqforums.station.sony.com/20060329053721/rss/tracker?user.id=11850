Such is the way of EQ. Something that's been missing since the MPG group trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by RhumbaKween on &lt;span class="date_text"&gt;03-25-2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;11:59 AM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This game would be even easier than it is now if they started designing new content so you did not need a tank or a healer or some damage mitigation class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And to the OP. There already is lots of lower end content that you can get away without one of the key archetypes. But it is older content. 69.1 is just sort of odd in that it just happens to be the best xp out there, and pretty much anyone can do it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

If you have maxed on AAs, you represent a MINISCULE portion of the population in EverQuest. A quick look at EQPlayers indicates that a infintesimal number of players (somewhere on the order of .00001% of total characters, POSSIBLY .01% of active, regularily played characters) are at maximum AAs. Of active players in a quick search of Warriors (where you can see the last played and concentrate on the higher end ones), a FRACTIONAL number have maxed out their AAs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hassan al-Nasir&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Audacia Venator&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;First off, Provide your exact numbers because I don't buy it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the next expansion (assuming October range). Anyone with over 1100 AA's will likely be maxed if they play at all. And the reality is that probably the last 150 AA's have no benefit to the character. By the looks of things on EQRankings.com an average of about 130 players per server are above the 1100 mark. So you're looking at 2800 players totally maxed by the next expansion. Assuming they release at a normal date. That's far from your .01 percent number you list... at .01 that would be 2.8 million active players, which there just aren't.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Of my friends that still play the game, we have several beastlords and a druid, assorted other support classes but no tank, shaman (or chanter) or cleric. There are SOME things we can do (69.1 hards with kite group is a lot of fun), but to advance in this game there is just TOO much you cannot do without the Holy Trinity:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;You are confused about the Trinity... It was strictly Warrior, Cleric, Enchanter. The need for the Trinity is gone from the game, thank goodness. With that said, yes you still need a bit of balance in your group. To do much you are going to need a tank, some form of CrowdControl/Slower and some healing. But I've done a ton lately with Druids/Shamans healing. And I've seen Beastlords, Chanters, Shammys and Bards all do great jobs slowing. All the 3 tank classes can tank, and depending on gear/content, other classes can tank also. And In many places you do not need true mezz if you have some extra healing so that your rooters can root park mobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All that to say. The trinity has been dead for awhile now. Which is good. But you do still need to have a bit of a balanced group as far as archetypes are concerned. You need a tank, You need a healer, and you need some damage mitigation. Sure you can still do some non conventional groups without, but there will always be lots of stuff that you cannot do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by RhumbaKween on &lt;span class="date_text"&gt;03-24-2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;12:11 PM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The only thing that seperates you as a 70 level warrior from any other 70 level warrior is Gear and AA. Gear in particular for a Warrior, which means in pick up groups Warriors who raid have an immediate and significant advantage as their HP/AC is light years ahead of casual non raid Warriors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hassan al-Nasir&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Audacia Venator&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This did not used to be quite as true. But in the age of everything being easy it is getting to be more and more true. It used to be that there were definte teirs of content. Your high end warriors/knights had really no desire to try to get groups in easy zones, and likewise most lower end tanks knew they had no business tanking in the higher end zones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But now we're at a point where the best xp zone in the game is 69.1 which both a fairly low end tank can handle but yet the high end tank gets great xp there also, and since there is no better spot to get xp, they do vie for the same spot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However the solution is not holding back more people. That will just cause more people to leave the game once Vanguard comes out. The solution is to truly add more challenge at the high end so that those raid tanks have something to do that's challenging to them, rather than spending time in easy spots like 69.1 taking spots aways from group geared tanks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From what I've seen thus far there is only one remotely challenging task in PoR (Hero's Challenge Hard). It's very sad that that is the case. But that will continue to make sure that those low end tanks have to fight against higher end tanks for spots since the content is so easy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well then I'll have to plead ignorance. For us it works great, but I can see you're point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hardesting things we've done are still pretty old. Korlach, The Ikk's, Tirranun, Time. We've not come to a place raiding small where it makes sense. But it may also be that over time Chanters are just better able to deal with content, and we're experiencing the benefits of that now, thus allowing us to do with 30 what used to take 55. By the time we get to Anguish/Demiplane, who knows, it may be more efficient to have chanters mezz the trash.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

That leaves people who haven't had time to &amp;quot;finish&amp;quot; the previous expansions out in the cold. Try getting a group to do DoN progression missions now, or DoDh spell missions. It is almost impossible. If a new expansion came out today, those people who haven't had a chance to complete their PoR goals, would have every right to complain. No one is forcing them to leave old content, except the need to go where the groups are.&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I agree with what you say. But I want to point out. Oow did not suffer the same abandonment as DoN and DoDh. Why not? Too put it simply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1) Oow had some very challenging content that was almost impossible initially for all but the best gear. MPG group trials and RSS were very very difficult initially. DoN and DoDh did not have a challenge that remotely approached the challenges of Oow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2) Getting loot in Oow was not a cake walk like it was in DoN and DoDh. There was no way you could expect to do something 1x and get everything that was available to you. I'd swear we did some of those MPG group trials upwards of 30x to get what we needed. We did almost nothing in DoN other than doing enough missions for faction, we spent the whole time still doing Oow. In DoDh it was very possible to do things a few times and get everything you needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3) Spells also provided a big reason to keep going back, even though DoDh added this, there were not as many places that they were available, except for Dreadspire. And Dreadspire has so many other issues, it's simply not worth spending time in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until the dev team truly starts adding super challenging single group content with great but rare itemization that much of the player base can grow into, people will continue to abandon expansions as new ones come out, because there will be nothing left there for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And let me say Rage is a great zone. I'll be interested to see how much longevity it has. It's tough for a single group at my level. There are some very nice augs available, some of the other loot is pretty weak if you've gotten most of the cursor dodh rewards. It's not terribly difficult to get to (part of Dreadspires problem). The XP is great. It will be interesting to see how it works out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by RhumbaKween on &lt;span class="date_text"&gt;03-23-2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;04:57 PM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I'd hate for them to be counted as being an active player under 70, because it would be inacurrate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The true number should be. Look at all the mains (played the most outside the bazaar) on an account in a set period of time, and what percentage of those mains fall into each level range. That would give the most accurate picture of where the playerbase sits. So for myself I have 2 accounts, and my mains which play the most on each is level 70, so I would have 2 count in the level 70 pool.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The only alts I'm interested in are ones that help my main. Whether through helping friends do things, or help with tradeskills in some way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea of wanting to play a level 1 again does not appeal to me in anyway. I'll find another game vs. play an alt in EQ for fun. Many of the people I know only play alts when they run out of stuff to do with their main. It's not by choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This idea that most high levels that just want to play alts is just misguided. We don't. We want challenging content to do with out mains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And with that said,they should &lt;strong&gt;absolutely&lt;/strong&gt; do things to fix the lower levels. They desperately need to find a way to bring the lower level players on a server together. The Tutorial was great, but it did not go far enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recently leveled a foraging alt to help with tradeskills. In doing this I leveled the first 10 in the Tutorial. It was alot of fun seeing 40+ in the there on Tunare. However, as soon as I got out of the Tutorial (the point at which I started powerleveling my forager), it was rather frustrating seeing players not being able to find groups because there were so few around to group with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key, in my opinion, is to find away to herd all of the sub 55's together somehow. So that it is very easy for them to find groups in real content, not MM's. If MM's showed us anything. Much of the lower level problem is finding groups. Adding more content will only exasperate the problem, unless it is made easier for them to find groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's face it. The majority of the content still in the game is for the lower levels. For characters in their teens there are probably 20-25 available zones for them to group in that would provide challenge. For your high end groupers, there certainly not 25 zones available in the game that provide challenge. Again, it's not the lack of content, but rather its diversity that is the problem.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

We can disagree on whether efficiency matters. For the crew I raid with, efficency is the name of the game since we raid with small numbers. In a raid force of 30, having 5 mobs in camp in ikkinz and having 1/3 of our raid force involved in offtanking, we'd take a huge efficiency hit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And I agree many do it this way. But certainly not all do. Most likely they do it this way based on whatever class yells the loudest. The chanters I know would not stand by for it though. And because they would not stand by for it, they have an integral roll to trash clearing. If your enchanters are perfectly willing to let others handle crowd control, then they have very little place to be upset if they feel they have no role.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Efficency is about speed. If a cleric is healing, they are not doing damage. If an offtank is tanking, they are doing less damage then they would do from behind another mob... And nothing says you can't be tanking 2 at a time so that people always have an active assist. The problem comes when you get 5+ in camp, all being offtanked with healers. That is way slower in the long run.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Except that devoting said healer and knight for 10seconds to lockdown is much different than for the time it takes for the mob to die. It's all a matter of efficiency. You don't just offtank, simply because it took 3 people to lock something down, because it's simply not as efficient. If you do, it's so that some class feels that they are doing something, at the expence of enchanters.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Sure if chanters were expected to do it alone, you'd be right,  but a knight helping the chanters get things locked down for 20 seconds is generally plenty. Crowd control should not be a one person job, just like offtanking or main tanking. High MR is lots of fun because it really highlights how well your crowd control team can work together.&lt;br&gt;</description>

There are lots of zerg guilds that have that very mentality. If you are a chanter, and you are in a guild that does that. Just leave. They are obviously showing that they don't understand how to be efficient, and more importantly you will be bored out of your mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And obviously if you're clearing super easy trash that's 20 levels below you, don't worry about it. But if you're doing a GoD raid, and the RL insists that mezzable things be off-tanked. It's very clear that said raid leader does not understand how much more eficient it is to have a chanter dealing with multiple mobs, vs. needing tank+healer on each mob or 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a problem with Chanters, but a problem with dumb guilds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

But we are expecting them to bat over .100&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problems we've seen are not a few items being off, but itemization being entirely re-done after release. PoR, has been very lackluster. With the best items from the expansion thus far in the group game coming from a very easy monster mission and an easy arcstone task. The arena charm is nice. I don't think you'll see big outrage simply because we have seen a few upgrades for the high end group player, even if they haven't come from challenging content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by RhumbaKween on &lt;span class="date_text"&gt;03-23-2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;09:50 AM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;You left out the part, that by the &amp;quot;plan&amp;quot; there should have been no upgrades in the 2nd expansion. That's what this is all about. That the &amp;quot;plan&amp;quot; is flawed, if for a segment of the population there are no upgrades for a slot for 4 expansions.</description>

I don't know if s/he actually meant that SOE did this, but if that is what was meant then tell us which &lt;u&gt;class&lt;/u&gt; had to wait for which &lt;u&gt;four expansions&lt;/u&gt;, enduring them without gear advancement in &lt;u&gt;any slot&lt;/u&gt;. It sounds pretty absurd to me, so I'm willing to accept the fact that RhumbaKween is simply exaggerating to get a point across, although that really casts doubt on anything else s/he asserts in these forums.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Taking phrases in context helps lots. I was referring to pre item retune of both DoN and DoDh. If you want an example look at the neck I wear. Single group neck from Oow. No upgrade for a tank since Oow in the single group game. Prior to the retune of DoDh, there was not an upgrade ANY of the MPG single group trial loots. And if you read Zajeer's post, it sounds like the problem with DoDh was the content, the itemization was perfectly fine in it's initial iteration, which would have meant there would have continued to not be any upgrades there. And thus far the only upgrade in PoR to that loot (now 3 expansions old), is the back evolving item that is super easy to get.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description>
