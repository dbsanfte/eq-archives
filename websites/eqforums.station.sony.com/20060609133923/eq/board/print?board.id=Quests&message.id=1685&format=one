<P>The Lake Pebbles appear to be advancing the task correctly at the moment.&nbsp; I was able to loot two and both were counted when I did this task on Test.&nbsp; Let me know if anyone runs into trouble on this again.</P>

<DIV>Ok, now that is just silly.&nbsp; Since you have to "explore the orb" to get into sebilis in the first place, why the bloody .... should you have to go back to it again after going to the bar?&nbsp; I suppose its no big problem for non-gaters, since that is the way out anyway, but still seems senseless to me.</DIV><BR>

<P>I agree on this one.&nbsp; I've gone ahead and swapped the places on these steps.&nbsp; You'll now be asked to explore the orb leading to the ruins first and then the bar second.</P>
