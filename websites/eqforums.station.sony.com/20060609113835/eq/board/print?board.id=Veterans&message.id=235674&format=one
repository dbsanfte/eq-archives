				<div></div><div></div>A weekly question won't necessarily mean a weekly answer.<br>That is considered communication? Why ask questions if no answer is to be expected? We are to ask rhetorical questions of the devs?<br><br>I could understand they might need time to answer questions if we quizzed them on topics they might not know about but I'm sure most questions would be confined to EQ, at least for the first few months. Are we to believe that they don't have any plan for CHeal (cleric question) or that they couldn't be bothered supplying an answer? Prathun posts about needing to look into things, kk he is new to his post but are all the devs new to their posts too? Surely there is a plan or a direction in place for the game? Why is there a problem getting answers?<br><br>Remember Halfling Hodgepodge Extreme - Q&amp;A?<br>Q&amp;A- <a target="_blank" href="message?board.id=Veterans&amp;message.id=115734">http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Veterans&amp;message.id=115734</a><br>Discussion thread- <a target="_blank" href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Veterans&amp;message.id=110789">http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Veterans&amp;message.id=110789</a><br>Player discussion thread opened before Kyths one- <a target="_blank" href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Veterans&amp;message.id=111161">http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Veterans&amp;message.id=111161</a><br><br>That was very limited in what players could ask, when they could ask and how they could ask and what devs would answer and when they would answer and how they would answer and eventually it just died due to lack of dev input. The problem there wasn't the players.<br><br>Just to remind people how the Hodgepodge started........<br><br><blockquote><hr>Mikar wrote:<br><div>"I forgot to mention that the first edition of Halfling Hodgepodge Extreme is scheduled to be up on EQLive on Friday, September 23rd.", Kytn</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Pardon me for asking this - but why wont there be a set of&nbsp;answers this month?</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>By not answering a single question for more than <strong><u>5 weeks</u></strong> this entire things gets an air of stalling to it - rather than&nbsp;the&nbsp;fresh air&nbsp;from wanting to communicate with us I hope its meant to give.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>So, I humbly ask that you put to your bosses that if this is meant as anything but a charade and&nbsp;I assume it is meant as more then answering questions should not wait 5 weeks. Rather it should happen soon&nbsp;&nbsp;- and without the use of the dreaded "just wait and see what we have in the coming expansion" kind of answers. Disclose some real info or dont bother, please.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>I am looking forward to seeing what happens. My jaded side is screaming no hard questions will be answered in real detail or any time soon - but my optimistic side is trying to convince me you wouldnt try to pull a fast one on us. Before the 5 week part my optimistic side still had a chance - but now I fear my jaded side took a huge lead. Please put my jadeness to shame by getting us some honest straightforward answers to a good deal of the questions asked - much sooner than in 5 weeks from now.</div><p>Message Edited by Mikar on <span class="date_text">08-16-2005</span><span class="time_text">06:43 PM</span><br></p><hr></blockquote><div></div><p>Message Edited by Maebe on <span class=date_text>06-06-2006</span> <span class=time_text>10:41 AM</span>
