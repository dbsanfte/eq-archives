    <title>Some FAQs about Veteran Rewards and Eligibility</title>

&lt;P&gt;*Veteran Rewards are based on the entitled time on your account: how many paid days your account has been subscribed&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;*You can see an ESTIMATED time for how much time an account has by typing /play in game. This will give you the time in years, but it is rounded so there may be some discrepancies.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;*Veteran rewards are updated once a month, therefore if your account rolls over to another year of rewards in the middle of the month you will not see a change until the next month&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;*If you bought a year's subscription your account will be credited for that year. Your entitled time will not increase until that entire year has passed and you sign up for another subscription (be that a 1 month, 3 month, or year plan).&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;*No matter how much played time a particular character has, Veteran rewards are based on the account. If you move your character to a different account, your character will reflect the appropriate number of Vet rewards for THAT account...not the previous one.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;*Known dates where Veteran issues arose: 9/13 and 10/31 some people were affected in either of the following ways&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;OL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;They were able to claim twice on the same character and therefore used one too many of their available /veteran claims&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Their entitled time was wiped, and should now be restored to the correct amount through the database&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;*Any time that was free or unpaid on the account will not be counted towards the Veteran rewards -- including the first 30 day free trial period and any lapses in billing subscriptions.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;*If you get an error in game (until recently it said please try to /veteran again in a few minutes) that means either a. You are not yet eligible for Veteran rewards, or b. You do not have any claims left to use&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;*Caveat - if they used two claims on the same character through a bug they may be entitled to be reimbursed one of those claims.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
