    <description>I have been worried that the progression might go too fast... But&#xD;
lately I have been thinking that it may go at a nice rate for me&#xD;
considering I enjoyed all the content up until Gates of Discord was&#xD;
released.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
My question is this, How difficult will it be for guilds to unlock&#xD;
expansions such as Luclin, and then Planes of Power? How difficult is&#xD;
Sleepers tomb, VT, and Temple of Sssraraazhahiaa to clear with the&#xD;
available items? Do you think bosses these major zones will be the&#xD;
triggers for&amp;nbsp; expansions such as Luclin/PoP.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
I ask because I started raiding once PoP was released so I missed the&#xD;
chance to really see how difficult these pre-PoP encounters were with&#xD;
the available armor.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

      <description>It's rarely an effective use of raid time to worry a lot about cockblocking other guilds.&amp;nbsp; The only time it really is worth it is if there is a bottleneck mob that can easily be kept dead preventing others from being able to access a raid zone you want to keep for yourself.&amp;nbsp; Keeping all the ST key droppers down is pretty hard, and wastes a lot of time if you don't need ST keys.&amp;nbsp; Keeping Emp Ssra down to prevent another guild from getting into vex thal returns a lot of good loot and only requires 1 raid per week or so, so that is often worth it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The number of mobs where it's worth it is pretty small though.&amp;nbsp; Emp Ssra, Rallos Zek, maybe a few others.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Would I **SMURF** another guild if I thought it was in our best interests?&amp;nbsp; Yes, but that doesn't mean I think it's often in our best interests.&amp;nbsp; If you spend a lot of time worrying about the competition, you'll end up slowing your own progression too much.&amp;nbsp; Most of the time, you are better off focusing on your own progression.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;It took over a month to start seeing lvl50's in the original game, and they were very few and far between. It takes a week of playing 24 hours a day (several people taking shifts on the same character) for a group to reach lvl50 with all the expansion zones(better xp and loot, not to mention transportation). I give it 3 weeks until anyone reaches lvl50 and another 2 or 3 until there are enough 42+ to take down vox and naggy.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;It will only get harder as it goes. Not to level but to take down boss mob. It may take 4-5 groups to take down naggy in classis gear, but how many are they going to need in kunark, and the further they get ahead the harder it will be to find the numbers to take the bosses down. Anyone who thinks they are going to unlock all the expansions in 6months is going to get a slap back to reality when they are&amp;nbsp;still shouting for a tp&amp;nbsp;and auctioning for a new breastplate in the ec tunnel 6 months down the road. goodluck&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Of course WoW raiding is easier then EQ, that's why we're coming back. The thing is, myself and a handful of my guildies that are coming over, 2box EQ/WoW. So, no I haven't forgotten what real skill is in a game. If PVP didn't exist in Warcraft, the game would be the most worthless pile of crap ever developed. I personally refuse to use a single addon in WoW and I'm leading a guild that has AQ40 on farm status. There are already level 50's on the beta server...that's without entire guilds coming over to have perma groups for the leveling process.&amp;nbsp;A few of my guildies that got into beta are already low 40s,&amp;nbsp;that being extremely casual exping, lots of solo/exploring, and lots of genuine testing.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;One thing I will admit. I MAY be underestimating the difficulty of the Vox/Naggy encounter in pure classic gear. So yes, while there will certainly be level 50's in abundance within 2 weeks and less, I'm not sure how hard it'll be to down the flagged mobs. Honestly I'd be ecstatic if they made the original planes part of the flagging process. I don't care if it takes 4 months! to down all the mobs needed to open Kunark. Leaving out&amp;nbsp;Hate, Fear, Sky, and Mischief as part of the flagging process is a travesty imo.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;In the end, however the server is still in Beta. They may&amp;nbsp;decide to put everything on a hard timer. They may decide to open up expansions the minute bosses are taken down. They may decide to put in a quest that involves killing every single boss from Emperor Crush to the Hand of Veeshan. No one really knows&amp;nbsp;yet. And you know what? If Kunark opens too fast, they may decide to put the breaks on and totally change the flagging process down the line. The point is, play the game how you want to,&amp;nbsp;and don't worry about a few guilds wanting to break the server in a matter of months. Laters~&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;As was already mentioned, yes there will be minimum time constraints for unlocking an expansion.&amp;nbsp; SO even if a group of people flies to max level&amp;nbsp; in a week or 2 and manages to find the "key" to unlocking the next expansion if the minimum time has not been met the expansion will not unlock.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>I'm a casual gamer, but im afraid i may get sucked back into this game lol.  I don't want the server opened up fast to expansions but i think it sounds fun seeing who gets what done first.  That is one of the best parts of eq, seeing who has what it takes to succeed.  At first i was kinda iffy about this server becuase i thought it would open to fast, but looking at it now i think it sounds like its going to be really fun.</description>

EQ is quite low on the respect spectrum and very high on the &amp;quot;who gives a rat's ass?&amp;quot; spectrum.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You keep saying I'll feel bitter, but guess what? Been playing MMOs for years and haven't felt bitter yet. I'm sure I could devote the time to get into any guild I like, but the difference is, I'm not interested in raiding, whereas you'll probably cry if your guild misses a kill.</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;hr&gt;doublea42 wrote:&lt;br&gt;I'm not measuring respect.  But they will get it.  Uber guilds have been getting it for years.  Some will hate them yeah, but they would hate anybody who is better than they are.  That's just the way it is.   And nobody will feel worse for losing a boss kill than an NBA player will for losing a game.  Afterall, this is a game. &lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You see, there's that attitude again. Being in a so-called &amp;quot;uber&amp;quot; guild doesn't make one better than anyone else. You have this delusional idea in your head that just because you raid you're somehow above the average player. ANYONE can raid if they are willing to devote the time to it. The only thing that being in a raid guild means is that you sat in front of a monitor for more hours per day than the casual guy. This does not = skill.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;NBA/NFL/NHL etc. players do what they do for a career. They get paid for it, it's their life, so they have a bit more invested in each game and are arguably deserving of respect. EQ is nothing but a pasttime, and the only people who respect someone for a pasttime are other wannabe's who already have that same arrogant, egotistical attitude and want the gear so they can pretend to justify it.</description>
