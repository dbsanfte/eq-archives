    <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I think that SOE should combine all the servers and split thecharacters up level.&lt;br&gt;Server 1- 0 to 20 server with only the Everquest trilogy enabled and only a 5 lvl tutorial or just an indroduction tutorial like way back in the day.On this server players actually start in their home city imagune that. They do the noobie armor quest and so on. When they ding 21 they move on to Server 2 .&lt;br&gt;Server 2- 21 to 40 Players now work more on tradeskills they also do their 2nd armor quest  with this server LDON and Lucilin are enabled&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Server 3- 41 to 50 Players work together to progress and start their epics  and twilight armor quest if they don't get their drop they can switch to AA xp towait and stay on a server that focuses on Naggy Raids and so on until they get what they need to progress.Also LoY expansion is enabled need at these lvls for spell drops.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Server 4 51 to 60 Planes of Power expansion is enabled for use. Here players finish epics begin Planar progression and do raids and get flags that otherwise the odds are likely they wouldn't get&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Server 5 61 to 65 GoD and OOW are enabled. Here players begin epic 1.5 's finish planar progression and  proceed to more new and exciting zones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Server 6 66 to 70 DON,DoDH and soon PoR are enabled now you can experience not just the game but can say you experienced  all aspects of the game like only being able to wear banded cause that was the best there was and so on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I realize that this would do away of twinking and for that I apologize  but it is the only way to bring the full experience back to the game.&lt;br&gt;Also I understand that ppl have made friends with higher and lower lvl players than themselves this is why guilds and guild chat should be able to span all servers. you can already send tells form one server to another.&lt;br&gt;I also had this point brought to my attention I won't be able to get temp. You will if you are high enough to to be on the server where ppl have it. You don't miss what you don't have.&lt;br&gt;Tradeskills would become important once again. Skills would be maxed instead of 15 levels behind. Think about this and post your comments ant suggestions pls and I will read and most importantly SOE can see that ppl want a change in this regard and what we are willing to loose and or give up to get. thankyou all for your valuable time. The # of each server for server 1 and 2 would be one a piece. Server 3 and 4 probably 2 each and 5 and 6 probably 2 or 3 each.&lt;br&gt;This may need a little tweeking that is why I am open for suggestions and Sony should be too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by GemNaturesfury on &lt;span class="date_text"&gt;01-31-2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;02:56 AM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;SOE makes level dependent servers and forces my characters to move, I will cancel my accounts.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Umm.... yeah, read the first page of posts, and must agree with the general line of thoughts. This idea of level based servers sucks. To the OP, SOE has a nice device in-game, I believe it is accessed by /lfg. Might wanna give it a try before you ruin the game for other people.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;I think the easiest way to accomplish what the OP wants (all the newbies in one spot) would be to restart the practice of designating a newbie server, and then offer one free character move off that server, once the chars reach 50+.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was discussed, to death even, when PoP came out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would destroy the community. We know each other on the servers. We would be forced to move on every few levels? Meet new people, go through all that again. Anyway, have you ever been through a server split? It's brutal. Who goes where? Half your friends are going to the new server! It's late and I'm tired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I guess you could choose between 15 different servers when you hit level 51. Come to think of it, this was also discussed extensively when Velious came out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;I am sorry the original poster felt a bit beat up.&amp;nbsp; I thought it was a reasonable civil thread most of the time, even though people with strong opinions were disagreeing loudly.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Personally, I didn't consider the original post about making other suggestions, just suggestions on the multi-server concept put forth.&amp;nbsp; There is (was) a thread on TNZ, called The Future is New Players that GemNaturesfury (if still reading) might find interesting, linkied here:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>The OP massively over reacted.  I can't see anything different in the response to this than I have ever read in response to anything else on these boards.  In fact I saw some fairly positive responses with good advice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One person pointed out the big problem of veteran's bringing newer people into the game.  What I think is missing here is the OP lacks any motivation to lead.  The players are there with the toons on the servers I have toons on they just tend to lack leadership.  There are no people forming groups, people sit around LFG all the time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You also don't have to have a &amp;quot;perfect group&amp;quot; with a slower, healer, tank.  You could do content where a ranger can tank (which is actually very wide and flexible at the lower/mid levels) which gives you 4 tank classes to use.  If needed a druid could main heal, but at the lower/mid levels this would limit content a little, but there is still a lot of content.  Etc..&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What you are wanting to do is seperate the entire community, create a further gap and a huge one between new players and older players.  It would destroy the game, literally.  Instead of looking at what would help you if it was changed in the game look at what you can use in the game already to help you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is no reason you should have to sit LFG for 2 hours.  Look up who is LFG find a spot based off what classes and put together a group it is that simple.  Find some quests you can do, get a group of friends.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For that matter where is your friends list?  I doubt you would be posting this if you had compiled a decent friends list.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>I simply asked for other peoples idea's to bring larger number's of lower level players together. In my own way I created a senerio that obviously noone likes but only one person has offered any idea or half an idea to do somewhat the same thing. This is not playing a game:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Palyer X stands in POK and cast fire burst&lt;br&gt;evocation 166&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Player X  stands in PoK cast once again fire burst&lt;br&gt;no skill up&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;and does this for hours on end trying to keep skills maxed because he/she is having to do MM to to PL himself through the empty void that is level 20 thru 60. A real mind numbing empty experience. I am sorry that you don't like my idea. I wish you would have posted ideas of your own instead of trying to belittle and rip me a new one. It is truly unfortunate that you see your way of playing the only way to play and the fact is that ppl come back and leave again because they enjoy the mid level game and it is no longer there. I twink now because you have to. I buy plat to buy spells that are outragously priced why because you have to. There is no longer a way to earn these and someone said something about server population well its on a steady decline with the way things are now. Sorry I asked for ideas from you ppl and instead of giving them you sat on your pedestal and flamed.I said a couple of times my idea might not be the way to go please submit yours to trying to find a cure to this problem. Sorry to say most didn't read that part of it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffcc"&gt;&amp;quot;It is truly unfortunate that you see your way of playing the only way to play and the fact is that ppl come back and leave again because they enjoy the mid level game and it is no longer there.&amp;quot;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is where you are wrong.  The people responding to your post are not the ones saying there is &amp;quot;only way to play.&amp;quot;  The current game allows hundreds of ways to play the game.  It integrates a diverse group of people who all have the ability to choose how they play the game.  If your proposal were implemented, it would prohibit many many current play styles and offer no real benefit to the player community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffcc"&gt;&amp;quot;I twink now because you have to. I buy plat to buy spells that are outragously priced why because you have to&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffcc"&gt;. There is no longer a way to earn these.&amp;quot;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just plain false.  You twink because you &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; you have to.  You can play the game without twinking.  My son joined a new server and took his character to 50 in two weeks time.  There was no way to twink.  You buy plat because you &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;think&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/em&gt;you have to.  I have never bought plat or anything else.  I know lots of way to make good money in the game.  I could start a new character on a new server, no friends, no one to help me, and buy all spells 1-68 long before I could use them.  The problem isn't that there aren't ways to make money in the game.  The problem is that you do not know how to make money or have no interest in doing what is required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffcc"&gt;&amp;quot;Sorry I asked for ideas from you ppl and instead of giving them you sat on your pedestal and flamed.&amp;quot;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I saw some flames (emphasis on the word &amp;quot;some&amp;quot;), but primarily people posted why they felt that your idea would not work.  There is a huge difference between flaming and debating an issue.  I'd say that 90% of the post here addressed the issues with your proposal.  If you cannot live with people having a different opinion that you do, then you should probably not ask everyone for their opinion.  If you cannot respect that others have a different opinion than you, you will never get respect for yours. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don't fall in love with your own proposal, because it makes it so that you cannot see the faults with it.  Any change will need to be for the general improvement for the game.  If you actually read the responses to your post, then you would be able to see that your proposal had lots of problems.  It would not improve the game, and would in fact be quite inconvenient for lots of people.  Why do you want to try to force a solution to your perceived problem on everyone that has so many harmful side affects?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by LeanaSoulwarden on &lt;span class="date_text"&gt;01-31-2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;11:51 AM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Assuming your plan were implemented, let me pose some questions:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;How would a veteran player and his newbie real life friend play EverQuest together?  under your system the veteran player would be forced to give up his level 70 500AA main character and create a new level 1.  Is this fair to those who only play and who have only ever played ONE character?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;How would a newbie ask a veteran for advice?  right now a lower level player just has to look for a higher level character and send a tell.  Under your system the lower level player would have to try to locate a player on his server who has played a higher level character.  Not impossible but far more difficult.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;How would family guilds work?  Since at each level range players are on different servers how could a level 50 to 60 character get enough help do an epic 1.0 fight? Even in a guild with 300 members, maybe 75 are online at any given time and off those 75 how many are in the 50 - 60 range?  even if the distribution is equal (which it would definitely not be) yopu are still only looking at 10 to 15 level appropriate guildmates to help out.  This would mean having to go outside a guild to get help and we all know how difficult that can be.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;How would raiding guilds works? not all raiding guilds are level 70 end game guilds.  So in your system, if and when a player exceeds the level the server can handle he simply moves on and may have to leave that guild to join another because that particular guild at the next level stage is no longer doing the content that he was doing previously.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;How would the shared bank and the bazzar continue to function?  Right now a high level character farming TS materials in a lower zone finds an item that he does not want, he can still loot it and give it to an alternate lower level character or try to sell it in the bazaar.  under your system how would that same player do this, if it were even allowed at all?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;These are the flaws in your concept that I have come up with.  Given more time I can probably come up with several more.  The underlying reasoning behind your concept is good, but your solution is too flawed to even consider it viable.  In all honesty there is no &amp;quot;system&amp;quot; method to fix this issue; there is nothing that can be implemented.  In another thread, I have the same &amp;quot;concerns.&amp;quot;  In my opinion though this is not something that Sony can fix.  the &amp;quot;fix&amp;quot; will come when players change their philosophy about when EQ begins: (&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Veterans&amp;message.id=177551"&gt;http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Veterans&amp;amp;message.id=177551&lt;/a&gt;).  Right now, it seems as though many if not most believe the game &amp;quot;begins&amp;quot; at level 70.  It most definitely does not.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;hr&gt;LeanaSoulwarden wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffcc"&gt;&amp;quot;I twink now because you have to. I buy plat to buy spells that are outragously priced why because you have to&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffcc"&gt;. There is no longer a way to earn these.&amp;quot;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just plain false.  You twink because you &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; you have to.  You can play the game without twinking.  My son joined a new server and took his character to 50 in two weeks time.  There was no way to twink.  You buy plat because you &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;think&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/em&gt;you have to.  I have never bought plat or anything else.  I know lots of way to make good money in the game.  I could start a new character on a new server, no friends, no one to help me, and buy all spells 1-68 long before I could use them.  The problem isn't that there aren't ways to make money in the game.  The problem is that you do not know how to make money or have no interest in doing what is required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;I have to agree with Leana here.  Twinking and buying plat are not required at all.  Twinking is &amp;quot;fun&amp;quot; because you can do things with a lower level alt that you could not do with your first character.  And I personally never understood buying plat.  Yeah there were times when plat was in short supply, but I never resorted to buying plat, I simply did tradeskills and sold the results, I parked myself in POK waiting for a group or my guild raid to start and sold buffs for donations, and/or I master looted in groups and prayed that no one would ask for a share :smileysurprised:.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Now I must comment on the example of the tank disappearing from a group after he dings.  This is a ridiculous example.  This would NEVER happen.  If a system like the one proposed were ever implemented, the server change would occur after the character was logged off for two reasons: 1) server transfers cannot happen while the account is active &amp;amp; 2) the developers are not THAT stupid :smileywink:.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;GemNaturesfury wrote:&lt;BR&gt;I simply asked for other peoples idea's to bring larger number's of lower level players together. In my own way I created a senerio that obviously noone likes but only one person has offered any idea or half an idea to do somewhat the same thing. This is not playing a game:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Palyer X stands in POK and cast fire burst&lt;BR&gt;evocation 166&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Player X&amp;nbsp; stands in PoK cast once again fire burst&lt;BR&gt;no skill up&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;and does this for hours on end trying to keep skills maxed because he/she is having to do MM to to PL himself through the empty void that is level 20 thru 60. A real mind numbing empty experience.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffff00&gt;Then don't play that way. Make a group and go do something else. I do it with alts all the time.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;I am sorry that you don't like my idea. I wish you would have posted ideas of your own instead of trying to belittle and rip me a new one. It is truly unfortunate that you see your way of playing the only way to play and the fact is that ppl come back and leave again because they enjoy the mid level game and it is no longer there. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffff00&gt;I know of several DOZEN guilds on my server alone, that have midlevel characters, and who group together constantly. Perhaps you need to join a guild? Or use your general channels to lfg?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I twink now because you have to. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffff00&gt;No you don't! Stop making excuses.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I buy plat to buy spells that are outragously priced why because you have to. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffff00&gt;Again, this is not true. I've made over 5 million PP in EQ, all from tradeskills. Its also a good way to use your time, when you have trouble finding a group.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;There is no longer a way to earn these and someone said something about server population well its on a steady decline with the way things are now. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffff00&gt;Yes, you can still earn spells, you just&amp;nbsp;don't want to do it. ANd server populations have not declined since the mergers, if anything they have gone up.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Sorry I asked for ideas from you ppl and instead of giving them you sat on your pedestal and flamed.I said a couple of times my idea might not be the way to go please submit yours to trying to find a cure to this problem. Sorry to say most didn't read that part of it.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffff00&gt;Probably because you were suggesting a draconian "fix" to a problem that only exists in your own mind. Join a guild, or start one. Gear it to mid level characters and advertise it. Make entrance open to all, and make lots of officers, so invites will always be available. Then you'll have your midlevel characters, all in one area, just like the guild I used to be in, over several years while I levelled up.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;</description>
