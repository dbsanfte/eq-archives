<DIV>i completely agree though, hate was one of my favorite places to hang out, but now i will probably never go back due to the 5 minute timer on everything in the zone. the 5 minute timer should only be on the maestro and inny, but i guess it wont happen until enough people complain.</DIV><BR>

<P><BR>Hate has not changed one bit--only it's relative value, which never was very high (outside perhaps the raid mobs which would have a OOC timer anyway).&nbsp; Whatever intrigue drew you there in the first place has not changed, so why does the addition of OOC regen to OTHER zones make so much of an impact.</P>
