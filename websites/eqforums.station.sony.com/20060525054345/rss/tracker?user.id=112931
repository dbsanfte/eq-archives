&lt;DIV&gt;I'm checking out the difficulties.&amp;nbsp; It's possible the inktu'ta traps are just really high level so hard to detect.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Rangers can't track traps that are hidden.&amp;nbsp; Not sure where that's coming from.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;For the other commands...&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;When you sense a trap, it only becomes visible to you.&amp;nbsp; Reveal Traps will make it visible to everyone else and it will stay that way for a while (varies by trap, but generally 5 minutes) so if you don't want to deal with disarming it, people can just avoid it.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Remove Trap is something everyone gets.&amp;nbsp; It allows you to remove a trap you set.&amp;nbsp; Just a general utility command.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;So basically, what you're saying is, for the classes that do not get to set traps (from what I've heard only classes that do not get auras get to set traps?), then remove trap is pretty much useless.&amp;nbsp; Correct?&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Wrong.  Main raid (Dark Disciple Master at Wakening Lands) can be done with a force of about 20ish, not all in 70 (but definitely all close to it), and definitely not all time geared.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Must haves - 3 strong tanks, several kiters that are experienced and well informed, lots of healing and DPS.  Healers should have RGC and/or RC at the very least.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It's possible to do with an 18 person raid.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dain MM arc was very good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only does this arc provide a storytelling kind of element (which highly encouraged roleplaying as I've found), the missions were very interestingly designed.  Three different missions that required three completely different strategies to complete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Took me and company about 6 or so tries to nail down how to finish Dain 3, but the 1st time that we won was no less fun than the 1st time that we tried.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also it enriches the perspectives that have already been built on from the beginning about Velious - That it wasn't exactly all a happy jolly place on ice - The different peoples there are pretty bitter about each other and the storyies that these missions tell just brings all that to life.  Good job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If only all the other MM's could be made to have these elements, that would make my day.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;To emphasize my previous post, I state these:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;- Everquest is an MMORPG.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;- Everquest was designed to be a group-centric game.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;- Everquest was designed to be a large immersive world.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;- Everquest was designed to reflect a balanced risk versus reward scalability.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;With these things said, yes I do play a cleric main right now.  I have been in various situations to demand some of the more overpowered tools of my class, such as Complete Heal, and 90%+ rez.  Though I feel that this is exactly all that they are, overepowered tools.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I feel similarly about features like PoK, Bazaar and Guild Lobby.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In some occasion they are more or less necessary, but in most they are not, and should not have to be.  They are nice to have.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Similarly, the ability to supplement some of the unique tools of certain classes, is nice to have, not necessary.  In a group-centric game, each class should have a primary and irreplacable role.  Whatever this role is, they should not be completely replacable by items or by another class.  Being a group-centric game, Everquest developers should endeavor to re-envision and reshape the classes into these unique roles, so that we as players are encouraged to seek out people for every class for their unique abilities, and to group with each other, not to buy potions to replace them with.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;You people are amazing.  96% rez is already overpowered as it is.  Now we want to be able to buy them off merchants?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;No.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Next thing we'll be able to buy off merchants is a lv 70 + 500 aa toon &amp;quot;token&amp;quot;.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

Just do away with everything but level 70 zones and MMs. From the tone of the usual posts any other zones are never used, aren't worth spending any time on and are worthless to the game.&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would assume that this above comment was made sarcastically.  I will in any case treat it as such.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason that low-mid level zones are &amp;quot;never used&amp;quot;, is because of the fact that the zone content is not dynamic.  Meaning, that the xp/item rewards in these zones have not evolved along with the playerbase.  Some of the things that make the job hard for devs, is that in a mature (10 expansions is mature I would conjecture) MMORPG world, the amount of content that has become &amp;quot;legacy&amp;quot;, is incredible.  There are at least 12 starting cities, each with about 2 newbie zones/dungeons attached to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of which, the playerbase has grown at a much different rate than they are supposed to.  Thank twinking, plat buying, ebay, etc. for this.  We as players farmed the crap out of the game overall and left ourselves with the question, &amp;quot;Well now that I'm done with Evercamp(tm), what now?&amp;quot; Many of us have not bothered to go and enjoy the content rich and immersive world out there, having become so focused on the instant gratification of the &amp;quot;ding&amp;quot; sound and plat clatter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We want new zones, pretty content, tough mobs, challenging fights, and better rewards.  We cry for it consantly.  So much so that we become intolerant of what the spirit of the game really is.  So devs give it to us - they spend a large portion of their time making uber-er things for us, and the more this comes out, the more the older, seemingly legacy and underachieved content becomes very undesirable in comparison.  Who wants to loot a pair of cloth shoes from runnyeye goblins when you can go grind a few hours in a new zone and buy some shiny boots of uber shinyness?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this time (just pre-DoDh) our playerbase has been so broken up, both by the fragmentation of the commmunity due to the game's own nature, and by the introduction of several other competitors in the game business.  Not only do newbies seem hard to come by nowadays, they are in fact discouraged to play in general because their friends are all lv 70 + 100s aa, that when they make a lv 1, there was no possible way to find anyone to group easily and there was no way for new players to enjoy the same gameplay experience that our more veteran community has had and still enjoys.  Change was needed for sure, we all knew it.  But then every time devs speak revamps, our playerbase cries status quo.  &amp;quot;It's good as it is now, why change it?&amp;quot; seems to be a common response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So - Devs answers were - Shrouds and MM's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shrouds let the higher level (the vets) come back and do lower level content with their friends, and still be rewarded for the previously trivial content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MM's proposed to offer an &amp;quot;alternate advancement route&amp;quot;, for the new players to find groups easily and still play the game without having to run through 20 empty zones lfg until they can meet up with their groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I applaud the devs for a noble attempt at these seemingly well intended purposes, I have many times suggested that the MM's required (and still requires) fine tuning.  Many of the participants of this thread and of our forum community agree with me on this point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I don't advocate the complete removal of MM's.  Once they are tuned to an acceptable rate of advancement (which should be about 20% slower advancement than the same time commitment would produce on average working current at-level content), and with the risk of death xp loss penalty reintroduced, they will be in-line with current content in my opinion.  Tack on mission specific task request timers to disallow MM Evercamp(tm), and the whole thing will be well rounded enough that if anyone decides to &amp;quot;70MM&amp;quot;, they are truly at their own fault for not skilling up or not learning how to play their own character for their worth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rest of us have the very easy decision to make of whether or not to play with a character that has chosen to do this, as it is apparant from the first two fights for sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sooner the devs tune the MM's back up the better.  Then they can spend their time on the more deserved tasks - revamp the old zones (without making them overly linear), and make exciting  new content.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

So you DO lose xp if you die.&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Yes, this is true.  You DO lose xp from your main char, but at the level of the shroud.  So if you, as a level 70, shrouded as a level 70 rogue, if you die, you lose the exact amount you'd lose normally.&lt;br&gt;If you shrouded down to lvl 15 say in Paludal Caverns to shroud XP and died, then the xp lose at lvl 15 to a lvl 70 isn't going to be noticeable (and thus the problems people report trying to get xp on lvl 70 toons in low level shroud form).  So in that case, it's not uncommon to not worry about it and just leave the corpse, thus the reason you might see ALOT of corpses in Paludal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yeah got the sense of that knocked into me soon after I posted that.  Was too lazy to come back to repost.  Thanks guys.  :smileytongue:</description>

It happened yesterday. I gated myself, that chanter and the ranger that was too stunned to speak out of there after that fight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;**SMURF** was there to be jealous of there?! Their blissful unawareness to the grave situation?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;My thoughts are somewhat similar to this player's intended parody.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recently had to teach a level 50+ paladin about the concept of chain stunning.  He didn't even know what the phrase meant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understandably, that is not all the fault of monster missions, but it goes to show how much in-role expertise each player learns from months, even years of playing their class.  The knowledge that goes into playing the class and grouping with other people, and how to maximize the usefulness of the character in and outside of groups are things that can not be learned in MM's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I point out another example.  Most people didn't learn (in fact I didn't either, until i did it and went &amp;quot;huh?&amp;quot; ) that non-DD spell stun does not actually break mez.  I used it to build aggro before I broke mez from my group's chanter many a times after I discovered how that worked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowing what spells, discs and abilities are to be used when and how, is what makes a good player indisposable.  Now how many levels and AA's they have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And even then, I have recently been asked by a large portion of my friends to chase levels.  In essence, they level up, I have to l level to keep up with them so they can play with me (and still have some xp incentive for me to do so).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I simply say no.  How many players have really realized the benefits of having a certain amount of strategically placed AA's at certain levels?  I personally have played a pally to 55 and with all of the 1st tier defensives, and now a cleric in the 50ies and starting on the archetypes.  I don't even have to say how much difference these AA's make, not to mention things like Divine Arbitration, as we move up the hierarchy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I don't think in essence that there is anything wrong with the attitude being taken right now by the &amp;quot;middle class&amp;quot; players right at this moment, whereas I believe it is in essence, two separate issues that shouldn't have been tied together to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by DerekTse on &lt;span class="date_text"&gt;01-25-2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;05:54 PM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I have to warn now to my fellow community members and players, that I have always been more or less an advocate against Monster Missions.  My opinion has not changed significantly since the introduction of monster missions, however they have in fact changed in the instances that positive progress was made by the Devs.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;While I think that it is a generally fun and interesting thing that players are allowed to have a way to get short sessions of play into their gaming lives, I feel that they are in a sense detrimental to the &amp;quot;large, immersive world&amp;quot; philosophy that goes into MMORPGs.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I point out my opinion (based on observations in game).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;1) Monster mission usage is seasonal&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Monster mission usage tends to be very chique.  Like last year's prom dress, our playerbase tends to drop the &amp;quot;old&amp;quot;er monster missions as soon as they are properly adjusted (or otherwise &amp;quot;nerfed&amp;quot; ).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;2) Monster missions tend to be repetitive&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Even more so than LDoN and DoN missions, I have seen players leave monster missions after the first or second run, saying things like &amp;quot;I can't handle it anymore&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;I'm gonna get sick&amp;quot; because of the repetitive nature of these missions.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;3) Effort vs Reward is (still) unbalanced&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If you're going to flame me about this point, don't.  I've already warned you up top about what my opinion is.  I don't &amp;quot;hate&amp;quot; monster missions, I just feel that they are a rather less ideal alternative that has been introduced into the everquest world.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Ask our avid users of monster missions why they play them repeatedly.  More than 75% of them will tell you &amp;quot;It's good xp&amp;quot;, very easily.  They do it so convincingly, without thinking, that they manage to in effect sell the idea to the next person as well.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;quot;Oooh!  That last run got me more than 2 aa's!&amp;quot; tends to be a common comment.  The response is euphoric, and it goes to show how much our playerbase watches the xp bar as they play.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Now, I'll point out a further observation.  Due to the last server patch and the resulting mishaps, as well as the double xp weekend that became the Dev team's response to the playerbase outcry (which I am still at ends with), I noticed something very interesting.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;On Firiona Vie there is usually smaller proportion of players that subscribe to the &amp;quot;grinding&amp;quot; exercises.  Due to the nature of the roleplaying preferred server and its rules, some more things are possible when playing with the community there.  Naturally, this is also a smaller server, especially now because there have never been any server merges into FV.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I happen to have a character that is in a rather serious roleplaying guild.  We don't usually subscribe to activies that are purely to &amp;quot;grind&amp;quot; xp, nor do we go about to unify all races and classes of players, understanding the differences in their historic backgrounds and their professions.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Intro double xp weekend.  Suddenly everybody in my guild and everybody I know becomes avid monster mission subscribers.  &amp;quot;Are you crazy?  You're going to miss out on the double xp?  Come join our MM!&amp;quot;  became a common phrase in guild chat.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I finally broke down, and decided to join my guildmates for a run at Highpass.  Heck, I could use the aa's.  Sure enough, I head there and immediatly I notice the lag as soon as I zoned in to Highpass.  I do a /who and what do I see?  162 players were in the zone.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Now, 162 people in one zone doesn't seem like a lot, but first of all, this is FV server.  Usually there's just about that many people in PoK at peak times.  And even then, what was the player population pre-DoDH for highpass?  About... 10?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But even 162 players in the same zone is not a big deal.  In PoK you see that all the time, 30 here for MGB's, 10 there, a couple here, that's fine.  The kicker is the 162 people (maybe save for 3 or 4 that are just zoning in and wandering around), were ALL squished in around the mission giver NPC!  The lag was so bad that I couldn't move.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;From just a quick look, I estimate maybe about 400 sq-metre of living space for the entirety of this population.  That translates to about 0.04 hectares, for 162 players.  That's 0.00025 hectares per capita, in comparison to 9.6 hectare per capita for the average American, and 7.2 hectares for the average Canadian.  The space was so cramped, it laid the fish tanks in chinese grocery stores to shame.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The question I immediately asked myself was - If we're trying to simulate a &amp;quot;large, immersive world&amp;quot; with everquest, it being an MMORPG, then should these kinds of living conditions be ecologically correct to the sentient lifeforms that live in this world?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In other words, is there something severely wrong that causes people to crowd themselves into a space so small, that they can not even urinate without spashing ten other people in the face, and yet still find themselves &amp;quot;having fun&amp;quot;?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I leave this question open ended for each of you to answer for yourselves.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by DerekTse on &lt;span class="date_text"&gt;01-25-2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;05:37 PM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Was just pointing out that not everyone (read probably more than half) who used those vendors had a clue. Yeah i'm sure some did, and of those who did and did NOT report it (i'm sure some saw the stuff and went, whoa, this ain't supposed to be here /bug and some saw it and went /greed) are responsible for the current actions the majority of us (1% my arse) have experienced. They hold some responsibility, yes. But SoE holds the lions share, first, for not doing proper QC on their patch, and then second for not Immediatly shutting down the servers and rolling everything back, then third, for being extremely vaugue in their MOTD and fourth, for releasing a script thats search paremeters were entirely to broad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Course, this has been beat to death here so many time already. But it just goes without saying that it's obvious SoE does NOT know hw to do crisis management and damage control. They seem to instinctively (or deliberatly) take the most damageing route they possibly can to correct any issue, and ten try hard to make the customer/user base bare the responsibility for their screw up in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sad thing is. It works, They have trained the players to take it up the arse, anytime they tell you to. I say You, because I am no longer a SoE/everquest player. Just an irate former user, still pissing in the proverbial wind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rev. Samuel J.
