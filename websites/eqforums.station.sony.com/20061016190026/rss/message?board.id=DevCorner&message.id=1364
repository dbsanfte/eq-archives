    <description>&lt;b&gt;Summary: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some people have not been able to start the alternate access quests (for PoP access) if they have started (but not completed) the traditional flagging path.  Is this intended?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Problem description:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;People in my guild who have completed at least one of the Halls of Honor trials have not been able to complete the alternate access quest for the Temple of Marr.  The quest NPC simply will not talk to them.  One person petitioned, and a GM advised him that he needs his Aerin'Dar flag before the NPC will talk to him.  I thought the point of this quest was to bypass the need for raids?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Likewise, people who have killed at least one (but not all five) SolRo mini-bosses are not allowed to complete the one-group quest for access to Sol Ro's chamber.  Again, the NPC will not talk to them, and if they try to hand in the key parts, the NPC will refuse them.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Other people who have not killed any of the minis or not done any of the HoH trials were able to complete the alternate access quests.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is this restriction intentional?  Would it be possible to modify these quests and their respective NPC's to allow anyone to complete them, regardless of flagging status?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Background details:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm the guild leader of a PoP raiding guild.  We're ready to move on to main elemental flagging, which currently requires just five major targets (Saryrn, Agnarr, Rallos Zek, Solusek Ro, and Lord Mithaniel Marr) in restricted zones.  This requires access to the Plane of Torment, Bastion of Thunder, Plane of Tactics (Drunder, Fortress of Zek), Solusek Ro's Tower, and the Temple of Marr (called HoHb).  Two of these zones are open by level (Torment at 55 and Bastion of Thunder at 62).  The other three zones are not open by level; instead, you must gain flags or complete an alternate access quest to gain entry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The people in our guild have an odd mix of flags.  We have people who have picked up a flag or two here or there on pick-up raids; and we have people who are flagged for elementals and even Time.  This makes it hard for us to raid consistently.  To bring everyone up to speed, I've mandated that everyone must be able to access the five raid zones as soon as possible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everyone has been able to complete the alternate access quest for Solusek Ro's Tower (killing the Banished Efreeti in Western Wastes).  Likewise, the alternate access quest for Tactics is easy enough, if time consuming (collecting the four quarters of a Diaku medallion in the Plane of Storms).  The problems come from the alternate access quests for HoHb and Solusek Ro's Chamber.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm hoping the developers will review these quests and ensure that you can start and complete them, even if you have taken the first steps in the "normal" flagging process.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;We have been experiencing some problems with Solusek Ro, and I believe it may be related to this problem.&amp;nbsp; Even more disconcerting to me is that I think that as officers, we may have made the problem worse.&amp;nbsp; We thought that the old system of gimping people into Sol Ro's Chamber still worked, though I have no problem that they fixed this.&amp;nbsp; But with this in mind, we made a big push to get everyone that was still missing backflags for Sol Ro Tower to get the alternate access so that they would not be booted from the zone during the gimping.&amp;nbsp; It now seems that many of our members that did the alternate access quest, AND then did the normal Progression are NOT flagged for Sol Ro's Chamber.&amp;nbsp; Please tell me this is not as intended.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;1.)&amp;nbsp; Player A is missing backflags to enter Sol Ro Tower, so does the alternate access quest to gain access to the zone to xp with their guildies outside of raids.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;2.)&amp;nbsp; Player A finishes all of there Flags to enter Sol Ro Tower, and the Planes of Air/Water/Earth.&amp;nbsp; (yes, killed RZ and can zone into these 3 zones alone)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;3.)&amp;nbsp; Player A completes all 5 mini's in Solusek Ro.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;4.)&amp;nbsp; Player A cannot click into solusek Ro's Chamber.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If a player does the alternate access quest, do they have to do the alternate chamber access quest as well?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; If so this is abolutely retarded.&amp;nbsp; I can understand requiring the alternate chamber access quest for players not fully traditionally flagged, but if someone does go back and get all the traditional flags, the alternate quests should not be required.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So now, we have pushed a large number of our guildies to do the alternate sol ro access quest, and it appears that they will now have to farm a bunch of stupid drops in sol ro even though they have already done ALL the work on their traditional flags.&amp;nbsp; This cant be right can it?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Another problem that I forgot to mention.&amp;nbsp; I was under the impression that gimping into the chamber and killing Solusek Ro automatically flagged you for his chamber.&amp;nbsp; We have a couple of members that gimped into and killed Solusek Ro in an open raid a while back.&amp;nbsp; These members are able to zone into PoFire which means that they have definately recieved the Solusek Ro flag.&amp;nbsp; These same members were booted from Sol Ro's chamber.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Please designate some time to fix these relatively minor but hugely annoying bugs with the planar progression.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Please add some form of indication to the raid window to identify raiders that are currently gimped.&amp;nbsp; It is currently impossible as a raid leader to keep track of how many non-flagged people are in a raid at any given time.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Please give us some indication that you are at least AWARE of the problems.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Please tell us to take our toys and go home if your unwilling to address the issues.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;Killing Sol Ro doesn't get you flagged for his chamber.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;At least a dozen guildies, and myself, did the alt flag for SRT, then completed normal progression including killing sol ro, and were correctly flagged for PoFire. (The very last progression kill I made was Grummus. Don't ask me how I managed to get everything else done first; it just worked out that way. It took me hours with the seer and running around to get all the flagging straightened out.)&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;It would be awfully nice to be able to somehow see which people were admitted to a zone under the 1/6 rule. It would be even nicer if a guild leader could easily say "If we drop below the critical mark on flagged-vs-unflagged, drop *that* player first". You don't want your gimp cleric to go when you have more BSTs than you can shake a stick at.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

I completed both the KoS and MB bypass quests but the Seer in PoK still gives me a msg for TZ VZ RZtW and Saryrn, and the grand librarian tells me the cipher of druzill is only half complete and i need to seek the Zeks. both bypass quest npcs seemed to be all set with me .

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;Since Time is now fully instanced and an expansion from 2 years ago, why not just open up its access?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;Currently my guild is 2 kills away from elemental planes.&amp;nbsp; Our average raiding force is 30 people.&amp;nbsp; 30 people will not beat Coirnav or TRC.&amp;nbsp; We've downed the likes of Saryrn, Bert and Agnarr with 36 people or fewer.&amp;nbsp; However the obstacles in our way are raids that require many more people than we can muster.&amp;nbsp; Our guild consists of people loyal to the guild who want to make it to Plane of Time with the guild as opposed to the average person who can just tag along with a Time flagged guild and get the alt access to Time.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;Any reasonable solutions to the matter or are we just stuck since honest efforts are being made to be meaningless?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Ah, but that's where our problem lies.&amp;nbsp; Everyone is either well ahead of us and trying to recruit from our players dangling the 'free Time flag for joining' or well behind us which would mean we'd have to go through backflagging all over again.&amp;nbsp; I guess what I was hoping for was a solution that allowed us to move forward which is an indirect premise of this whole thread, how not to keep falling backwards ot hit a standstill.&amp;nbsp; If it required some progressive labor, fine, as long as I can see true progress.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

This should have required 5 or 6 flag raids, then 3-5 encounters requiring approx group strength.  But the pre-elemental alt progression is not setup to be flexible enough.  Example SolRo.  If you have 1 of the minis, you can not do the alt quest.  If you have one of the HoHa trials, you can not complete it by doing the Alt quest.  The Alt backflagging is generally all or nothing, for each progression line.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If the Alt backflagging was done correctly and was flexible, all your guild would need to do would be to hit the gods again for newcomers, then have them finish it up with the group encounters, instead of the guild having to repeat an additional 10+ raids to get a few newer people elementally backflagged (prior to actually killing an elemental god).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is only so many who can be 85% into a zone.  And with the current condition of the pre-elemental backflagging though, it is alot easier to go back and do those additional 10+ raid encounters.  Thus if one guild were to teamup with another guild, even if they are a few steps behind, such an association would go a long way towards getting the numbers for the elemental gods, particularly TRC.</description>

&lt;P&gt;QVIC and time alt backflagging are flexible. No many what parts of the normal progression you've done. Completing the 1, not 31, tasks that flags you for that zone instantly. Kill a named phase three for time and do a 30 hour quest for Qvic. Caveat you need other people ot help but in both case your guild can help out and wont burn out as the impost is not great. You are attractive cause you can skip killing Agnarr, POS quest, POJ executioner, HOH a - c, MM, POI quest,&amp;nbsp;MB , MM, hedge, TT, Saryn, KOS, Bert, Carprin, ?, RZ, TZ,VZ. 5 minis, Sol RO, Fenin Ro, Xegony , The Rathe, Corianav and skip straight to time flagged. Likewise with QVIC which was just as broken as the Pre ele alternate access quests but the devs actually spent a lot of time consulting with the players and fixed it. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Phase three time named drop 10 essences so wait til you get 10 apps run through time flag em then farm for a few times and move on. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I wish we could get some loving from the devs for the pre-time guilds but have given up hope for &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;a) a response , unlike time and above guilds&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;b) Some constructive discussion on how to fix it , away from the time plus guilds&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;c) Some action, as if&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;One thing I learned via trial and error the last few years and the many alliances I have tried to work with is that unless the leaders of the other guilds are as strong as the leader of your own, the alliances die because the other guilds tend to fall apart.&amp;nbsp; Furthermore, if you are the GL of your guild, you really don't have any control over the quality of the members of the other alliance guild(s).&amp;nbsp; Let me tell you, a lot of them are total rejects.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I have been in a number of different alliances that for one reason or another die out, often due to some form of weakness becoming more and more glaring in the other guilds which eventually cause them to wither away (Hence why we are still around while the others fade away and it brings us back to square 1).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Alliances are nice in theory, but in practice are rarely successful.&amp;nbsp; I'm not saying all alliances fail, but the guilds who would be strong enough to ally with us are already beyond us in content and don't need to ally with us.&amp;nbsp; That's the current quandary.&amp;nbsp; And if the alternate suggestion is to pick up a guild below and catch them up, I've already tried that a couple of times and the drama queens and ambivalents of such guilds create more grief then it's worth.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I wasn't closed to the idea of alliances, but you can only drink sour milk for so long before you decide it's not good for you.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

However the obstacles in our way are raids that require many more people than we can muster.  Our guild consists of people loyal to the guild who want to make it to Plane of Time with the guild as opposed to the average person who can just tag along with a Time flagged guild and get the alt access to Time.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;Any reasonable solutions to the matter or are we just stuck since honest efforts are being made to be meaningless?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the same reason Emp nor VT hasnt been opened up, nor can ya 85% someone in, thus not needed.  This is where your guild can collaberate with another guild(s) in similar situations.  Tis be better than doing a flagraid where there are alot of unknown players instead of working with one set of people.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The attempted alternate backflagging (not flagging) route was introduced in an attempt, iirc, so that guilds already in the progression to backflag newcomers without having to go through all the previous steps.  The Time (in Time and able to get to and kill P3) and Elemental backflagging (ability to kill elemental gods) works fine, this thread pertains to the pre-elemental progress (guilds able to kill pre-elemental gods, and are just entering into the Elementals).&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Sarkaukar-Povar on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;08-23-2005&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;02:06 PM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I'm really starting to think we're never going to hear back from a dev on this topic again.&amp;nbsp; Just a glimmer of hope for a short while and then bzzzzzz (we get dialtone).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Well, I still haven't found a virgins trial being done.&amp;nbsp; Occasionally I hear of someone doing it, but it's always after the fact at an odd hour that I wouldn't have been able to make anyway.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Any Dev's want to ask me anything about my flags I'd be very happy to answer any questions.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>Sorry to put this here, but I was unable to find anywhere else to put it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was trying to find the post that describes how the flagging in GoD now works. &lt;br&gt;There was some changes a month or 2 ago where you would be handed the items you were missing upto and including the item from the endboss of the encounter you just did. I believe it was Inktu'Ta that was being re-done, so that when you beat Inktu'Ta, you would get the flags upto and including Txevu. &lt;br&gt;I am unable to find the post describing it, and was hoping some of you could point me in the right direction?</description>
