				<DIV>I received this task at lvl 51 from the task master that is almost direct straight into DL from the cave entrance of Firiona Vie.&nbsp; The task is called "Keeping Order" and the second to last step I am trying to complete appears to be broken.&nbsp; The step is to explore the entrance of the cave in Firiona Vie that leads to the dreadlands.&nbsp; It says, "As one last ditch effort you should explore the entrance to make sure that there is nothing of value there."&nbsp; Not only have I waited for possible ground spawn or an&nbsp;NPC that needs to be hailed, I have explored the entire cave structure.&nbsp; I have petitioned this twice and have received no help from the GMs.&nbsp; After spending 2 hours working on this quest I would like to be able to complete it.&nbsp; Any help that can be given would be greatly appreciated.</DIV>
