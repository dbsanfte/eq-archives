    <title>server staus on sony web page</title>

    <description>&lt;div&gt;when is sony going to update there server status after they have done a patch and it is working and not before. this is frustrating every time sony does a patch the server status show's all servers up when in fact they are not even letting some 1 log into the game. some 1 at sony needs to get there head out of were ever it is and show the server status up when it is up not when it is still down. it is now 1 hour past the time they say all servers are up and still can not log into server to select a charcter. all im asking is that some 1 needs to show servers up when they are up not up while they are still down is that so hard for some 1 at sony to do ?&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>To make a short reply.. quite often while the servers are 'down'.. they are up.&amp;nbsp; The Devs need the servers active in order to log into them and test the content and thus the servers are 'up' but the login server(s) are not.&amp;nbsp; What is likely needed on that page is a login server status, but it may have a different interface than the other servers and is unable to be displayed the same way (it has been requested before but not done as of this date obviously).&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
