    <title>How about character level being what unlocks additional expansions?</title>
    <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Progression&amp;message.id=1071</link>
    <description>&lt;div&gt;To really keep the &amp;quot;classic&amp;quot; feel to this new server, instead of having events unlock expansions, why not have character level unlock expansions (instead of killing Vox or something).  Have Kunark and Classic open at beginning, let level 40's have access to Velious, then starting with level 50 and up, have each level or two unlock an additional expansion for those characters.  Sort of like having level requirements to access a zone.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I don't mean levels to unlock expansions for everybody, but just for the folks who have levelled enough to open them for just themselves.</description>

      <description>The level idea is horrible.  Levels are far too easily obtained to work as a progression trigger.  It needs to be something far more challenging.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ideally, SOE should just make progression very hard in order to slow us.  For example, to open Velious they could require all of VP be cleared, 1 of each epic completed, and all the planes beaten.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;A time based failsafe is definetly needed imho.  This server has a potential to be something great for players and SoE alike, but it also has the potential to be completely ruined by hardcore players.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

They would either invade the lower content for farming or quit and make it so the casual players would never see the later expansions.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Personally I like the idea of unlocking by raid encounters because I was a hardcore raider and plan on being a raider for this server.  Having the raid encounters unlock the expansions will bring a sense of accomplishment to the players(that were involved anyways) and that their actions actually did affect the server.  A big problem with this idea though is that the top tier of the server will be the ones doing it and could ruin it for the rest of the people who couldnt invest as much time or didnt want to race to 50. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If you only had to reach level 40 to unlock kunark what would keep those people from just staying in kunark after that? Part of the reasoning behind this server is to make it so players dont skip content. &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I think they should flag expansions so you either have to kill the raid boss to unlock the next expansions or do some kinda high end epic group task to unlock it.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Basicly high end raiders will get to the next expansions first then once they have got there a task is added into the game for others to single group get to the next expansions if they are raiders. The expansions are account based so unlocking it on one toon will allow all your alts to go there also. This would prevent blocking by high ends killing hte raid content but also give everyone a feeling of accomplishment for making it to the next expansion. Maybe add in a fail safe so that say after 6 months or a year after the next expansions has been unlocked if you are still behind it will go ahead and unlock for all.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;THIS IS NOT A CLASSIC SERVER. THIS IS A PROGRESSION SERVER.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Also why would u want to cause expansions to open faster? leveling will take a while but given kunark open at the start and the expansions opening like you said you could make 65 in a month probably.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Cloud_Stromm on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;04-18-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;08:31 AM&lt;/span&gt;</description>
