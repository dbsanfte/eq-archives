&lt;DIV&gt;A black cat crossed my car path this morning as I was pulling out of the driveway.&amp;nbsp; Not a good omen for a Friday the 13th.&amp;nbsp; Mind you I am not a superstitious halfling but that did give me pause.&amp;nbsp; Fortunately the rest of the day has been event free.&amp;nbsp; There is still much day to go though.&amp;nbsp; Did I just jinx myself?&amp;nbsp; ARGH!&amp;nbsp; How do all of these rules work?&amp;nbsp; Do I throw salt over my shoulder?&amp;nbsp; I think I just won't leave my office until after midnight.&amp;nbsp; The only thing that could happen in here is some sort of freak air conditioning mishap.&amp;nbsp; Maybe something with the computers . . .&amp;nbsp; Hmm this could be bad.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Disneyland tomorrow ought to remove any bad mojo right?&amp;nbsp; Mickey is the cure for everything I have found.&amp;nbsp; It really is the happiest place on Earth, just as long as you are not the one in line, next to the woman with the cranky infant.&amp;nbsp; They are all ready for the Disneyland 50th anniversary and I plan to enjoy every bit of it.&amp;nbsp; Unfortunately the re-vamped Space Mountain is not ready just yet.&amp;nbsp; That will be fun.&amp;nbsp; The ride has been closed for 3 years now as they prepared it for the 50th Anniversary.&amp;nbsp; Rumor has it that there is all new track and it is basically an all new ride.&amp;nbsp; I will anxiously await it's July 15th opening.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Next week is the week our industry lives for, well okay that is not entirely true.&amp;nbsp; But it is the week we spend tons of time and effort getting ready for.&amp;nbsp; E3.&amp;nbsp; E3 is a lot like Disneyland, only with booth babes.&amp;nbsp; Alright you caught me again, it is nothing like Disneyland.&amp;nbsp; There will be lots to see and do for the exciting week and even more going on at the SOE booth.&amp;nbsp; We have lots of fun stuff to show and the Community Teams will have updates for you from the show floor.&amp;nbsp; We plan to post pictures of our booth and some of the happenings therein.&amp;nbsp; Make sure you watch the forums and webpages next Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Okay I now return to my regularly scheduled lucky rabbit's foot rubbing and mirror avoidance.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Have fun!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
