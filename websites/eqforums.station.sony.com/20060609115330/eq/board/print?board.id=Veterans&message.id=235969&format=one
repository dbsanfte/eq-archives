				<DIV>Dain 2 is pretty easy, though it's easily the longest mission.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>One big key is to only use CH for healing, and when in doubt heal the Dain.&nbsp; That way, you save mana and can keep on moving.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Generally, we have the Dain pull.&nbsp; Make sure you pull them a ways towards the entrance so you have room for them to run without spawning adds.&nbsp; You should get no more than 4 on any pull, which keeps it easy.&nbsp; Kill the ones that don't run first - they're really the only ones that do damage.&nbsp; Make sure everyone assists.&nbsp; After you kill off all the Master scouts in the pull, start in on the runners.&nbsp; Have everyone who can root keep the scout from running - you really don't need healing with only scouts.&nbsp; You should pretty much never have the adds spawn - once we figured out the event we'd get a set once every 3-4 runs (usually when we were down by the named, since you've got less room there.)</DIV>
