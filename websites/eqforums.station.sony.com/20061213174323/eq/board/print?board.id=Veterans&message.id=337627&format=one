<P>Dont EVER do that again, tss faction was&nbsp;prolly the worse and the most boring required flag ever.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>VP key quest sucked. Was far worse than TSS.</P>
<P>Velious faction sucked, as did keying for ST. Not every guild/player could get that huge faction hit by killing the zone boss - and ST keys were not as common as they are today. Huge time sink. Huge. You actually need a new definition of huge to understand just how bad it was.</P>
<P>Luclin Emp key, Emp weapon and then VT shard camps. Holy wow, I am almost insulted folks are complaining about TSS when I go back over these horrible time sinks.</P>
<P>PoP had raid&nbsp;flags. Every zone past PoJ. Nothing else needs to be said.</P>
<P>GoD was just a horrible horrible content mistune.</P>
<P>OOW you not only had to camp the sigs, but do the MPG raid trials. Something today's players do not have to do - just sigs.</P>
<P>DoDH and PoR? I retired just before DoDH launch.&nbsp; After returning getting DS/DP keyed took me <STRONG><EM>months. </EM></STRONG>PoR isn't going so hot, either. Getting folks to do the same old instances juust doesn't seem to hold the same replay value. Instanced progression usually caters to certain class/group designs. Not much room for flexibility there.</P>
<P>TSS progression is just Exp grinding in open zones. No instances, not everyone needs to have the task - different folks can get different tasks completed in the same group or solo. It put the Quest back into <EM>Ever<STRONG>Quest</STRONG></EM>. It is actually horribly easy to do. Drops are common, repops are fast (not 12 hours +/- or 3 days etc).</P>
<P>EverQuest used to be hard. Instancing brought a little too much convenience to the playerbase. Some people will always prefer it. Some will always prefer open zones. It is important to balance those wants and needs of the plaer base. So far, TSS has offered very little in the way of progression blocks or bottlenecks. It is all up to the initiative of the playerbase. Anyone can get raid flagged.</P>
<P>Just have to go after it with determination and flexibility.</P>
