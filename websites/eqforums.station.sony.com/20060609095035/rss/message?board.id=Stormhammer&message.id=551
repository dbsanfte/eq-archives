    <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I was hyped when I found out that there was going to be a week of special events for the Summer Festival, but now that the week is ending I'm a little disappointed about how it was handled. Granted I can see that some events needed secrecy to&amp;nbsp;keep people from cheating (example the brewing contest). Especially the events that gave out special titles. But there could of at least been specific times slots posted in advance letting people know that there was going to be something happening. I mean we didn't need to know what the event was or where it was going to be. But a heads up at what time one was going to happen would have been really nice so that we coulld of logged on and had a chance to attend these events if we wanted to.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Advance notice that something was going to happen at a specific time&amp;nbsp;could&amp;nbsp;of given some of the guilds the chance to clear time slots on thier calendars so people could attend these events. It was very frustrating to log in only to find out that you just missed an event or to sit around waiting for hours hoping that you can catch one only to log off and find out later you just missed another event. At least the Festival is over with and we can at least enjoy knowing that&amp;nbsp;things will go back to normal and we can make plans in advance to attend&amp;nbsp;a dynamic event if we desire.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Summerfestival may have&amp;nbsp;looked great on paper but from what I have seen in game on the server, alot of people were disappointed on how it was handled. I'm not talking about a few percentage of the server population, but the majority of the server populaton was disappointed.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I commend Sony for having the Summer Festival, its a great idea.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;However, I would like to say that I much prefer having mostly scheduled events spread throughout the day...so you can plan your day and still have some unique fun.&amp;nbsp; Dynamic events are fun, but not when you wait around hoping for one (to take the place of the normal morning events that&amp;nbsp;were cancelled), only to find nothing seems to happen until after lunchtime is over for the west coast.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I would also like to see less of the speed-rush-to-kill events (scavenger hunts).&amp;nbsp; Speed rushing to kill mobs before someone else&amp;nbsp;is something that is expected on regular servers, but something&amp;nbsp;I have come to not expect on the premium server - and one of the reasons I pay the premium price.&amp;nbsp; 4/5 of the first events have been of this type.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Overall it is interesting and exciting, just had some&amp;nbsp;feedback I wanted to pass along.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;The calander is empty of events, shouldn't someone be posting the events for the rest of the month already? This months events should be full and next months worked on now.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;I also want events to start giving a start time.&amp;nbsp; Having to logon for several hours to hurry-up and wait&amp;nbsp;is not any fun. So what if many more people show up for events, isn't that the idea? that people pay more for events and&amp;nbsp;know when they start?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;When we login to stormhammer the next event should have the start time and zone announced with the "welcome to stormhammer" text.&amp;nbsp; I want to be able to set a few hours aside in my rl work for events, 2 hours online not 6 hours online,&amp;nbsp;please.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Not that I care much anymore but....&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;1)&amp;nbsp;Perhaps the recruiting functions should've been here at POK or Bazaar. More logical places, with more &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;incidental traffic. Nice idea of offering a port to Lake Rath, but still...&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;2) Agree with another&amp;nbsp;poster regarding activity announcements. The assumption&amp;nbsp;appears to&amp;nbsp;be that&amp;nbsp;people were going to be logged in all the time. Probably not the most realistic of assumptions. Apparently, some announcements&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;started popping up in the website, but towards the end of the festival.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;3) What benefit to the general population does a race of 1st level characters provide? For fun factor, would&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;rather see a game of gnome ball between the "tall" races of each guild.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Personally I can't comment of the event as a whole, as I decided to spend the weekend at the beach. So far, have not heard any overwhelmingly positive comments in game.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;The events that did occur were more fun and innovative than an average event (excellent content).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;But, overall I have to give the summer festival a thumbs down.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Less events than on a normal week, imo.&amp;nbsp; In fact, I felt there we a LOT less events than on a normal week.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Saturday and Sunday were especially low on events during a time many people expected the most events to occur (resulting in a very high level of&amp;nbsp;disappointment).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;No events were posted so people could plan for them (I don't count the guild recruiting as an event).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Overall,&amp;nbsp;a normal week of events is more fun than the summer festival was.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;When was the notice for Monday's 62+ event posted?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I know two people, not counting&amp;nbsp;myself, who checked the calendar on Sunday evening PST and saw nothing posted for Monday.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Bug?&amp;nbsp; SNAFU?&amp;nbsp; posted Monday morning?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;RE: Monday 62+ event&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Believe me, if you were there at the beginning this started great, but overall was NOT a fun event. It had the potential to be one of the best ever, but just was a disaster. For those who joined it FROM THE START!!! not three hours into it (which added another hour to the overall time) they know what I am talking about. Overall the worst event ever attended and most frustrating for people who put the entire time and effort into an event.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;The time for the recruitment events is even worse for us. We are on from about 3am PST to 9am PST as our main block, so the Disciples may or may not be able to make the event. Oh well. At least I made the TT event this morning... Only happened to wake up at 4am my time to do it. Anyway, as always any pre-dawn stateside players, morning/afternoon Euro or Evening Asia/Aussie players on look us up. Would have been nice to have some overnight events since there are GMs on all the time even if only for this one week.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;No love for the overnight players again.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>I have no problem with the idea and I think it's great.  I just think they should work with either the guild leaders or the recruitment officers two weeks in advance so that everyone can actually plan things out expecting for it to happen.  Not just have it sprung on us.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;There are a few more days left this week to make things more favorable for everyone at the Summer Festival.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Guild Recruitment in Lake Rathetear Arena - is not the &lt;EM&gt;best&lt;/EM&gt; location to get to for &lt;U&gt;anyone&lt;/U&gt;, unless summoned!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Note: The last Shadee Traydur venue change to the Arena was &lt;STRONG&gt;not&lt;/STRONG&gt; a "friendly" East Commons game show.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I agree with the other comments also, I understand the nature of hunts and dynamic events.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Please&amp;nbsp;plan at LEAST one Evening or Night regularly schedule event so that folks know &lt;U&gt;where&lt;/U&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;U&gt;when&lt;/U&gt; to gather.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Even if it becomes a Guild oriented "sponsored" opportunity.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Scavenger hunts. Are they being done by level? (40-50, 50-60, 65 only?)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;These kind of events are a double edged sword. While it would be great for someone like me if they would announce the start times publicly, you'd wind up with a mad rush of people trying to get to them which would water-down the fun. Hopefully I'll luck into logging in at the right time later this week. :)&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I agree that it was a great idea....and it's sort of nice to have the "collect as fast as you can" events, but I really hope they are not all like that. It's a nice little change from the norm but on the other hand it shouldnt be overdone.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;As far as the guild recruitment thing: I am very happy they have decided to do this.....but it puts my guild (and no doubt a few of the other guilds) in a pinch, we are a casual family guild....makes it kinda of hard to get all our people together if we don't have at least a 1 week notice....we have been given a&amp;nbsp;3 day notice and I am scrambling to get my people together to at least have 2 representatives for the time slots. I was kinda bummed when they didn't announce when the guild recruitment would be since we had all been told that the summer festival would start on Monday, I just sort of assumed that they would start the recruitment thing on Monday so I set aside my time and it didn't happen....&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;There will obviously be things that people would say should change and I am sure they will take these suggestions in and apply them to the next festival (or any event like this). But the general idea of this festival is great imo! For all the people at SOE that put their time and ideas into creating this I would like to say thank you = )&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

They don't match.  Also, just because we requested specific times doesn't mean we got the times we requested.  It also goes back to the short notice.  With no communication, there isn't much you can do.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;It kind of explains a lot when they can't coordinate a simple thing like the recruitment times with the guilds doesn't it? It also seems&amp;nbsp;pointless if you do not know when&amp;nbsp;the guilds you want to talk to will be there for sure. Kind of rough to expect every guild to have representatives there the whole time.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
