    <description>&lt;DIV&gt;who designed these spell quests for dod the level 68 1 has a level 73 name at least that a 70 level warrior with 11.5k hp can't tank because they being soe made it unslowable ,knock back and gets stronger as it gets lower in hit points so the reg players have no hope in completeing this quest&amp;nbsp; unless they can grab a high end raiding guild tank that has 14k or more and since most only want to help there guild that leaves reg players lacking. i have tried with 2 tanks 1 70 warrior with 11.5 k hp and a pally with 10.5k hp and a cleric druid and 2 dps wiped each time cleric runs ou of mana druid get knock back . soe realy needs to change these i hate to see level 70 spell quests &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>If you need any of the loot (aside from the spell itself) from the progression quests, then you are not going to be powerful enough to do the quest.   The 68 progression quest drops 150hp/mana level gear. Outfit a group, like mine, with gear similar to that and the group will get owned.  Not a very good risk vs reward. SOE missed the mark on these big time.</description>

      <description>You mean they actually screwed over casters MORE than they did with the BS "Muramite Rune' method of spell distribution?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And here I thought that was impossible!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Never underestimate the idiocy of Sony I guess.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(</description>
