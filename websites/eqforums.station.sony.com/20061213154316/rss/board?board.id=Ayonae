      <title>Ayonae Ro is Dying</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Ayonae&amp;message.id=116#M116</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Due to the multiple new MMO's out, there is a drastic pull from old Everquest to newer games. While I can't blame anyone for wanting something new, I'm starting to think it's killing our world. Those of us who have remained true, are suffering in the aftermath of WoW and EQ2. I've spoken to enough people about this to realize its not just me. I have a 66th level Rogue on Ayonae Ro, and I spend an average of 6 hours a day trying to find a group. I do not have a bad reputation keeping me from groups, and in a server I feel is heavy with tanks and healers, Im pretty sure its not because Im simply not needed, anywhere, ever. When I do find a group Im lucky if it can be held together for more than an hour. Granted people have things to do and real life interferes, this however, is ruining the gaming experience for those of us still trying to enjoy ourselves. I would hate to think that to retrieve the fun I was previously having I would have to move on to another game.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;On a side not, I don't feel we should have to pay $75 to move to another server that has a larger population, to once again do what we are already paying $15 a month for.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;"While the issue is not as simple as removing flags altogether (we feel flags are necessary for the zones they are currently attached to)" &amp;nbsp;- snip&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;There are only so many people who can and do play mmo's. Many, MANY people have left eq for eq2 or WoW. Many have simply quit due to the many issues with recent expansions. So many on aro in fact that there is a major decompression in every guild I hear about with very few exceptions. Guilds are merging together to try and remain strong enough to meet the stringent requirements placed on them to achieve these obsolete flags,&amp;nbsp;or disbanding entirely.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Meanwhile, apparently, back at HQ, all the sony eq1 employees are in a rose colored vacuum, blithely pretending that somehow none of this matters.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;What we have is the few people who are already ep+ and who havent quit being either forced to continue the monotonous backflagging that has been the bane of FUN in eq since the release of POP, or forced not to support their guilds endeveaors as they suck up any and all players they can to try and&amp;nbsp;beat the encounters with&amp;nbsp;sheer numerical&amp;nbsp;power - which we then have raid forces where 15% is geared up to the point of being able to do the content successfully and the rest are speed bumps.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I remember when velious came out, and you had to run to the dragon spire to get the dragon key to be able to port to the place you just ran to. They finally came to there senses after a while, and it turns out it was EXACTLY that simple to fix the problem - REMOVE the innane&amp;nbsp;key requirement that DIMINISHED&amp;nbsp;the chance of having fun playing&amp;nbsp;the game.&amp;nbsp; Games are supposed to be fun, not second careers - something one does to get AWAY from work, not ADD to it.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I honestly doubt they will let this post stay, but on the off chance that anyone at the company reads or understands what I am saying I felt compelled to post it. The game is dying, strangled to death by market forces and simple economic truths. Mark my words, if you continue to support these outdated methods of inhibiting the player base from enjoying themselves through the attainment of new places to play and things to see, if you continue to make everquest WORK instead of FUN, guilds will continue to erode; players sick to death of redoing grummus and carprin et al will continue to exodus to other pastures, and in the end there wont be any one left but the people wearing the&amp;nbsp;rose colored glasses.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Now dont get me wrong, I think there are certain key encounters, RZtW for instance, who are clearly there more to gauge the abilities of a guild to deal with content AFTER that event is successfully completed which should still require a successful win - lets face it if a guild cant take rztw they are gonna do a lot of CR post rztw, however continuing to stick rigidly to the idea that the entire progression of 22 some odd flags are still vital to the game is demonstrative of a serious lack of awareness of the real state of everquest - at least on aro. I have to wonder how many guilds can actually produce 85 players on aro anymore on a nightly basis. I havent gone on a raid since these changes were implemented and I leave myself open to seeing some real benefit from these changes, but this is the writing I see on the wall and it is written very, very clearly.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Happy Holidays,&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;One Customers Persepective&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;250+ (thats ~ six thousand hours) non-bazaar days played..&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;.. so they all rolled over and one fell out, one bear in the bed and the little one said, where did everyone go?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>Zone - The Guild</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Ayonae&amp;message.id=102#M102</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I would like to take this time to point out some factors to anyone looking to join or work with the guild "Zone". I almost never post to message boards because of the constant flaming and rants these things create, but I feel strongly enough about this issue that it's a must, no matter the consequence. After experiencing first hand what the guild was like, it was brought to my attention that the guild was all about the leaders and not the guild as a whole. Many times when the guild would raid, I would find myself pummeled into the ground while the Rogue, yes, I said rogue, would pull and bring back most of the mobs with him, if it were possible, I'm sure he would have brought other mobs from other zones into the mass as well, that was merely an annoyance but something that should be pointed out. Now I've never asked for help at any time because I was busy helping everyone else, but I do like to occasionally pick up loot or extra money so that I may progress my character beyond the lost experience or gear that has surely become outdated with the 8 expansions we now have to look forward to churning and burning through. Where is the point you ask? The point is there is generally 2 looters during our raids, the Guild Leader, and the Guild Leader's Husband. I'll leave you to figure out who they are because I don't want to point out names here. During the raids they loot everything, diamonds blue diamonds, random weapons etc,anything that isn't no drop basically. They do not, at any time, lotto or use the point system to make sure some of the loot goes to others, there is no guild bank. So I ask myself why I'm raiding to get all these points that I don't even get the opportunity to use. So I kept doing the raids thinking that someday the points system will actually be put to good use, still no luck, still a waste of time, other then the few select who get epic pieces. So you may ask, where does all this money go? Well the guild leaders pockets is what I've found. Several times I've seen them wipe raids, and retry and wipe again. Well this happens, so what right? The difference is, one night a guildy was promised to get the epic piece that was to drop, there was no mention of a roll and the person was on the loot list, so it was understood, without specifics that the person would loot the piece, which is exactly what the person did, well , suddenly the leaders's go, umm why did you loot that? And the person replied that they thought thats what they were supposed to do, a simple misunderstanding right? Well, after a couple minute this person was petitioned, berated, called a liar and a thief by their own guild leaders. This person did not ninja and log, this person did not do any thing but apologize for the mis understanding, and offered to stay and help the one other person, (who incidentally hadn't signed on for a year and was the only competition for the piece decides they need it that same night too). Meanwhile, tells and guild messages and messages to other guilds are going on saying they're going to run this person off the server. It was handled very childish for something I know was a misunderstanding. Now I do know the person this happened to, and I again, do not want to mention names, because I'm only bringing a point here. I am one to stick up for my friends, but only when I see they really did make an honest mistake, and was treated like a villan, I can't help but do any thing to see it right, that is why I am posting here. I'm sure many will be able to figure out who I am just from this post, and thats fine. I decided after this incident that it was time for me to leave the guild, and continue my journey's solo because I am not putting in my time just to better 2 people's characters who really don't care about others, and will on a whim, accuse people of being full time crooks on mistakes. After I left, I get word that Leaders mentioned that I wasn't much of a loss since I was just a friend of the "crook". Well that being said, I'm glad I left. To moral of the story is, take careful consideration before joining this guild. The grass is always greener on the other side, unfortunately, sometimes it's sitting on a septic tank.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>Open Raids</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Ayonae&amp;message.id=97#M97</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Ok I've been gone for a while, but back when I was playing alot there was a channle in the game that was all about getting raids going in different area... In my return I have noticed that the channle is no longer around... and every once in a while I see shouts for raids getting together, but most of those are hard to see deu to useless spam from others in ok..&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I'm not all that sure that I am allowed to do this, but I would like to start an information post here for when ever open raids plan on getting something together... or maybe have a weekly thing posted here, so people would know in advance where to meet and go....&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Hello everyone as much as i like this server i am growing tired of constant lag and crashes. Have top of the line computers and still have bad issues. Was talking to a old friend tonight who started playing and made a toon on his server to continue to talk off the phone and much to my disbelief the server was awesome. As on ayonae ro i have all kinds of lag and ld issues and crashes on server. Well on this other server i noticed i was able to zone in a instant like my computers where new again no lag even with over 120 people in pok i mean no lag at all. zoneing everywhere was really fast. No graphics issues that i experience a lot all the graphics where GREAT. Everything looked so much better. I then decided to try 5 other servers same things they were all awesome in these respects. Brings in the question just what is wrong with ayonae ro is the server machine really really old? Running slow? Having a lot of issues? I believe yes. I believe that sony should either replace the server machine or split the server. I dont believe our current server can handle to much more load lol. How many others see this issue? If so lets start saying so to the right people get our server upgraded or something maybe replaced.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Maybe I should have said Thursday Morning.&amp;nbsp; I usually play around Midnight on weekdays and I was wondering if there is anyone out there that wants to start playing together.&amp;nbsp; I was thinking we could create new characters, and get together for roleplaying and adventers.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I wanted to try somthing kinda like what I keep seeing on TNZ, where we play non-twinked characters, and just explore and have fun while we level up.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If anyoone is interested let me know.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; You can post here or send me a PM.&amp;nbsp; Also if you have any ideas on how we should do this let me know.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Im just looking to have some fun!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
