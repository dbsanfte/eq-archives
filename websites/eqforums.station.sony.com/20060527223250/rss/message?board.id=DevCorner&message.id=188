&lt;DIV&gt;I cant believe your actually going to undo the entire monk mitigation nerf.&amp;nbsp; They used to mitigate like a plate tank combined with a block on the uber end they could out tank ... tanks in exp groups.&amp;nbsp; Thats why they were nerfed: because a paladin got his butt handed to him by a monk with the same AC.&amp;nbsp; Now&amp;nbsp; lets put this to bed right now....&amp;nbsp; Is that what its going back to? &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Will a monk with the same AC as a paladin when no shields are involved be a better tank then the paladin?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I am not so sure on the concerns quoted above. I'll have to look at the AC of monks now a days... but half the problem that was there before was also created by itemization, like 50 ac pants from Avatar of War.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Since then I beleive that the gear for monks has dropped in AC substantially, though I may be wrong.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Can anyone shed light here?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The nerf was brought about for one reason because at the time there was an AC hard cap.&amp;nbsp; I can't remember the exact numbers right off but I think it was a little above 1k AC.&amp;nbsp; If any class went over the hard cap it didn't do anything to their damage taking ability.&amp;nbsp; So at the time a 1200 AC monk would mitigate the same as a 1500 AC warrior since both were above the hard cap.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The AC system has since been changed.&amp;nbsp; Today there are soft caps, which has been parsed at 1340ish for monks.&amp;nbsp; Once the soft cap has been reached there is a diminished return on AC above it.&amp;nbsp; And it is true that the AC items available to monks today are not as close to what the plate classes can acheive as it was pre nerf.&amp;nbsp; So the monks ability to generate AC is still going to be below the plate classes.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;I've played EQ for&amp;nbsp;over 6 years. &amp;nbsp;It was great in the beginning.&amp;nbsp; It was great all the way through PoP, in my opinion.&amp;nbsp; After that, however ..... EQ has just gotten worse and worse ... though I keep playing.&amp;nbsp; However, if the classes undergo these changes that would probably be enough to make me quit for good.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I&amp;nbsp;played Star Wars Galaxies too for a while.&amp;nbsp; Then they changed the classes .. completely.&amp;nbsp; Horrible.&amp;nbsp; I quit and refuse to go back.&amp;nbsp; Why Sony is intent on ruining games that have nothing wrong with them, I do not know.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Please do not make these changes.&amp;nbsp; I, and 99% of the players that have played for years would be, without a doubt, against it.&amp;nbsp; These changes are as stupid as they get.&amp;nbsp; It would be changing EQ into a totally different game.&amp;nbsp; If i wanted to play a different game I'd go play Worlds of Warcraft ... and I may if this happens.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You guys have totally screwed soloing in EQ, obviously you dont play the game, if ya did ya would know that now most quests like 80%, ya need help with, kinda a real drag sitting in front of a puter for hours waiting to see if anyone will help ya with a quest. Further, whats the point for colour anymore ? A 44-45 Necro with pet, with help ie rats buffs, cant snuff a green ^^ ? Ratio is way outta wach my Necro seldom takes solo anything blue solo unless its not heroic green or blue. If this keeps up I'll trash my Necro, and try my Wiz, if that turns out like thr Necro it will be adios Sony :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all, been reading through this post for a good 2 hrs. this morning, the post seems kind of all over regarding the status of the Re-Envisioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Has there been an official announcement , lately, regarding the class re-envisioning? Many people seem frustrated as to the lack of developer response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Was thinking, if the developers are keeping quiet as to this subject, could it be because of the next expansion? Supposedly, it will give content from Lvl 1 to 75? Could this be Soe's answer to many of the problems the game may/may not be going through?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I do hope that if Soe is taking another route to address the class issues, that atleast an official response is in order.......something like &amp;quot; Hello all, I am developer &amp;quot; X &amp;quot; today I have some exciting news, the Class Re-envisioning issues discussed in this thread, have been figured out ! With our next expansion, characters will have a much greater ability to solo, and a much wider ability to group with classes other than the' Holy Trinity' currently needed---stay tuned !!! &amp;quot; Of course this is just speculation, but would be nice to hear 'something' from the developers.................  :D&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Wow, people still posting on this dead thread?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;'Class re-envisioning' is never going to happen, it is an excuse soe use to explain why they havn't fixed any of the numerous problems with many classes. Then they use expansions as excuses why class re-envisioning never gets done.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They release an expansion every 6 months. They take 5 months to design it, 3 weeks to code it and 1 week to test it. Then the next expansion has to start late as they need 2 months after release to try to get some of the bugs out of it, then they forget the remaining bugs to try to get the next expansion out the door.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This dosent leave any time for anything else.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ang.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Do you have a paladin lol? Its not 50%, its 25%. And it lasts for only 5 ticks. Usually on raid mobs, it vanishes in a couple of rounds (maybe 10 seconds?). Guard of Righteousness might be....nice....when you're fighting mobs that hit for 800, then that 10k cap won't really hurt too much, but 2k+, its gone before you can blink. I would also like to see Silent Piety retuned into some form of self DI. I really don't see an issue with giving paladins DI, make it a long casting time (8 seconds). On raids, theres generally enough clerics to give the tanks DI, and with a long cast time, there is no way to put it back up if it goes down while tanking.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Well I could of completely missed the boat, but I am not sure why casters are asking for the 2nd part, as in my mind the 1st part was caster specific, the updates to spells and refresh times, adding new spells for all levels to balance out progression and so forth.&lt;br&gt;The melee got left behind ie not part two for them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Not sure if this will post or not. currently deployed so our net is weird at times. I may have missed something in the posts but i didnt see anything about necroes. I have played off and on since 2000 started out as a rogue (thought i was the king of all when i got a full set of gothic ring). finally settled on necro as main class with a ranger that i bot as extra dps backup snare( best combo i found for 2boxing on one system). While i understand to a degree the issues with druids and cleric in the healing arena and the plate tanks issues (have played pal sk and war in pop zones). i have noticed a few things one overall clerics are the best healers i tried a shammy war combo but found the shammy couldnt keep up with the 40-60 range with my war my buddies 60+ shaman could my 50 shaman could not handle the loss of hp when soloing. anyway i digress i could go on about combinations in the growing stages all day. however back to the lords of eq the necro. i understand some of my kind left the game slowly over time as our pets dots and nukes slowly became not as good for soloing. while the 45sec timer is great for raids group mobs it sucks soloing i am not a time geared toon my current necro is 70 and has decent gear but it is mostly crystal gear and a few friends have a piece rotting somewhere and let me go loot only like 2 pieces of &amp;quot;raid level&amp;quot; gear. we have lost our soloing edge. before i get flamed too hard yes i know that on a normal basis we can solo mobs that most casual players only see in a group but gone are the days of a necro soloing mobs that a higher end group can take. i can solo mpg ent but not in past that.  if i had 1300aa's i probably could move in a little bit more but my little vacations kinda kill my aa grinds. they keep reenvisioning all these other classes meanwhile rangers and necroes slowly lose the edge we had.  while we still can rival rogues in sustained dps we are losing that to other classes. add in the fact that lowend players are no longer playing in the zones i grew up in they dont get that feeling of power and prestige that i felt as a necro growing up. the race for levels is more difficult in that groups often dont want a necro unless its a fear trial ( still need the other trials but as im not in an uber getting a slot for one is difficult). ill edit this later work calls.  i really need to get home as it it im another year behind by the time i get back</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;i dont see why pallys should be pushed above with what they already can do since with a don  tome a pally can mitigated 50% on top of what they can mitigate already.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'd really love to see the class re-envisioning take place, but ummmm I can't find ANYTHING official about this since the post from March, 2005; over a YEAR ago!.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can anyone link a dev response or post by an official EQ representative that they are either actually still planning on doing &amp;quot;class re-envisioning&amp;quot;, or that it is dead?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have seen MINOR changes (ex: the knight gimp defensive), but nothing major like they had talked about (for example druids being able to switch back and forth from great-healing-and-ok-dps TO bad-healing-but-extra-dps).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seems to me that the Everquest team had a bunch of great ideas, implemented a few minor ones, and then this completely died out.  It hasn't even been mentioned within the last year in any of the dev chats as far as I remember.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is this just something that people like to chat about, but isn't really a &amp;quot;project&amp;quot; for the developers anymore?!? :smileysad:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Kaz&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well this is an aa revamping not a class revamping.  However, many of us cleric's invested aa's into a ward.  This ward was designed to &amp;quot;AOE&amp;quot; heal everyone.  Now I understand that the healing on this ward is like well not really that noticable however stacked with other cleric's &amp;quot;wards&amp;quot; and such it might one day become usefull.  The only thing that makes these wards unusefull is the fact that they die to aoe's.  It would be really nice of sony if they could make the ward that has 100 hp (aprox) immune to aoe's.  Or maybe explain to me why we even have this ward.  During downtime it still is uneffective do to everyone will regin hp's way before they regin there mana.  ATM this aa seems like an awesome idea for aoe mobs and such.  In depths of darkhollow they even added one that removed poison and diseise counters.  However since these wards are also effected by the aoe's and most aoe's have a initial dd to them the ward dies and proves ineffective.  So just wondering are these working as planned?  Or could we get the wards so that they are not effected by aoe's. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ty for your time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dewey&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Just a couple concepts for the paladin class.  Compared to warriors and shadow knights, paladins take damage very poorly compared to other classes when you add everything up.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;1.  Warriors naturally mitigate better&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;2.  Shadowknights life tap to DPS, heal themselves, and agro the mob they are tanking (very efficient)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The way a paladin decreases the ammount of damage it takes in any way above innate skill, is to stun a mob.  There is very  little a level 70 paladin in anguish or greater can stun either on raids or xp groups.  An SK can still tap a level 73 mob; a warrior doesn't lose mitigation when the mob is above level 70.  The only other way a paladin takes comparatively less damage is by targetting him or herself and healing.  While this is happeneing, the paladin is doing slim to no damage to the mob (damage shield and ripostes) and they are generating very little agro to hold the mob.  To sum it up, with mobs above level 70, paladins lose our balance of being a tank and get easily surpassed by the other two tank classes.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;My reccomendation would be to make just one of our 4 second stuns (with 1 sec cast) be able to affect mobs up to 5 levels higher than us (with the exclusing of raid mobs, which would be flagged stun immune).  This would provide us the equivalent ease of healing to that of an equally geared SK.  Yes we would still have our heals which SKs dont, but SKs still have the ability to pull with FD, do group mana, and to do appx twice our DPS on non undead mobs.  Overall I feel this proposition is ballanced and fair.  Thank you for any consideration.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;My second idea:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I would liek to see Silent Piety revisited.  It originally had the DI component which was deemed to be overpowered.  IF the DI component was placed in there in the first place, I am assuming developers were not opposed to the idea, but didn't seem to see a way to ballance it.  I feel tying the DI component to our Lay Hands would work beautifully.  If a paladin has Silent Piety up and dies, or gets below X percent  (preferably 5 or lower since Lay hands is a decently long refresh), then the game does a check on Lay Hands.  If the ability is available, perform lay hands, and now lay hands is down and Silent Piety wears off.  Now if Silent Piety is cast again, there is no chance of a DI save until Lay Hands refreshes. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I feel this would breathe life into this spell that is currently shunned by the pladin community, allow for the implementation of a concept developers already liked to some extent, and would not be overpowered or out of ballance since Lay Hands is an ability we have had since day one.  Thank you again for any consideration.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The return of relevanc of stuns would be welcome to all classes that use them :)  As a clerics i miss doing th god trials and saving a silky when no heal could of.  It gave me another way to contribute and it was useful, oh yah it was fun too..  Now any xp mob worth killing is yellow or red /=</description>

      <description>Ok, to all the developers, why not just delete rogues from the game? Cause with PoR u have almost made us useless. I want to know why i spent the AA on SoS? cause it sure is useless in PoR, . plus alot of dodh zones. Then to make resonating screech melee slow that cast every 5 seconds. Im  have great gear, and good resist, but this is just ridicuous, when  monk have enough power to solo level 73 mobs , least they can solo when not in groups, we have enough trouble finding groups at present to  do this exspansion like this is crazy. I want someone to respond to this and try to give me a reasonable explanaton.Thx&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;They are done with the changes to the classes. They diden't realy know wich way to go with it and now they are most likely thinking that the changes that they did make are not what they wanted, so they are leaving it be where it is.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Or they just don't have the time to do anything. Just look at the DoDH banner that's still here, apparently they have droped support for these forums since the release of EQ players. All their resourses that are left to work on this game are put on web devel for EQ players and any new expansions.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I'd susspect any class change ideas&amp;nbsp;they decide to do would actually be filtered to other "newer" SoE games.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hate to say this Valuric but if you click on forums on EQ players this is the boards you are taken to lol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Personally I dont believe we will see much if anything come out of Re-envisionment. I feel the marketing and business people at SOE have decided that new expansions, no matter how badly balanced and buggy, will always have precedence over the devs time. Its not the devs fault its the beancounters. Only fault, as far as I see, is that of the devs failure to keep us informed of what, if anything is still happening. Same can be said about the techies when things go wrong. MAybe its an overall area that SOE need to address and have a customer service or PR focused person much more closely associated with the boards.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
