<DIV>In congratulating Kytherea as she takes on her new role as Community Relations Manager for EQ.&nbsp; After a grueling search for a successor, (<EM>which consisted of me stumbling around the office in a caffeine induced haze, pointing at people and asking if they wanted the job)</EM> Kytherea has accepted <EM>(she had her head phones on at the time and really had no idea what I was saying, she was just smiling and nodding at the crazy man).&nbsp; </EM></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Kytherea has worked far too long under my tutelage and torture and is now ready to dole out some torture of her own.&nbsp; This is a well deserved promotion for the wielder of the mighty War Hamster.&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Please have mercy upon her.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Congratulations Kytherea!&nbsp; Bring on the Hamsters!</DIV>
