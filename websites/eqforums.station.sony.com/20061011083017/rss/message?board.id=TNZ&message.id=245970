    <title>Bard Pulling Question</title>
    <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=TNZ&amp;message.id=245970</link>
    <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I have been playing my neglected lvl 40&amp;nbsp;Bard for the past few nights and have a question about pulling mobs. I have been using the song Selo's Consonant Chain to pull the mobs back to my camp. This works well but it's a little slow getting back to the camp.It's basically a snare pull.&amp;nbsp;I want to speed things up a bit and am wondering what's the best method for pulling mobs. I was thinking maybe I should get some throwing awes and try that method, who sells them? Is there a better method?&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>What the other people said...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Snare does have it's uses for pulling though. Like when the creature moves very fast in an indoor zone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sometimes you'll get a tank that's very slow to tag, and snaring the creature right before it reaches the group can save your healer a bit of mana.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>The speed to bard pulls is the mez.&amp;nbsp; If there's 2 mobs, mez one, let the other aggro, and bring it to camp knowing there'll be another inc in a mo that'll need mezzing.&lt;br&gt;It's the gaps between combat that feels slow, if once you've got a mob in camp, you can run off, bring one in and let it be mezd/debuffed/slowed ready for the tank to instantly switch over,the loss of bard song whilst pulling won't be missed, and you'll get better at dashing off just as the regen/mana song has landed.&amp;nbsp; You get a bit more time to prep the pull whilst the groups fighting as they won't notice the time as much.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; If there's multiple camps of mobs near where your pulling to, leave an easy single/duo nearby if you mistime the rate of killing in camp and need to top off the groups mobs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Controlled chain pulls is where the speed is, keep working on it and you'll find groups appreciate the speed.&amp;nbsp; Just let them know what your doing in advance to prepare for it.&lt;br&gt;(this technique is something that you'll continue to rifine the rest of your bard pulling time, so it's well worth starting when you can).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;snare pulling sucks regardless of class [not talking about&amp;nbsp;snare splitting.&amp;nbsp; Im talking about the act of snaring&amp;nbsp;just to bring it to camp]&amp;nbsp; mem lull and pell when pulling at those levels.&amp;nbsp; lull to your satisfaction then pull with pell.&amp;nbsp; Thats what i did.&amp;nbsp; You can do what ever you want but snaring on a pull should only be done when your scared of something or want to stagger something.&amp;nbsp; But generally speaking bards mez when they want to stagger a pull so thats not really your thing =)&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Keep in mind you can always hit it with snare/slow when its next to camp.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>imo pull with fufils... it's got a good range, and the magic debuff since you can land other stuff on it easier.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
