      <title>Welcome to Fennin Ro, new citizens</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Torvonnilous&amp;message.id=84#M84</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Fatale on Fennin Ro is recruiting.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;We are primarily a family/ fun guild.&amp;nbsp; We raid 4 to 6 times per month and you will usually find two guild groups going in various levels; we love to group together.&amp;nbsp; Most of our mains are level 50-70, but we all have alts, and some members are new players as well, so we schedule events for lower levels too.&amp;nbsp; We're just starting the planar progression raids and are seeking other guilds to ally with to do the tougher ones (we can muster 15 to 18 people for a typical raid, which is a bit short of what's needed for planes).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;We want people who want to have fun, who enjoy helping others as well as getting the help they need.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If you want to join a guild, or if your guild is looking for partners to team up with, catch any Fatale member online or email me at klangley2@mindspring.com .&amp;nbsp; We have a website paid for but it's not active yet, so I'm not posting it until there is something to look at.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Good hunting!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=4&gt;Hey everybody,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=4&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This is Siimba Heartsong, writing from Iraq. If you remember me good to go. I am in the US Marines, but i have been ingame since launch. You may remember me as Gearr Goyle, Archangelus Michaelus, Siimba Heartsong, or any of my other names. Since i have been in the Corps, i have not been able to play almost at all except for a few times in december of 2003, but i am happy to announce that Siimba will be coming to a Zone near you in October or November, depending on when i get sent back home. Since Operation Iraqi Freedom 2 has occupied me out here near Falluja for quite some time, i have been almost completely sanctioned from comp access, so forgive for the lack of emails and such to those who are dear to me. My E-mail is listed, please send a note sometime if you would like to stay in touch. Anyways, duty calls once more so i will have to cut this off. To all those who play in my fav world, see you soon and love the pie. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=4&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; sincerely, &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <title>Looking for a Guild</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Torvonnilous&amp;message.id=55#M55</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I play a 48 Ranger on the Torv. server. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;For the most part I have soloed, LDoN, and pickup groups to get where I am now. This has worked good for the most part. I can still pick up LDoNs. As far as just a pick up group, I have found most players have moved onto the plains. I have ented the Plains a few time, but no luck on finding a pick up group. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;With that being said, I am on the lookout for a Guild.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I'm looking for a raiding/family guild.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Any links or help would be great&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Thanks,&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>For Devs: LDoN Refund Problem (please read)</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Torvonnilous&amp;message.id=54#M54</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I recently petitioned with the following problem:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I purchased two pieces of the Rage armor that was erroneously added to the Live server LDoN merchants a while back. I purchased thse two pieces not knowing that they would be taken out of the game. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Now that there is a refund, I am now stuck having spend 2x 1492 and not being able to get them back. I think the same problem holds true for people with the multi-slot aug BPs and other items that were altered from their originally broken or unbalanced states.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;My petition was answered by an SOE CS rep telling me that since there is no way to proove that I did not know the items were bad they will not be able to refund my points, trade me for a refundable piece of the same point-value or make the item refundable...&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I don't see how I and anyone else in the same boat should be made to pay for the mistakes that were made in placing these items and many others like them in game. Once they were in, without an immediate comment about them, as well as the fact that it was unforeseeable that we would be getting refunds, there is no way for SOE to tell me that I might have tried to "exploit" them by buying these items.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If they didn't want the players to keep them, they could have removed them off players as well as the merchants. I understand that they probably did not want to do this, because it would have been a rather lengthy and time-consuming undertaking. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;At this point however, I don't see what damage it would do to simply flip the switch on the Rage items and make them refundable. It would not be unbalancing and it would simply make up for the fact that SOE made a mistake. Acknowledging your mistakes and fixing subsequent issues that arise from these mistakes should be high priority in the CS arena.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Please someone tell me that "there is no proof" isn't the final answer to my problem. I work hard during the day and don't have that much time to play. 2x 1492 points is a LOT of points to lose on an item that will now just simply get put in the bank, if not destroyed outright.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Sincerely with hope,&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;-Alters peoples posts to make them say what he wishes them to say&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;-SIngle handedly, along with a few of his admins, has created a hostlie environment for the people of torv to throw crap at one another. How many runors were started on the tov board? How many people had reputations destroyed because of that board (and alot didn't deserve what the trolls dished out).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Get this, he doesn't even play EQ anymore--hasn't for a long time. So, he cares very little if he ruins things for you.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Alot of people have left Torv, it is consistenty one of the lowest popu;ated servers...with people like this at the forefront of the community it is no wonder that half the people I knew leave the server.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Torvonnilous&amp;message.id=27#M27</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;This past weekend there was a weird event going on, I do not think this was a GM event but I might be wrong, there was a war going on between the Eldritch collective and the meldrath minions, most mobs were DB near the mino caves, we tried to kill a few but when you killed one it would split in 2 and were tougher than previous mob, we killed only a few but they were too hard to handle with a single group, maybe with some cc we would have killed more but was imposiblle since people were training mobs left and right, after a few hours of battle the zone was reset and was as calmed as ever. I searched for clues of any quests that might have implemented in the zone but could not find any. I almost forgot to mention that Meldrath was yellow con to level 65...&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>I was killing shisar stalkers for their organs the other day and I killed almost every single one I could find and none dropped any organs. Just wondering if this quest was removed or something. I killed about 20-25 of them.</description>
