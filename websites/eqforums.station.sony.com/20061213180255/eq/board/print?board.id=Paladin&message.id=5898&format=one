<P>I agree with Royr, it sounds like you're doing it incorrectly.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no "single-pulling" involved in this.&nbsp;&nbsp; You have 3 gravestones around the stage area.&nbsp; You position 3 groups, 1 near each gravestone, and you kill everything that spawns so they don't reach the stage.&nbsp; Eventually, Mujaki becomes targetable, and he is standing there on the stage alone at this point.&nbsp; You run and kill him, then the 2nd one spawns in the same spot.<BR></P>

<DIV><BR>There is single-pulling involved if you're doing it with a limited number of people.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>We were killing the gravestone spawns, but due to lack of DPS we fell behind while trying to eliminate the waves that spawn 2 mobs each (from each gravestone), and the next wave hit before we were done with the last.&nbsp; Some got by us and joined Mujaki on the stage.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>When Mujaki became targetable, we didn't want to try to offtank his companions at the same time (they become targetable and aggro-able when he does), and didn't have an enchanter, so we worked at single-pulling him away from his helpers.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The first time we attempted this we had a few deaths (due to the puller being Feared then eaten), and by the time we were done rezzing and rebuffing and medding a couple of times, and were ready for another pull attempt, he despawned.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The second time, a few weeks later, we single-pulled him successfully on first attempt, and killed him easily.&nbsp; But no Shade spawned when he died.&nbsp; We'll try it again tomorrow now that the devs say they've fixed it.</DIV>
