<P><BR>because now all the mobs are grey to green, so there realy is no exp there anymore. and because why would anyone in their right mind go some place that now penalizes them to go there, compared to everything else now? yeah oh sure its no worse then it was before ooc regen, but thats not the point to you all oh so whiners that have to try and whine and call everyone else whiners. was there a penalty for going there pre TSS? nope, notta zero zilch zip, but now there is a masive penalty.</P>
<P>also for sake of arguement i used to bring up all alts through here to level and exp up through to like 55-60ish, why would anyone in their right mind now want to even consider that when you can go anywhere else in the game at that level and not get penalized?</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>come on bring on the flames you oh so whiners that whine constantly calling everyone whiners. you do know you guys whine more then the people you complain about right? nah probably not, still in denial i take it.</P>
