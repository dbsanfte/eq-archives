      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I wish they would, but the devs probably don't want to deal with the balancing issues. IMO, Bsts are very powerful (perhaps too powerful) at the low end, and Bers are not powerful enough at the low end.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>I'd love to see berserkers and beastlords added to the starting game OR I would like to see all berserker/beastlord loot removed from the loot tables. I would be pissed off if my guild kills trakanon and we get a beastie and berserker tunic. If that happens will we be able to petition for new gear? lol&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>I'll stick with some facts. See if you can argue them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Beastlords were a class tied to the luclin expansion. In order to play a beastlord, you had to buy the expansion. Just because they allowed other races to play beastlords, doesn't make them global.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Beserkers were a class tied to the Gates of Discord expansion. In order to play a Beserker, you had to buy the expansions. Just because they allowed other races to play beserkers, doesn't make them global.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is it that hard to understand?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Obviously SoE doesn't want to make beastlords or beserkers global on ANY server, why would they want to make it global for the progression?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;No, not obvious they don't want to, only obvious they haven't done it yet, one year ago you could have said the exact same thing about the raid, LFG, and map windows because those were expansion linked then.</description>

      <description>Simple things that are taken for granted such as PoK, the map function, and the LFG tool are minor things that should have been globally included in the first place. It's been over 3 years since luclin's release. They still havn't made beastlords global...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Guess what, They aren't going to make them global for the progression server.  I don't know about berserkers, but here's what I know about beastlords.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reasons why they won't make beastlords global&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;   &lt;br&gt;   - Can't do epic untill Luclin&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   - Pet procs do too great of damage for a classic enabled server&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   - There's no lore tied to beastlords pre luclin&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>1.  If people are ok with pickign a class where they cannot get thier epic during kunark, then who are you to nay say?&lt;br&gt;2.  So do wizards/mage/necros/druids&lt;br&gt;3.  Depends on what you mean by lore... there are beastlord specific quests, drops and NPCs in pre-luclin zones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Well not sure on beastlords, but beserker's have lore in EQ, beserker pre-dates some gods in the game, I belive acording to EQ lore sullon zek is a berserker.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;All of the berserker epic quest is in original and kurnak zones, and as Jayabalard said people can still play the class without the epic being avaliable in kurnak, you could go thru the entire game and never get your epic, doesn't matter in the long run.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;On beastlords pet procs, they aren't unbalancing to the game, they don't get better till higher levels with spells avaliable in later expansion zones, lower levels they are in line balance wise with every other class, and berserkers if anything are slightly underpowered.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Pointless bump up from page 4.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;REALLY hoping that devs reconsider this issue, what with the content thats live now to handle these two classes that isn't tied to any one expansion.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Bazaar and PoK are now global in EQ... but will not be available on the progression server at start.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Having Beastlords and Berzerkers at start does not make any sense to me game play wise OR lore wise. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Beastlords would be unable to do their epic as it requires access to Luclin. It is also Luclin era loot with it's stats and procs. Also, lore wise I think of it this way. Beastlords were released as the same time as access to the moon was gained and we met with the Vah Shir. Until this time, the knowledge of the beastlord was loss to all races on Norrath and it was this event that allowed the lessons to be taught to the Norrathian races.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Berzerkers have an issue when it comes to their epic as well. While I believe it CAN be done with old world zones, it is a GoD era weapon, not a Kunark era weapon. Also, it adds mobs into zones that are a bit out of line at that point. Picture heading into PoFear and having Ireblind imp up when you are all level 50 in Original and Kunark era gear (either from a previous failed attempt or because you run to wall and kill scarlings and accidently kill the enraged)... It would like zoning up into Severilous, VS, Cazic, or Trak. Not something most guilds JUST getting into Fear at this point in the game could handle on zoning in. Also, Fear to the best of my knowledge will be one of the zones reverted back to original condition (as well as the mobs in Hate) and as such the mob would not be there in that condition.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;What I am trying to say is... there is a LOT more tied to opening up these classes at the start of the server then some people realize. I personally HOPE they will not be allowed as there are still game play and gear balance issues in the game due to the addition of these classes to EQ as a whole.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

The effects/proc on it are identical to the ranger epics.&amp;nbsp; The only&#xD;

community complaining about getting an epic that was cut and paste from&#xD;
the rangers?&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
There's just as much involved with removing them; are they going to go&#xD;
back and remove all of the BL/Berzerker specific gear that was added to&#xD;
the old world/kunark/velious?&amp;nbsp; I hope they don't do the lazy thing&#xD;
and leave the drops in, otherwise guilds who kill trak and get a BL&#xD;
&amp;amp; zerker BP instead of something usable... well, people can plan&#xD;
ahead for thier twinks I guess.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

      <description>Maybe this is not a dev decision as much as an SoE decision.&amp;nbsp; Those expansions were marketed so that if you purchased that expasnion, you got the reward of another race.&amp;nbsp; If they unlock the classes, should they also unlock the 9th spell slot?&amp;nbsp; Because that's also tied to an expansion. Maybe this is unbelievable to you, but there are players that do NOT own the expansions past PoP.&amp;nbsp; Should those people have access to Beserkers?&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's progression, you are meant to go through the content as it was originally presented.&amp;nbsp; Here's a newsflash, races and classes are also considered 'content'. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tanoril &lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;We're not talking about races, we're talking about classes.&amp;nbsp; The ninth spell slot is a non-issue, as it is unlocked via AA, not an automatic thing from just posessing an expansion.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;And yes, IMO, at this point if people don't have Luclin, there is little point in keeping them from making Beastlords, seeing as how new accounts sold in stores have had the Luclin expansion on them for years.&amp;nbsp; And yes, IMO, at this point if people don't have Discord, there is little point in keeping them from making Berserkers, because though the length of time is different, new storebought accounts will include this expansion anyway.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;And, there is a flaw in your logic of calling races and classes 'content' - by that logic, all gear and spells from an expansion are also 'content' yet people can use the tradeable gear and spells without owning the expansion.&amp;nbsp; Ought that 'content' be locked away from people who lack the relevant expansion?&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The statement makes perfect sense, when you consider the servers in general.&amp;nbsp; The request is to make these two classes global, no longer tied to an expansion, in order to fulfill one of the "mission statements" of this server : for everyone to start on an equal footing.&amp;nbsp; If they are made global, however, it would apply to all servers, not just the Progression Server.&amp;nbsp; Also, if someone does not have Luclin then when Luclin is unlocked on the Progression Server, they won't be able to access the moon, but will be able to access 'content' from Luclin : tradeable spells, and gear.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;And yes, it could be done, &lt;EM&gt;&lt;U&gt;IF&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; they chose to.&amp;nbsp; The arguments for it are putting these two classes on an equal footing with everyone else : playable at start, the vast majority of players (&amp;gt; 99%) on other servers have these two expansions and so wouldn't be affected by making them global, and there would be just as much work with recoding mobs and mob drops in making them availalbe from day one as there would be in preventing class specific drops from those two classes from dropping before those two classes are unlocked.&amp;nbsp; So no, I don't have to accept their decision on this issue - it wouldn't be the first decision they've rethought and changed their minds on, y'know.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Oh, and to the person who posted after Ermentraud, who I didn't quote : Berserkers came out with the Gates of Discord expansion, not Omens of War.&lt;/P&gt;</description>
