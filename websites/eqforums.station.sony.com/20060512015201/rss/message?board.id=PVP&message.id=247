&lt;P&gt;Vegetoe...you should have stopped at "I been on rz two years".&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I like Barmaley's idea.&amp;nbsp; If there would be a way to implement something of&amp;nbsp; a reward for control of a zone or something, that would be worthwhile or even limit the number of raids that could do certain content per week.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Or like Spider said, a new zone where the Zek's could enter and fight for content/loot whatever.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;As far as 'picking a fight'...to what end?&amp;nbsp; There's no loot I would want, there's no content we'd be fighting over, it would basically be random pk'ing, and that's not what I want.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;Please extend an invitation to the members EQLive development team involved in the evaluation of PvP to explore the possibilities of "shadowing" one or all of the following top Zek guilds:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Ascending Dawn - Rallos Zek&lt;BR&gt;Hate - Sullon Zek&lt;BR&gt;Pandemonium - Tallon Zek&lt;BR&gt;Defiant - Vallon Zek&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I realize that most Developers prefer the anonymous and invisible approach in dealing with the server populations.&amp;nbsp; Its one thing to be a passive observer, but its another thing entirely if you are an active participant.&amp;nbsp; The leadership of all the above guilds would enthusiasticlly embrace the opportunity.&amp;nbsp; The EQLive team would have a chance to interact with experienced older EQ players, go on a raid or two, and take part in a few large scale pvp encounters.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I would highly recommend coordinating with Guild Officers if there is an interest.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Another option would be to fire-up the Discord Server and "copy" over the characters of the above guilds and assign an EQLive representative to each of the four teams.&amp;nbsp; Make PoTranQ a pk zone and then tell them first one to kill &amp;gt;insert_pop_mob_here&amp;lt; wins.&amp;nbsp; Don't worry about rewards or titles, bragging rights and screen snapshots will take care of that.&amp;nbsp; Teams would probably have to be limited to 36 due to lag issues.&amp;nbsp; One rule only, if you die then you have to sit in PoK naked until the test is completed.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Plane of Valor might be a good zone to do this in.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;All of the "themes and concerns" discussed in this forum could be demonstrated there.&amp;nbsp; Let the officers of the above guilds negotiate the format and rules of such an engagement.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;reason hate is No 1 on pvp boards is they did a ZERG invite of masses of evils when they lost alot of old time players...so you had the accumlated score of all the new guys added on..thye went from 100k behind on points to roughly 60k ahead in a very short while...and yeha they do have some double DT'ers running around....(2 sks who just run up and both DT same time nice pvp strat huh)...you only ever really see a few Hate willing to pvp rest are raiders no pvpers...buit then all pvp guilds have those types of players, just&amp;nbsp; hate has more.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Would love to see all the zeks joined into 1 server as guild based...would make PVP very interesting and would populate alot more zones for active PVPers.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Right now i can login and not find 1 good or evil in a pvp zone....all in instanced zones for safe xping/raiding.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>For the record, The Curse isn't a "gank" guild.  We're simply a PvP guild.  We do not raid.  In fact, we generally dislike raiding.  That being said, we're almost always out looking for a fight.  We don't *try* to gank people, we just usually run as a full group.  It's not our fault 2 guys are AFK at a LDon camps.  We will always stick around for more people to show.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's our approch to the game that differs VanSailor, you guys like to incorporate much more of the PvE aspect in your play.  We, on the other hand, do not.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway, back to the subject at hand... it's pretty silly to have just the top PvE guilds from each server be the representatives regarding PvP.  It should be a mix of the top level PvPer from the whole server.  Sony has logs of who gets the kills, they should extend invites to the people on the top of the kill lists and tell them they can invite 3 people.  Those people should then be brought to a test server where they put to the test all the new changes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's not rocket science.  You need a broad demographic for testing this kind of thing.  Not having one is what got us what we have now!</description>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;I've noticed something about hate lately.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Now my gear, im not the greatest geared wizard around, only about 2300-2400 hp unbuffed.&amp;nbsp; Nothing fancy.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I go around looking for pvp, now the people i pk might have better or worse gear than mine.&amp;nbsp; Doesn't matter.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Lately though, it would be me (alone) or with a couple others, vs like 6+ evils.&amp;nbsp; And we would win, why?&amp;nbsp; Strategy.&amp;nbsp; Lure them away break apart their groups etc.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; So we beat them, then in comes more evils.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Then a group or a group and a half of hate will just storm in, totaling 10+ people just for like 3 of us.&amp;nbsp; All the time..&amp;nbsp; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I have literally NEVER seen hate members solo pvp, when they do they get killed or forced to book.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I can beat a lot of hate 1v1, or in 2v2 fights.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; They are not good at pvp, its all their gear and dts and lifeburns.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; What really makes me laugh is when i go 1v1 with certain hate wizards, we have a lure fest they get me to 60% and start to cast manaburn!&amp;nbsp; yes manaburn on a little ol good team wizard lol.&amp;nbsp; I usually laugh when i click off my hp buff and they sit there dumbfounded on why i didnt die.&amp;nbsp; I had one try to start meleeing me to death while i lured and killed him.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;But yea, i would pick maybe 10 of the most active pvpers from each team.&amp;nbsp; I would say for sullon just look at the scoreboard (which was never fixed like it was promissed).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>Well I really hope that the DEV team does finally talk to the community prior to any changes or server setups.&lt;br&gt;One thing is for sure hindering them and thats the PvP community not speaking with one voice. Every single change will cause tons of people crying fearing to loose their advantage. And generally there are at least two fractions of PvP players (hardcore, wanting huge rewards/penalties for PvP deaths and blue, wanting only small rewards/penalties to prevent griefing) making it nearly impossible to create ONE environment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The solution is already existing - several rulesets.&lt;br&gt;If the servers could be tweaked in cooperation with the communities and also including an one time server move option maybe this could solve a lot of issues. But since that would need some SOE manpower chances are pretty low :(&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;About talking to the top guilds: Well, its generally not a bad idea but has one problem:&lt;br&gt;We on Vallon are a server where not only ONE guild fully dominates the server. There are actually three time enabled guilds (Defiant, Ancient Dawn, Zephyros) with another guild (Aduentus) working hard on it. On a server where only one guild dominates the server via gear advantage I guess they would not want to loose their incredible superiority. Therefore you could not expect a totally neutral and objective statement regarding PvP, esp. high end PvP IMHO.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;just my 2cp...</description>

      <description>Hate is also the largest populated guild on SZ by at least 3x any other guilds numbers... Funny part is if the newts combined to make a guild of the same size Hate would not be #1 which is lol. Hate is also much less skilled at pvp than the newts and goods, part of this being is when everyone else on the server is evil the chance to have to PvP is much smaller. Newts/Goods are much more skilled at PvP since they have to fight 24/7 and do not have the luxury of being "blue" as the evils are.&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The best pvp I've&amp;nbsp;done recently&amp;nbsp;on Rallos Zek was when&amp;nbsp;Wudan the&amp;nbsp;#2 guild on RZ (a plane of time-geared guild) decided to war my velious geared guild.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; At the time of the war Arch Lich was still a major mob for us and camping ssra for emperor keys was a nightly ritual.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Most people on the server thought Wudan would stamp us into oblivion and cause&amp;nbsp;our guild to disband.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;One of Ascending Dawn's officers&amp;nbsp; sent me tells asking if I wanted their guild's assistance.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I thanked AD but turned&amp;nbsp;their offer down and told them it was cotw's problem and we'd try and handle this ourselves.&amp;nbsp; I"m not sure but this is probably why AD's vote to assist us did not pass.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;So we stood up to Wudan and fought them on our own terms, and surprisingly about one -third of the combats we won.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Considering the huge difference in gear many people found this amazing and it only reinterated to me that skill and teamwork &amp;gt; gear in pvp events.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;Anyways it doesn't matter what server you're on, following the top guild will show you nothing. The top guild on my server hasn't raided a zone the #2 guild can enter for over three months.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Follow a guild with fierce competition and you will see the real problems of pvp surface.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;thats the same with following the #1 guild on SZ. Hate never pvps or barely ever pvps. The only time the come out is if we are CCing them.. All over times they are raiding/xping in zones we cant even enter.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>bar' has a good idea, that would be very interesting to see pvp guilds compete with other pvp guilds of different servers.&amp;nbsp; It could give pvp "rebirth" so to speak. Why even limit it, bring back competitions like BOTB, and such.&amp;nbsp; Bring back things that were fun and would make people want to pvp.&amp;nbsp; ALso I am new and all but i dont udnerstand just exactly what is trying to be done with when the devolopers constantly "balance" classes.&amp;nbsp; On what grounds are they balanced, and waht legit reasons.&amp;nbsp; I know that you are looking into a new pvp system which is fine and dandy, but come one pvp is Player vs player; not nerf bat vs nerf bat.&amp;nbsp; Pvp isnt meant to be balanced, at least not in my eyes.&amp;nbsp; It is meant to be&amp;nbsp; a challenge to over come other classes skills and use your own the best you can and make do. It is not lets listen to bluebie #0001 randomy spew emails in about MBs hts and so forth.&amp;nbsp; Your class has those skills and use them to there fullest they should.&amp;nbsp; PVp is smarts and skill.&amp;nbsp; Use those two combos and theres no need for nerfbatting anyone.&amp;nbsp; Its like this saying life isnt fair lets "nerf" it.&amp;nbsp; YOu deal with life best you can, and look for ways to better yourself in it ( least i would hope!).&amp;nbsp; &#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The only thing i realy saw when reading this is about telling the guilds&amp;nbsp;" first guild to kill &amp;gt;name of mob&amp;lt; wins " sullon would be the only one with handycaps here cause we dont get every class at our grasps we dont have druids ( extra spot heals besides shammies) Pallies ( more heals plus no casting time full heal ) and rangers with there bow burn witch is massive amount of dps. Hate has made it to plane of time and beat it down as well killed a little of GOD with out these classes so they have accoplished alot and should get great credit for this cause all you other servers get to have every class at you hands for raids, but my point is activities such as who ever kills this first if it comes down to who does more dsp to raid mobs hate would loose even if we do have a lot of DT/LB bow burn from rangers would equal to more damage.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Now in a pvp guild vs guild hate has great chance of winning most of the time we have good comunication.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
