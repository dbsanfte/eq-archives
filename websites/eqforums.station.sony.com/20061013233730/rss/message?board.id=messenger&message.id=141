    <title>Community Summit and Fanfaire</title>
    <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=messenger&amp;message.id=141</link>
    <description>&lt;DIV&gt;As promised I gathered my notes from the Summit sessions, the panels, the breakfast and as many times as I could corner a producer, designer, community halfling, coder/programmer and the rest of SOE's team that didn't have the good sense to run at the sight of me and my notepad. &lt;A href="http://eq.crgaming.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=10470" target=_blank&gt;'Heres what I got for now...&lt;/A&gt; and in the next few days I will add more on different topics or we can discuss on the EQLive boards for more details or feel free to email me, especially if you have more pictures (I have around 450 but need to fix them up and start uploading them to our galleries).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Thanks again to SOE for their candor and willingness to discuss any and every issue brought forward.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
