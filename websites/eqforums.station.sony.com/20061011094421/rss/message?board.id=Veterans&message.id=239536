    <title>Cloak of the Spirit Tracker</title>
    <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Veterans&amp;message.id=239536</link>
    <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Since this question is coming up in a bunch of different threads, let me address this specific item here.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The Cloak of the Spirit Tracker was built after the initial implementation of evolving items and used a much lower amount of experience required to level it up than normal evolving items.&amp;nbsp; This was to make it level at a rate closer to what we originally envisioned for evolving items than at&amp;nbsp;the slow rate they were actually levelling at.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;In an effort to improve the overall time it takes to evolve all items, with this patch we significantly improved the amount of experience you gain toward an evolving item&amp;nbsp;when you get a kill.&amp;nbsp; This in turn&amp;nbsp;caused the Cloak to&amp;nbsp; level up way too fast.&amp;nbsp; To correct this, we had to increase the amount of experience the Cloak requires to level so it is more in line with other evolving items, which should now level up at a much more appropriate rate.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If you had a cloak before this patch, after the patch it still has the same amount of XP in it that it had before the patch.&amp;nbsp; No XP has been lost or removed from the item.&amp;nbsp; The cloak does, though, require more experience to level up now than it did before, so the experience you had in it is a lower percent of the total experience than before the change.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;This means the Cloak will display a lower percent toward the next level than it did before the patch even though the amount of experience it has is the same.&amp;nbsp; In addition,&amp;nbsp;if it was borderline between levels, it may&amp;nbsp;devolve a level since it no longer has enough experience to reach level 2 or 3.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>yup i'm whining :) I am after a girl.&amp;nbsp; The point i was trying to make was with 8 red mobs if it based on the mob should have given me more than 2%.&amp;nbsp; I know people that were soloing their cloaks in places like Inner Acrylia Cavers and GE and now in a group doing the last waves of arena missions with red and yellow mobs you don't get jack for experience.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>It's okay to voice your opinion Elvin. Rouan comes prepared with stakes.  The constructive criticism is tucked away in his back pocket.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I can't say I totally understand the leveling of the new cloaks but I do know it does take longer than I would have thought.  If I'm right it should be solely xp based so it doesn't matter what con mob you kill.  If it's based on the type of cons you kill then there is something wrong with that as most groups I do with my buddy, we don't go normally looking for reds and yellows.  I just think SoE took one too many swings with the nerf bat at this item though since it takes longer now than some intelligent items.  Can't complain too much though since other items are much easier to level up.  This just came to the front because of it's notariety.  If anything go ask them to do the right thing and start you off this way from the spot your cloak was at pre-patch.  Now that is something that was eloquently handled.</description>

&lt;P&gt;2% from 8 mobs seems to be extraordinarily well (unless they changed something again) - refer to the postings above.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I duoed 15 mobs in Noble's Causeway (RR/AM camp) and got .... 0%.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Remember, they changed the basis on how the items are awarded xps, not merely the number of xps needed.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Before, the most efficient route was to kill light blues, since they leveled based solely on number of kills, and there was a penalty for grouping.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Now they level best on reds, but the grouping penalty has been removed.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Thus 2% from 8 red cons in the arena while 0% from 15 (presumably dark blue?) mobs in NC is consistant with the new leveling methods.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Unfortunately, most modern groups are only taking down dk blues, so in practice, the cloaks are a lot slower than before the change.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Just curious,, Why is there no Dev responses to this matter exept for the initial one?&amp;nbsp; There may of been in another thread, but this seems to be the one everyone is talking about this issue on. Now the channeling&amp;nbsp;issue, I seen plenty of responses there, and&amp;nbsp;I know that was a major screw up too.&amp;nbsp; I have a bad feeling that this will just be swept under the rug as most other stuff is. And people wonder why I&amp;nbsp;have kept&amp;nbsp;my subscriptions on a month to month basis for five years!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I seen some post one what xp they are now getting, well took my son to veskar to get his bard to level 62. He needed a yellow and a half, I pulled constantaly till he go the level and got a whopping 2%. Not excactly sure how many kills that would take, but know it was quite a few. Everyone being DB. &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;I was at 95% into level 2. One more group would have done it. Now I am at negative 60 on level 2. This really needs to be looked at. Instead of a couple more hours to finish off, I am looking about 160+ hours.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;When the exp was nerfed in the monster missions, sony didn't go take 80% of your AAs away, don't understand why they would do this. I am turning my cloak off until something changes. I guess level 2 will have to do now. :smileysad:&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&amp;nbsp;In addition,&amp;nbsp;if it was borderline between levels, it may&amp;nbsp;devolve a level since it no longer has enough experience to reach level 2 or 3.&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Maybe someone (official from Sony) could explain this part.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Level 2/0% cloaks devolved to level 1/20%&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;If we assume that evolving is linear that means that level 3/0% cloaks would have devolved to level 1/40% (but most didn't because of the way the change was implemented ...)&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;In other words: Only those who had a cloak at level 3/800% would have kept their cloak at level 3... I don't think this would have been any reasonable number of players. So either the above statement is not valid or the "nerf" was accidently overdone and was not expected to work out as it did.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Would be happy to hear about it.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;THink that the reason level 3 cloaks did not devolve is that there is no record kept of xp earned after the item reached final level. While i have mine at level 3 and have had so for a long time now( although I doubt i would have hit that 800% mark you use) they cannot make any assessment of this. Yes I do feel for you who have had their cloaks dropped by over a level and feel this is unfair. Maybe if they had just reduced it to 0% at current level it would have been fairer although that would then penalise those close to leveling but not quite there................arrggghhhhh. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Beside this I cant see why some say this is an overpowered item. It has fearrune but no focus's, reasonable hp/mana/stats, ft and regen on it and some avoidance (cant remember the what else). Yes, its a very good item but is this really so earth shattering that it has to be nerfed immediately?? Dont think so somehow, think its a kneejerk reaction rather than anything else. Problem is they have created a huge amount of aminosity yet again.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&amp;nbsp;There is a complicating factor with this item. When PoR went live the orginal cloak was buged on leveling from lvl 2 to lvl 3 the cloak stats did not change. i.e. the lvl 3 version of this cloak had the same stats as the lvl 2 rather than the intended lvl 3 stats. This was fixed however the fix left those who had leveled the cloak to lvl 3 with a broken item, the cloak was lvl 3 couldnt be leveled and had the stats of a lvl 2 cloak a state identified by the relevant dev on test. So one of the npcs was given the function of changing the stuck version of the cloak to a non evolving version of the cloak with the lvl 3 stats. This means that even if those with the fully evolved lvl 3 cloaks had their cloaks devolved in the patch there would still be folks with a non evolving version unafected. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;Personaly I think the exp change for the cloak was excessive, it did level a little to fast but the magnitude of the experience increase was unjustified kinda like napalming a house to strip the paint of a wall.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;What I don't get is why SoE can't just say "Ok, we **HALFLING**ed up, we gotta slow down the xp on this cloak.", and just fix that.&amp;nbsp; Accept that the folks who currently have cloaks got lucky &amp;amp; leave them as they are, was there really a huge need to devolve existing cloaks &amp;amp; **HALFLING** everyone up like this.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Ok, if you left the cloaks alone it would make it a little unfair on the folks currently leveling them up,&amp;nbsp;but nobody's going to complain too much.&amp;nbsp; Mistakes get made and&amp;nbsp;it's far easier to accept that a few folks got lucky than to find half the folks got lucky and the other half suddenly got hugely penalised.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;They've just done exactly the same as they did with the merchants in PoK that time where folks could buy items at reduced prices.&amp;nbsp; Instead of just accepting they **HALFLING**ed up &amp;amp; removing the merchants quickly, they left them up far too long and then spent ages rolling back *anybody* even remotely connected to the merchants.&amp;nbsp; People lost items / xp with no idea why.&amp;nbsp; I never saw a good explanation for why they had to do that to everyone.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;With both cases, was it really that big a deal to leave people with the stuff they gained?&amp;nbsp; Sure, they got lucky &amp;amp; progressed further &amp;amp; quicker than the developers intended, but is that really a good reason to punish them like this?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Now it could be that they just adjusted the XP to the level it was meant to be, and nobody considered how badly this would appear to the players.&amp;nbsp; Then again, they stated that borderline cases would be devolved, so they knew there would be some kind of effect.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Question:&amp;nbsp; did they just **HALFLING** up again, and not realise just how much XP these cloaks were going to loose?&amp;nbsp; Did they not consider that level 3 items wouldn't be affected?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I have the feeling they did consider all this however.&amp;nbsp; It's only a guess, but from the way they act I feel these changes are being made because SoE have their plan fixed in their heads and aren't flexible to adjust the plans after they find a mistake.&amp;nbsp; I don't think they have anybody looking at these fixes from the players point of view.&amp;nbsp; All they see is that their grand plans got messed up and rather than accept that &amp;amp; look for the best solution given the situation now,&amp;nbsp;they desparately try to force things back to what they originally intended, usually antagonising the community along the way.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;If they just considered these things from the players point of view &amp;amp; tried to make sure the changes are fair on those who have been affected they'd be getting a lot less grief on the forums and players wouldn't have such a negative view of the company.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Hell, they could post the question on the forums first saying, "we **HALFLING**ed up, it needs correcting and the options are these.&amp;nbsp; Which would you prefer we do?".&amp;nbsp; Ok, it takes a little more planning but all of a sudden you're working with the community instead of fighting them off after every patch.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Just my 2c&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;As some one who was affected both by the roll backs and the recent cloak de leveling I will have to say that I was much more upset over the rollbacks then sony's most recent screw up.&amp;nbsp; I was relatively lucky with the roll backs in that the only thing that I actually lost was one PoP flag and one item that I picked up on that raid,neither made or broke my character.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;In the case of the rollbacks however I could see the need for them as items from an as yet unreleased expansion had made it to the live servers, really no way that you could expect SoE to let that fly, Did they go about taking care of it the right way? a resounding no, was some action necessary? yes&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Now to the current situation, I had obtained my cloak about&amp;nbsp; 4 days prior to the patch, I had it leveled to somewhere around 40% on level 2, most of this I got the same way I had leveled my blade of the ecplipse, soloing in GE, the rate of exp increase for both of these items was about the same, was 2 kills per % on the cloak and 2 or 3 per % on the blade, I had previously done some work on a twisted shank and found it to be about the same in GE.&amp;nbsp; The only reason that the cloak leveled so much faster in terms of reaching the final stage is that it has significantly fewer stanges then the other two, the rate of exp increase was about the same.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Enter the current situation, After my cloak deleveled I decided that I would go and try to recover the lost exp, as Veksar was the new hot zone and its dificulty was about on par with GE I decided to go there to exp, 8 kills later I got a % and decided to give it up in frustration, Later that night I was grouping in MPG for about an hour, didn't even make a percent and I know I killed more then 8 mobs, so my question is where is this mythical grouping bonus? while all the mobs were blue they were all obviously significantly higher level then the ones in veksar and yet my cloak did not advance at all? I realize that on some of the more difficult to evolve intelligent items that the situation has been grately improved, all well and good, I have an evolving bow that I am going to be attempting to level here shortly and am looking forward to it going faster, but again it doesn't particularily help the situation at the moment.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Was the cloak too easy to level? probably. Was there a need to slow it down? maybe, difficult to say as I don't see it leveling any where close to the old rate and on all the other non intelligent items I have worked with rate seemed about fine, was only the total amount that was annoying.&amp;nbsp; Should they have de leveled peoples cloaks in order to fit it into some concept on how fast the items should take to evolve and then not have it conform to that? No.&amp;nbsp; While I am not going to quit over this, have already invested far to much time and effort into my characters to do that, it does go on the pile of increasing disatisfaction with EQ as a whole.&amp;nbsp; Am still upset with them over not being to renew at the $99 rate because we changed banks but that is a different issue entierly.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Once again way to upset your player base, unfortunatly for me will just have to bend over and take it like everything else.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Oh on a side note if your cloak displays a negative % and is still level two it will de level with your next kill, thats what happened with mine at least, I suspect that if you turn exp to the item off you could maintain it at level 2 but with no hope of ever getting it to level 3.&amp;nbsp; And no this doesn't warrant a double exp weekend.. unless they decide to make that exp only apply towards evolving item exp ;)&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;It still amazes me how SoE only nerfed a portion of these cloaks (mine included, being about 20% away from level 3) but not all.&amp;nbsp; I fail to understand the thinking sometimes.&amp;nbsp; Do I agree that the cloaks should have been nerfed in some way?&amp;nbsp; Yes, I think that is a fair assumption.&amp;nbsp; The way in which it was done however is almost villainous and sadistic.&amp;nbsp; Does Innoruk himself head up the SoE development department?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Just another nerf in a long line of nerfs that will result in the loss of some clients I am sure.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Raspla on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;06-16-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;06:33 AM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I have to say I fully accept that they needed to change the Cloak and I know we did not loose any exp. However it is now painfully slow to level, Playing with the same group of 4 characters in Arcstone for several hours. In that time each of the 4 lvl 70 characters gained 6aa's each. The warrior was evolving&amp;nbsp; Skymaul, the Ceremonial Hammer (A supposedly "intelligent" item) two of the characters were evolving their cloaks. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;In the time it took to gain 6aa's the Warrior gained 7% exp in lvl 1 of the hammer, still very very slow but better than it was by far. The shock came when I checked on my cloak, I gained 6% exp in lvl 1 one of the cloak. That is slower than an intelligent item, that is 1% exp per aa gain in a group of 4. As a casual player at this rate the next expansion will be long past before I can dream of getting the cloak to lvl 3.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Previously I grouped in a group of 5 with someone leveling the Blade of the Eclipse. While I gained 1% on the cloak they got 5% on the sword. The exp gain on the cloak must be wrong it should be at least doule its current rate if not even triple. That would still be alot slower than it was but would at least be seen to have a realistic chance of leveling for the casual player.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;In addition,&amp;nbsp;if it was borderline between levels, it may&amp;nbsp;devolve a level since it no longer has enough experience to reach level 2 or 3.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;I know my cloak was little way&amp;nbsp;in to level 2 before the patch. After the patch is said it was -77% in level 2. As soon as I got my first kill toward evolving the cloak it de-level and said 22% in level 1. Seems to me you would need to be more than just borderline to not have it loose a level. Unless the exp need is vastly different between level s1 to 2 and 2 to 3 the cloak would need to be well over 50% in level perhaps even close to 80%&amp;nbsp; or 90% to not lose a level.IN essence unless you had finished leveling the cloak you got to almost start over.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;My initial&amp;nbsp;experiment tonight seems to&amp;nbsp;show I&amp;nbsp;get 1 AA&amp;nbsp;for every 1% on the cloak now. That is considerably slower.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Just two things:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;To level the cloak to max you have to "ding" it 2 times.&lt;BR&gt;To level the Blade of the Night Sky to max you have to "ding" it 6 times.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;So far both items gained XP on the same rate, i.e. to have the blade at max you needed 3 times longer (to ding 3 times as much).&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;With the change the XP gain on the cloak was reduced to 1/5th (mine went from level 2/0% to level 1/20%), so to evolve the cloak to max now actually takes a significantly longer time than to evolve a Blade of the Night Sky to max.&lt;BR&gt;To give a number: Seeing that so far 4ish mobs in GE gave 1% we are now talking about 20ish mobs / % or 4,000 mobs total to get the cloak to level 3 (you'll know where to find me the next&amp;nbsp;2 years. In comparison, the Blade of the Night Sky to full takes 2,400 mobs.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;To the devs: Please keep in mind that the number of complaints in this thread will be lower since cloaks at level 2 were devolved to level 1/20%, but most cloaks at level 3 stayed there, which eliminates a lot of complaints. Once again I'm angry on myself that I don't belong to the "early adaptors".&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Suggestion: Bring the evolving rate in line with the Blade of the Night Sky (i.e. increase the required XP by 3 not by 5).&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;It was an obvious mistake to devolve some cloaks while leaving others as they were, but since I don't believe that it will be rolled back, I just ask that you *please* do *not touch* the cloaks that you haven't devolved. While it's not fair, it's at least something good for a good number of players. And of course - I don't need more competition in GE when I go kill my 3,600 mobs.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</description>

In an effort to improve the overall time it takes to evolve all items,&#xD;
with this patch we significantly improved the amount of experience you&#xD;
gain toward an evolving item&amp;nbsp;when you get a kill.&amp;nbsp; This in&#xD;
turn&amp;nbsp;caused the Cloak to&amp;nbsp; level up way too fast.&amp;nbsp; To&#xD;
correct this, we had to increase the amount of experience the Cloak&#xD;
requires to level so it is more in line with other evolving items,&#xD;
which should now level up at a much more appropriate rate.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;This being the case, you grossly missed the&#xD;
mark.&amp;nbsp; Whereas I could get 1% evolution from a couple dark blue&#xD;
solo kills prior to the nerf, an entire group burning through a hive&#xD;
mission and killing reds and yellows netted me 5% evolution in about 90&#xD;
minutes.&amp;nbsp; My previous rate was 25% per hour, solo.&amp;nbsp; The&#xD;
adjustments made to this item have not only annoyed a good deal of&#xD;
customers; they have also overshot the &lt;i&gt;correction&lt;/i&gt; to the Cloak's rate of evolution which was meant to offset patch changes.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;Sony needs to learn that &lt;EM&gt;everyone&lt;/EM&gt; has an elimination cavity.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I say&amp;nbsp; set the experience on ALL of the evolved cloaks back to zero.&amp;nbsp; That way&amp;nbsp; we're all smurfed (except for the principled soul who wouldn't use it because it was too easy to get.&amp;nbsp; THAT made me smile!) and Sony gets its satisfaction from everyone who quested the cloak, including the ones that finished it when it was easy, arguably the exploiters here.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;As for the argument that finished cloaks would lose proportionately more xp,&amp;nbsp; I say boo hoo! /em tosses you a bottle of KentckY.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Whose ox is gored now?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;May I leave the developer with (insert personal attack here).&amp;nbsp; My only regret is that you've shown so little creativity dealing with this purported non-issue, that you'll be unable to justify the license I've granted you.&lt;/P&gt;</description>
