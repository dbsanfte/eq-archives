      <description>&lt;div&gt;There are melee disc for the under lvl  50 toons but as far as I know they are only sold in PoK. I don't think these were a &amp;quot;feature&amp;quot; of PoP so we shouldn't have to wait for them. They were a class balance issue and something to make melee more interesting.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Disciplines existed long before tomes; I'm not sure if it was from the very beginning, but it was close to it at least.   You used to just automatically aquire them when you hit the appropriate level.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The only ones for warriors at least that I can think of that were added at lower levels were the minor healing ones.  I don't think those are worth changing vendors for.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Melee tomes (most if not all) are available from vendors in the EC tunnel.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Well if they're in the EC tunnel then thats good news. I've only played 1 melee and I like the lvl 35 rogue disc. I wasn't aware they were in EC too. I think monks get a nice lull at 35 as well.</description>

Like not staring at the spell book to med. That was just a change to the game. It could be argued that this is an advantage to casters that was not in the orginal game either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I played a monk to 50 during Kunark we did just fine without these lulls so i'm not overly concerned but I think they should be included.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&amp;gt;Spoken like a true caster.  Why don't you think they should be in?  (and remember this is NOT a classic server)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;They were added to the game as part of the Kunark expansion, so it could be argued they shouldn't be available until then like other things based on the expansions they came in. It probably won't make much difference though.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Aren't there some spells like that too or are they all tied to expansions directly?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
