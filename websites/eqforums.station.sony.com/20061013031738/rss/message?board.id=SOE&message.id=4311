    <title>Everquest's fundamental growth problem</title>
    <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=SOE&amp;message.id=4311</link>
    <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I was having a conversation at work with another MMORPG player, a guy I had just met, and we were talking about various games we've played in the MMORPG universe. We talked about WoW, and how it was neat, but never really absorbed us. He talked about the game he played on a regular basis, FFXI. I tried it when it came out on US PC, didn't know much Japanese, and ended up quitting as a result. When he asked me what I played, I told him EverQuest, and he asked how the game was. Being a longtime fan of the game, (wouldn't still be playing if I wasn't ;) ) I found myself giving an answer that surprised me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I told him that while EverQuest was a pretty fun game for someone who's been playing it for a while, it's a pretty poor game to get started in these days.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We segue for a second. EverQuest II was supposed to be Sony's next hope- a next-generation game with which they could slowly ween the EverQuest playerbase from. (SOE said much to the contrary, and while I don't believe for a second that the plan with EQII was to eventually close EQ, it makes no sense to have two products from the same company compete against each other.) As is becoming apparent, that isn't happening, and Sony has responded with recent graphically intense expansions, having to keep the looks of a prior generation's game up to date with another.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The content of the past few expansions has dealt mostly with the 65-70 range, however, and this is where EverQuest's great growth problem lies. As we've all seen, EverQuest is extremely stratified. Almost all play takes place from 60-70; if you're below those levels, on most servers you can check the /lfg box all night and not see another person in your range looking.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All of this brings me to my point, and what I feel is EverQuest's problem #1- a new player &lt;i&gt;cannot&lt;/i&gt; play the game and eventually progress to that stratified tier of players.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If a new player has friends, they often powerlevel him through this phase. There is the option of forming lower level alts to play with your EverQuest newbie friend; but in practice, most people would rather have their friend level up to play with the characters they've gotten used to (EverQuest is very main-centric these days.) The new player also has the option of monster missions; however, I believe that to a new player, learning the game, 60 levels of monster missions is the most horrid thing you can do- especially when you leave MM's to fight in the real Norrath, and quickly find yourself playing a different game.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the traditional EverQuest mold of looking for strangers to team up with and kill the dragons, EverQuest no longer offers that pre-60. Which leads to the fundamental problem; how do you encourage growth in EverQuest, in the current stratified atmosphere?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first question I asked myself in response to this was &amp;quot;does Sony &lt;i&gt;want&lt;/i&gt; EverQuest to grow?&amp;quot; While a company is usually always hoping to grow their product, SOE faces the difficult position now of having two products compete with each other. Several EQ players have EQII subscriptions, but then again, several EQ players also have WoW subscriptions. However, I don't believe that at this point SOE hopes to shunt the EQ playerbase, via migration, over to EQII. The alternative here, and the one I believe Sony will stick to, is one of ugly coexistence. Thus I expect Sony continues to hope for the growth of both games.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That being said, what can realistically be done about this problem? Monster missions were a cure to the &lt;i&gt;absolute&lt;/i&gt; problem of not being able to level, but in the end they were more of a shot in the arm than a panacea.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are no easy solutions to this. One could go for another XP cutting mission in the lower levels, but in the end all that does is restrict a player's learning, while simultaneously bombarding them frequently with new abilities before they've gotten a grip on the old ones. Reducing the exp required to level only shrinks the 1-60 world, and makes the level appropriate content that much more useless, as it's being used for less time. Another option, which SOE will, eventually, pick up on, is to offer pre-loaded characters. The MMORPG gamer in me that levelled quite a few characters quite high despises this idea, and I'd like to see it held off for as long as economically feasible. This doesn't just shrink 1-60 content; it all but wipes it from the game.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The only option I see in which to develop an environment in which new player growth is fostered is a difficult one, radically shifting the attitudes of the playerbase- SOE must break the &amp;quot;culture of the main&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;People place a lot of attachment, and a lot of effort into their main characters. There is a virtually limitless ceiling (yes, some people have hit it, and I think you folks are sick and need some sunlight) on experience for characters, and as content grows stronger, you need more and more experience and abilities to be able to handle it. Raiding requires large amounts of experience to be placed into a character. There is a large, large incentive these days to stick to one character as &amp;quot;yours&amp;quot;, with a few other &amp;quot;alts&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sony must start developing content which encourages players to dust off old characters, or to start new ones. An environment must be created where a new player can log in, get through the tutorial- and then be able to reliably find a couple of people to partner up with. If players are continuously steered towards the next advancement mission, this won't occur.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The next expansion, as word has found its way out, will have content from 1-70. A great danger I see here is if this is a '35-70' expansion in the sense that GoD and OoW were. If most of the content is steered towards the high end, there's nothing new to entice people to explore any of the lower-level areas. They'll sit mostly dead except for powerlevelling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Old content needs to be reinvigorated alongside new lower level content, and &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; in the way that Nektulos was. If you have an array of content for lower-level players, supplement that by making small changes to the zones that old players grew up in. The Befallen revamp was a good example, but changes don't even have to be so immense. Have some unusually strong, unusually numerous wolves in WC from one patch to the next. Have a small camp of &amp;quot;boat sabateurs&amp;quot; near the docks in BB. If old content is more dynamic then it currently is- typically dead and static 11 months out of the year, then affected by some anniversary or holiday event the other- it'll be more attractive, and people might just opt out of that 700th black wing run to go explore that new content in Toxxullia Forest with their little beastlord. You don't have to make radical changes to the world; you just need to keep it &lt;i&gt;alive&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another question that needs to be explored is the high-end. Sony last tried this with PoP, releasing LoY and LDoN, two mid-range geared expansions after a long, high-level progressive one. In the end, a lot of guilds ended up killing Quarm week after week while waiting for something new- and not everyone necessarily wants to play an alt at all. Progression is also usually held in check by experience and gear, both of which consume large amounts of playtime. Content for these players has to be maintained, upgraded, and freshly designed, and all of this takes manhours.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I suggest slightly increasing the amount of players which reach the &amp;quot;end&amp;quot; of an expansion before the release of the next expansion. Have a Mata Muram style boss around- something to shoot for, but something that probably won't be dead until that next expansion &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; released. Having three guilds at the end of one expansion before the next is released, I think, is perhaps too quick. Let the people that &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; to beat the content as fast as possible end up with a month of farming the last boss, and devote what time you can save towards freshening up old zones. It doesn't take a large-scale, heavily planned effort; just a few visible ones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In order to continue the growth of EverQuest, SOE need to put more effort into making Norrath a relivable world. Players have to have a reason to explore that old content, and to be that community a new player can join, beyond the transient urge to try out another character. With a solid effort at giving new players the game every role-playing MMORPG promises- a dynamic world in which you can meet friends and explore the world- EverQuest can pull out of the holding pattern it is in and introduce a whole new breed of players to Norrath.&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;EQs gradually declining numbers are really easy to explain.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;#1 - The world is simply too big.&lt;BR&gt;When many of us began, there were just Odus, Antonica and Faydwer.&amp;nbsp; If you were level 1-10ish you were already where you should be when you started.&amp;nbsp; After that you started having a few choices, but the choices were limited enough that you could be assured there were others of your level range there hunting to group with.&lt;BR&gt;Unfortunately, while new content can be fun and interesting, having new zones added every few months introduces a serious group problem, primarily for lower level characters.&amp;nbsp; As there were more and more places to be, there were fewer and fewer at any given one of them.&amp;nbsp; Finding a group became such a problem they added the LFG tools (which new players don't know how to use even after the tutorial) and even with PoK books finding these zones is difficult for anyone who wasn't around before PoP.&amp;nbsp; And any actual "New" player's characters are likely to be seriously undergeared relative to the Alts they're grouping with.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;#2 - SoE loves raiders.&lt;BR&gt;I don't have a problem with raiding, I have been through the gamut of it.&amp;nbsp; From pre-Kunark pickups on fear and hate, to small guild raids on kael during velius, to medium and eventually high end raiding in anguish.&lt;BR&gt;Unfortunately, each successive expansion (with some exception) has been targetted primarily on the higher end/raid guild content.&lt;BR&gt;LDoN was a wonderful concept, but the exp nerf destroyed it.&lt;BR&gt;DoN missions were a nice try, but since nobody wants to group with anyone under 70, and expects raid-obtained gear and tons of AAS.. well high end wins again.&lt;BR&gt;DoDH introducing MMs was a miracle, but because people were using them to PL alts SoE decided to throw all of the time and resources they invested in that concept down the toilet instead of simply restricting MMs to giving AA exp and not Level exp.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;#3 - SoE likes locks.&lt;BR&gt;This is probably the single largest contributing factor to players quitting after 50.&lt;BR&gt;Imagine if you made a character today....&lt;BR&gt;Do you honestly believe that even with the help of your better friends in the game, that this new character will ever finish PoP, DoN and DoDH progressions?&amp;nbsp; Will they ever even see KT?&lt;BR&gt;How many years have you played to accumulate those friends who might help you?&lt;BR&gt;New players start discovering these barriers in their 50s and quickly learn that their chances of getting keyed or flagged for most of them are long since past, as the numbers required to accomplish the keyings are already past them and on to new content.&lt;BR&gt;Being told that you "have no chance to" anything is bad.&amp;nbsp; While it is not entirely factual, it is, for most practical purposes, true.&amp;nbsp; Guilds don't go around collecting up new players and helping them get their PoP flags or to kill DoN dragons.&amp;nbsp; They have already done that and are off to do something else.&lt;BR&gt;I suspect that within a year's time, even finding a group to work on signets for Anguish will be a thing of the past.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;SoE needs to seriously re-evaluate the direction they're taking EQ if they wish it to last.&amp;nbsp; The high-end players will be harder and harder to please as time goes on, and the gap seperating them from everyone else continues to grow.&amp;nbsp; As they leave, they are not being replaced, because the power to accomplish the needed steps to BE one of them is becomming more and more difficult to obtain (read: numbers of willing players).&lt;BR&gt;As they continue to design more and more based on a diminishing portion of the player base, they continue to alienate the potential next generations, and further shorten the life of the game.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Monster Missions were the single best solution to a lot of the problems.&amp;nbsp; But thanks to a rush to fix an oversight, they have pushed them out of popularity to the point that finding a group for any but the newest (dains) is next to impossible.&lt;BR&gt;-They nerfed the exp on most of them to reduce the exp farmability factor.. okay that makes sense.&lt;BR&gt;-They increased the difficulty on most of them to reduce the exp farmability facotr ... Ummm.. wasn't that why the exp was reduced?&lt;BR&gt;-They make the 45 minute lockout global to Eliminate the farmability factor...&amp;nbsp;:smileywink: . Can we have the old exp and difficilties back now?&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I agree.&amp;nbsp; Marketting needs to step up and really push this game for new players.&amp;nbsp; I haven't seen an advertisement for EverQuest in a few years.&amp;nbsp; Well, except for one.&amp;nbsp; I finally recently saw an EQ advert on an Xfire banner.&amp;nbsp; But besides that...&amp;nbsp; Needs television commercials, shelf-space in gaming stores (even if it's the package deals only, they're harder and harder to find), more mag articles/advertisements.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;In my opinion, they need to Market the new TSS expansion as the "New Everquest"&amp;nbsp; with the original EQ, with pok, bazaar, and guild lobby and guild hall included.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;This would in turn attract all new players to the game who would be willing to play the low end of the game.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Being that there is a new race involved an starting city these new players will interact with older players who are playing in the new starting city.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Over time, friendships will develop and these poeple will join guilds.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I think this is entirely possible since TSS will be the new expansion with all new content for levels 1-75, and all the older players will be flooding into the expansion to check it out.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;*and to really get this off the ground, TSS has to include the original EQ with it, and have a good marketing compaign behind it.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I beleive that TSS can be the savior of EQ if it will bring in new blood. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;However, this drive to have it DD only will NOT attract new players, well very few anyway. There appears to be an almost total lack of interest in marketing EQ. The was another comment a couple of weeks ago (I forget which thread) saying it wouold be advertised in some obscure magazine only available in the US. So, with little to no coverage in advertising, no chance of seeing the game appear in any gaming shop, until after xmas according to the boards and even then probably only in the US I just cannot comprehend how any right minded marketing person can consider that any strategy is in place to attract this new blood.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;It is only this new blood that will help EQ grow. The old and bold members on here will continue to dwindle, server mergers will probably happen again and eventually the gamer will die. I do not want this to happen but why should the onus on providing customers for a commercail profit making company have to rely on word of mouth from its existing customer base. Are they going to pay me, or credit me subscription time, for every new player I bring to the game?? DONT think so !!!&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Interesting read.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I have a few suggestions:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;1: Revamp all old world zones and starting cities. Introduce a new quest/dialog system to the game that is a bit more current. Introduce new quests for 1-50, and go back and adjust the old quest and rewards. Make the tutorial just that...a tutorial. Put a quest requirement or level restriction on the PoK books. Move the PoK newbie quests out and place the questing back in the starting cities. Revamp the water zones and get a new and improved immersive boat system going again...and have plenty of low end questing out there to inspire low level travel. Place in "Mages Guild Teleport Systems" in each mages guild in each of the 'starting' cities. Have it usable for a fee. Actually show the player 'levitating' over the land with neat sparklies...going through zonelines...till them get to the city mages guild they are going to, then 'beam' them down into it. Just like a griffon ride, but without the griffon basically. =) Would be amazing. You could even make it to where the player has to have already visited the place before they can be 'sent'.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;2: Revamp all old world dungeons, restructure the loot and spawns. Make quests in ALL the starting cities for dungeons in different level ranges...and include instructions on how to get to them...for new players. The quests would bring people together. Look into instancing for dungeons. People like that....it 'feels' better and more immersive.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;3: Tweak the entire downtime system. From death to regeneration rates. Put in different ways players can be 'buffed'...instead of it being potions ( which are expensive for a new player ) and player buffs ( encourages two boxing and 'donation' buffing ) put in things like EQ2 food and water idea, campsites ( player puts up a camp that has a timer on it ...while in the camp sitting down mana and hp come back at a much higher rate ...say each camp lasts 30 minutes..regen turns off if in combat ).&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;4: Treasure chests. Have them spawn around the world in monster camps and so on. Have a 'chance' to drop something magical.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;5: Institute "Age". Characters have "Age". Once a player has reached the top level they start growing 'old'. Once they reach an elderly state they have to retire from adventuring. All stats are drastcally reduced. If a player decided to 'retire' they are allowed to turn their PC into an NPC. The PC/NPC is then placed in a "hold" and gets put into the game by&amp;nbsp;a GM or DEV. This is the 'reward' for reaching that...they become a part of the lore and world. The PC/NPC is now unplayable by the account, but now the player can choose to make a new character. This character can have special 'advantages' depending on what class the retiring character was, and the new character gets one item from the retiring character as an inheritance, which will have lore on it that the player labeled. In this way an item could conceivably be passed down many many generations. Perhaps an item like this could actually gain in power during each passing...perhaps even gaining a voice of it's own.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;6: Place durability on items. And institute the 'binding' thing. This would help ensure the market for new players was reasonable.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Things like this would really draw in people. You could call it "Everquest: A Dynasty Reborn" .&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>You know Brite, you described EQII almost exactly with all that. :P&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In any case, the regen and death systems are getting tweeked. And old zones are being revamped all the time; it's just too big of a task to do all at once.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;1) EQ needs an huge influx of new players to build up the population.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;2) If EQ magically did get a huge influx of players, they would be able to group and advance with peers without the LFG problems.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;3) If these new players enjoyed the game at the start, many would get hooked and become "lifelong" players.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;4) Old zones contained some of the best content for new players.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;5) Old zones are abysmally underutilized.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;6) 30-Day free trials don't even begin to "hook" a player on a world as huge and complicated as Everquest.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Solution: Give away the original Everquest, absolutely free, with no monthly subscription charges.&amp;nbsp; Instead of some lame 30-day trial.&amp;nbsp; Give away the original game.&amp;nbsp; Free. Forever.&amp;nbsp; No strings attached.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Listen.....all of us long time players got hooked on THAT Everquest.&amp;nbsp; We are evidence that that game alone can hook hundreds of thousands of customers.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Imagine it.&amp;nbsp; Give that away and the worlds will be FLOODED with new players.&amp;nbsp; Sure, not all will ever buy a subscription. But many will. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;And if they are noob players with no committment to the game, who cares.&amp;nbsp; They won't be interfering with the serious gamers who never play in Greater Faydark or East Commons, anyway.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Give a free EQ CD in every copy of PC Gamer Magazine.&amp;nbsp; Have free coupons online to get a CD mailed out.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;What is the worst thing that could happen ?&amp;nbsp; You get a million players playing EQ for free ?&amp;nbsp; That's a pretty danm good problem to have.&amp;nbsp; Imagine that, after several months, only 5% of them get "hooked" and want to advance.&amp;nbsp; 1/20 go out and buy the next expansions and sign up for an account.&amp;nbsp; Suddenly there's 50,000 extra paying customers.&amp;nbsp; Thats over &lt;U&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;TEN MILLION DOLLARS&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/U&gt; in sales revenue!&amp;nbsp; (And I think that is an extremely conservative estimate).&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Its important these players play on REAL servers so they can advance their characters, play with their friends (who can come to their "junior" expansion zone) and so they can see tells and chat and players experiencing bigger better things.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;I half to agree with you on having a free server for people to join.&amp;nbsp; I believe a free classic server for people to join and level up on would be a great idea.&amp;nbsp; Where when you hit level 50 you can get a choice.&amp;nbsp; With like 50 or 75 bucks they'll transfer you character to a different server and unlock the rest of the expansions if you choose to join.&amp;nbsp; Not a lot of people would stay on the server after 50 any ways.&amp;nbsp; The gear drops from boss mobs would get old very quickly with only the 3 expansions.&amp;nbsp; You cn only raid the same mobs so many times before extreme boredom sets in.

      <description>I have a feeling Sony is now hoping Vanguard will be the REAL EQ2.&amp;nbsp; Many players will likely accept it as such.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I disagree with your argument that SOE planned on weening the EQ playerbase onto EQ2.  EQ2 was desgned with a much different group of people in mind; the people that left EQ over time because of various reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, as for bringing new people into the game.  Well, that was one of the main topics at the last summit.  Growing the game is something keenly on the minds of hte developers.  To address the point, the next expansion will be a full level expansion; meaning that you can level from 1 to 70+ in the expansion.  It will include a new starting city, that seems like it will serve as a hub if you will, for all new players coming into the game (which will make it easier for them to find groups.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can read all about it here: &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.mobhunter.com/001474.html"&gt;http://www.mobhunter.com/001474.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, we'll get more info on it from E3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>There are a lot of reasons Everquest has a shrinking userbase.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&amp;nbsp;(1) Bugs. Way too many bugs. SoE pushes out content too fast to do a good job of debugging it first.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&amp;nbsp;(2) This might seem strange, but TOO MUCH content. Even high end&#xD;
raid guilds complain that expansions come out too often - and MOST&#xD;
players will take years to see all the content in any given new&#xD;
expansion, if they ever get the chance to see it at all. ONE expansion&#xD;
a year would be a lot better, and would help address point 1.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&amp;nbsp;(3) TOO much graphics. When I zone into an empty New Freeport and&#xD;
get more lag than I ever saw in the Bazaar, there is something WRONG&#xD;
with the graphics content level. This is one of the things that killed&#xD;
EQ2 - pretty graphics at the EXPENCE of good gameplay.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&amp;nbsp;(4) Did I mention bugs?&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&amp;nbsp;(5) Pathetic customer support. When *I* knew more about the game&#xD;
3 months in than a so-called "Game MASTER" knows, there's something&#xD;
wrong with that Game Master - either in training or experience. IMO SoE&#xD;
should be recruiting their Game Masters and a lot of their other&#xD;
customer support from their existing Guides, they might get folks that&#xD;
have a clue that way.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&amp;nbsp;(6) Quests that are worthless or have a reward that is NOT in&#xD;
balance with the benefit. The way things are right now, World of&#xD;
Warcraft has a far better claim to the name "EverQUEST" than EQ does -&#xD;
quests in WoW tend to be balanced on the difficulty to reward a LOT&#xD;
better than EQ quests are.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&amp;nbsp;(7) Creaping featuritis. I hated what I saw of the EQ2 interface&#xD;
when it was in EQ - WHY is SoE trying to inflict that overfancy hunk of&#xD;
junk on EQ of late? The "Old Default" interface is a LOT better&#xD;
interface than that EQ2 piece of junk.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&amp;nbsp;SoE seems disenclined to learn from it's competition - they have&#xD;
constantly blown off suggestions that they at least TRY to match the&#xD;
factors from other games that make those games ENJOYABLE. They seem to&#xD;
have gotten the impression that "pretty graphics make the game better",&#xD;
and have NOT learned from the EQ2 fiasco that "overfancy graphics make&#xD;
the game a PITA and the player experiance WORSE".&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&amp;nbsp;I also get the impression that SoE never really had a good handle on why EQ became popular in the first place.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I have to agree with quint 100 percent in his observations. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;That being said i also think there are more problems in the game and the way it is handled. There are no longer guides or game masters who intervene when players train or camp steal or use macros. Despite many many petitions I still see charaters doing the same things over and over again.&amp;nbsp; Also the rediculous prices of everything from soul shards for summoning corpses to items sold in bazaar. Way way too expensive. And the constant changes int he game just make things worse. The new Nek forest and new freeport are soo ugly!!! Why mess with a good city? They keep making changes that ruin the game. I can see why so many have left the game. Everquest is NOT the game I started playing years ago. That game no longer exisits. Its hard to find a group now and some classes can make plat off casting buffs, while others have to farm the old fashioned way. I cannot believe the game designers are allowing this? I guess they are not paying attention at all. Or they do not care. There are still alot of bugs in the game and the quests still are stupid and way too tedious. And all the progression is kinda boring. I think the game started going down hill once Shadows of Luclin was released and has been going down hill ever since. Omens of War was a decent expansion but the insane faction hunts for quest armor is rediculous. Depths of Dark Hollow and PoR expansions are a big disapointment. Adding nice items to the game doesn't make up for those stupid progression tasks or the bad graphics. The graphics are soo awful! Eq 2 was awful as well! Not sure who is designing these games but they do not appear to be consulting the players at all. So many are leaving the game. Oh well i will play eq for a while until something better comes along or I get fed up with eq and leave like alot of peeps have.&lt;/P&gt;</description>
