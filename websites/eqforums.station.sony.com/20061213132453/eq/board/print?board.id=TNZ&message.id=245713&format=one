If you're level 70 looking to solo the golems in order for a slim chance to loot the Amulet of Necropotence, please take note that it has been moved to another monster in the game." <br><br>Then make all the quest items no-drop, so they won't sell them in the bazaar.<br><br>Then maybe some of us will be able to finish our epics finally.<br><br>You do realize that some guilds are requiring this item, and keep careful track of the golems?<br><br>All I would like is a simple, logical answer. If you have no intention, please explain the logic behind it, so I can finally put this frustration out of my mind.<br><br>Thanks.<br><div></div><br><hr></blockquote>And this has what in common with the podcast?....
