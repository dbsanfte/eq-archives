				<DIV>As I am far from anything close to uber armor, I bazaar-purchased a Metalofiber Vest yesterday, and equipped it with a slot -11 Master's Symbol of the Skeptic. (No I could not afford the Grandmaster one)&nbsp;I am a level 66 Enchanter.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I have a number of questions regarding this armor:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>- The stats on the Symbol give me "Damage Shield +1". What does that mean for a Gnome Enchanter? I haven't fought anything since the purchase, but does that mean it hurts any mob that hits me with a whopping 1 damage, or does it mean that the damage output from when a damage shield is casted on me is now greater?</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>- The vest has number 7, 11 and 12 augment slots. The 11 is now taken by the Symbol. The 7 is easily fillable (thinking of putting a&nbsp;DoN bought augment in it with a focus effect when I have saved up the crystals)&nbsp;However, I have looked in the Bazaar for slot 12 augments, and they are mostly the ones dropped in OOW and then cut by a Jeweler. The thing is though that only the 100k costing&nbsp;Titanite (spelling) which has 40% haste on it actually fits in the CHEST slot, and none of the others do. I can of course equip it with the next LDoN augment that comes along (which fit in ALL slots), and I think I may actually still have one in the bank somewhere..... but I was wondering if there are any slot 12 augments I should be hunting for.... the augments sold from the DoN merchants all seem to be slot 4, 7, 8, and 9</DIV>
