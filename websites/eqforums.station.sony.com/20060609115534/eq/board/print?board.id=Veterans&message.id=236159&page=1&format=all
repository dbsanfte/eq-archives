</BLOCKQUOTE><BR><BR><BR>Tis tough for it to die when the evidence says otherwise, that there that might be least a bug that does exist for instanced zones and multiple of mobs in camp. Examples would be the Highpass MM. Even when the last person in is the last to close with the mobs and engage, the untargetted mobs swarm to that person. The same with some of the MPG group trials, particularly the The Mastery of Efficiency trial. One could discount the MPG trials since they have long lockup timers upon a win, but with the MMs and their short lockout timers, it is quite noticeable. It will be even more difficult to sway others away from it, particularly those who spent alot of time in MMs such as Highpass MM on double exp weekends.<BR>

<P><BR>Heh, I know the feeling. I've tried to explain to people in various channels that monster missions were not nerfed on numerous occasions. But I guess if there's no guarantee of an instant group, some loot and an AA in 20 minutes it's no good.</P>
<P>Of, course, I'm making generalizations. Not all players are like that. The other day a friend and I managed to get a group to try Fall of the Combine with us, a mosnter mission we'd never tried before and knew nothing about. Of course, for each person willing to try there were 5 more were uninterested because they "don't do MMs" or lost interest when I failed to link awesome loot and promise an easy AA in under 45 minutes, but that's a rant for another time.</P>

My first thoughts were 5 variables for each character (flags if you will) (and I am a computer geek too), each time you do a mission if would put the mission in newest variable. The variable would be from last to oldest run mission. Each time you get crystals from a mission it would move the variables down (rotating the older missions down or out) so that it would keep track of the last 5 missions done and in what order.<br><br>Each time you got crystals it would check the varaibles and for each instance of that mission reduce the crystals by 10%.<br><br>As I thought about this, some concerns came to mind. One was time between missions and the other, is that the code idea above was bulky.<br><br>Then I remembered tasktimers. Which could be modified to add "Mission Name: 10% (24 hours)" each time crystals were given or added 10% and 24 hours to a timer already there. Right before crystals were given it would check the timers and modify the reward. This could probably work for anytime loot is generated.<br><br>Anyway, just my brain working when I am actually trying to fall asleep.
