    <description>Gear you should work on:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;AC/HP gear.  At your level it is possible to get enough AC and HP to make a HUGE survivability difference.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cha gear.  Cha effects the resist rate of your spells.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Int gear.  Try to hit "200 int".  Int above 200 isn't really worth bothering with.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The "Blue Ceramic Band".  It is a pottery recipie.  If you are keen, look up the ingredients, buy them (they are all vendor-sold), and hire a potter to combine them for you.  (when asking for the potter, make sure you have all the ingredients and mention the item (Blue Ceramic Band) and that you have all of the ingredients ready).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You can test to see if you have all of the ingredients (without bothering a potter) by attempting a combine by yourself.  It will destroy the ingredients if you have the correct ones, but will ensure that you know that the right recipie.  =-)  And being polite to people you are asking for help is important!</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Had someone tell me that I had to do at least 5 hp's of damage to a mob if I'm using a charmed pet or if the charmed pet does all the damage I'll get greatly reduced exp.&amp;nbsp; Person suggested I get a clickie band or ring that could do this minimal damage mana free.&amp;nbsp; I'm only level 28 and have crappy gear and am wondering what kind of gear to look for.&amp;nbsp; Should I be seeking charisma maximizing stuff?&amp;nbsp; I've played pet class(necro) and have played a wizzie a little so don't really want to nuke and would rather try charming.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>I think there's a post somewhere on those forums that explains how much exp you get charming depending on how much damage you doing. Basically the more damage you do, the better the exp. &lt;br&gt;Easier on the exp side when you do reverse charming (you drop your pet hps, get rid of charm, park the former pet/or kill former pet, you take another pet etc) i think.</description>

      <description>Reverse charming is, frankly, too much work for pre-charm-nerf content.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The clicky ring you're looking for is a Blue Ceramic Band. It's cheap, and clickable at level 20.  If you can't find on in the bazaar, any decent potter should be able to whip one up for you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Getting charisma up will definitely help with charms, as will tashing first, and charming things that are not very magic resistant, and lower level than you.  It will still be somewhat unreliable for long durations at your level however, so I suggest killing in pairs (Letting a mob beat your pet down to near 0, letting your pet doing likewise to the mob, then killing both.)</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;That's how I learned to charm, in HoH where nothing summons and everything is easily debuffed. Good spot for exp too.</description>
