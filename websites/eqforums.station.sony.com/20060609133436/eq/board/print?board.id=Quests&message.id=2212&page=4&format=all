				<DIV>Man, this is just cruel.&nbsp;&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The task, Find Fribblebrap 4: The Korlach, &nbsp;is ejecting my group at 3 hours left of the original 6, and again at 1 hour left.&nbsp;&nbsp; It uncompletes any objectives you did while inside.&nbsp; The very vague goal of "find the alchemist' is just a slaughter x number of mobs.&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The time we found that out, we cleared from ZI to the far campfire room and back.. only to&nbsp;hit the 3 hour mark&nbsp;and a zone full of respawns between us and named, so it boots us and recreates the instance.&nbsp; bam, have to kill x number of mobs again, but only got 2 hours till next respawn of the zone.&nbsp; The next time after, we moved straight to the campfire room and killed.. killing respawns weren't enough to fill the quota for popping named, boom, ejected.&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Not to mention.. when you go to the cocoon, there 2 spiders guarding the door near bridge.. 3 inside the first room, 3 inside upstairs, and 3 in the way back room.&nbsp; If respawns happen in the first room before you open the cocoon, the 4 mobs that get triggered to agro your party as you watch the NPC run off will turn out to be 8 mobs.. 2 pairs of spawns in the exact same spot.&nbsp; We even saw triples once.&nbsp;&nbsp; Our only way to get out of that mess was to have the warrior stand in the middle and cyclone when they all were triggered to agro us... then do laps around the lake as NPC reached his objective, zone.&nbsp; </DIV>

<DIV>I've run into a problem with the "Basic Training" task from the tutorial.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I've had a low-level rogue for a long time before the new tutorial was made (his original purpose was to run around Kaladim harvesting mushrooms so my main could use them for making Kaladim Constitutionals). Though I never really played him aside from that, I'd occasionally pass a few items down that my other characters had either outgrown or couldn't use. As a result, at some point, his starting Dagger* got deleted to make way for better items.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I recently moved him into the tutorial to run him through some of the tasks when I was bored, but could never finish the Basic Training task...more specifically, the step where you give your weapon to Absor to have it upgraded. I obviously cannot do that because I no longer have the weapon he accepts, and cannot buy it anywhere since I believe it is NODROP.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>So my question is: is there any way those few of us who have lost or otherwise discarded that weapon can get another one, either through a hail, perhaps a kill, perhaps an equivalent tradeable item can be added, etc. Alternatively, perhaps we could just skip this step by telling him we [do not need an upgrade] or something.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I know it's probably not a big deal, and the task works fine for other alts I've created afterwards and kept their starting weapons. But it's going to drive me crazy to not be able to finish it. <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0> Thanks.</DIV>

				<DIV>I am a human magician. This is to let you know that Barrenzin's 4th task directs me to <STRONG>East</STRONG> Commonlands to kill Dervish Cutthroats, and more. I spent several hours looking for DCs in East Commonlands, to no avail. I eventually crossed over to West Commonlands and, lo and behold, was able to find the DC's and carry out all the 4th-task requirements there ---- in <STRONG>West</STRONG> Commonlands. Obviously, I was misdirected. The task took place in West Commonlands, not East Commonlands.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Having completed the 4th task and reaped its rewards, I expected&nbsp;Barrenzin to give me a 5th task. Instead he gave the 4th task once again, which I completed a second time (no rewards, of course). So I went back to Barrenzin and, to my surprise, he gave me&nbsp;his 6th and 7th tasks ---- but no&nbsp;5th task. I completed both the 6th and 7th tasks and Barrenzin now says he has no more tasks for 'someone of my abilities'. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>So where do I go next to get more tasks?</DIV>

<DIV>Barrenzin does offer a 5th Trial - however it is a Group Trial (need at least 2 members - not sure if it is minimum level driven or average level driven, but I believe the minimum level is 15) - Use the Keyword "Group" and you should be able to get the task (assuming you have the approprate group). Note: you will have the same issues with the 8th and 9th trial - those are group tasks as well.</FONT></DIV>

<P>Task: Elusive wisps (newbie armor task from Castlen Drewe) on Xegony server</P>
<P>My troll SK has a very hard time completing this task since the two steps to investigate the Lavastorm zoneline and the wizard platform do not update. I have walked from the PoK book to Lavastorm and back several times and sat on the wizard platform meditating for a while. Is there any particular place you have to stand to update these steps?</P>

<P>Got this task on my level 23 gnome wizard.&nbsp; The first step in the task is, "Explore the small inn to the south" in South Ro.&nbsp; I just combed the south half of South Ro and I could not find a small inn, only the Wayfarer camp, a couple of sets of ruins, and assorted orc camps.&nbsp; Perhaps the small inn was removed when South Ro was revamped, if so, the task should be fixed accordingly.</P><BR>

<P><BR>I just checked on this one and believe I found the issue.&nbsp; It appears when the zone was changed over one of the coordinates needed for this step had a typo.&nbsp; I've fixed it now and it should be working correctly again after the next update.</P>
<P>The inn is in what is now South Ro, but used to be in Oasis.&nbsp; Check the inn just south of spectre isle with Innkeep Tizzy and it should update for you.&nbsp; I'll alter the text for that step to help clear up the confusion.&nbsp; Let me know if you have any further trouble with the task after the next update.</P>

<P><BR>This appears to be fixed on Test at the moment.&nbsp; It should be corrected on the live servers after the next update.&nbsp; </P>
