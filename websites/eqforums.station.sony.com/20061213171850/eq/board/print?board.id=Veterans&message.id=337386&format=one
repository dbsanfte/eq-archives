<P>No worries, I still hate players just as much as before (the pain runs deep I tell ya). </P>
<P>In an ideal world (or in this case, game world), there would be a ton of different pieces of geomotry, and a ton of different textures to go with that geo, for each armor class type. So you'd see 3-4 versions of plate looking armor geo-wise, for example, and 6-8 versions of textures to go along with it, giving you a good 18-24 different combinations of armor. Not to mention having particle point attachments to armor, which would give even more possibilities (a particle like a black cloud that swirls from your arms/shoulder slot all the way down to your hands, for example). Now, this armor would be armor-class specific, not race specific as it is now in EQ (think Ogre plate chestpiece versus High Elf plate chest piece and how different they look). What this means is, each race would look extremely similar in the same armor set.</P>
<P>Now, with that many combinations, a few exclusive textures can be made that would be "epic armor". A paladin's epic armor, for example, would be all white, glowing, and regal in look (personally, I'd say it should be purple and pink with hearts and ponies on it, but I'm betting the artists and players&nbsp;would attack me). And then we can do really unique looking armor for each class that would stand out and give you that same type of feeling that the old Planar armor gave. Remember that feeling where you could spot out that cleric in their Ethereal Mist armor from a mile away and know they put a lot of time in their armor? That was cool and would be nice to have again.</P>
<P>Now will this happen in EQ? Probably. Will it happen very soon? Probably not. We need new character models that load their armor as attachments instead of skins on the model the way the current ones work. The Drakkin model was our first real 'test' into finding out how much programming and art resources were required to make the model, and now we have a better understanding of what it takes, so expect a revamped race(s) in the next couple of expansions. I personally am excited just for the simple fact that we will have the ability to make cool and unique armor once the models are done.</P>
<P>Anyway, epic armor would be cool, but that's more of a personal dream of mine than something that will happen anytime soon.</P>
