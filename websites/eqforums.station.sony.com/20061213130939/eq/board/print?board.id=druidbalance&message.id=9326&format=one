				Since barkspur is capped at 8 hits, and can't be increased at all through aa/focuses, why limit the duration to 18s.<br>Barkspur although is &quot;unresistable&quot; damage, its is not that effecient compared to our 40 nukes with basic focuses, so its a situational spell. Barkspur is also suspectible to other factors, like oor, running mobs, change in targets etc etc. Whats the harm in upping it to 15minutes to ensure full damage occurs. Leave the recast at 12s and the functionality remains the same.<br><br>Would like to see the community thoughts on it, as well if possible to add to our top 10, brought up to the dev's in fan fair etc etc.
