    <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I am pretty sure that the evnts that unfold in time occur before any player steps foot into the planes of knowledge. I also think the wekeaned stats of placing zebux in the stasis is what allows us into their realms. so at the point when you return to maelin evrything that happened before you entered the plane of time is still in placeAll the events that transpire before you enter time occur after zebux has been placed in stasisso the question is are the dieteies still in a weakened state. and could this weakened state have been what&amp;nbsp;attracted the muramites to norrath.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Loreseeker Maelin fidgets about with excitement, 'So here you are, this is quite impressive. I cannot wait to see the results of this impressive machine! I have coordinated with the clockworks here that have not gone mad. We have set the machine to tear a point of time open that should be equal to that based on the cipher and history that we have [researched].' &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Loreseeker Maelin says 'Based on the findings from the information that you brought back to me I have determined the exact time to open. I believe the machine will work. Please step up and activate the machine! Once you have formed a bond with the Plane of Time you will be able to access the Plane again through the Plane of Tranquility. They have built a portal there, but no one was able to become attuned to that plane, until you that is. Good luck!' &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The ages begin to tear through your body. You wake to find yourself in another time. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;You have entered The Plane of Time. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Solusek Ro says, 'This is absurd, why are we wasting our time and energy on this!? Direct action is needed, now! Banishing Zebuxoruk will not stop the mortals from entering into our planes. Their greed for power will have them soon trampling through our realms!' &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Rallos Zek says, 'On this I agree! We must take action and the time is now. I will not have these mortals achieving the powers that we hold.' &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Fennin Ro says, 'Calm yourselves, you need to appreciate the situation that is at hand.' &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Xegony says, 'Please listen to reason, we are doing what we must. The mortals possess a direct tie to Zebuxoruk. If his stasis is finished their link will dwindle as well as their powers and knowledge.' &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Rathe says, 'The knowledge that was given to them by Zebuxoruk will fade from their minds. We must do this now, for if they were able to translate the divine language all existence would unravel. The balance of power in the universe would be destroyed.' &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Solusek Ro says, 'This is exactly the point that I am making! So you agree we must show them now that we are the power above them, and not to be questioned!' &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Rallos Zek says, 'You must see what he refers to; we must turn to Norrath and show them our power. What they are trying to accomplish cannot be allowed to come to pass.' &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Fennin Ro says, 'My son, please understand we must stop this advancement of mortals without halting their existence. The balance of power must be maintained. Without the mortals the balance would fade.' &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Solusek Ro says, 'So they have made your decision for you too father. You are all wrong, this will only bring them further into our realms seeking answers! We must take action now. Have at your foolish games, I will not allow them to obtain my power.' &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;You look up and see a meteor burning through the sky; Solusek returning to his tower to brood over the matters at hand. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Rathe says, 'Rallos still your warring heart. This is what must be done. We must place him in a stasis from which he will not be released. Come share your power. We must commence now.' &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Xegony says, 'Mithaniel, Karana please record what you see here. &lt;BR&gt;With your good nature I am sure that your records will be impartial to any side. We must record this for the ages and learn from our mistake of allowing Zebuxoruk to gain so much power that is easily passed on to mortals.' &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The Triumvirate of Water speaks as one voice. It says, 'Now step up to the chambers. Give a part of yourselves to the bind on Zebuxoruk. Through our power, the bonds on him will never be broken. He will be eternally placed in stasis.' &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Saryrn says, 'What of our weakened state. I refuse to return to my realm without the power to rule over my minions.' &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Terris Thule says, 'Yes, how can I spread my touch over my lands if I lack so much of myself?' &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Cazic Thule says, 'Do not worry daughter, we shall stay here until we are able to recover our strength.' &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Rallos Zek says, 'Our armies shall serve us as we regenerate our abilities. We have nothing to fear.' &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Bertoxxulous says, 'My soldiers of pestilence shall watch over us. Let us return to our chambers now.' &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Innoruuk says, 'Are you enjoying watching this Hammer of the Tribunal? I hope your petty report will show my disdain for the Tribunal having no hand in this.' &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The Seventh Hammer says, 'Do not waste your energy Innoruuk. You know they are eternally preoccupied with their trials. Surely even you understand many of these trials exist because of the hate you instill into the population of Norrath.' &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Innoruuk says, 'Do not mock me! I shall seek you out after this is done and my power is restored. You will not be so smug after our next meeting.' &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;When we went to the plane of time, didnt we go back in time before all of the planes of power expansion and that is why the gods are so weak?  So the muramites could of been coming when Zeb said their was something dark in the future at the end of the expansion, but due to time travel, the muramites were there before the start of the expansion.  I remember reading in various ingame books that the invasion of Kuaa took a long time, that the muramites almost lost, but that could of been the dragorn making themselves look good in their history.  In one the books they stated they attacked a portal with the majority of their forces.  So the muramites also could of invaded Tealosia during their war with the dragorns.  Did the muramites have trouble taking over Tealosia, or did they take it over instantly?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Maybe Eze for one of his next articles write all the lore that was scrapped for OoW, or Vahlar could release it, sort of like a deleted scenes on a DVD, and maybe hopefully for all outdated expansions.  Sorta of like a what if?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The meeting raises some interesting points to, Solusek Ro did not take part in sealing Zeb, proving Solusek was at full power when we fought him, suggesting that he is one of the weaker gods who the mortals could beat when they had full power.  I think this could said for Mithanial and Karana also.  Was it ever explained where Tunare and Bristlebane were during Plane of Time, or were they just ignored?&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
When we went to the plane of time, didnt we go back in time before all of the planes of power expansion and that is why the gods are so weak?&amp;nbsp; So the muramites could of been coming when Zeb said their was something dark in the future at the end of the expansion, but due to time travel, the muramites were there before the start of the expansion.&amp;nbsp; I remember reading in various ingame books that the invasion of Kuaa took a long time, that the muramites almost lost, but that could of been the dragorn making themselves look good in their history.&amp;nbsp; In one the books they stated they attacked a portal with the majority of their forces.&amp;nbsp; So the muramites also could of invaded Tealosia during their war with the dragorns.&amp;nbsp; Did the muramites have trouble taking over Tealosia, or did they take it over instantly?&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;My next update is going to be the Battle of Greenfields, that will detail most of it.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The Muramites didn't have much trouble at all taking over Taelosia - they didn't have a very effective army, and most of them were caught completely unawares - they were kind of the France of Norrath if you will.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Now the only fighting against them, save the Norrathians, are Trusik resistances.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Aye I share a similar interest with the question that you brought up at the end of your post.  If all of these gods made a pact to bind Zebo, where was Tunare and Bristlebane?  From what I can tell of the texts and friends that have saved the info and typed it to me from visitting PoTime, Tunare and Bristlebane are never mentionned at all.  This is very interesting given the Expansion Art pretty much has a battle like stance of Tunare vs. Mayong...Good vs. Evil...etc...If Tunare was left out surely this plot by the more darker dieties and some of the moderate ones to bind Zebo must have back-fired on them and they were too weak to see that Zebo had already had his plan rolling b/c Mayong must have already been entrenched on his search for immortality by then.  It is plausible to think then that perhaps Tunare and Bristlebane were more powerful than the other dieties and foreseen what was to come and could have refused to show up b/c they needed to conserve their powers on what was to come....Mind you this is speculation on my part...But doesn't it bother you that 2 strong dieties were absent at the meeting to bind Zebo's powers and are part of the box art of the expansions that will ultimately have something to do with the binding and/or distruction of Zebo, Mayong, and/or any other diety that could have possibly backed them?</description>

&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
how many years after the closing of gate in tealosia does gates take place. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;i dontthink the kuaa&amp;nbsp; timeline matters much since we know that when the wayfarers arrive in taeleso which i wish i could remember how to spell lol.&amp;nbsp; Matam is in Kuuaa. do we have confirmation that the launch force in telosia was indeed launched from kuaa?&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Yes, of course it was launched from Kuua.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Here's the basic timeline:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;OL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;50 years ago, Kuua is officially conquered by the Muramites.&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Not too long ago, Vrex Barxt Qurat opens the portal for the Muramites to come to Taelosia.&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Muramites send an expeditionary force under Tunat'Muram Cuu Vauax to tame Taelosia and take as many slaves as possible.&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Taelosia is conquered.&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Mata Muram plans to invade the rest of Norrath, Taelosian/Trusik slaves are pushed back through the portal.&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Dragorn strike an alliance with the Riftseekers to attack the Muramites, to push them through the portal to Norrath and then seal the portal, thus locking them on Norrath forever.&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Dragorn form a massive army and attack the Muramites.&amp;nbsp; This Muramite force is the invasion force planned to take over Norrath.&amp;nbsp; To the Dragorns' own surprise, they are successfully defeating the Muramite army, even without the Riftseekers' help.&amp;nbsp; Just as they are nearly victorious, the Riftseekers destroy the portal in the hopes of laying waste to both armies and being rid of both the Dragorn and the Muramites, as the portal sets off an enormous explosion that decimates both armies.&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Tunat'Muram Cuu Vauax is trapped on Taelosia with no way to get home, and Cynosure Kvanjji is set to try to reopen the portal to Kuua.&amp;nbsp; He orders Zun'Muram Votal to build up his army around Nihilia to set up a beachhead fortress, while utilizing the magical barrier around Qvic as a defensive mechanism.&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Wayfarers arrive.&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Several wayfarers are scattered, captured, and ultimately crushed by the waiting Muramites.&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Players arrive and begin a guerilla war against the Muramites, and then later learn how to access Txevu, gain access to the upper levels, and kill Tunat'Muram Cuu Vauax.&amp;nbsp; Of course by the time you get to him he's of no immediate threat as each of his commanders are dead, most of his soldiers are dead, and Cynosure is dead, so there's no way to re-open the portal back to Kuua.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gates of Discord had some amazingly good lore, it's a pity most of it was locked away behind Uqua. The storyline build up from Natimbi through the Sewers and Riwwi, and especially (in my opinion in Tipt) just whets the appetite, but that's about as far as most people who weren't in Time farming guilds could go. Kod'taz and beyond was simply beyond the means of the vast majority of players, and without being able to taste Ikkinz and Uqua and beyond, the lore kind of got ignored (unfairly, but definitely understandable, hard to appreciate something you aren't even going to see).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even today, years after the release of GoD, Uqua is STILL the stumbling block for top guilds on servers. On my own server, just over half of the top 14 guilds are through Uqua, and those are the top server guilds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hassan al-Nasir&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Audacia Venator&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Ah....yes i did mix them up.....though i have seen Tunare before...she's at the top of the huge tree with black panther guardians....but still that lends to 1 new and 1 old question.  (1)Why did Tunare and Bristlebane not take part in the meeting? (2)What is the siginificance of FV becoming a new diety(AKA Daughter of Tunare)?  Woudln't that have a HUGE impact on the pendellum swing by adding another god to match Mayong?&lt;br&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;She's not the daughter of Tunare, she's the daughter of a servant of Tunare.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Who knows why Tunare and Bristlebane weren't invited?&amp;nbsp; It's possible that Bristlebane, given his demeanor and outlook on things, genuinely doesn't care if mortals get certain powers or not - and Tunare, maybe she had a strike of morality that Mithaniel Marr didn't.&amp;nbsp; She considers Innoruuk her absolute enemy, and won't bargain with him, even if Mithaniel will.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Interesting I always thought she was the daughter of Tunare....could have sworn i read that somewhere...or was perhaps told wrong...Still would lend to a very strong presence to the Pantheon.  And yes I agree Tunare would rather eat slugs then deal with Innuruk, but that's mainly b/c he corrupted her creations for his own....though no matter now you look at it if Fironia Vie becomes a full diety, which i'm sure is only a matter of time since most elves treat her as one anyways and Tunare goes out of her way to make sure she is protected, Tunare would certainly look after her as well when Fironia Vie becomes a diety.</description>

&lt;P&gt;Firiona vie is the&amp;nbsp;bassturd child of an adulterous relationship.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;She could only be accepted into the pantheon as the Goddess of Betrayal or the Goddess of Adultery, which would be interesting, but I doubt SOE would be willing to do something that interesting.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Ezedriel on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;04-10-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;12:26 AM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Funny, I don't seem to recall when they decided children were responsible for the nature of their birth, but given that you would have Firiona made the goddess of adultery due to the actions of her parents, that would seem to be the case.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In anycase, they have a god of lust, so I don't see why they couldn't have a goddess of adultery.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I also don't seem to recall what Firiona has done to ascend her to godhood, other than being the adulterous of, essentially, one of the satyrs in Plane of Growth.&amp;nbsp; They themselves aren't gods, so why should their child, who is half mortal, become a god?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Though I'm far more inclined to believe that someone who is the result of adultery were to become a deity, that would be the domain they take over.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ok, now you have me confused. Firiona is the child of Galeth and King Tearis' wife.  Where does a satyr enter into this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Painful memories and shame of years past washed over him. He remembered locking his wife in a tower in Felwithe in anger and how months later she had suddenly died, not knowing her death brought him a daughter.  He remembered all those years he missed with Firiona and the dark irony that the &lt;strong&gt;very high elf&lt;/strong&gt; he cast out of Felwithe, Galeth Veredeth, raised and trained her as his own to become the Chosen of Tunare. While his reasons for putting Firiona under heavy guard were different than the reasons he hid away his wife, he had accepted he stole their freedom for good reasons.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;First, I will you tell that I know why you banished Galeth from Felwithe so many years ago. And, at the time, you were probably right for doing so -- but you were too late,&amp;quot; Firiona said, tightening her grip on her father's hand as he tried to pull away.  &amp;quot;That very night you banished him, when you suspected he was becoming too close to my mother, I was conceived.  And during the time you locked my mother in the tower because of your suspicions, Galeth and my mother arranged with the servants to have me taken into the forest to be raised by him, my father, for fear you would have me killed as an illegitimate child.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which brings me to the question of Lanys' origin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Though the gods have been silent to mortals for some time, they are not stagnant.  Innoruuk, the Prince of Hate, still holds a burning hatred for Tunare, the mother of the Plane of Growth, and her disgustingly fair elves.  He still fondly recalls how he surprised the meddling Tunare by robbing her of the first Elddar elven king and queen of Takish-Hiz whom he transformed into his own race of dark elves.  But &lt;strong&gt;when Innoruuk's own ill-gotten daughter, Lanys T`Vyl&lt;/strong&gt;, faced Tunare's chosen champion, Firiona Vie, at the battle in Kithicor Forest and lost her ground, the Prince of Hate was overtaken by a sickening disappointment. &amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who is Lanys' mother?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact remains that each is the Chosen of their people and their God, regardless of their beginning. Neither one deserves to be a deity under those terms alone. I personally have seen nothing from either that warrants their ascension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also feel that if Firiona is to be judged by the infidelity of her mother then we must also judge Lanys by the child abuse of her father. So Firiona could be the Goddess of Adultery and Lanys could be the Goddess of Child Abuse. Both are ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Oria39 on &lt;span class="date_text"&gt;04-10-2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;06:31 PM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Oria39 on &lt;span class="date_text"&gt;04-10-2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;06:39 PM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ah, yes, but Goddess of Distress is a far cry from Goddess of Adultery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I quote you, Eze:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;She could only be accepted into the pantheon as the Goddess of Betrayal or the Goddess of Adultery, which would be interesting, but I doubt SOE would be willing to do something that interesting.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither of those applies to her anymore than Goddess of Child Abuse applies to Lanys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that you have changed it to Goddess of Distress and Goddess of Disappointment, I can partially agree with you. However, even then Tearis' distress is not the result of Firiona's actions, merely her creation of which she had no control. Innoruuk's disappointment with Lanys &lt;strong&gt;is &lt;/strong&gt;the result of her actions of which she did have control and not of her creation. I see quite a difference there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would be more inclined to call Firiona - Goddess of Regret.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Oria39 on &lt;span class="date_text"&gt;04-10-2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;07:15 PM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Agreed, though given her good alignment, perhaps put a more positive spin on her title and make it &amp;quot;goddess of penance.&amp;quot;  Seems to fit in with her losing the Lifeguide and all.  As for Lanys, I'd say envy suits her well enough.  The fact that she's failed to garner the favor of her divine parent as Firiona has must give her an endless source of jealousy and hate.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Those are both possibilities for Firiona Vie.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Let me rephrase - I personally find the one that suits Firiona the most is the goddess of adultery.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Or, have her mother sainted as the Elven Saint of Impurity, and Firiona Vie is the Elven Saint of Redemption, while Galeth could be demonized as the spirit of betrayal.&lt;/P&gt;</description>
