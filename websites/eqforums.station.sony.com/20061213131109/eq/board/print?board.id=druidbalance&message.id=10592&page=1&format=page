Barkspur is also suspectible to other factors, like oor, running mobs, change in targets etc etc. Whats the harm in upping it to 15minutes to ensure full damage occurs. Leave the recast at 12s and the functionality remains the same.<br><br>Would like to see the community thoughts on it, as well if possible to add to our top 10, brought up to the dev's in fan fair etc etc.

				<div></div><p>Although that would be nice, I would much rather prefer the hit cap removed or raised. Being it lasts only 18 seconds, I think it would be much more useful if there is no limit on how many times it can work, or at least raise that hit cap somewhat. The short timer should be the weakening factor, not the hit limit. My thoughts anyways.</p>

				<div></div>I've tinkered with the spell a little bit... and IMO i think the spell is semi-broken.  The DS component only works if you have some other DS on (I tried to cast on myself and get hit, didn't see any DS hits).  Also, the 8 hit cap is super-ridiculous.  The druid class seems to be one of the only classes who gets &quot;caps&quot; put on us.  It happened with our 1.5/2.0 click, it happened with Skin of Reptile (yet, shammy get a version w/out a cap), Ooken Guard has a cap, and now this.... Come on SoE, can we catch a break?<br>

<P>Finally got Barkspur last month and noticed that it does still not apparently work if the person is not already wearing some sort of ds.</P>
<P>That, and my prior belief that not only does it no now do enough damage, but a large portion of the damage it can do is ofen lost due to its short duration, especially if agro bounces at all.</P>
<P>Would also be nice if one of these days, one of these would hit the aura or song slot, since most of the time the tank or target doesn't want to give up a buff slot to make room for a ds, even this one.&nbsp; However, different issue.</P>

<P>Thanks for posting Prathun.&nbsp; It is nice to see a response now and again.&nbsp; Sounds good though&nbsp; =P&nbsp; JOKING.</P>
<P>Since you are obviously reading a bit, please look through our other posts.&nbsp; This class needs SOMETHING.</P>
<P>I can see your point on this one, but maybe 5 minutes would work if not 15, since it is single cast, that could not get in the way, however this spell is not my main focus, although i would have liked to see a bit longer duration, and a bit more damage. Anyway, been awhile since I thought about this not so useful spell (usuable situationally when mhing a good group in moderate or less zone where the extra 300 mana per cast is not going to drain the mana pool.</P>
<P>Panther can be applied to an entire raid and increase dps by how much?&nbsp;&nbsp; Why did druids not get such a spell like this, since already we coudl not buff as well, debuff as well, heal about the same, now dps as well as.&nbsp; Anyway, hope you read through the other posts.&nbsp;&nbsp; You will see some infighting, but I think there are enough stats tied in throughout that the frustration of all druids at this point should be apparent (even those couple who disagree with or dislike others).</P>
<P>As it is, most druids have not gotten a group over a shammy or other dps class in eons.&nbsp; As it is, now high end melee dps now leave raid groups with only a druid in it if they can get in one iwth a bard and/or shammy.&nbsp; Anyway, the whole picture, healing (ours particularly) , our utility, our dps, debuffs, buffs, what we offer a group is way below par. </P>
<P>I can't tell you how many druids I know (and they dont' even see this "face" from me), are frustrated to the point the rarely get on anymore, are switching mains, get on but dread it and logged depressed because they cannot even get a guild group. One druid in my whole guild at this point doesn't have problems getting groups, and that is cause that druid is&nbsp; 3/4 boxed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, the wide open zones of tss helped a bit and when the expansion first came out, was easier, but now that people can see that other classes dps is so far above ours, shammies can heal just as well (which is fine imo), dps a heck of alot better, debuff better (in addition slow), buff better (in addition can haste), who in thier right mind is going to take a druid over a shammy?</P>
<P>I don't say these things in game, cause if I tell people and let them know the true situation, I would never get a group for dpsing or my utility, only potentially last choice for a healer when none other available.</P>
<P>Anyway, hope something is being done fast.&nbsp; As it is, am having trouble trying to keep a couple very sweet 5-6 year playing druids from quitting right now.</P>
<P>I don't expect a response to this, so no need to post.</P>
<P>Again, just wanted to thank you though for actually reading one/some of the posts.&nbsp; That right there gives some hope to a few of us.</P>

<P><BR>Two top wizzies in my guild say they&nbsp;rarely run oom anymore, and they regularly are criting for 20-36K.</P>
<P>The more I thought of it last night, the op was right, you are not going to get your casters in range do do the damage, so realistically the most you are going to do is 45K of damage on a one shot deal.&nbsp;&nbsp; Look at the damage a zerker, monk, shammy's panther, wizzy, nec, mage dishes out in a typical raid 3-7 minute fight and&nbsp;20-25&nbsp;people meleeing&nbsp;x 1680 damage or 45K is not that much damage. I think the person who posted this was not even considering raids when they did so, as I was not until Prathun responded.</P>
<P>Still we got so many issues now, while I'ld like to see the duration and/or the max damage cap eliminated (or some combo thereof (ie 5 minute duration with higher cap, 3 minutes with no cap, whatever),&nbsp; we got so many bug fixes, behind the time spell set, missing spells, aa usefulness and cost issues, debuff&nbsp;and dps issues that I would lke to see those addressed (granted some adjjustment to this spell is in order as it is too limited and wimpy to be used as is 95% of the time.</P>
<P>Don't expect Prathun to respond to the requests guys, just hope he read through the rest of the threads and hopefully past the infighting/vendetta wars to the meat that is in there.</P>
<P>To the shammy who tried to compare SotQ vs Equinox burn, your post was already concisely responded too.&nbsp; Load two different nukes and&nbsp; wahlaa!!!&nbsp; Should we also mention the dot comparison, the fact you got a "decen" pet?</P>

				Just saying the comparison between mana burn and this DS are both far fetched comparisons and not really tactical use things in the manors being suggested. Considering mana burn line of AA's is still real costly and not as productive as actual practical use.<br><br>

<P>mana burn no longer eats all of a wizards mana.&nbsp; I think the top one is 9k.</P>

<P>Ok, so the community thinks 18s isn't long enough to guarantee full effect, and obviously 15 minutes means buffing entire raids...</P>
<P>so wouldn't the logical step be like... <STRONG>36s</STRONG> so that the most a Druid could buff is two people at a time, while doubling the amount of time the effect will stay in place?</P>
