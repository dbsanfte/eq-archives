      <title>Who's pulling these days?</title>

      <description>I just recently started playing EQ again after taking a long break. Durring that break I played a few other MMOs and found that a bunch of the elements of group play I liked were lacking (Crowd control, pulling, tanking, etc.) So, I've come back to EQ for a game with a little more group stucture and challenge because of my true desire in all MMOs is pulling!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So here's my question: Who's pulling these days?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I made a monk about a week ago when I got back and up to level 20 (which is where I am now) I've defaulted as puller for most groups I've been in that needed one. I thought this was encouraging, but I've been hearing lately that monks are not the primary pullers like they were when I last played (From before Kunark to just a little after Luclin came out) I've heard that monks are third on the list after Bards and Rangers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I just wanna pull =) I think I would prefer Ranger but if Bards are head and shoulders above them in pulling ability I could still get into it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks for reading&lt;span&gt;:smileysurprised:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
