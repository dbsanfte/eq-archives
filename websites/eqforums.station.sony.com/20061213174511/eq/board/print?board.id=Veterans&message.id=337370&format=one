</BLOCKQUOTE>Yeah, I did say that somewhere (I remember saying it, just not sure where =p). And yeah, it was more of a theoretical "everything gets upgraded eventually" than a definitive. Though, when we do phase out the LDoN augment, I'd rather it be from a quested/single group source than a raid source. You raiders don't do enough non-raid content in the game in my opinion. Plus, providing more chances for varied demographics of our game (raiders versus casuals in this case) to group up and accomplish a common goal, the better.<BR>
