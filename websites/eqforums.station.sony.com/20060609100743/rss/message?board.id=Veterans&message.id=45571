      <title>A proposed modification to the backflagging solution</title>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I was thinking about a possible alternative to the flagging solution. While the current solution solves some of the large guild issues, it ignores a&amp;nbsp;many individuals who have gotten their flags through pickup raids. These individuals have worked just as hard getting their flags as anyone else, and as far as I can tell this solution does nothing to help them.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;First let me say, that I have for a long time, thought the whole flagging system was inequitable and a horrible idea. Unfortunately however, they are here to stay. Way too many people have spent way too many months getting flagged to just be told that all their efforts were in vain and were not required.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The current solution seems reasonable. However, people who have never gone through planar progression should not get a free ride. There should be semi-substantial&amp;nbsp;soloable or groupable quest&amp;nbsp; required in addition to the item, to get the flags. Giving&amp;nbsp;them to people for free would be a slap in the face to everyone who worked though planar progression through pickups.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So how do you compensate the people who have gotten their flags through pickups?&amp;nbsp;One way to accomplish this is to make flags account based instead of character based. That would allow all of someone's alts to be, in a sense, backflagged.&amp;nbsp;There are many benefits to this approach for both guild raiders and pickup raiders. Unfortunately, it does not address multi-boxers, but I am not sure how to do this without creating an exploitive situation.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;It has probably been mentioned before but i can't be bothered reading all the posts.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The &lt;EM&gt;reward&lt;/EM&gt; is for doing all the planar progression is that you get a rather nice charm slot item. The folks that only do the backflag don't get any of the charm increases. The only &lt;EM&gt;reward&lt;/EM&gt; for doing the back flag loot is that you can now get into PoFire/PoW/PoE/PoS without a raid.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;It is quite literally a backflag - not a method for guilds to "leapfrog" the progression, unless some other guild deliberatly invites them along to loot.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Some of you folks seem confused. This change was a "BACKflagging" change, not a "flagging" change. The goal is to make it so guilds do not have to incessantly fight content below their level every time an unflagged recruit joins. Hence the "back" in "backflag".&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Regardless of whether Gates was a "collossal disaster" or not, the fact is that the playerbase showed with their actions that they arent' willing to do hard single group quests to access content.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This happens to be the case with Tactics as well, which has an amazingly easy alternate quest which people aren't doing.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;That's the reality, what people claim they want, and what they show that they want by their actions are two entirely different things.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;Don't try to make your "accomplishments" to be bigger than they really are.&amp;nbsp; They didn't re-tune GoD because of you, they re-tuned it because it needed to be re-tuned.&amp;nbsp; Big woopidy do.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I was asking about this at the Fan Faire, and GoD's "failure" came from player stubborness, not out of "too hard content".&amp;nbsp; Everything you asked for was there, and you turned it down.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I mean your entire arguement is completely filled with contradiction.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Using charm pets?&amp;nbsp; Are you insane?&amp;nbsp; Maybe that's the method&lt;EM&gt;&amp;nbsp; you&lt;/EM&gt; used, doesn't mean it's the right one.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I mean, you're being pretty presumptuous to assume that because you didn't like something it "ruined" anything.&amp;nbsp; The whole backlash of people whining about Planes of Power flags didn't come around until about the GoD era, when people were mad they couldn't finally leech onto the old expansion for no effort.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Nothing was "ruined" with any of these expansions, and your unwillingess to actually take advantage of what was given to you doesn't dictate the success or validity of expansions.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;The reason I have not done the group access in GoD has nothing to do with an unwillingness to use a hard, group-based alternative.&amp;nbsp; It has to do with the fact that the hard, group-based alternative was designed for characters who already have raid-level access to zones, and thus equipment, that make GoD trials viable.&amp;nbsp; To compare this to planar access, or to claim that such alternatives are available and not used because of this is off the mark.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The point is, there is NO hard, group-based alternative to accessing the elemental planes, and as of yet, no valid argument why there shouldn't be.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;To their credit, SOE has made it possible to gain equipment to make GoD viable for non-time/elemental geared players with many of the drops in groupable areas in OOW.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This has corrected much of the urgency for fixing the flagging/backflagging issue, but it hasn't eliminated the issue.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;And as to charming in GoD..why is that insane?&amp;nbsp; Nothing crazy about using a pet that quad-taps for 1048 1048 1048 1048.&amp;nbsp; The insane thing is that they allow that.&amp;nbsp; It should be corrected (not in the halfassed way the nerfed it in OOW but in a well-thought out way) but it's a very valid way to go through these zones if you know what you're doing.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;I agree, but if they "must" fix it I would like to see them take everone in consideration who has worked for their flags. Right now what I am hearing is that&amp;nbsp;"its free for you, but its not free for you"&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Actually, there are quite a number of &lt;EM&gt;different&lt;/EM&gt; arguments:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;OL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Guilds that have already done flags as a group need to replace members. As new members join, the guild, as a whole, needs to go back and get the flags that the new members do not have. I do not, personally, see this as an issue - just require the damn flags for membership if the guild does not want to do backflagging. This is the "not what you know, but who you know" issue.&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Non-raiders wanting access to flagged zones. This is an issue where people who just don't want to (or cannot) raid want to go into the Planes using an alternate, soloable or groupable, method. Being one who went the Open Raid route and having been to the EP's (not Time), I agree with the statement that there is little group content there (I did not say "NONE", I said "LITTLE"). From my experience, doing this will create problems as well:&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;The non-raiders will scream when a raid comes through because the raid will wipe over the group content or the group itself (e.g. MOBs with zone-wide AE). A conflict will result over the rights of the raiders vs. the rights of a group - in a raid-designated zone!&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;The non-raiders will discover that 90% of the drops in these zones off the groupable trash is total crap and demand the "EP-quality" gear that they have seen in the past.&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Non-raiders will be upset at the extremely limited group camps (and how difficult many of them are if you are Bazaar-equipped) and will demand more group content and easier group content (or better gear) - in a raid-designated zone.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I don't think *anybody* is trying to BLOCK anybody else, regardless of the gnashing going on and the accusation that some are blocking a change just because it would trivialize their own accomplishment. I think it is more that those that have it say "why don't you just do it? If you refuse, then why should you get special consideration?"&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Just like everything else. You want it, you work for it. Not that big a deal.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;I was referring to the fact that some people think that other people disagree with the concept of leaving flags in place purely to prevent others from getting there. I do not think that is the case - I think people are saying "it is there - just do it if you want it"</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;There is another problem area not in your list:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;* guild with low member counts or guilds on servers where the&amp;nbsp;flagged population has dropped below "critical mass".&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I am in a guild that has enough people to raid the eplanes and to flag our members.&amp;nbsp; But, like all guilds, we lose people and need to replace them.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;This is where the problem is.&amp;nbsp; Now&amp;nbsp;a guild that has already gone thru the work to be eplane capable can no longer hunt in the eplanes due to a lack of people (or healers, or whatever).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So you end up needing to recruit.&amp;nbsp; My server's population&amp;nbsp;is so low that there are not many unguilded flagged people, so you end up recruiting unflagged people (and other servers will see this more with EQ2, WoW, etc sapping players).&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Now this guild is stuck having to backflag mobs, fight cockblocks, fight spawn bottlenecks, fight event bugs, and fight server downs all in an attempt to get a few people up to the playing level SO THE ENTIRE GUILD CAN RETURN TO THEIR NORMAL HUNTING GROUNDS.&amp;nbsp; Add in that people simply get tired of logging in just to see ANOTHER backflag mob on the hit list and stop logging in...well,&amp;nbsp;you now have the recipe for mass people quitting of the guild or even the game.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Its not about GIVING some undeserving peon a flag, its about giving the other 50 people who&amp;nbsp;ARE flagged a chance in hell of having some fun on a rare occasion.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I know its a shock but EQ is a game, and games are occasionally meant to be at least a tiny bit fun.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;That is such BS. If that were the case a huge number of guilds would have been yelling for alternative ways for people to get flags so they can then recruit who they want or tell people go you flag quests before apping. But NO its about free flags for them and none for anyone else.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;Is it work or is it fun?&amp;nbsp; I said that the key/flag quests weren't on another thread only to be told that yes they were fun.

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Actually, Ikeyblur, what SOE is doing is that the quest requires a NO DROP item off a MOB in the plane you are trying to access. And only a couple of such items actually drop. Thus, you can't sell the items and you can't have 10 people doing it.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Essentially, you have to get gimped into the zone (with whatever requirements exist for gimping - you usually can't jump 2 flags), get the item, do the quest and it only gets you the single missing flag.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;At least that's how I understand it.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;However, it does apply to Open Raids as well. I see a booming business that will come to our Open Raiding community as the raid leaders auction off (and the ninja-looting!!!) of gimps and the distribution of those no drop items.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;BTW, I was also told that it doesn't work for the PoP progression quest for your charm item and the AA from that, apparently you need to follow the real progression for those benefits.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;gt; If you want your recruits to be able to skip content by doiong some other quest, then by god everybody should be able to do the same quests.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Everyone can do the same quests. The quest merely requires that you have a large contingent of people already have the flag and are able to kill the mobs in question for one part of it is all. If you can fulfill that requirement, nothing is stopping you from completing the quest. The quests are not, however, something anyone can do alone. The truth is, these flags were mainly designed around guild progression, not individual progression. You are asking for something they aren't.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
