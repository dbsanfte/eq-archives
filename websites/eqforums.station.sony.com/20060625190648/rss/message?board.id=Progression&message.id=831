    <description>&lt;div&gt;This is a thread for all those that would like to say to Sony what their dream progression server would be.  Everyone that doesn't want the new server, don't bother posting here. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;First off:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;font color="#ccff00"&gt;Everyone at SOE should realize that a lot of people want to relive EQ from the beginning, and this server will not fail.  Message boards from every game I've looked at has a topic on this server.  Here is your chance to hook us again for years.  All you have to do is listen to what the majority wants, and try to deliver on it.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;font color="#ccff00"&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;1.) This is the most important part of this post... Server progression needs to be time based, not mob based.  Reason being, power guilds will rush to the top, beat the high end, and ruin the whole intention of this server.  My proposal is to introduce the expansions in 6 month intervals, or the exact timeframe in which they were originally released.  This will allow most everyone to experience the aspects of every expansion as they wish, and not be rushed through it at the powergamer's pace.  I also think the majority of the people want this.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;If you replayed this game for 7 years from the start, I think you could hold a whole new crop of players for those years.  I know I would stick around, and so would countless others.  This server could be the rebirth of EQ.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;2.)  All races, classes, and areas should be released in respect to their server's release.  This keeps with the continuity.  This is unpopular, but it is only right for a progression server.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;3.)  Zones should be reverted to how they were.  Lavastorm, Paw, Mistmoore, Cazic Thule, Hate, and countless others should be brought back to their original form.  There were many quests and exp levels gained there before they were revamped to higher levels.  They need to be brought back to keep continuity and add more places for the low end game to level.  Revamp them as we reach the timeframes they were revamped in if you must.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;4.)  All quest mobs that were added to keep up with twinking and game progression should be removed from the starter zones to keep out the items that would be way too powerful for original EQ.  Again, put them back in as we reach the times they were in.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;5.)  The opening tutorial to today's game should NOT be in there.  That would trivialize most of the original EQ right there.  It also kills the newbie zones that house players below level 10.  Don't even make it an option.  Please take it out.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;These are the most important changes that should be made to make the progression server great, in my opinion.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;Now, here are some changes that are not likely to be made, but I would love.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;Permanently remove PoK books and the Bazaar.  a zone like PoK somewhere in the world with no books at all would be ok, and it could link us to Tranquility.  The books just killed the size of the world.  Let the druids and wizzies port, and I don't even really mind the spires.  Bazaar killed community selling and replaced it with afk leave your spare character there selling.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;Place no cap on spells.  If a cleric wants to cast virtue on a low level character, let em.  I didn't mind it, and I don't think anyone else did.  That is a highly controversial issue though, so either way, I don't mind there.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;Give us a chance to preregister guilds there so that we can plan in advance, and get the guild names down.  I have many friends I used to play with coming back, and I'd like to be prepared before the server starts.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;That is all I can think of now, but lets hear everyone elses ideas.  One last word to

just do a decent job on this server, and you have us all over again.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;font

      <description>If you make it time-based to unlock you defeat the entire point of the server.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;How does making the server time based defeat the purpose of it?  Progression will just be controlled to suit the masses, instead of one power guild.  The expansions will still be opened over time, and everyone will experience the content for a fair amount of time.  If the server is just pushed through, then its is just another server.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;For those of us who were around during original eq and level 50 early on we all rememebr the nights of 100+ people in lguk and sol b. Well it would be hundred times worse this time around. Quite frankly eq will progress at a decent pace anyway probably have kunark open within 2 months. Velious another 1-2 months after but after velious is open it will slow down quite a bit.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Quite frankly it's not like you have to keep up with the power gamers. In a server like this with it just opening it's not going to be like an old server there will be many many casual people so you can progress at your own rate. The problem is these days the server has been out so long that even many of the casuals are level 70 with a decent amount of aa. This time around there will be plenty of casuals to groups with even after the 200 or so power gamers on the server jump ahead.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I do remember the crowded days of early EQ, but the fact remains that they were still fun and memorable.  The problem that most people don't realize is that if the old expansions aren't forced (not unlocking any new ones for a certain amount of time), they will not be used.  So if a hardcore guild unlocks Luclin before everyone has done Seb, ToV, ect. they will just simply bypass that and work on Ssra and other things.  In the low end, people will skip oasis, highpass, and other old zones and go for PC and echo.</description>

Quite frankly I'm not expecting luclin to be unlocked for a year. Defintly no earlier then 9months. Sorry but 3 months averages per expansion is the best you can hope for. People want to progress again but the majority don't want to have to wait the original 7 years again.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actually, I (after wracking my brain for the last week) have a solution that sort of takes concepts from a few people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1) End-game mob-kill progression like Rashere stated it would be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2) Flag the mobs by guild, and require a certain number of flags (each by a different guild) to be aquired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  -- This would allow for the majority of the server to catch up to the one or two guilds that will race for the &amp;quot;Blue server&amp;quot; tag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3) Have a post-success time lapse of 1-2 weeks (after the ??&amp;lt;4th&amp;gt;?? guild's success).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  -- This would allow for everyone else, including stragglers, to at least have a chance to catch up, while the high-end raiders continue raiding and build alts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4) Open up the next expansion to everyone (not like theres any other choice without redesigning the whole game).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Ok, so don't label it a classic server.  EQ with no expansions didn't have this tutorial, the quest mobs, the revamps, ect.  It wouldn't be hard at all for them to lock out the tutorial at least.  You can already just hit a button to turn it down now.  Part of origional EQ was the starting zones, and the tutorial just blows them, their equip, and their exp out of the water.  If it is in any form plausable to make this &amp;quot;progression&amp;quot; server more like a classic server, they should do it to bring back countless old players that are sitting in their chairs waiting for this to happen.  The only reason you aren't hearing more from these guys on this board is because you need a subscription to post here.  Read how many are interested on other game boards.  They will bring back a ton of players if they swallow their pride and do their best to make it as classic as possible.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>My dream classic server would be Original EQ through Velious, with all the original zones and graphics in place.  No revamps, no high detailed models.  The original game in all its polygonal, simple-textured glory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All gameplay mechanics and UI features would stay the same.  Unlike just setting the content (zones, NPCs, quests, etc.) back to the old days, there is no way to go back to a set &amp;quot;snapshot&amp;quot; as far game mechanics, class balance, the UI, and such goes.  I'm totally fine with leaving things like cartography, not losing pets on invis, no medding with spell book, class changes, no poofing corpses, and the million other little changes over the years which have frankly been almost all for the best.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But I'm the sort that really enjoys the look and feel of EQ so for me the main thing would just be original trilogy graphics, zones, items, NPCs, and content of that nature.  I would see this as a server to just play on for fun, because if you focused on progressing you would get bored once you beat Velious.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;In my option they just need to call it.... Darkpaw Server (hardcore ruleset) and give a warning to anyone entering that this will be 100x harder then any other server and are they sure they want to play then just leave the added stuff in its not going to effect things to badly (maybe change newbie armor quest to give crafted etc ro armor set so its less uber).</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;I actually like the tutorial, but I just don't think it should be on a server that starts with no expansions.  The origional EQ had 20+ zones just for people 1-15.  The tutorial kills those zones away.  This doesn't even involve my want of a &amp;quot;classic&amp;quot; server.  I'll admit that I wish they could change it back to the way it was.  I'm willing to compromise in my wants though.  The tutorial just doesn't fit in my opinion.  I like your idea for the newb armor quests.  Banded armor rewards, fine steel, ro armor, ect. would be a fair way to get around it.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;the only problem i see, is that the economy was based on armor farming/creating such as bronze and banded. otherwise it would be a good idea to have bronze/banded as newbie quest armor. the crafted and ro armor were much to difficult to do the first time around so they shouldnt be reduced to a newbie quest.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Cloud stated on another message about making this a hardcore ruleset server. i.e. you either raid and progress through the content or you dont. I agree with standpoint.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The problem with that is that some players might just be slower levelers, and want to progress, but everyone is already on to Kunark and Velious when they are ready to go to SolB, Lguk and Perma.  Players can get left behind even if they want to progress.  Then it turns into any other server out there.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;This is not a classic server stop asking them to revert stuff back... sure it would be nice to revert some of it back and as with VP they said they would revert it back... but it is IMPOSSIBLE to revert back to a classic feel.... do u want pelts to not be stackable again? there are far to many small changes that have been in placed that can not be reverted back from so even if they reverted all the zones back it still would not be the same so stop thinking it is or will will just get pissed and quit when the server goes live. I wish they would place all new classes in from the start even if the race is locked out because this isn't going to have a classic feel weither they are in place at the start or the end. I personally would like to start boxing druid / bst but according to what i read i will not be able to so i am stuck with some other hybrid class (sad i never played a pet class and bst only one that can sorta tank for a druid healer).</description>
