				<DIV>I have given this subject some thought and wonder if Katta will have any place in future storylines since he is a bard and was possibly 'saved' by the elves.&nbsp; Lcea's not talking so what do you all think? Is there a place for Katta in the future of Norrath?</DIV>

<P>There probably was some tie in to him that was ment to happen in the Luclin expansion, but it was dropped like the&nbsp;Luclins tower and several other zones that were ment to be in, after all these years I dont know if we will see them and or any "wrap up" of the unfinished story lines. It may happen, they have done things like Veskar, Chardok B etc etc which furthered along old old story lines, or added in some new ones.</P>

<P>Well, they seem to be good at bringing back storylines that have faltered. <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-tongue.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0> I mean Mayong was no where to be seen or heard from in ages and they found a place for him. I think since Katta is/was a bard, Luclin will be the next fabled, Mayong needs a nemesis.......it would make sense to have Katta in there somewhere. After all, since the residents of the city of Katta abhorr vampyres and the leader of their city is a bard, I think there could be a very interesting tie-in with the events of the latest expansion. </P>
<P>Ayonae needs a new plane since Mayong has taken over hers. Druzzil could turn back time (she does that regularly) and bring Katta back.&nbsp; There could be many intriguing ways to bring him into the storyline progression and, in fact, make Luclin more a part of the world again.&nbsp; With Luclin being the next fabled, I think it's time to do a little work there. <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-wink.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0></P>
