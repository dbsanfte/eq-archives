    <description>&lt;DIV&gt;There has been a lot of controvery and not a lot of communication about this issue, here is the way I think it should be:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If two or more forces wish to attempt the same mob, and none of the forces are ready to engage, and no&amp;nbsp;raid pull&amp;nbsp;has been made, the forces should fight it out.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If one force is ready to attack the mob, and another raid wishes to attempt the same mob, they must eliminate the other force before they engage.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If one force has already engaged the target, then the other forces should not be allowed to interfere. Taking any challening raid target requires a vast amount of concentration and healing power, even a few players could easily wipe out a full raid.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If one READY force is attacked by another force, and is not eliminated (removed from the raid location by any legal means) then the remains of that force may still retaliate even if the second force has engaged. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Someone is going to ask "What exactly defines 'Ready to Engage'", by "Ready to Engage" I mean that they are done clearing the area (if needed), are formed up, and are ready to engage the mob within the next few minutes. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;For example, family guild A (A) wishes to kill the Avatar of War, and two uber groups from uber guild B (B) wish to kill it as well, if A arrives and is still forming up, regular PvP would be the solution. If A is ready to kill the AoW and B wants it for themselves, then they must take it, if they simply engage with A still in the zone (or some are left alive after they were attacked) then A may retaliate even IF B is already attacking the AoW. Now if A was already attacking the AoW, had taken it to 25% and B simply wants to finish it off, then by the rules, they would be SOL.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I drafted these at 2 AM after trying to get some sleep so there's going to be some problems, tell me what you think.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>Exactly who can you attack while guild is PvE a raid target.</title>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Ok it seems clear enough that intentional attacking to cause exp loss is illegal.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Say GuildX is attacking Fertha in RSS. I zone in and am looking for some pvp. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Its seems clearly illegal to attack people activly in the raid (clerics, MT, chanters and what not).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Its seems clearly legal to be in MPG at the zone in to RSS and kill whoever comes by.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Am I able to kill people who zone into RSS (once they have control) at the zone in and on the way to the raid? Seems so. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;How close am I allowed to get to the raid and pick off people who arn't engaging the mob? If somewizard is oor of the mob doing nothing is he fair target - clearly no one will take exp loss if he live or die.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Also as soon as the boss mob dies I assume that I can attack anyone at that point... &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Is that how it works?&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>Killing the raid then killing their target and distributing loots is always more fun.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;GM's are beyond inconsistent on this. I attacked a raid on saturday, got petitioned, and the GM then rezzed all the people we had killed, ported us out of the zone and gave the other guild a chance at the raid mob without PvP interferance. His reasoning was that they had 3 more people than us so they had a better right at the target (we had been fighting back and forth before, during and after the pull).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;What's really frustrating is that we beat the other guild in PvP, prevented them from getting back into the zone so we could engage the target, only to have a GM boot us all out.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I just wish there was a clear line on what you can and can't do. It was so much simpler on SZ.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Humm well reading the other posts I would have thought you can attack people engaging a mob.... &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I was attacked during PvE the other day and didnt do anything about it cause I thought it was legal. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I don't really care much one way or the other but would like to get some final written rules so that I don't get banned over something I dont know is legal or not... &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I'd just wait until the mob died then kill 'em all.&amp;nbsp; A bit of patience never hurts.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;You can attack the raid if you wish. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Unless the raid sets up guards at the zone-in and kills you first of course :)&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
