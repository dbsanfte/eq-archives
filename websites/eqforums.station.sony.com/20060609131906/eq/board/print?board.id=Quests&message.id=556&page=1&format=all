<DIV>About 6 months ago, my friend who 2 boxes a shaman and monk took me to Chardok for the first time.&nbsp; I instantly fell in love.&nbsp; The zone is a pain in the ass, and can really be frustrating, but if you go with the right people who know their way around, it can be a very fun and rewarding zone.&nbsp; It's been a good while since I've hunted in there with my friend, but after hearing about all the wonderful quests that Chardok offers, I decided to try and get as many of the items as I can.&nbsp; Please note that it is best (and sometimes required) to do these quests at level 51 or above.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The biggest hurdle to Chardok quests is faction.&nbsp; I'm sure many of you have done raids in Chardok, taking down named mobs for epics and the like.&nbsp; You've probably killed sarnaks by the hundreds in the Overthere and in the Lake of Ill Omen.&nbsp; These activities result in the complete decimation of your Brood Di'Zok faction, which&nbsp;includes the Chardok sarnaks.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The good news is, it can be repaired.&nbsp; You can rebuild.&nbsp; The best way to start would be to kill goblins in Frontier Mountains endlessly.&nbsp; This includes Nurga and Droga.&nbsp; Killing these goblins increases your Brood Di'Zok faction.&nbsp; These goblins usually drop Green Goblin Skin or Mt. Death Mineral Salts.&nbsp; Collect as many of these items as you can, you'll need them.&nbsp; The goblins might also drop a Drogan Warlord's Insignia, so grab one of those too and save it for later.&nbsp; Once you've killed enough goblins to be non-KOS (at least&nbsp;dubious), you can take these skins and salts to Chardok, and give them to the "midget" sarnak at the entrance, Herald Telcha.&nbsp; Give him 4 of each at a time.&nbsp; Hail him for the full details.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can also increase faction by&nbsp;killing mobs in Chardok B (Halls of Betrayal).&nbsp; This also increases Brood Di'Zok faction, since the mobs in Chardok B are considered "Betrayers of Di'Zok".&nbsp; Just be aware that this is riskier than just killing goblins.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Okay, so get that faction up to ally.&nbsp; I have heard that these quests can be done at warmly, but I wanted to be sure, so I got to ally.&nbsp; By far the easiest item to obtain is the <A href="http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=6903" target=_blank>Di'Zok Signet of Service</A>.&nbsp; All you have to do is go through the quest dialog with Herald and he will give you this ring.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Now it's time to get another ring.&nbsp; This one requires a bit more work.&nbsp; There are a few steps involved, but it's mostly just a lot of running around and killing a mob at the end.&nbsp; Click <A href="http://www.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1888" target=_blank>here</A> for a complete writeup of the quest.&nbsp;&nbsp;Tonight I finally got my faction to ally, so I did the quest.&nbsp; It took about an hour total.&nbsp; I had a druid friend join me for tracking, ports, and buffs.&nbsp; We&nbsp;got all the quest&nbsp;NPCs right away (didn't have to wait on any to spawn).&nbsp; When I was ready to do the final hand in, I had a 67 warrior friend join us, just in case.&nbsp;&nbsp;We easily killed&nbsp;spawned mob.&nbsp; I looted&nbsp;it's head, and went to&nbsp;Chardok and claimed&nbsp;my lovely <A href="http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=12316" target=_blank>Regal Band of Bathezid</A>.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I did this quest with my level 64 paladin.&nbsp; The Regal Band is admittedly a very good melee item due to the clicky damage shield, but it also has caster stats on it.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>My next goal is to get the Spirit Wracked Cord.&nbsp; I will post again when/if I obtain it.</DIV>

<DIV>There's a 3 way tunnel near Droga (easy to find with a map) that has about 30-40 goblins inside that a player can easily do. Plus you can camp stuff like the Crypt Conjurer's Stone (with a little faction rebuild) or do help easily move royal raids.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I think this ring also stacks with the dain ring to get a total of a 33 ds with 8 ac in 2 buff slots.</DIV><p>Message Edited by Vjik on <span class=date_text>02-16-2005</span> <span class=time_text>05:06 PM</span>

				The FM caves with the mobs from the old Droga/Nurga are South of Droga, West of Nurga.  Closer to Nurga than to Droga, in fact.  These drop salts and skins more frequently than in Nurga/Droga.  It is more fun to get your faction up soloing (or grouping) in Nurga/Droga, as these zones are well laid out and reasonably challenging for such relatively easy mobs.  You are never forced to make more than a two pull (unless much lower level), and the proportion of casters is very high.<br><br><em>Edit:</em>  you can also get Chardok faction in Chardok B, which is very conveniently placed in Chardok <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0>.<p>Message Edited by Borek-VS on <span class=date_text>02-17-2005</span> <span class=time_text>08:31 AM</span>

				Yeah, I just got my Mage from max KoS to apprehensive to CoH people to the Chardok raid spots, and the goblins in the FM caves were definitely the easy spot to do so. They literally die in five seconds to the epic pet, and about 1/3 drops a skin and/or one or more salts. I'd go there for two to three hours and come out with a ten-slot backpack full of skins and salts... between that and some XP grinding in Droga with guild groups it took me 3-4 evenings.<br><br>FM caves are pretty boring, but the fast way to raise faction. Now, if only I hadn't pressed 'shift' rather than 'ctrl' a couple of times and accidentally handed in whole stacks rather than single skins and salts...

				<DIV>I love those goblin caves in the southwest.. very easy to clear them out with my paladin, and repops are very fast.&nbsp; That's where I finished up my faction work (that and turning in the skins/salts).&nbsp; Another tip: you can check your Chardok faction by conning "a goblin traitor" in the cave to the left.&nbsp; Just don't kill him!!!&nbsp; You will take a negative faction hit.&nbsp; The angry goblin also spawns in this cave, which is the final hand-in mob for the ring.&nbsp; This is where you will kill the named spawn.&nbsp; Also, a lot of goblins in this cave drop nice items for lower level alts.. like the (nerfed) circlet of shadows among other things.</DIV>

				<DIV>The loot table for goblin soothsayers in Warslik Woods was changed a few&nbsp;months ago to almost always drop a green goblin skin, and very rarely you get two. Used to be a quite a rare drop in this zone, but no longer.</DIV>
