    <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Just wanted to voice what I believe to be a solution to old world zones leveling from 1-50ish and their low population or low desirability... Well first of all you have to ask yourself, what brings a player to a zone? I would say on the top 3 list, number 1 is the xp. If the zone is good xp it will attract players. What I believe would solve the problem of old world zones (ie, Lake of Ill Omen, Frontier mountians, Karana's, Upper/Lower Guk, and much more) is simply increasing the experience gained in these zones to match other newer zones that give better experience. It would be way cool to go back to lake of ill omen and be able to find a group. Or the oasis of mar... &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I also wanted to get other peoples opinions on this idea and perhaps some idea's of your own. Thanks!&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Or, bring down the experience gained in "experience powerhouses" such as Paludal Caverns. Once you are over 50, you will need to leave the old world anyways and move on to Kunark, Velious, the Planes and beyond. There is plenty of experience hot zones over 50.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Below 50 however, everyone is doing the same-old, same-old.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;1-5: Gloomingdeep Mines.&lt;BR&gt;6-10: Either Crushbone or Blackburrow. &lt;BR&gt;11-15: Crushbone or Kurns Tower.&lt;BR&gt;16-25: Paludal Caverns.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The levels 1 through 25 are pretty much the same thing for most players. Sometimes slightly dependant on faction (Dark Elves hate Crushbone killing), sometimes dependent on where the player is in the world and whether they want to travel.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I think part of the problem is the lack of newer, lower level players, and the fact that people that want to level up an alt want to get through the first 30 levels as quickly as they can grind it.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Another factor may be the lack of decent graphics in the old world, but I agree, the main factor that draws people to Crushbone, Kurns, and Paludal Caverns is experience.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I want people back in Oasis! South Karana aviak hunting! Camping the bandit camps in West Karana! Camping the Orcs in West Commonlands! Derv camps in North Ro!&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Maybe together with revamping some zones for newer graphics, (if at all that happens) they could make the older zones attractive again to visit.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;What paludal caverns has in terms of EXP, it lacks in loot and money drops. So it is a tradeoff that people take.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;"cruddy bronze" and whatnot are actually level appropriate to the zone and the level intended crowd. Granted, most who play lower levels are playing an alt, so they are out there for the exp primarily and drops a distant second.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I agree that many many original release quests are severely outdated and worthless.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Only advice i could give soe on that would be to do an email contest to design new low level quests, where the population drive their quests a little bit.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I have an idea.. I was inspired by the scavenger hunt.. maybe someone else has suggested it before, but if they did, I don't know about it.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;How about having&amp;nbsp;an epic quest?&amp;nbsp; Not for a weapon, but for experience, skills, money, faction, whatever.&amp;nbsp; It is a quest that will take you all over Norrath at the appropriate levels.&amp;nbsp; It&amp;nbsp;will&amp;nbsp;evolve as new expansions are added.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;It starts when you are level 1.&amp;nbsp; Your guildmaster mentions it to you when you hand him the note.&amp;nbsp; Maybe something like, "when you are older, go see (npc) in (zone) for the next part of your adventure."&amp;nbsp; So at a certain level, let's say 10, you go see the npc in another zone (not too far away).&amp;nbsp; That npc has a task for you, it could be anything really, but it's something that can be solo'd by ANY race and class (whether it be tradeskill related, collect x amount of some item, look for ground spawns, speak to other npc's etc. etc).&amp;nbsp; When you complete that task, he gives you a reward and tells you to go see another npc when you are older, and so on and so on.&amp;nbsp; If you go to that npc before the required level, the npc tells you to come back when you are older.&amp;nbsp; The tasks you are given and npc's you are sent to could be totally random, with lots of different possibilities, so that each person will get a unique quest.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;When a player reaches level 70, the have a final task.. something hard this time.&amp;nbsp; Your reward could be one of many.. there is no set reward.&amp;nbsp; It would depend on the path you took for your epic quest.&amp;nbsp; But all possible rewards should be something cool..&amp;nbsp; not a&amp;nbsp;crappy weapon that will be junk 6 months later.&amp;nbsp; I can't think of anything off the top of my head but you get the idea.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Edited to add that you get a reward for each task :)&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Frangellica on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;04-11-2005&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;01:08 PM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I actually like that idea Fran....I would so love to do something like that honestly....I'm such a slow leveler anyways that something with a certain goal every 10 lvls or so might actually get me out of my alt-itis rut and concentrate on one character more often. :smileyvery-happy:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;There are certain older quests that I would not want to see gotten rid of....like even though it's probably considered worthless now, I'll still be taking ranger babe on her quest for Ivy etched stuff simply because I did start it a while back before taking a break from the game and is one of the little goals I set for myself. Is there better stuff to be had? Certainly....but don't remove everything that is considered "old and outdated". Maybe make a few adjustments to some of the older content, a little bit of upgrade perhaps, but nothing major and certainly not just remove it simply because Item X from zone B is so much better....because guess what? I don't have all them fancy new expansions because there are other things to do with my money most days...and it's enough to pay for a game every month. When my character can actually use them, I'll think about adding the newer ones that I'm missing....but right now I'm still comfortable with what I have and what I can do. &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;i dont know about increasing xp for mobs in old world. I can kill solo two or three times the amount of mobs that i could in poj. even post 50 as a solo spot xp after two hours in the zone is better than what it was in poj.&amp;nbsp;old world mobs are much quicker kills.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Instead of using instanced zones, what about using morphing zones?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;What I mean by a morphing zone is:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Look at Gukta and Oggok.&amp;nbsp; Gutka is the Froglok Home and former home of the Trolls.&amp;nbsp; Oggok is the Ogre home city.&amp;nbsp; When certain conditions are met in The Feerott and Innothule Swamp, a permanent but minor&amp;nbsp;change occurs to the zone.&amp;nbsp; After 10 or 20 minor changes, a major change occurs.&amp;nbsp; This would keep the content in the zones changing and would keep players interested in seeing what new happened.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Some examples of changes could be:&amp;nbsp;When a certain number of lizards are killed at the camps in the Feerott, one of the lizard camps disappears or maybe more lizards show up to reinforce the camp; In Innothule Swamp, when enough mobs are killed within a certain distance to the Feerott Zone Line, a small Ogre Fort appears with Ogres that are there to either help secure the Feerott from intrusion by the Frogloks or to help the Trolls regain their home city.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Regarding the stories that are written by SOE(?) and available in game: Why not have a bunch of quests surrounding those stories?&amp;nbsp; When Grobb fell, some stone was stolen.&amp;nbsp; Why not have 40 or 50 quests made available to players which will run them around and advance the story line?&amp;nbsp; In some cases, why not have opposing quests where players can either help the Trolls or the Frogloks and as each quest gets completed (or gets completed a specific number of times), the story changes and new quests are released.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Back when I first start playing EQ (a different account on a different server from where I am now), the biggest complaint I heard from players was that this game is an MmoRPG...emphasis on the RPG.&amp;nbsp; What peeps wanted back then was some way to influence the world.&amp;nbsp; As things stand, there really is no way to influence the storyline of EQ at all.&amp;nbsp; Morden Rasp may be the person who's visions all Norrathians will eventually follow, but why not allow the players to alter the course that Norrath takes in small ways?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;I LOVE this idea (thats why I gave it 5 stars...) htere are already some player triggered zone changes, like the sonic wolf/ grimling (is it grimlings?) war in Hollowshade, and the Thurgadin/ giant war that is the climax of the Coldain Ring quest.&amp;nbsp; But these are temporary; when they are over, things are back to normal.&amp;nbsp; But a reactive game would be great, and technically feasible.&amp;nbsp; It would mean that each server would be in a different state at any given moment.&amp;nbsp; On server A, there have not been enough kills of Emperor Crush, so there are orc raids near Kelethin every night.&amp;nbsp; On server B, things are more or less normal.&amp;nbsp; On server C, killing Crushie has been very popular, and so the camp at Orc Hill has been taken over; the wood elves who now control it offer special quests and rewards to those who go into Crushbone on missions...but the orcs have prevailed on Dvinn to bring in some dark elf necromancers in a last ditch effort to save their home, so the zone is tougher now.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;Ideally each "state" of a zone should offer similar risk/ reward balance, and a "trivial kills don't count" rule would prevent level 40s from whacking green Crush over and over to trigger a state change.&amp;nbsp; Players might have competing agendas... I want the orcs to be ahead because that state gives better warrior drops from the orc raiders (or just because I'm evil), while you want the elves to win because there's a nice enchanter item that drops from those dark elves (or because Kelethin is your home, and it's role playing your character to want to protect it).&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Admittedly, I am a total newb at EQ, but I am an "old hand" at D2 and some other games.&amp;nbsp; I believe Frangellica and MadameRocks are on the right track here.&amp;nbsp; I love the idea of the epic quest, with occasional rewards along the way, as a way of getting players moving around.&amp;nbsp; And a few small adjustments, especially in drops, would help the lower-level newbs like me--especially when there are no others around to group with, and soloing is the only option--which is most of the time in the Neklutos Forest.&amp;nbsp; Maybe one of those higher-level players coming through Nek would even take the time to help me hunt down and stomp out the dreaded Leatherfoot Marshall.&amp;nbsp; As far as drops go, it wouldn't be hard to have an occasional "good, useable" drop that would not be overpowered.&amp;nbsp; Simply make the item dependent on level--not to use, as level restrictions are the worst thing that could possibly happen to EQ!&amp;nbsp; No, make the EFFECT dependent on level.&amp;nbsp; A random drop of a mace that has a base damage of, say, three, with a +1 damage per character level.&amp;nbsp; Or a breastplate with a base&amp;nbsp;AC of four, with a +1 bonus per level, etc.&amp;nbsp; The numbers I quote may not be balanced, as I have little experience at EQ, but with the correct balance it would work, and make some of those hard-earned items won by low-level chars worth hanging on to.&amp;nbsp; One little complaint--EQ is one stingy game!&amp;nbsp; It is bad to go up five full levels, selling everything that hits the ground--even prying the gold from all the orc's fillings!:smileysurprised:--and not have enough money to buy one chain shirt!:smileysad:&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I did an analysis of this question many months (maybe even years) ago.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;It all comes down to cost vs. reward.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Cost includes such things as travel time, convenient places to sell off, bank and restock, danger of dying, difficulty of corpse runs, one-way pathing&amp;nbsp;etc.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Reward includes such obvious things as experience (particularly bonus experience), loot and general "fun factor".&amp;nbsp; And yes, risk is part of the "fun factor" so it can weigh on either side of the scales.&amp;nbsp; I think I speak for many of us when I say that some of our best memories are of those occasions when we "shouldn't have" prevailed, but nevertheless, somehow did.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;But there are non-obvious things such as, are there convenient places to sit and med, or are you at the risk of constant attack (e.g. Runnyeye)?&amp;nbsp; Is the mob level so spread out that those who can get experience from the low end mobs are at risk of getting creamed by the high end,&amp;nbsp;yet those who are at the high end have difficulty finding experience mobs (e.g. Dagnor's Cauldron)?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Bear in mind also that as you progress forward through the expansions, mobs generally get more difficult.&amp;nbsp; They hit for more damage, have more hitpoints and/or have higher resistatnces, AC, etc.&amp;nbsp; So in terms of general ease, the "old world" is usually better, except of course for the zones which have been revamped and brought up to more "modern" standards.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;People will obviously go to a difficult dungeon if the reward is great enough.&amp;nbsp; Lower Guk is a particularly difficult dungeon crawl if you are level-appropriate, yet there used to be someone there all the time, camping the Rogue DE illusion mask, the Flowing Black Silk Sash, etc.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;With the old Splitpaw, it was rare to find anyone hunting beyond the "double doors", simply because of the difficulty of the dungeon with wanderers, see-invis casters and the one-way pathing.&amp;nbsp; Except for a couple of quests, there wasn't much to draw people in.&amp;nbsp; (I spent many happy hours playing in pre-revamp Splitpaw, so I think I know what I'm talking about.)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;As a contrary example, the Warrens is a wonderful dungeon, because as you out-level the creatures near the entry, they ignore you and let you proceed unmolested into the deeper reaches, where you can find creatures to challenge your abilities.&amp;nbsp; (And of course the ones near the entrances will happily devour you if you get too low in hitpoints and attempt to flee, the fiends.)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;Just wanted to voice what I believe to be a solution to old world zones leveling from 1-50ish and their low population or low desirability... Well first of all you have to ask yourself, what brings a player to a zone? I would say on the top 3 list, number 1 is the xp. If the zone is good xp it will attract players. What I believe would solve the problem of old world zones (ie, Lake of Ill Omen, Frontier mountians, Karana's, Upper/Lower Guk, and much more) is simply increasing the experience gained in these zones to match other newer zones that give better experience. It would be way cool to go back to lake of ill omen and be able to find a group. Or the oasis of mar... &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I also wanted to get other peoples opinions on this idea and perhaps some idea's of your own. Thanks!&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The problem is, how do you pick which zones get the bonus?&amp;nbsp; And if you just blanket increase the XP across the board to all old world zones, folks are still going to gravitate to a few of the more desirable zones and&amp;nbsp;the other zones will be left alone.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Good Example - Chardock is an excellent zone for low to mid 50s, but is so far out of the way, there is no incentive to go there when PoJ and PoI are right off of PoTranq.&amp;nbsp; Even better would be Sol A is great for mid 40s, but why go all the way there when the Overthere has a PoK book?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;No, the number one reason why people go to a zone for groups is Convenience, but the easier we make it for people to travel the less of the world people actually see.&amp;nbsp; After all, if you have to travel more than 2 zones away from a PoK Book it isn't worth the trouble for a lot of folks.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I totally agree with what people are saying are the top three reasons for going to ANY zone.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;EXP, Itemization, Content.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Face it, why would anybody go to a zone with a few mobs, that drop cruddy bronze armor and&amp;nbsp;give little exp, when they can go to a zone with similar level/difficulty mobs that give better exp and have chances of dropping nicer items, and possibly quest/tradskill materials!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;There are NO augs in any oldworld zones.&amp;nbsp; There are droppable cheap items that are better than&amp;nbsp;most long camped drops from oldworld mobs.&amp;nbsp; There are outdated quests that give little to no reward compared to 5 minutes in an expansion zone.&amp;nbsp; There are obvious exp differences in mobs of similar levels with similar hps in older and newer zones.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Hot zones are a great idea... but give them a chance to drop a decent aug or a spell and watch people's eyes perk up.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I like the idea of revamping the zones from a cosmetic standpoint. Having newer looking zones will appeal to new players(and old) and bring the game up to speed with the other online RPG's that are around today. What I do NOT agree with is the raping of low end zones (split paw and MM) to satisfy the high end players suggestions of needing more spots to play. I have a few 68 level toons around and I personally believe there are more than enough zones for us to hunt in. Has anyone been in split paw since the revamp??? I have gone and had a look every few days for the last few weeks and have never seen a single person when I have checked. Granted MM had 1 or 2 people in it, but it always had a few on my server for faction grinding anyway. This was a great spot to hunt in for a 30's-40's group. The plat drop was great for the levels and the items could have been updated to reflect the maturity of todays game making this a great low/mid level zone for another 2 or 3 years.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If sony were to take a look at actually marketing the game a bit more and drawing new players in, then re-tooling older zoons would pay for itself. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Lastly I dont see the harm in the suggestion of having some of the old world named mobs dropping high end spell runes and gear. Some/most of these mobs still take more than a single group to take out and would give some options to the less ubar geared players in the game to raid for these items while not having to fight over new zone targets.&amp;nbsp;I&amp;nbsp;mean really, in the end if the mob is the same level and difficulty why not??&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I dont think I have particularly seen any high end players wanting zone revamps, seeing as they have been pretty uniformly poor - partly due to the fact they are old zones with generally bad pathing, so putting dangerous mobs into the mix is generally not a good recipe - mistmoore being one of the ultimate expressions of this problem, even if people thought the rewards were worth going for, its just silly trying to actually fight there as it takes so long to work out exactly how and what to pull, where to stand, and so on.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Besides this most of the loots from zone revamps seem more aimed at non raiders, or smaller raid guilds - I didnt see any 300hp/mana loots from splitpaw or mistmoore when they were being linked anyway.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Some of the mini revamps have been ok (CoM, HS, etc) where they just updated the zone to be more friendly and reitemized to make it more worthwhile compared to other content at the same level range, but pretty much all the fundamental revamps have been failures - the only one that worked for a while was CT, and thats just because the loot was so much above what could be one grouped at the time in other places.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;most old world dungeons do recieve an experience bonus . I do not think thats a problem my lower level characters did quite well. they were advancing as fast as anyone in pc or anywhere else for that matter.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Outdated quest and outdated temizationa re the single most important reasons why players go elsewhere.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;as part as reenvision the sol ro quest as well as old world drops need to be revitalized. perhaps including more tradeskil drops as well. more random drops such as augs being attainable in these zones as well.. Quest drops and more vable drops seem to be the best approach to attracting players&amp;nbsp; since this reduces the incentive for high level farming which can really make a zone unappealing fast.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Also the task system should be adjusted to allow players to earn points&amp;nbsp; usuable in ldon adventure camps.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I also think the taskmaster network needs to have a basic progression starting in each races home city with an improved referral system. a Neriak task master sending me to another taskmaster asking me to do thing that would in essence hurt my home city faction is kinda out there. &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;All zone revamps aren't bad. CT back in the day was quite active. Only reason it isn't as active still is because of so much new content.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The problem with MM and Splitpaw revamps is that they were poorly tuned. People don't react well to content that pushes them at such a frenetic pace outside the raid scene.(generalization yes, but i think it strikes true.)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;MM was the devil back with the original build, imagine what it would be like being targeted to level 70?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Splitpaw was the devils baby brother too.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;You can imagine why they are empty.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Here is another idea for zone revamps. Cycle them. SoE could easily maintain 2 copys of a zone, running high level for period of time, then switching to normal level build.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I know for a fact that many people would rejoice if they could bring their under 50 toons back to CT for one.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;*edit* and to move things along, soe should go ahead and blow luclin up, and start the shattering :D&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Another variation on the dual level zone idea:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;With all the server moves and merges, it might be interesting to have servers with all high level zones including the former lower level zones, kind of hard and harder zones.&amp;nbsp; People with lower level characters to stay as they are now.&amp;nbsp; People could make a one time free move of each of their characters &amp;nbsp;to the high-level servers when the character got to the appropriate age.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I tend to play a variety of lower to mid characters and would welcome a scheme that put more characters to group with in those zones.&amp;nbsp; I know it will never be like the early days again, but those old zones were wonderfully designed and are still fun, in a nostolgic sort of way, to hunt in.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;I don't PVP, but actually played on the Discord server during its month run because the original zones were crowded with characters and activity. :)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>I agree with modifying the zone experience of some of the older zones.  Like was mentioned in another post, through the scavanger hunt, I was introduced tosome Kunark zones that I've never been to.  Burning Woods looked like a great zone.  As a 57 pally, I could easily solo dark blue mobs for exp, and there are undead!  Unfortunately, I can easily solo in PoJ too with much better return on exp.  If some of the zones were modified to be on par with some of the planar zones, I'd happily pack up my stuff and go hunt there.  Sure the hot zones are a step in the right direction, but they don't fully address the problem of under utilized zones.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Could it be that maybe you've been to the old world zones so many times and know where everything is... where every MoB spawns, where to go to camp such and such... that it just isn't any fun anymore.&amp;nbsp; What would happen if things were moved around?&amp;nbsp; What would happen if the goblins in Butcherblock got tired of being farmed and pact camp and moved?&amp;nbsp; What would happen if occasionally the groups in Paludal made so much noise that the awoke the sleeping creature in the lake???&amp;nbsp; I don't believe it would be all that difficult to throw in some temporary surprises to the old world zones... characters can zip here and there almost instantly, why not the occasional MoB?&amp;nbsp; Would make it much more interesting to zone into East Commonlands and find that instead of a griffon wandering by a frost giant having made a wrong turn had wound up in the zone... think of the possibilities.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
