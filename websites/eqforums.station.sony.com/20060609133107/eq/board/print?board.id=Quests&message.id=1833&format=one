				<DIV>Task 'Initiating Maneuvers'</DIV>
<DIV>Given out on lighthouse Island in Gulf Of Gunthak.</DIV>
<DIV>This tasks has a step to kill 10 Fire giant warriors in Nagafen's lair. This is no problem if the giants are up but if someone has killed them then you are out of luck on this task since the fire giants have a very long re-spawn.</DIV>
<DIV><BR>I'd like to also ask for more tasks for 70th level characters and spread them out among all the expansions please. Getting real tired of doing the ones from Gunthak and the Overthere.</DIV>

I do however want to take a mob the way a monk should do best, in melee combat.  Then I want to mend up, bind my wounds, and do it again.  Equality does not mean I can take the same mobs in the same manner as another class.  Equality does mean I can take mobs for experience.  And if in getting an ability to solo, you improve my group role, bonus." DMize / Hirou Protagonist 65 Transcendent, Sol Ro
