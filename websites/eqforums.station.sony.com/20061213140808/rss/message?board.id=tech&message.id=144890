      <title>Problems with Casting Window</title>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;My casting window is not coming up for my Main Character.&amp;nbsp; I do not have a custom casting window, however I am using a custom UI.&amp;nbsp; The really odd thing is that even if I change my UI to default it still doesn't come up for this character.&amp;nbsp; However if I switch to another character&amp;nbsp;the casting window comes up fine.&amp;nbsp; I have tried completely renaming the UI_Charactername files to allow EQ to rebuild the character UI files and that still did not work.&amp;nbsp; Anyone have an idea of what I'm doing wrong or any suggestions of what I could try?&amp;nbsp; Is there a keyboard shortcut that hides the casting window?&amp;nbsp; Even if there was it would show up after I wiped out the UI_Charactername.ini files, technically everything should reset then (it did except the casting window)&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
