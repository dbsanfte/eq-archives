&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The CHeal playstyle is still around and will be around for a long while yet, but other playstyles are coming back too (or new ones developing). The Vie + regen cleric, the stunning cleric (need more work there to get the stuns back in line) and yes even the nuking cleric and the meeleeing cleric.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66cc00&gt;I do all of the above and it's CHEAL that allows me to do these things.&amp;nbsp; Cheal gives me the extra mana to cast an RDS, my pet, nukes, and stuns (and DoTs soon too).&amp;nbsp; Cheal is what gives me time to actually get in some&amp;nbsp;damage.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66cc00&gt;That may sound weird but its true; take a typical one minute fight, if I cast cheal 2 times in that fight that's 20 seconds out of 60, the other 40 seconds (that's two-thirds) I am able to melee, nuke, stun, RDS, etc.&amp;nbsp; I have to cast Hallowed Light 4 times during that same span of time (I tested in RSS), to keep the same tank alive. That's only&amp;nbsp;13 seconds worth of casting however, I have also spent nearly FOUR times the mana (800 vs 3100 base and since cheal IS affected by mana reduction effects they are neutralized), so I can't spend that mana nuking, or casting my pet, or the RDS.&amp;nbsp; All I can do is melee, and even then I have to sit out at times because I have reached a point where if I don't med between casts I will be oom shortly thereafter.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>Summit Plans: Issue II: The Secondary Role. Soloing clerics, stackability, low healing situations&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Other classes now are (rightfully so) gaining improved healing abilities. Already a group has a choice of Clerics and Druids and sometimes even Shaman and Paladin's as their main healer. Cleric healing is very powerful, but increasingly cleric healing is almost TOO powerful for normal grouping situations.  Why would a group leader look for a cleric who is basically overhealing with every heal (not because the cleric wants to; their heals are just that strong) when they can get any one of any other adequat ehealing classes who can do other things. It is time for clerics to have a strong, viable secondary role in groups. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Whether it is in a group that does not need heavy healing, a group that has doubled up on the clerics for whatever reason, or the soloing cleric, the cleric does not have much more to bring to the table beside their healing power. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As things stand right now, the soloing cleric can get eaten up by low blues in old content, which we should ideally we should be able to get through.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And in groups that don't need the strong healing power that the cleric brings, a group leader can compare us to the other healing classes and decide to go with a druid, or a paladin or a shaman because all three can bring other things to the group beyond the healing a cleric has.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And in groups with two clerics, there is a strong mindset that the second cleric is just a hanger on who isn't bringing much to the group. There is a strong feeling that the group is humouring the two clerics by pairing them up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We do not want, nor need the ability to tank mobs (other than in extreme group wipings anyways situations). What we do need is a valid secondary ability, most likely as a semi-solid DPS class of some sort, that we can bring out to the group and not be embarassed about.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Proposed Solutions:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. Cleric stances. Similar to druid stances that are in the works, give us something similar. Let us go into a battle stance that will turn off a cleric's natural healing bonus, but increase our spell damage and meelee damage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. Give us another spell line that does not check against MR. Our retribution line is great, except for the fact that mob Magic Resist is so high nowadays the spell resists like crazy. A new nuke spell line, added in the higher levels when resists become most noticable (probably around L45+) that is chromatic on its resist checks. To reflect its higher chances of landing, have it do slightly less damage. Another option would be to shift the higher end nukes (Down to and including Judgment) from an MR check to a Chromatic check.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3. Recently, the game has been shifting to put meelee in as a cleric's secondary role. With that in mind, it is high time our meelee skills reflected that. We should be close to the Paladin's if not identical at the higher levels. We do NOT need the extra attack skills like "Double Attack" and stuff, but we should be making decent DPS with our meelee skills none the less. Capping a cleric's offensive skills near a level-equivalent Paladin's level would help solidify a Cleric's meelee abilities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4. It used to be that root was a viable tactic to stop a mob from running and to root park. Cleric roots however are proving to be inadequate in the 60+ game. Between our DoN Ward spell and our hammer procs, stopping a mob from running becomes chain casting root. We need our root spell strengthened so it can endure through more than 1 or 2 procs/nukes. If the DoN ward is spread down to the lower levels this will become a problem down there as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;5. An improved root system would help with runners, but there is another suggestion that could work well for soloing clerics/clerics (and a similar version for paladin's) fighting in groups without a snarer. Create a new "Infuriate" spell line that when landed will infuriate the mob, keep the mob focused on the group, unsnare and unslow the mob, but keep the mob from running.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I would much perfer they just kept our heals up-to-date with the content, which in some cases they have whilst others they have not. I would like to see a CH upgrade, maybe like a second CH spell you get upon reaching 55? 60? ....Most tanks I group with In order for them to reach 100% I find myself Landing it at 60%, which kind of makes those AAs Useless, Ive crit complete heal hundreds of time, but On a huge ratio against all odds, I prob. benifited from my AAs 10% of those CHes, And the only time I ever seen it actually benifit was on raids in a rotation. Another words, I crit when I dont even need it too, meaning lots of wasted crits.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I don't want a secondary purpose, and if they gave us better DPS rather it be melee and or Nukes, then people would only **SMURF** and whine we are to powerful, much like i believe the druids NOW are to powerful. Dont understand thier big gripe but that is on another thread..&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Battle clerics are Ok, as long as they when there is a time to melee and when there is a time to be a healer. I for one will melee when on raids/ or going after a named where we have to clear halls, rooms, etc (basically on the move) All my melee is maxed out, and those summoned hammers can add more to the damage ratio, On a normal fight it (depending on group) could proc 10 times, making a thousand points of damage, stack with base melee hits it can add up to where you did some significant damage. If we are in a tough place where my tank is dropping bout as fast as my C-heal cast time, ya damn skippy im more on the heals and at this point dont have NOTHING, DPS wise in my spell gems....&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I said it before on the other thread, I play the cleric to be a healer...I knew what I was getting into when I started my class, and have BIG hopes that I can hold that tittle of being the best healing class. Otherwise the charm of my purpose is gone, and I'm sure then i'll try other places..I Chose to play a cleric much like druids chose to play thier class. I knew from the beggining I most likely will always need a Tankable class to get anywhere in the game, I knew then Clerics was NOT the soloing type. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;And where the h.e.l.l is the voteing booth? SOE making these changes because of the voice of a handul of players? I swear to Innoruuk, THESE boards are the only place I hear people gripe about the classes they play, And I know these boards dont get to hear 100% of the player base. None of my guildies frequent these boards. Yet is this the only source SOE gets thier info on what people want?......wake UP SOE, get the info from the people IN THE GAME. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;and I vote leave the classes ALONE&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;While you have your screamers and chicken littles, saying SoE sucks and new MMOG_01 will slay EQ. There's a point of realism, such as playstyles phasing out or hashing out new playstyles. Such as cleric soloing mechanics enhancement, is the brainchild of boards. Does it effect everyone? No. Does it help most of us, yes. I'm a group centered players, but sometimes I like to solo. That's how I got my SoS sometime ago, which I pride as much as my epic because it was something that is both strong and it's sort of a crowning achievement. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Understand that up until DoN, that cleric soloing remained untouched since Shadows of Luclin and did not scale well.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;As for CH, it's&amp;nbsp;venerible and in it's twighlight. I seriously can't wait until that mechanic is dead :smileywink:&amp;nbsp; But either way, it's a mistake and I doubt if they'll upgrade it. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The key is not whining and having constructive criticism, and saying what you like.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;Maybe in its orginal form it was a poorly balanced spell (400mana no HP limit), but its been nerfed twice since then and it has now come into balance, it completely heals the average tank about 50% of the time :smileywink:.&amp;nbsp; However, the fear is that in one or two expansions, which&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;U&gt;will&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; increase overall HPs and mob DPS,&amp;nbsp; the current cheal will no longer be useful and we lose one of our advantages over other healing classes.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;A "Cleric" thats wanting to see "Complete Heal" disapear, Plus wants more DPS, sounds to me like "One dem dere drood wannabees"&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;So that it may seem The C-Heal will one day be obsolete. So I guess its safe to assume Clerics will be worthy of nothing but 96% rezzes....eeerrrrr Wait! Druids are wanting that too, as it seems they might just get it...Ok scratch the rez, Ok clerics will be worthy of being BUFF bots for temp/virt/conviction, since all of our other buff lines are deemed useless. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;All you OLDER clerics hang on to ya toons, One day they will be nothing more then PoK merchants, And you poor young clerics, give it up your now doomed to uselessness in the end, why? all because of a so called "balance"....and a handfull of druid wannabees....&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>I understand and agree with the feelings about Complete Heal. It is a game mechanic that is slowly on its way out and is unlikely to see any upgrades ever. (not impossible but very unlikely).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The problem with Complete heal is, you push one button, and you can not do anything else for 10 seconds. You can't move, you can't DPS, you can't alternate heal, you can't cure, you can't use an AA, you can't nuke, you can't stun, without interrupting that CHeal. It makes clerics a very monotonous class if that's all you see them as. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Quite frankly, we as clerics have been spoiled by Cheal for 9 expansions now, and because of that many are unwilling to look beyond that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Luckily (depending on your PoV) the Dev's are shaking things up slowly. They are making encounters that make CHeal virtually impossible to use. Either damage spikes too much, the mob stuns too much, silences, the AE's are too high forcing you to heal your group with other tools, the mob shadowsteps or grav fluxes, mob casts diseases and curses that have to be cured fast, etc.... Most of those appeared in raid encounters but they are slowly trickling down to the group encounters too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The CHeal playstyle is still around and will be around for a long while yet, but other playstyles are coming back too (or new ones developing). The Vie + regen cleric, the stunning cleric (need more work there to get the stuns back in line) and yes even the nuking cleric and the meeleeing cleric.</description>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The CHeal playstyle is still around and will be around for a long while yet, but other playstyles are coming back too (or new ones developing). The Vie + regen cleric, the stunning cleric (need more work there to get the stuns back in line) and yes even the nuking cleric and the meeleeing cleric.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66cc00&gt;I do all of the above and it's CHEAL that allows me to do these things.&amp;nbsp; Cheal gives me the extra mana to cast an RDS, my pet, nukes, and stuns (and DoTs soon too).&amp;nbsp; Cheal is what gives me time to actually get in some&amp;nbsp;damage.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66cc00&gt;That may sound weird but its true; take a typical one minute fight, if I cast cheal 2 times in that fight that's 20 seconds out of 60, the other 40 seconds (that's two-thirds) I am able to melee, nuke, stun, RDS, etc.&amp;nbsp; I have to cast Hallowed Light 4 times during that same span of time (I tested in RSS), to keep the same tank alive. That's only&amp;nbsp;13 seconds worth of casting however, I have also spent nearly FOUR times the mana (800 vs 3100 base and since cheal IS affected by mana reduction effects they are neutralized), so I can't spend that mana nuking, or casting my pet, or the RDS.&amp;nbsp; All I can do is melee, and even then I have to sit out at times because I have reached a point where if I don't med between casts I will be oom shortly thereafter.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;The Problem is thogh in all this expansions they didnt came up with an workable solution to replace CH. Timing ch takes more skill than randommashing AHL for 7 to 14k heals. Thanks to foki its imposible to build any decent blast heal chains wer not 80% of the mana goes on 0 to 1k heals. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;And even IF it were overall workable what would we face then?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;"Hey i dont have to use 12 sek cycle heals anymore its sooo nice now i can finally use all the otter nifty spells i have between heals"&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;"Yea right that is if this other healing options&amp;nbsp;would leave me with&amp;nbsp;any mana for those things thanks to lower effecy i still can only heal unless i work with even more downtime this lowered healing effecy allready force opon me"&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I REALLY dont understand why SOE dont go for one and give us an expension were we dont get higher heals for higher mana but same heals more efficent! Any child understand that clerice need to take care of their primary role 1st. If this dont allows for cast time of manareserves to do something else its really not important what kind of 2edary ability we have unless we can get an groupslot just for it. (and i dont see clr geting from last dps to anything dps or reall CC/pulling anytime soon since we miss a whole bunch of tools for that)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Class balance is simple, and guess what? No codes need to be changed, no re-digital formatting needs to be written, No testing, No trial and errors, Nothing of the sort On SOE's end. Know how to balance the classes? Its called the player choseing the class that they enjoy playing. If&amp;nbsp;we are&amp;nbsp;so damn misserable playing&amp;nbsp;our class, Or ya not haveing fun, then its quite possiable&amp;nbsp;we dont need to play that class. ...logic&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Then if you play ALL the classes and learn they ALL have somthing to whine about, then whats left? &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>I'm not sure I really understand all this "if you want to be a tank go play a pally" and "no one else in my group is allowed to heal" and "i'll boot any cleric who wants to melee" crap - although I'm half convinced that Soapy's post was a troll, since there's no way that any cleric could be that **SMURF** about healing and actually manage to get groups, let alone be part of a raiding guild.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Isn't it possible that there's more than one way to play a class?  Do we really need to tell people the "right" or "wrong" way to be a cleric.  Some people love to do nothing but heal, some love to heal and nuke, some love to heal, nuke and melee and crazy dorfs like myself love to heal, nuke, melee, tank and pull!  As long as you're keeping your group alive and having fun, does anything else really matter?</description>

      <description>Hi guys, druid stopping in, hope you don't mind.  :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;hr&gt;Whaxx wrote:&lt;br&gt;Add slow, track, and DoT in there, and you got......  a Druid.&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;Uh no . . druids have never gotten slow.  The closest thing we ever got was an attack debuff, and while that was good for a 10-15% dmg decrease back in PoP (it's mostly useless for that purpose now), even then it still wasn't anywhere close to slow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the people afraid of druids, I'll reassure you that even as druid healing increases, you've still got a pretty tight grasp on a group slot as long as we don't have XP rezzes, especially in long grind type groups.  And that's without any secondary role.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When I started playing my druid, I was informed that druids were wisdom casters, also known as priests.  And as a priest I would be able to heal.  I fully expected that clerics would have other tricks: bigger heals, faster heals, heal over time spells, group heals; there are plenty of examples of that.  But I also fully expected to be a functional healer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If I need FT20 and 45% healing focus to heal where a cleric needs FT10 and 30% healing focus I have no problem with that at all.  I expected clerics to be ahead, and clerics to be able to heal specific encounters sooner.  But I still expected to be able to do it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And I am pleased that it definitely looks like the game is headed in that direction.  I will need to spend more time earning AAs or gearing up, but I will work as a healer.  And honestly, I think the overhealing argument is a pretty minor one.  When I am working as healer in non-trivial content I really don't have time or mana to nuke and I really prefer not to snare, since I will inevitably get caught at some point healing when I need to be snaring.  In trivial content I am preferable, but since the content is trivial so is the benefit.  Additionally, if the content is trivial and little/no healing is required, there are other classes more desirable than a druid for that slot.  FAR more often, the cleric will be chosen for the DVA/rez safety than the druid for a little extra dps.  (It's worth pointing out that druid dps is correctly located below wizard dps, and since wizard dps is currently pathetic, druid dps is abysmal.  Honestly the secondary dps advantage may be totally due to perception.  When I am serving as healer, my only real damage contribution is DS, which usually runs around 10-20dps, depending on various factors.  So actually a meleeing cleric serving as healer may well add more damage than a druid.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However the stackability is a serious issue.  But stackability is also where the secondary role question is absolutely unavoidable.  If there are two clerics in a group, one of them is not healing.  (Not unless it's a really unusual group.)  With two druids, one of them can focus on snare/FR debuff/nuking.  Druid dps is a joke right now, but if and when caster dps gets fixed it could be at least worthwhile, if not good.  For the second cleric in a group, what do you do?  People like Boradek who oppose ancillary skills and secondary roles . . do you think that two clerics should never group together?  Because that's the situation you're supporting, even if inadvertently.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I would have no problem with a cleric doing 100-150dps meleeing solo.  With my DoTs when I am soloing I do 200-250dps depending on crits, and that's with tacvi/anguish foci.  That's not sustainable indefinitely for me, but I imagine the cleric would have to heal himself and eventually med also.  I also have no problem with a second cleric doing that same 100-150dps melee in a group, as long as it is the second cleric.  Doing that while healing would be overpowered I think, but if you get in some battle cleric stance, or cast some super melee buff with a hefty mana drain component (in the neighborhood of 50-70, basically enough to negate modern mana regen) in order to do that damage it sounds good to me.  Incidentally, in a group setting with little downtime I currently sustain in the neighborhood of 100dps nuking.  That's just all I can do with max FT etc.</description>

      <description>Kryp, I think you'd be surprised how many are laughing behind your back but are too polite to say anything. =p&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think you'd find a lot of people who think it's silly but harmless, some that think it makes you look noob and wish you wouldn't do it, and almost none that actually think your dps is a meaningful or important contribution that makes you more desirable, because it's not meaningful.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The reason some of this are fighting it so hard is that we believe that it's destroying "The Vision" for the cleric class and what the cleric class has always been in EQ.  We believe it's inconsistent and moving the class in a direction of play that is less fun for the player base as a whole.  It's blurring the lines with paladins, the true melee/healer hybrid.  That's the class that you should be playing if you want to melee and heal.</description>

      <description>Thankyou for posting that. :) &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I would have to agree that being a cleric is far more than just healing for yet another high end guild.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Still I can sympathize with Boradek, it is clear that our pious and light lines are where Sony desires us to go, and that complete heal eventually be lost as a usable tool, simply because it takes too long to cast.  We very much need more healing, and not be dependent on critical heals.  Usually my critical heals occur when the tank was just healed by someone else, weee 11k critical heal for 224.  As the content continues to be more difficult, and the complete heal less and less used we need to be able to rely on heals that are 150% to 200% larger than they are now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There should not be a requirement for twice as many clerics as every other class to play high end content.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course I have to agree with the melee clerics though, that we should be able to farm trades skills items without needing a chaperone.  I would like to be able to solo when I'm not raiding, alone, with some reasonable expection of success and experience.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So what is a viable secondary role?  Limited crowd control and damage mitigation for a selected target.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chisaineko of the Vazaelle</description>

      <description>All you people should make paladins if you can't stand being a cleric. Personally we are fine the way we are. Developers need to focus on our best assets. Not on stuff that is never going to happen. Ala Sarocs plan to turn us into viable tanks. If you want to tank then make a paladin and retire the cleric people. Its really that simple.</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;NO!!!&amp;nbsp; For all you anti-melee clerics out there,&amp;nbsp;you keep on believing that we melee/battle clerics want to tank mobs, that is simply not the case.&amp;nbsp; What we DO want is to add a little extra fun and challange to the game.&amp;nbsp; Typically that means adding DPS when we can and off tanking if and when we have to.&amp;nbsp; Besides that, try to answer these questions and see if you can justify your beliefs:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;1)&amp;nbsp;Why would the Devs grant us&amp;nbsp;weapons like &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Noqufiel's Wand of Infinite Enmity&lt;/STRONG&gt; (caster ONLY) or &lt;STRONG&gt;Furious Hammer of Zek&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; (Cleric ONLY) or &lt;STRONG&gt;Delightful Orb of Forgotten Magic &lt;/STRONG&gt;(All/All) (These happen to be my last three primary weapons) or &lt;STRONG&gt;Illuminated Hammer&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;(again caster ONLY) &lt;STRONG&gt;Hammer of Holy Vengence&lt;/STRONG&gt; (cleric ONLY) and MANY others (from all over Norrath), if they did not intend for us to use those DD procs in melee combat?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;2) why woudl they create a spell lien of summoned hammers with procs and high dex bonus on them (to improve proc rate) if they did not intend for us to use them in melee combat?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;3) why woudl they create a self only buff line taht grants added attack, dexterity, haste, and mana regen (while standing) if they did not intend for us to use it in melee combat?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;4) why woudl they create a non-permapet for us taht could be made permapet by chain agro?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;5) why woudl they give us DD and stun spells?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Try justifying the stand-back and heal style now.&amp;nbsp; I doubt it can be reasonably argued.&amp;nbsp; The only reason to stand-back and heal is if you feel you cannot do more than that.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;The biggest obstacle facing clerics RIGHT NOW, is that we do not stack as a class AT ALL.&amp;nbsp; If there are two clerics in a group ONE is dead weight (we all know this).&amp;nbsp; The biggest obstacle we face in the apparent future (nothing is set in stone) is that other priest classes (Druids and Shamans) will soon be able to fill our role AND their current role as well, if that day has not arrived already. &amp;nbsp;Which means even ONE cleric in a group is dead weight.&amp;nbsp; This thread was intended to promote ideas for a secondary role a cleric can play.&amp;nbsp; Since (apparently) a LOT of us melee anyway, we suggested a way to improve that melee ability when our healing skill is not required.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;That being said, even if ALL the re-balancing is done chances are you will continure to see clerics getting groups for their healing abilities.&amp;nbsp; We are a KNOWN factor.&amp;nbsp; Everyone in EQ knows we can heal and we enjoy doing it.&amp;nbsp; Even if a group has a druid or shaman as a main healer I have little doubt that if a spot opened and a cleric was LFG they woudl take that cleric and shift the druid/shaman back to their "known" primary role.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Changing the subject somewhat: someone mentioned clerics with "slings".&amp;nbsp; This will not happen.&amp;nbsp; There are only five classes with range weapon capability in EQ (Ranger, Warrior, Paladin, Rogue, and Monk) If another class were to get a range attack it would be SK or Bard WAY before clerics.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;The notion of an offiensive stance could be remedied by "fixing" the divine avatar AA.&amp;nbsp; Right now, it does not last nearly long enough and its recast time is WAY too long to be of any real use.&amp;nbsp; Take off the regen, increase the duration and decrease the reuse time and it would be worth while.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Improving our pet could go a LONG way to adding a role.&amp;nbsp; Part of a shaman's DPS at the moment comes from his/her pet and a shaman's ability to do a multi pet every so often.&amp;nbsp; The Cleric (and druid) pet is a JOKE.&amp;nbsp; If it cannot be retuned grant us AAs that will make it more permanent and improve its DPS.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
