<P>I'm not sure if you're referring to the raids or the single-group trials.</P>
<P>As someone mentioned earlier, "trials" wouldn't necessarily make sense in every expansion because the lore doesn't always&nbsp;center around an individual that poses challenges&nbsp;to those who wish to prove themselves.&nbsp; That said, we do&nbsp;have scripted raid encounters every expansion with mechanics that aren't dissimilar to the MPG raids.&nbsp; The difference between Hatchet the Torturer and the Trial of Adaptation is primarily lore. <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0></P>
<P>I liked <EM>almost</EM> everything about the single-group&nbsp;MPG trials.&nbsp; They were challenging, hand-crafted, unique events that required careful and sometimes unusual tactics.&nbsp; My problem with them was that the rewards were substantial... maybe a little too substantial.&nbsp; High level spells, a permanent increase to the resistances hardcap and some incredibly good gear.&nbsp; And I suspect this spike in itemization is one of the main reasons why they were so fondly remembered.&nbsp; Ask yourself, and be completely honest, if the events would have been so popular if the rewards were a shade or two less powerful.</P>
