&lt;DIV&gt;don't really have much to add to anything other then how excited i am at the prospect of this server.&amp;nbsp; first time i set foot in norrath was back in i think 01 after picking up the eq classic 3 pack.&amp;nbsp; as i remember it luclin was out at that time but i had no access to it as i didn't hve that expansion.&amp;nbsp; played for a bout a month then left.&amp;nbsp; a few months later returned with a upgraded system and pop and luclin added on to my account.&amp;nbsp; then after a month or so(i do have a habit of only sticking with an mmo for about a month and changeing to a differant one) i left again and didn't come back until darkhallow.&amp;nbsp; played and left again and then last week i decided to reactivate my account ranomly and in doing so i come accross this server.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;i like a bunch of others am hoping that we can take our sweet time and open expansions slowly but i am really looking forward to being part of it.&amp;nbsp; name is already reserved though i haven't fully decided what class/race.&amp;nbsp; looking forward to rewinding with all of you.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;i thinking i probablly will as this will give me the chance to something close to what i have always wished.&amp;nbsp; be there at the beginning on day one when everyone is pretty much on the same page.&amp;nbsp; even with all the games launched over the last few years finances usually keep me from joining until a month or to later and by that point there is pretty much always a slew of people all the way at the end.</description>

&lt;P&gt;Have to agree with the OP; I am totally stoked about this server.&amp;nbsp; Just the other morning I woke up early and found myself thinking of how much fun it'll be researching spells and such; and how the recent nerfs have renewed my faith that the old world will be more than just an&amp;nbsp;"annoying time sink"&amp;nbsp;holding us back from Kunark.&amp;nbsp; It will be a world of danger but also rewards that truly benefit my character.&lt;/P&gt;</description>
