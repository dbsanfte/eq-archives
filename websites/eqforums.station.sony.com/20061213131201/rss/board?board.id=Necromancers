      <description>With clerics able to crit 32k, mages the same on summoned, wizards doing 42k (Ithink it's 42) for mana burn, is there any chance we might get a critical lifeburn AA next expansion?&amp;nbsp; We got the lowering of the reuse timer this time.&amp;nbsp; In its current form lifeburn is pretty much useless on modern bosses.&amp;nbsp; Hitting for the sum total of our HP makes it possible for 20k for the very few top people, and there would be several of us able to hit for 17k+, but really that is limited to a tiny few individuals playing the game.&amp;nbsp; The ability (not the chance, a definite ability) to critically lifeburn would make this class defining feature meaningful again.&amp;nbsp; I used to look forward to the necros all calling when their lifeburn recourse was off so the next one could go (back when we had more than 2 of us /mourn departed necros).&amp;nbsp; we don't really bother to call it now since we hardly ever use it, and when we do it's mostly at the very end of a raiding night, just to say that we actually could.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's depressing to see wizards regularly nuking 20k , and clerics preening themselves that they critted a turn undead for 32k on an undead when our largest possible damage is limited to our hp.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Necromancers&amp;message.id=9844#M9844</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;"I would like to add the idea of a permanent illusion spell like enchanters or rogues have..since at high end liching oneself to death is a thing of the past I for one would LOVE to be able to have lich last over zones..whole raids etc. They have the clicky familiar that lasts over 400 minutes why not let us stay liched?"&amp;nbsp; Aiyee&lt;!-- QuoteEnd --&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;!-- QuoteEEnd --&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;YES. If they can't get our spells and mana regen right, at least we KNOW they have the existing code to implement permanent illusion. It ticks me off to have to re-lich every time we zone, levant, or get evacced. I know this is minor compared to the issues facing our class at the moment, and in the face of the emphatic gutting of our ability to maintain top dps it really isn't a biggie. However, it might be something they can give us that fixes a really annoying thorn in the side.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Now that they took out the EE part of the description what good is a lvl 74 spell that costs more mana and does less damage than Corath Venom, a lvl 69 spell?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Maybe I missed something. But if not it would really be nice to know why necros "only" got downgrades in TSS?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <title>Hunting Places for a Necromancer?</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Necromancers&amp;message.id=9836#M9836</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Ok I just turned 18th level in Kurns Tower, now it seems the ONLY place that people put down on where to go to next is PC, do I have anyother options? I&amp;nbsp;have the Platinum Edition and it only has 7 of the 12 expansions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I tried to go to Highpass but that was a disaster and I couldnt get one person to join me to go there.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I saw that Unrest is a Hot Spot, can my 18th level necromancer go there or should he gain a few levels?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;It seems to me that almost every class follows the same progression on leveling, I dont know many zones, only about 5. But different perspectives would be nice.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Would buying the Titanium Edition make it easier for me to find other zones to level in.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;It just seems strange that I am 18th level and never been in a Human city yet am about to goto the Moon to hunt.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <title>Request: Harmshield AA</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Necromancers&amp;message.id=9831#M9831</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Harmshield as an AA would be a big help to raiding Necros. Necros have the ability to save raids with their Feign Death AA. Unfortunately this often leaves the necro in a spot near mobs that will agro when they stand up. The instant invis AA works much of the time when a Necro is soloing or grouping to get away from mobs after being FD. Most raid targets have a lot of see invis mobs around so it does not work in that situation. Harmshiled would allow a Necro to possibly get to a safe spot before feigning again but most of us don't have that spell memmed most of the time. Harmshield as an expansion AA would solve the problem. This would allow a feigned Necro to stand up, click the Harmshield AA and then train away the mobs and/or get to a safe spot to feign again. It would not be overpowering since we already have this ability as a spell currently. It would just make it more accessible. A one hour reuse timer would be about right (presuming your raid does not wipe more often than that).&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;Well, it's been months and still no answers:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;Where are our promised pet illusions?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Has&amp;nbsp;the VSM stacking issue&amp;nbsp; been addressed?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Is anything being done to fix the efficiency problems with our spells, the lack of mana regen from our lich?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Why are our lich upgrades stagnating so much at a time our spells cost unprecidented amounts of mana?&amp;nbsp; As you can see below, we haven't had a meaningful Lich upgrade since GoD was released.&amp;nbsp; There wasn't even a lich upgrade for DoDH, even though our mana cost went through the roof in that expansion.&amp;nbsp; Expansions in which increases to mana regen outpaced increases to spell cost are highlighted green.&amp;nbsp; The others are red.&amp;nbsp; In my opinion, our conversion needs to be closer to 120 mana per tick.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

I know I could always solo some giants in SRO/Commons but those are mostly roamers, and it would be hard without track. Any advice?&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Try again Necro Bard Combo?</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Necromancers&amp;message.id=9786#M9786</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Ok New Necro here. How about a Necro Bard Box? Have all no fizzle AA's. Thinking Auto Follow then Selo's, HP/Mana regen, Spell Damage Modifier. Would the increase in Power be worth splitting the Experience with Bard. Necro would obviously benefit but at the lose of some EXP per Hour. How else could this combo be used ? Sounds like fun I am gonna try it. Anyone else have any experience with Bard partner or Boxxing this duo?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Thanks in advance.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <title>Damage Per Mana from PoR to TSS</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Necromancers&amp;message.id=9770#M9770</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;We got some new DPS spells in TSS, which was nice since we didn't get any in PoR.&amp;nbsp; And yes, some of the TSS DoTs even belong in the top 8 spell gems for DPS, though sadly a few others are worthless low dps or dpm spells.&amp;nbsp; Many necros have notived that they cannot cast for as long as they used to be able to, and complained, running oom on fights you didn't used to run oom on, because you are using TSS spells.&amp;nbsp; Well, it's apparent why, even with no foci at all our TSS spells have worse mana efficiency in the top 8 slots than prior expansion.&amp;nbsp; Add foci into the mix and the gap only widens.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have a 17% increase in total damage for a 26% increase in mana costs which means efficiency went to hell, or for a nearly 7% loss.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;DoT duration in the top 8 went from an average 6.25 ticks down to 5.75 ticks. That means that we will have to cast more frequently on average, which additionally costs us more mana for the damage we are doing.&amp;nbsp; Add on top of that the fact that many necros had decent foci before tss, and lack it for tss spells, in addition to the loss of Affliction Efficiency (non raiders could have 25% mana pres to level 70 for DoTs), and you have quickly depleting mana pools.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anywyas here's a comparison of Total Damage and DPM before any foci between our top 8 DoTs from PoR to TSS:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="http://img340.imageshack.us/img340/1852/tssdpmrk2ru4.jpg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fang of Death is left out of the PoR lineup due to it having a horrid dpm. Some necros may have used it regularly in their lineup pre-tss, but frankly I'd hope they were the minority. If you include Fang of Death we still have efficiency loss to TSS, but it's not quite as pronounced.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What to do?&lt;br&gt;1) Lower mana costs of TSS spells&lt;br&gt;2) Increase durations of TSS spells&lt;br&gt;3) Increase damage of TSS spells&lt;br&gt;4) Increase FT on Otherside by a decent amount&lt;br&gt;5) Any combination of the above 4&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Mana Regeneration in the Post-TSS Era: A Case Study</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Necromancers&amp;message.id=9768#M9768</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;Mana Regeneration in the Post-TSS Era: A Case Study&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Since the dawn of time, the necromancers have paid for their vastly superior mana regeneration with increased inefficiencies and reduced burst DPS. This tradeoff was generally regarded as fair and balanced by most. Wizards burst well, and necromancers used large mana regeneration to sustain well. Sustainability and burst power were juxtaposed, represented as the opposite ends of a continuum, if you will.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;Today, the situation is thus:&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;U&gt;Wizard:&lt;/U&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Patient Harvest: 5800 mana every&amp;nbsp;6 minutes. This is&amp;nbsp;97 mana per tick for Rank 3. (Rank 2: 5625/70 = 80, Rank 1: 67)&lt;BR&gt;Familiar: 10 mana per tick.&lt;BR&gt;Scales of the Crystalwing (Rk III): 6 mana per tick (Rank 2: 5, Rank 1: 4)&lt;BR&gt;C. Pot (Type X): 14 mana per tick.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Total: 127 mana per tick, discounting meditation and non-class buffs, using all readily available self-cast buffs/potions.&lt;BR&gt;(Rank 2: 109, Rank 1: 95)&lt;BR&gt;Discounting potions:&lt;BR&gt;(Rank 3: 113, Rank 2: 95, Rank 1: 81)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;U&gt;Necromancer:&lt;/U&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Otherside: 85 mana per tick (Rank 2: 81, Rank 1: 78)&lt;BR&gt;Wraithskin: 4 mana per tick (Does not vary by rank)&lt;BR&gt;Total: 89 mana per tick, discounting meditation and external buffs, using all readily available self-cast buffs/potions.&lt;BR&gt;(Rank 2: 85. Rank 1: 82)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Please note: Clarity potions do NOT stack with Lich, and are thus 100% useless to necromancers.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As the above figures indicate, necromancers are now expected to be inferior to wizards across the board in terms of mana regeneration, while still paying the increased costs for their spells on every spell and generating reduced burst DPS as the tradeoff for sustainable DOT. In other words, we pay more on a spell-by-spell basis, to do less immediate damage. Due to the duration-based nature of our spells, it is typically more difficult (often impossible) to "dip" into OOC regen than for a similarly employed wizard, who can simply remain seated for the first half of combat to use up their combat-rest timer, and use superior burst DPS to "catch-up" after having sampled a couple of ticks of OOC.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;U&gt;Something is very, very askew here.&lt;/U&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;U&gt;Hypothesis:&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Otherside and Wraithskin need to have their mana regeneration components VASTLY increased, simply&amp;nbsp;to maintain the basic parity between in-combat regeneration rates. This basic analysis does not factor in any consideration about necromancer spell efficiency&amp;nbsp;being balanced around&amp;nbsp;superior mana regeneration spells (ie: Lich) that are not in evidence any longer.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Please note: I am not suggesting in any way that wizards are "above their station" or "overpowered". I am not suggesting any reduction in wizard ability, nor do I think such a thing is appropriate. I do, however, think that the natural order of the game has been altered (Inverted!) and needs to be set back into balance in this particular, by restoring necromancers to the apex of in-combat mana regen they have traditionally demonstrated.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I welcome discussion of this situtation, but I must request that we keep our discussion civil. If you have something constructive to add (like analysis of mana regeneration for other classes) you should feel free to do so. If you're only going to flame, save your breath for cooling your porridge, as I've donned Seasons for this encounter.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;ok first a warning. ill be comparing the necromancer class to other classes, while this is usally a bad way to describ why there is a problem with YOUR class because they are different i bleive it is relavent here. also befor i get flamed by the comments im going to make in no way am i wanting to have other classes nerf'd. i think they are perfectly fine where they are the necro class just needs a boost.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;5625 / 70 = 80.35 mana per tick for Rank II Patient Harvest&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;5400 / 80 = 67.5 mana per tick for Rank I Patient Harvest&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;these are the 2 wizards harvest spell from rank l to ll they receive a 19% boost&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Otherside rank ll: 81 mana per tick&lt;br&gt;Otherside rank l: 78 mana per tick&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;the 2 necro lich spell we receive a tiny boost 4%&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;not only that but thier familiar gives them another 10 mana per tick and thier rune give 4/5/6 for rank l/ll/ll&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;necro's only get one more regen spell thier rune which has always been identical to wizards but now only gives 4/4/4 ft for rank l/ll/lll&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;so at rank 2 everything this puts wizards at 95 mana per tick and necro's at 85&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;from the past necro have always had supiror mana regen and now with the OOC regen system and necro never being able to dip into it during a group this needs to be VASTLY upgraded&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;the second issuse is the necromancer lifetap....this is one of the key defining abilities a necromancer has&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dink of Decomposition SHD/73 1: Decrease Hitpoints by 1161&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Drink of Decomposition Rk. II SHD/73 1: Decrease Hitpoints by 1207&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Drain Life NEC/71 1: Decrease Hitpoints by 1505&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Drain Life Rk. II NEC/71 1: Decrease Hitpoints by 1565&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;so this means the necro lifetap is 30% ahead of the shadowknights&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;a comparison&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/spell.html?spell=5338" target="_blank"&gt;Touch of the Devourer&lt;/a&gt;SHD/70&lt;b&gt;1:&lt;/b&gt; Decrease Hitpoints by 740&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/spell.html?spell=5419" target="_blank"&gt;Soulspike&lt;/a&gt;NEC/67&lt;b&gt;1:&lt;/b&gt; Decrease Hitpoints by 1204&lt;br&gt;thats about a 65% difference please return it to how it used to be and increase the necro lifetap to around a 1900 point lifetap&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Ever since TSS has come out, and I have switched to the higher end spells I have been having HUGE mana problems.&amp;nbsp; I can't keep all our spells up as long, hell my guild is on our 5th or 6th vish kill and even during that high i'm having to take med breaks while waiting on us to kill the mana mobs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I would like to think i'm **SMURF** near as well geared as possible for where my guild is in progression, the only items i have that are not CoA+ are not foci items that have anything to do with my DPS or DPM.&amp;nbsp; The problem is two fold.&amp;nbsp; Our dots efficiency has gone down the tubes, and lich just has not scaled in relation to our weaking DPM and rising modded (specialization checked, and mana pres foci) spell costs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Has a dev looked into this at all?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Are other necro's running into these problems as badly as i hear we are?&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by putlamenamehere on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;11-22-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;09:51 AM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

      <title>Looking ahead..(weekly question topics over the nest 3 weeks)</title>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If things stay as they appear to be atm. The next topics for our weekly questions are(in order)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Week of the 21st-&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Vakk'dra's sickly mists and stacking issues.&lt;/b&gt; I'm plan to ask for the EE generation component to be removed so it so different ranks stack(I don't know of a single EE being generated with this spell anyway). Then request that it's damage be increased significantly to justify the mana cost(basically mimic'ing chaos venom's efficiency).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Week of the 28th-&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Overall dpm and lack of efficiency.&lt;/b&gt; I plan to cite dpm across multiple expansions of similar lines(fire, magic, disease and poison(pending the vakk'dra question reaction)..ask for ashengate pyre to be extended by two ticks(to be a true pyre of mori upgrade, this will add to the total dmg of the spell and make the dot efficient enough to use more often since we'll refresh it less often). The goal of this topic is to get us to a point where we can stack our dots for the duration of fights in all levels of content(anywhere there's an appropriate force(size and ability) for the content they're in).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Week of December 4th-&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Instant fd and Imitate death.&lt;/b&gt; I really don't see this happening until next expansion, but that doesn't mean it's not a good idea to ask for this now. If they say no on imitate death, I'd like to try to get them to reduce the 2 minutes it takes us to lose agro, down to somewhere around 30 seconds, so we can get back into OOCR quicker. We'll still be 30seconds behind everyone else(when feigned and pulling or something)but, I think that's an acceptable alternative to me saying "ok..thanks =(" and walking away with nothing for you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What's actually being requested:&lt;br&gt;Deathpeace to be instant and hold the two minute agro clearing time. Imitate death, clears agro instantly and is also instant cast. ID will be requested as an AA. I'm not sure on the refresh on this..I'll look that up as time for this question gets closer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;If you think priority should be different tell me quickly(especially if it's flipping the order of the first 2). If not, that's the order that I think you'd like the issues addressed in&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Week of november 13th - question</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Necromancers&amp;message.id=9732#M9732</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Week of november 13th.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Necromancer question-&lt;br&gt;Otherside(TSS lich) is not scaling as previous spells of that line have with our mana expenditure. This is leaving necromancers to run OOM on long fights, an area where previously we have shined. Could you review and then raise the mana return(either by increasing efficiency or keeping the same ratio and increasing the magnitude) for this spell? Also, it's come to the attention of numerous necromancers throughout the community that while we pay a price for our mana regen, we are no longer regening more mana per tick, then our buffed counterparts. They'd like to know why we are paying a penalty for inferior passive mana regeneration, when the other class has no such penalty?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Additionally, the lower level spells of the lich line, are now lower mana regen the clarity spells of corresponding levels. Again, we pay the penalty and there seems to be no reason to. Previously the lich spells were better mana regen then any buff of the same level, with the increase lower level clarity lines recieved, necromancers have fallen behind in that reguard as well.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
