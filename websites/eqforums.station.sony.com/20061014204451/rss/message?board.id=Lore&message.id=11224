&lt;CENTER&gt;&lt;B&gt;Ardathium Vol. I-VI&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/CENTER&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;These brief details are conclusions drawn by me in my brief encounter with the ruins of this lost citadel. I cannot claim any word of this to be absolute truth, for the information I had available was vague, if not cryptic through the impenetrable veil of ignorance and time that shadowed my vision. Throughout the whole of Norrath's libraries and scholars, I was not able to find a single shred of evidence or legend relating to this place. Eerily, it was as if it had never existed, that the memory of Norrath itself had torn Ardathium from its mind.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Ardathium - that is the name of the place I shall detail as best I can in these pages.&lt;STRONG&gt; &lt;/STRONG&gt;A glorious citadel constructed by the first followers of Mithaniel Marr in what is now known as the Southern Desert of Ro. I know for certain that this place exists, or existed, though in unfortunate, irreparable ruin beneath the unforgiving sands of the desert. I have been there, and I have seen it. I cannot tell you where or how to enter this place, for I was forced to leave prematurely during my investigation of the site. An earthquake forced me to escape, or be buried alive with the city's forgotten dead. Unfortunately, the earth swallowed the city further into its belly, the topmost portion of Ardathium's tower was buried deep beneath the sands once more. I cannot say when or if the city will rise again through the will and labor of united men and it would be the wasted energies of a fool to hope for as much within our lifetimes.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In the two and a half days that I was alloted the opportunity to explore the standing portions of this place, I learned so little and yet, so much. A great library had once been housed within the walls of the white and golden city of Truth. Though most of the tomes have dissolved into dust in the cruel clutches of time, I was fortunate to find a few legible documents, preserved by the desert's heat. The script was ancient, but I recognized bits and pieces of the runic tongue of old. This story is one that I have concluded to be a possible fate of Sir Grenic Drere, the hero of our tale, and the fate of the city of Ardathium.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;CENTER&gt;--------------------------------------------&lt;/CENTER&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In the first years to crown the Monument Age, the Fortress of Ardathium was erected in the northernmost fields outside the Elddar Forest. Established by the half elven paladin, Countess Viannay, Ardathium would be the first of the great monuments established in the name of Mithaniel Marr throughout all of Norrathian history. Dedicated solely to the crusades of The Truthbringer in the name of valor, honor, and truth, Ardathium was one of Norrath's most beautiful, though tragically short-lived treasures.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Constructed of pure alabaster stone and crowned in statues and tower caps of solid gold, Ardathium was a sight to behold. Its white and blue banners rose high toward the heavens and the brilliant glinting of sunlight off of its tower's golden caps could be seen for miles above the lush, green canopy of the Elddar Forest to the south.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The Che Virtuson was established shortly thereafter - an elite force of zealous knights and priests dedicated to The Truthbringer and his divine word. A small commune of faithful peasants dwelled within the outer sanctum of the fortress' temple, though the fortress was primarily governed as a war-front against the dark evils that lurked in the eastern swamps of Innothule and the Feerrott. Countess Viannay appointed three Viscounts to her aid, dubbing each of them a General of the Che Virtuson and second in command to only her dominion over Ardathium.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Grenic Drere, a human paladin of Marr who had led several knights and faithful pilgrims to Viannay's aid during the first battles with the troll armies of the east, was among those appointed to lead at her side.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Ardathium would launch several campaigns against the massive trollish armies that dwelled in the swamps of Innothule to the east. Countess Viannay's fervent regard of the amphibious race as a poisonous plague upon the face of Norrath and her military prowess in conjunction with her unchallenged zealous faith in The Truthbringer would lead the Che Virtuson to several victories over their enemies -- all the in the name of Mithaniel Marr.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Unfortunately, Countess Viannay would not live to see the end of her life's work and her death would be the first step toward the glorious fortress' demise several generations later.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;CENTER&gt;--------------------------------------------&lt;/CENTER&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;During one of the greatest battles that Ardathium had mounted against the trolls of Innothule, Countess Viannay fell terminally ill to a foul curse placed upon her by one of the powerful troll shamans, Tjarduugh. Unable to lead her armies and confined to her bed chambers, Countess Viannay handed the reins of her armies to the Viscounts while the high priests struggled to counter the curse. After a mere fortnight of battle, Grenic Drere was the only remaining general of the Che Virtuson and the war had seemed to turn to an inevitable defeat within the clutches of the infectious shadow. His desire to avenge the Countess was overwhelming and upon the final moments of her life, Grenic vowed to fulfill Viannay's life's work.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The Countess' body was to be preserved through the magic of the priests and laid to rest in the grand mausoleum that housed all of Ardathium's heroes in the highest tower of the fortress. In the largest chamber of the tower mausoleum, Countess Viannay's body was placed upon a raised platform of alabaster and gold. She was dressed in ceremonial garb of silk and chain-linked armor and held beneath her hands, folded over her breast, was the hilt of her holy blade. Her body was covered with Soraviene's Veil - an artifact that would kill any creature whose faith was not solely bound to honor and virtue that dared to touch it.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;With the Countess laid to rest, Grenic ascended to hold the title of count over all of Ardathium. His vow to his mistress would become the consuming goal that gave meaning to his life. Two massive campaigns would be launched beneath Grenic's command against the trolls.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The loss of their Countess had fuelled a passion that acted as an impenetrable shield upon all souls of the Che Virtuson, and they were victorious. The troll warlord, a shadowknight known as Kzurott, and his forces were pushed out of the plains upon the first campaign, and the second would lead to the knight's demise. However, this victory would seem hollow, for Tjarduugh, the high shaman that had ended the life of their beloved Countess, remained and much of the troll army stood.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;CENTER&gt;--------------------------------------------&lt;/CENTER&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;No doubt fell upon Grenic's mind that Tjarduugh would launch an attack that would more than likely cripple Ardathium, if not destroy it. His men were weary and few amidst their immeasurable bravery and honor. The attack could not occur if Ardathium were to survive, and above all things, Grenic's vow to Viannay was held in the foremost of all his considerations.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;He ordered the pilgrims to leave Ardathium for their own safety, vowing to them that they would hear word when and if it was safe for them to return. The Che Virtuson were then organized and prepared to act as mediators of defense, for to launch an offensive with such an army of a mere five hundred soldiers and priests would be suicide and inevitably guarantee Ardathium's downfall.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Grenic sent a message with the pilgrims, who had to travel through the Elddar forest to reach safety as he had instructed them to do so. A small band of the migrating pilgrims stopped at one of the elven outposts on the eastern border of the forest.&lt;STRONG&gt; There, they left Grenic's message, which would reach Elwyean in the halls of Takish'Hiz. The great Koada'Dal wizard was quick to follow Grenic's request for his guidance and wisdom, for this several thousand year-old elf was the grand-sire of Viannay and had given his blessing for Ardathium's construction outside of the sacred forest.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The news was nothing new to Elwyean, for Ardathium's impending doom had not escaped the keen eyes of the elves. Elwyean advised Grenic that the destruction of the swamp would diminish much of the troll's forces and would leave them in scattered chaos. Grenic was hesitant, though he did not take Elwyean's advice lightly, for an elf's pledge to destroy a natural niche was not something uttered in every lifetime. The elves of the Elddar believed that the swamp was corrupt - that the trolls' darkness had seeped into every fiber of the land and that even the trolls' destruction would not uproot the whole of the evil that had infected the region. The wizard informed Grenic that the swamp would inevitably be destroyed by the elves, but it was up to Grenic to decide whether or not this act would be one in favor of his city's continued existance, or one executed after Ardathium's fall.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;CENTER&gt;--------------------------------------------&lt;/CENTER&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;After much consideration and prayer, Grenic conceded to Elwyean's advice and asked for his aid, for the swamplands were immune to fired kindled by human hands. The ancient, stoic elf understood and advised further that Grenic station his troops for defensive purposes, and to destroy the trolls that dared to flee toward the forest's borders. Hesitantly, Grenic agreed, knowing that the act would undoubtedly leave a mark on his soul for judgment in the hereafter. However, his heart and convictions were steely upon his promise to the late Countess and the protectino of the great city and everything it stood for.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Elwyean briefly returned to his people to inform them of the coming destruction of the swamp. The elves were on guard for any trolls that penetrated Grenic's forces, though none left the Elddar to directly aid the human citadel. Elwyean's return was heralded in a massive azure, gold, and red maelstrom of arcane fires that erupted across the swamplands. The magical fire could be seen for miles beyond the forest and its glittering flames raged on for days. Grenic's forces destroyed hundreds of troll warriors and civilians that fled for their lives.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;After twelve long days, the swamp of Innothule had been obliterated - the waters evaporated by the searing heat of the blaze and even the most robust of foliage reduced to pillars of ash. Elwyean never again returned to Ardathium or consorted with Grenic after the battle. Grenic's fortress was safe, though the cost of this victory would weigh heavily upon the knight's conscience and soul for the next several decades.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Summons were sent back to the pilgrims that had previously been sent away. Most returned, though a few opted to remain in the new settlements that had begun to establish upon the eastern coast of the continent. All were welcome back, though Grenic denied a celebration in the wake of a time of mourning for what had been done.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;CENTER&gt;--------------------------------------------&lt;/CENTER&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Years would pass and Grenic would see the prosperity of his city rise up from the ashes of its former turmoil. His remorse and shame would lift their scars from his soul and his thoughts would change to that of humble acceptance. Grenic revered what he had done as a necessity, for if he had not given into a tactic that would otherwise be dishonorable, all that he saw before him - the peace and happiness of his people, the people of Marr - would have fallen to damnation and ruin.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The next several decades would bring prosperity and peace to the people of Ardathium. Grenic would produce a son and daughter, Erolysia and Mitharius, twin children who would be named after the patron deity and his respected sister that the fortress had been founded for. Upon Grenic's death, Mitharius, a knighted warrior in the Che Virtuson, would ascend to Count of Ardathium. The great leader's body would be taken to the highest tower in the city and in the great chamber of Ardathium's Heroes, Grenic's body would be laid to final rest beside his comrades.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Ardathium would experience nearly a century of prosperity and peace beneath the leadership of Grenic's bloodline, though a great earthquake and the burning of the Elddar forest would leave the once-white and golden jewel of Mithaniel's legacy upon Norrath in irreparable ruins that would, in the passing eras, be consumed by the desert sands of Ro. The memory of this great city would be lost as the ages passed and turmoil wrought the minds of the modern cultures.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I hope that these words can give resurrection to the memory of this glorious place - that the descendants of its survivors and the scholars of Marr will come forward and restore the proper glory and respect to the memory of a might, though compromised knight's achievements and the history of Marr's first successful mortal campaign. &#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;If this is during the time the Elddar Forest was still standing, how can Elwyean be called/considered a Koada'Dal? There were no distinct races of Elves at this time other than Elddar.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I was curious about this as well - especially since in Western Wastes, there is a Koada'Dal who existed since the time of Elddar.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;perhaps the koada dal were a sect or a tribe simliar&amp;nbsp; to how the kylong would relate to the iksar. Koada Dal&amp;nbsp; and the fier dal may have been the prominent sects. or the sects that initially left the eddlar forest</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;It's possible that Koada'Dal could've been the ruling class of elves, and that's why they moved into more opal palaces and the like, while the Fier'Dal were the commoners and created Kelethin.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;It would make more sense if Koada'Dal and Fier'Dal are in fact classes rather than races, per se. Interesting at any rate since I have not seen reference to this outside of this one and apparently the one Eze has seen.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;heres a little tidbit indicative o f the takish hiz attitudes . I believe thekoada dal and the fier dal were seperate orders of&amp;nbsp; Tunare religion. I dont know if the titels had anything to do with&amp;nbsp; status but more of philosphy. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Wegadas' elven companions were entranced with the dank, gloomy treasure they had found. They were lured by the gentle song of the forests' spirit, a song that any elf's spirit would easily hear, and bewitched by the purity and strength of the uncorrupted and untouched spiritual life and strength of the wood. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;After a day of intense scouting and brief interaction with the peaceful human tribe, the elves reunited with their brother and spoke of their need to have this forest for the Takish'Hiz Empire. Wegadas spoke out against his fellow elves, he did not wish to drive the humans from their home, for they live with it in a way parallel to the elves' own cultural ways. He felt that the humans could be brought to the ways of the elves and the forest could, with the aid of the Elven Empire, thrive onits own and remain pure, emerald jewel of wilderness that they stood within. There was no need to reave this home from the tribe, for they lived only in harmony with the wild and balance of nature. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The superior in the group, a wanderer by the name of Kuvriathan, objected to Wegadas argument and sent him back to Takish'Hiz with instructions to report their discovery. The druid departed his party's side obediantly, but did not leave the forest boundaries. The elves then tried to herd the humans out of this forest in attempt to cleanse it of the tribal presence and the taint they believed the humans would inevitably bring - for these elves had seen the fledgling foundation of the eastern costal cities and knew the destruction this race was capable of on a whim. The wary Gihjna and Lujien immediate interfered, having watched the elves since their arrival. Unsuspecting of the fierce and powerful guardians of the woodland, the elves were taken unaware. All but one of the elven party were destroyed - Wegadas. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Yes, Torn, that is one of my absolute favorites stories in all of EQ. I had forgotten about this part too:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;It was in those first years that Wegadas' intrigue with the humans grew to tightly woven kinship. Slowly, he released his grip on his elven life and embraced the feldgling existence and culture that he was instrumental in fathering. The elven druid was Fier'Dal no more, his brethren were no longer human - they were all children of the wild and it was then that Wegadas learned a true peace. &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;This would, in fact, support your theory and I agree with it. Since Wegadas did not seem to physically change from being Woodelf,&amp;nbsp; his no longer being Fier'Dal would seem to imply that it was a form of class or philosophy. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Over the first years, Wegadas taught the human tribe the ways of the wildnerness - he spoke to them of Tunare, The Mother Of All; the great goddess of growth and nature. He taught them how to pay their respects to his own goddess without prayer or sacrifice - only that they must respect the power of the natural world, for as it had given them life; it can just as easily and without warning take it from them. This is a law that should be neither feared nor hated but one that is given the respect of an inevitable reality and one that cannot be altered by steel or mind. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The humans clung to Wegadas' liberal preaching and lessons, embracing the matron goddess of growth as their own. Soon thereafter, the humans would learn the ways of the druid - adapting and wielding the magics that Wegadas taught them, and that they taught themselves at an exceptional rate. Rangers would be the first of the master adepts, however, for the magic within them was less than their druid compatriots and the ferocity of the wild had already been established in their ways. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Here we have human followers of Tunare. I really do wish they would flesh out this story and open the zone. I found particular relevance in:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;When the Lujien came for him, he presented himself unarmed and willingly, despite the human pleas for him to go and not incur the wrath of the guardians that had allowed them haven in the woods. The Lujien halted their advancement when they saw the plight of their accepted human guests to spare the elf's life. It was their pack leader, an elder Lujien warrior known to the human tribe as Udos-Ehai Digowa (&lt;STRONG&gt;Fang of the Shadow in the common tongue&lt;/STRONG&gt;),that approached Wegadas and sunk his great maw into the elf's shoulder, but did not kill him. The Lujien spoke in voiceless words to the elf, a conversation that would later be written in the Writ of the Wild, a sacred text that dictates the history and code of the Unkempt Warders. &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Very much makes me think of the Fang of the Longshadow in DoDH. :smileywink:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;This all raises a few more questions in my mind. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Wegadas accepted the humans' hospitality and despite the language barrier separating them, Wegadas quickly learned that these humans lived in harmony with the forest, and likely had for some time. Their intense geographical knowledge of the region was precise and what little bit Wegadas had to observe, he took note of the harmony in which the humans shared with their habitat. &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;He was reminded much of the primordial elves - in the times before Takish'Hiz and the establishment of the great empire his people had come to be. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;What were these primoridal elves like? &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;When the Lujien came for him, he presented himself unarmed and willingly, despite the human pleas for him to go and not incur the wrath of the guardians that had allowed them haven in the woods. The Lujien halted their advancement when they saw the plight of their accepted human guests to spare the elf's life. &lt;STRONG&gt;It was their pack leader, an elder Lujien warrior known to the human tribe as Udos-Ehai Digowa (Fang of the Shadow in the common tongue),that approached Wegadas and sunk his great maw into the elf's shoulder, but did not kill him. &lt;/STRONG&gt;The Lujien spoke in voiceless words to the elf, a conversation that would later be written in the Writ of the Wild, a sacred text that dictates the history and code of the Unkempt Warders&lt;/EM&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;It would seem that Wegadas may have become something more than elf in that act. Almost like lycanthropy. Given we have werewolves in Qeynos, Roley Defarge chasing what he thought was a lycanthrope through Jaggedpine Forest and Jaggedpine Forest's close proximity to Unkempt Woods, wolf-like creatures in Unkempt Woods.....would it possibly be the source of the lycanthropes in Darkhollow? &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;When human settlers dedicated to the ways of Karana established themselves in the Jaggedpine forest and began to explore the surrounding areas, the unkempt were revealed to the rest of Norrath in flurry of brutal attacks upon any whom entered their territory.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Oria39 on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;06-01-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;08:10 PM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Wasn't the origin of werebeasts in Norrath already documented elsewhere?&amp;nbsp; May have been EQOA lore or something, but I distinctly remember the lore having something to do with the Unkempt Woods/Jaggedpine Forest.&amp;nbsp; I'll see if I can find what I'm thinking of.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;Yep, lycanthropes are indeed the result of interaction between the guardian races of the Unkempt Wood and Wegadas.&amp;nbsp; Also some other interesting, if perhaps inapplicable to EQLive, lore in that article, including a reference to a god never mentioned elsewhere and one of the few references to the Ratonga outside of EQ2.&amp;nbsp; It's a pity EQOA kinda fizzled out, whoever works on the lore for that game is pretty&amp;nbsp;smurfing&amp;nbsp;good, in my view.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;These creatures are spirits&amp;nbsp; not like the werewolves found in the karans who do come from darkhollow&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I would venture th primordial elves&amp;nbsp; were similiar to sprites where they roamed the forest with the sle purpose of protecting the forest. &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Gonna address a few things here, that I think I've posted elsewhere on this forum too.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The elves were created by Tunare and came to be known as Elddar elves for the forest in which they lived.&amp;nbsp; When they later fled Tunaria for greener pastures, primarly&amp;nbsp;Faydwer, the eventually evolved.&amp;nbsp; Someone mentioned that the Koada`Dal and Feir`Dal were more like classes, and I suppose you could look at it that way.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The nature-bound elves spent most of the time in the forests, etc. like the druids, rangers, and so on.&amp;nbsp;The&amp;nbsp;other elves, the politicians, paladins, clerics, and&amp;nbsp;those most tied to structure, tended to&amp;nbsp;congregate&amp;nbsp;indoors, for lack of a better description.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;You can consider that an evolution took place.&amp;nbsp; There would certainly have been remaining&amp;nbsp;Elddar while the Koada`Dal and Feir`Dal began to change and identify themselves differently.&amp;nbsp; Their bodies adapted to their environments, etc.&amp;nbsp; Then, eventually, the Elddar&amp;nbsp;as a race of elf vanished.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;As for the werewolves, their origins are described in the Depths of Darkhollow manual.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P align=left&gt;light of the moon. It was only a matter of days&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;before they all went through the first transformation.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;This leads me to wonder why it took so long for anyone to further explore Darkhollow? I mean people were killed, surely someone in Qeynos noticed this. Why wasn't anything further ever done for so many years? Why did it take the actions of Lanys in Nektulos Forest to uncover Darkhollow?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;This from the storyline for Darkhollow:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;"Something deep beneath us has been awakened.&amp;nbsp; A great explosion shook our forest and the way was opened to a dark and dismal place, a place called Darkhollow, some have said," Cristanos leaned forward and whispered in the king's ear. "All manner of Norrathian now walks through our forest to investigate this new place and for a short time last eve our lands were overrun with drachnids.&amp;nbsp; In fact, Sergeant L'Nev was the only one of his three troops to return and he may not survive as it stands."&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;King Naythox has memeories of&amp;nbsp; lycanthorpes rising and abducting&amp;nbsp; tier dal.&amp;nbsp; They even gated their water supply. do you think it possible that Neriak decided it wasnt in their best interest to look for darkhollow.. in addition to that Lanys did not uncover darkhollow a magical explosion opened the way. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Yeah yeah yeah, I'm aware that she didn't directly open the way but the explosion caused by her actions did. I didn't realize I needed to be so literal here. Sorry.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;For those that don't want to read the manual themselves for the whole story, here it is:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT face=PostAntiqua-Bold size=1&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;Werewolf Origins&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;FONT face=PostAntiqua-Roman size=1&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;The werewolf has existed in Norrath as long as most other races have, but was&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;found only in Darkhollow for some time. These first feral werewolves, called&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;wurines, credit the Great Wuria with their creation -- the mother of all werewolves.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;She is considered a spirit of the dark wilds and less of a god. She is the provider of&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;the beasts they hunt and feed on and the source of their strengths.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;The werewolves learned to grow and survive in the dark and dangerous underground&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;world around them. They have the gift of intelligence, are motivated and&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;social, but not all equal. They are feral creatures with finely honed instincts and survival skills.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;FONT face=PostAntiqua-Roman size=1&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;For several hundred years, no one on the surface&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;of Norrath had ever seen a werewolf. It&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;wasn't until an expedition of Qeynosian miners&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;breached the barrier of Darkhollow that the first&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;werewolf was seen and the first human bitten.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;The werewolves attacked the foreign expedition&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;party and killed all but three who suffered nearlethal&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;bites -- Patrim Gallowtrow, Brendin&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;Fardon, and Wendal Meen were their names.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;They manage to survive the bites and flee to&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;the surface to later become the kinsfolk of the&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;werewolves of Darkhollow, the half-human,&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;half-werewolf breed that transformed under the&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;light of the moon. It was only a matter of days&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;before they all went through the first transformation.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=PostAntiqua-Roman size=1&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;This new breed of werewolf became known as the Clan of the White Fangs. They&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;considered themselves closest in blood to a true werewolf through the father's bloodlines.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;It was Patrim Gallowtrow who bit Sentry Alchin, the friend of Sentry&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;Joanna in Rathe Mountains, who became one of the White Fangs. The White&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;Fangs were arrogant, aristocratic, and were somewhat consumed with their power&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;and gifts.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;Later, the generations of White Fangs in Norrath became muddied with mixed&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;blood of the various races of Norrath as they mated in human form. This third&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;breed or tribe of werewolf became known as the Dusk Leapers -- the mutts of the&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;werewolves. They lived on the fringes of civilization and often plotted against it to&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;rule over it and their cousins, the White Fangs.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;Meanwhile, among the wurines down below, social conflicts that have lasted thousands&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;of years continue unresolved.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;FONT face=PostAntiqua-Roman size=1&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;As with any intelligent creature with a measure of individuality and the capacity for&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;ideas, the werewolves do not always agree or follow the same path.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;(Next is two long paragraphs describing the Shadowmanes and Ragepaws which are not relevant to this subject so I'm not posting them.)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;FONT face=PostAntiqua-Bold size=1&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;The Norrathian Perspective on Werewolves&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=PostAntiqua-Roman size=1&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;When the first werewolves that were created by wurine-bitten humans began to&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;walk the lands of Norrath, new conflicts arose. By day, the werewolf could comfortably&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;walk among humans in human form. At night, they could transform into&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;a fearsome creature, half-human, half-wolf, with an unnatural destructive rage and&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;strength. They prowled the wilds and hunted, killing anything in their path. These&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;werewolves roamed the wilds of the Karanas, the Faydarks, or wherever they felt&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;free.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=PostAntiqua-Roman size=1&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;A few Norrathians, touched by the terror of werewolves, chose to band together to&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;thwart the danger and protect their families. They call themselves the Fangbreakers,&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;a relatively quiet society that spans several generations and reaches far across the&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;lands of Norrath. The Fangbreakers recognize each other quietly and trust very few.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;For centuries they have protected their organization from being infiltrated by werewolves&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;posing as concerned citizens and they prefer to keep it that way.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;Nul Aleswiller has been the leader of the Fangbreakers for 500 years. They were&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;originally employed by the people of the Plains of the Karanas to protect the farms&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;and lands from the threat of werewolf attacks.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;FONT face=PostAntiqua-Roman size=1&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;Bunu Stoutheart, Fixxin Followig, and Cory Bumbleye can be considered the coleaders&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;of the Fangbreakers, having also lived in the Karanas for hundreds of years,&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;keeping the werewolves at bay.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;And therein lies my question. Since miners from Qeynos broke through to Darkhollow, found werewolves, were all killed but a few which were bitten and turned into werewolves, why was there never any further exploration done in Darkhollow? Surely the families of those miners killed noticed they were missing, some investigation done. It just doesn't sound reasonable to me that the citizens of Qeynos said ' Oh, well, these men died. We don't know how or why but we dont' care. Let's just have a memorial service and forget it." I am not even bringing into the discussion whether the Tier'Dal had knowledge of them previous to the explosion caused by the actions of Lanys that opened the way to Darkhollow in Nektulos. What about the Qeynosians?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
