Now granted, my group was mainly doing them for the lore, but it seems odd that after 3 tasks with normal and hard options, these final 2 tasks do not have a (hard) option.<br><br>Secondly, the melee reward aug (wurine sense stone, with improved dodge 3), while much more appealing than the caster aug, was a bit of a disappointment, mostly because it only had a slot 7 option, rather than say, a slot 7/8. Again, it's not anything I particularly need, but I know it's a desireable/hard-to-get mod2 for a lot of people, and the tradeskill ones are rather expensive. Since there is no equivalent "hard" task, it seemed like making this slot 8 might be fair.<br><br>I'm probably barking up the wrong tree to complain about itemization here, but I was mostly curious whether the lack of hard missions was a disrepancy or intentional. I'd heard about it from friends a couple weeks back, but hadn't tested it myself till today.<br><br>(Also very curious if those library doors in Dreadspire are intended to be perma-locked in spite of doing Melion's task/being able to lockpick them, or not...but that's a grumble for another day.)
