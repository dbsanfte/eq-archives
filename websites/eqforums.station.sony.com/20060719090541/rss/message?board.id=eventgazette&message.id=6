    <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="5" color="#ffffff"&gt;EQ Guide of the Month - February 2006&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;The EverQuest Guide Program is a program of volunteers. These volunteers dedicate their own time and energy to enrich the world of Norrath. As a Thank you to them Guides of the month have and will be chosen for their exemplary contributions.  &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt; The tree whisper gently in the Greater Faydark as an energetic Wood elf points to her latest burse. “See that. Don’t believe everything you heard about ducks okay.” She tells a small Gnome taking down notes as quickly as she can. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;img width="200" src="http://eq2players.station.sony.com/images/en/guides/guide_of_the_month/EQ_GoM_0206_sm.jpg" height="192" border="0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="5" color="#ffffff"&gt;Guide Vantique&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;1. Why did you become a Guide?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;I originally became a guide in 2004 so that I could help the players of Everquest.  As a Customer Service Manager for many many years, it seemed natural for me to assist and it always seemed that there were never enough guides to assist in things that the players wished to do.  I wanted to be able to extend myself to assist in things I know I would want to do as a player.  The more I guided, though, the more I loved it, and wished to be more part of enhancing the players experience within the Realm of Norrath. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;2. What games do you guide on? For how long?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;I have guided on EQPC or EQ1 for 1 year, 4 months now, and have loved every day of it!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;3. What is your guide race and class?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;My guide race is a weee short purple wood elf, who has claimed the class of Bard, however all who know me will tell you, I will fumble strings on my instrument and trip over things left out in the zones.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;4. What is your favorite color? &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;My favorite color would have to be green, as it reminds me of the woods, and trees, and lush green grass in which is provided to us, but purple just seemed the be more of a fit for the clumsy one.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;5. What is your favorite land (zone)? Why?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;My favorite zone to be in is Greater Faydark.  Granted, many times you will find me congo'ing in the Plane of Knowledge, however, I truly find myself at home within the tree city of Kelethin.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;6. What has been your best or favorite moment as a Guide?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;WOW!  There have been so many!  If I truly had to pick one moment in time to freeze that I could relive forever, it would be the infamous &amp;quot;Congo&amp;quot; line within the Plane of Knowledge on the Druzzil Ro Server.  There were about 50 people who followed along, shouting their names, and singing weee rhymes as we circled New Tanaan several times.  I remember at one point in time, I had turned around to see the players, and had so many people behind me at the time, I completely froze!  I remember the players going, &amp;quot;Uh, is the dance over?&amp;quot;  As soon as I could gather my senses again, the line continued, louder, and more fun than ever!  &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;7. What is your favorite quest, event, or knowledge circle? What do you do the most of?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;Well, now again, there are so many, but if I had to pick one, it would be the Festival of Love.  The event, the quest, and the whole part of it seems truly uplifting to me, and I get all giddy just thinking about it!  The players enjoy it, the guide team enjoys it, and I have done many a wedding during this festival! &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;8. What has been your worst of least favorite moment as being a Guide?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;To be honest, I have not had a least favorite moment, as all of it has been quite enjoyable for me.  The only thing that maybe disheartening for me, would be watching fellow players and guides leave to join the outside world.  As much as I know it needs them, it is like losing a friend at times, and breaks my heart.  &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;9. As a player have you every run into any Guides and events?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;Back a couple of years ago, I participated in a Rumble event, and enjoyed every minute of it!  Since then, I have been able to participate in fishing tournaments, other Royal Rumbles, and a High dive, or two.  Maybe it was three or four?  *Giggles loudly!*&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;10. What is your favorite thing about this Game?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;My favorite thing about EverQuest is the People.  I love the players, the guides, and those awesome GM's that I have the greatest pleasure with.  From high end raiders, down to the new people who have come in, and are looking for guidance.  From my guild mates, to my guide mates, these people are what keep me alive the most!  I have a very close relationship with many of the players in this game, and they are what keep me here, and keep smiling!  And sometimes, there are those mischievous ones, who keep me tripping! *Cackles loudly then SNORTS!*  &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;11. What do you plan to do in the future as a Guide? Any goals?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;Oh I have lots of goals in mind as far as the guide program.  One of them is possibly continuing my guiding experience within the lands of EverQuest 2, and at some point in time, I would like to assist and serve the program as an Elder Guide. However, until then, being able to pass Senior training to assist and serve not only guides, but players as well, is my biggest goal to attain at the moment. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;I would just like to say, Thank you very much for giving me the honor of being chosen as Guide of The Month.  It truly is an honor!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt; *Vantique the Clumsy One bows, then falls flat over on her face!*&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
