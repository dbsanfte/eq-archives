    <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Lets Rank Em!!!&amp;nbsp; List your top 5 memorable EverQuest Moments...&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;1. While playing my enchanter in a group of 3 with no healer (monk, enchanter and wizard) saving the wizard from death at 1 hit point using a rune spell while the monk regained agro.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;2. Getting my Testament of Vanear with my druid after weeks of being bound in HH and gating there every night after I was done playing and logging back in there every day just to check and see if spawn was camped.&amp;nbsp; I even set my alarm several times to try and be the first one there for the next projected spawn time.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;3. Being able to use my first surname at level 20.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;4. Getting a full set of bronze armor for my high elf paladin.&amp;nbsp; She still wears all of it too, of course she is only level 10, created in November 1999 and has 1 day, 20 hours and 55 minutes played.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;5. The day I was able to play my first froglok!&amp;nbsp; Anyone who knows me or has seen my desk knows I collect frogs, so this was a great day for me. &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Comic Sans MS" color=#ccffff size=4&gt;1.&amp;nbsp; Being so excited when I got my first group port...&amp;nbsp; Then the feeling of let down as I found out it was only in zone group port...&amp;nbsp; Then the feeling of triumph as I saved ppl time and again with it.&amp;nbsp; /succors&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Comic Sans MS" color=#ccffff size=4&gt;2. Getting my Tunarean Signet Ring...&amp;nbsp; long quest, and by the time I completed it, the ring was obselete, so of course I still wear it.&amp;nbsp; /shows her love of Tunare&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Comic Sans MS" color=#ccffff size=4&gt;3. My EQ wedding... and then divorce!&amp;nbsp; :smileytongue: &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Comic Sans MS" color=#ccffff size=4&gt;4. When I first started EQ I&amp;nbsp;&lt;U&gt;really&lt;/U&gt; didn't want a guild, but I remember a ranger &amp;lt;Mikoda&amp;gt; refusing to be refused and getting me a guild invite to my guild, which was then called Majestic Legends.&amp;nbsp; The loyalty I have for my guild: Legends of Veeshan...&amp;nbsp; I have been in LoV from the beginning of the guild, and there I have stayed.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Comic Sans MS" color=#ccffff size=4&gt;5. The day my mom asked me if she could play, now that was a &lt;U&gt;huge&lt;/U&gt; jaw-dropper, because the woman had previously only played Mario!&amp;nbsp; Couple that with the day I found out &lt;U&gt;she out lvled me&lt;/U&gt;!&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Really tough stuff but...&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;1. Finishing my newbie quest armor back when those Pristine Forest Drakling Scales were rare. I still have my newbie armor in the bank.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;2. Reaching lvl 20 for the first time. Finally got my surname Shadowruler. Haven't taken it off since.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;3. Completing my Epic 1.0. That was a great moment for me.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;4. Getting flagged for the Elemental Planes. Finally.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;5. EverQuest Guide Program. Nuff said.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;There are so many more I could think of too. People I've met have been great.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;Hmmm...can I add a new one?&amp;nbsp; How about having the chance to relive the days of old starting EQ from the beginning, with expansions having to be unlocked to go further?&amp;nbsp; I love this idea of the new server !</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;5-&amp;nbsp; Slowly making my way from Qeynos to Freeport without the use of any maps, any advice, and having no clue where to go.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;4-&amp;nbsp; Those good 'ole days in Castle Mistmoore, whether it was hoping Mayong Mistmoore would magically spawn or when a druid friend of mine would pull the maid and butler by attacking and gating back to the begining of the zone, creating one amazing train&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;3-&amp;nbsp; The first time battling Rallos Zek and beating him.&amp;nbsp; I love this raid when it goes smoothly.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;2-&amp;nbsp; That battle hardened shadow knight (level 20 or so) who gave my shadow knight nearly a full set of bronze armor and that one scythe that comes from a quest in Neriak.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;1-&amp;nbsp; Being one of the first monks on ANY server who was human and took the time to work through the Iksar Whistling Fists quest, including the ever frightning journey through Plane of Fear alone, sneaking up on Cazic Thule to turn in the quest pieces.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;1.&amp;nbsp; My brother-in-law and I were out in Butcher Block being bad and kiting the dwarves.&amp;nbsp; I was playing a druid and he was playing an enchanter.&amp;nbsp; He got bored of watching me run around so he jumps up on the next pull and begins to try to out damage me to gain agro.&amp;nbsp; Completely confused I ask him what the heck is he doing and he replies "Just let it hit me!"&amp;nbsp; so I stop and let the dwarf hit him... now what he wanted to happen was for it to hit him and make his pet attack it while he ran away ... what really happened was he was stunned on the first hit and never took another .. I was on the floor laughing so hard that I forgot that the silly dwarf was mad at me too.&lt;br&gt;Loading please wait...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2.&amp;nbsp; Again my brother-in-law and I were grouped with a few other friends one being a new ranger player.&amp;nbsp; My bro was playing his bard this time and were all standing at the bottom of one of the lifts in kelethin. He was playing some buff song and we're chatting about where to adventure when our ranger friend gets bored and decides to shoot a bat.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; He aims.. he fires .. he misses.. the bat but hits the gaurd with no problem.&amp;nbsp; He yells RUN!!!! .. we all jump up dazed and confused while watching a horde of guards come and Rodney Kings his arse.. and just when we think its all over the guards come other and do the same to my brother-in-law ... again on the floor rolling..&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3.&amp;nbsp; Yet again my brother-in-law and I we're playing.&amp;nbsp; I had brought my computer over to his place and was set up across the room from him... Anyway he had just got some new cool spell with his enchanter and wouldnt tell me what it was but he wanted to show me.&amp;nbsp; So I met with him in Fronia Vie right over the bridge close to the gaurds so the mean monsters wouldn't mess with us while he shows me this new cool spell... he starts to cast then runs over to my machine so he can see what it looks like ... Poof he turns into a skeleton and he's like Oh yeah I'm cool.&amp;nbsp; Then out of no where we hear "You have ruined your lands and you will not ruin ours!!!!" My bro's expression turns from happy to panic.. as he watches his enchanter turn into a pile of bones .. heh.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4.&amp;nbsp; Doing my first dragon raid on Naggy.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;5.&amp;nbsp; Doing the last turn in and getting my epic leaf blower. &lt;span&gt;:smileyvery-happy:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I've played off and on for 6 years, my first character was a High Elf Paladin and my first foray into Everquest was running around the zone wall and "discovering" Clan Crushbone.&amp;nbsp; But having to narrow down all those play experiences to 5... well, I had some trouble... here are some favorite times, in no particular order: &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;* Animal charming rhinos to hunt ulthorks in Velious with my druid in his 40's&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;* the many, many hours I spent in Blackburrow (still one of my favorite zones) with all of my characters.&amp;nbsp; I love doing a "canonball" into the pit and swimming out the bottom.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;* The day my enchanter buddy got Gravity Flux and we /dueled and he hit me with it and threw me in the air.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;* My first experience with being "blinded" by an orc prohpet(not sure on mob, it was a *long* time ago) in East Commonlands.&amp;nbsp; I thought my computer had died.&amp;nbsp; I could still hear noises and I saw the lag meter on the screen, but everything else was dark... I couldn't figure it out.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;* Quad kiting Wyverns in Cobalt scar and getting the named Yvolcarn(sp?) who is unsnarable... *Loading, please wait*&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;* Soloing a Ldon with my necro&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;* Playing with poisons with my rogue&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;* Creating a Barbarian with a rl buddy of mine.&amp;nbsp; We made up stupid names that went together...&amp;nbsp;I forget what they were exactly...&amp;nbsp;"Going" and "Toofar" I think...&amp;nbsp;and camping two trees in Everfrost.. remember two trees?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;*Getting to 200 in research and having enough components to make several copies of Funeral Pyre of Kelador and selling them for tons of plat in baz, as it is a hard to get spell.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;*Amazing people who don't know the versatiltiy of a necromancer as I res people.&amp;nbsp; I've played healer (in mid-50's, early 60's in easy Ldons), crowdcontrol (Undead mez, screaming terror) and balls to the wall high dps in group.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;* ah... you get the point.&amp;nbsp; It is rare that I don't enjoy myself when playing EQ.. that's why I've been playing it for so long, despite the frustrations with the game, dynamics, the company, various guilds I've been in and such.&amp;nbsp; It is a great game.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Well, I haven't been playing for long, so my list of memorable moments is from events that are quite recent (and ones that many others&amp;nbsp; have gone through I'm sure) but here they are anyway :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. Finally getting my Shackle of Stone.&amp;nbsp; It took me countless hours, lots of frustration, having to camp several rare mobs, and then spending an hour swimming around Timorous Deep looking for Master Ri...... woops, I won't spoil it!&amp;nbsp; And then The Great Oowomp!&amp;nbsp; That darn ogre right behind him always messed up my tries of getting the last fist, until a very kind enchanter made her way all the way over to where I was to charm the ogres in question.&amp;nbsp; I finally reached the 2nd rung of the Switftails that very night (which was only a few nights ago).&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. Wandering around East Commonlands for one of the armor quests, and seeing this weird thing flying around the zone.&amp;nbsp; It started flying towards me and well... let's just say I don't really remember much of what happened between seeing my first griffon and zoning in to PoK sans all of my items!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3. More wandering for another armor quest in Field of Bone, looking for that blasted troll so I could start the quest, I could not find her for the life of me, so I saw a few islands way up north on the map and decided to look there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Tangrin was not pleased about me trespassing on his island...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4. Wanting to explore, I traveled to the Butcherblock mountains.&amp;nbsp; I saw a guard outpost and thought "Oh good, if a tough mob comes to eat me I can just run here".&amp;nbsp; When I discovered the crazed goblin, I ran there, only to be slaughtered by the guards.&amp;nbsp; That's how I learned the hard way about factions and KOS.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;5. Most of these seem to involve exploring and dying in interesting and hilarious ways, this one is no exception (although I didn't die this time).&amp;nbsp; I heard about how Cazic-thule resided in the Plane of Fear and wanted to pay homage to him.&amp;nbsp; I remembered through my journeys in the Feerott and looking at the map that there was a portal to the Plane of Fear from there, so I decided to travel there. I knew it would be extremely dangerous but I had eariler gotten feign death as an ability and was feeling pretty tough around that time.&amp;nbsp; Anyway, me and another iksar friend of mine (he's a necromancer) headed over there, ran into our first spectre (conned red obviously) and promptly freaked out.&amp;nbsp; He tried casting invis undead on me, but it turns out spectres can see through that.&amp;nbsp; He promptly tucked his tail in between his legs and stayed put, and I, the fearless brave one (haha, just kidding!&amp;nbsp; It was I that was wimpering and sniveling all the way, but he said he'd make fun of me if I didn't survive the trip and hail Cazic) went on.&amp;nbsp; I managed to avoid the spectre's attention, and got about halfway through the tunnel that leads to the portal when I ran into another specture.&amp;nbsp; This one was right in the middle of the narrow hallway, so there was no avoiding him.&amp;nbsp; I was wondering what I should do when it noticed me and started drifting towards me!&amp;nbsp; I freaked out, but ran forward past it, thankfully they're slow.&amp;nbsp; I ran and ran, feigning death and miraculously succeeding, and got to the main portal room.&amp;nbsp; Saw a named dark-elf guarding the portal but I ran right past her into it!&amp;nbsp; I had made it, and was spamming /tell to my buddy letting him know that I had succeeded the first leg of the trip...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;... and then I was promptly spat out back into the Feerott, because I wasn't at least level 46 and couldn't enter any planes (I was around level 21 or 22 at the time).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On a technicality, since I didn't hail Cazic-thule or even see what he looks like, I lost the "bet".&amp;nbsp; The instant I ding 46 however, you can bet I'm gonna go there!&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Ok all I have been playing less than 2 years but i have a few rather interesting memories to share. None or them high end my main is only lvl 56.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;5. The first time i realized that Beastlords actually aren't tanks no matter how bad of a mamma jamma you think you are in your thirties. Me and a friend were in DSP and he was at least 44 at the time. He was performing mass pulls to get some good exp. and I decided that i would get in the middle of them and try to take aggro off him when he got low on health. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;LOADING PLEASE WAIT...................&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;4. Wasn't a fond memory, but it is a memory that will stick in my brain. My first guild raid.&amp;nbsp; We were set to assemble in Lavastorm at the entrance to Naggy's. It took over an hour after the official start time of the raid to actually get everyone present and zoned in ready to go. That was aggravating but wasn't that big of a deal. was MANY of our first raids so it was semi-expected but upon entrance into naggy's our scouts informed us that the mobs we were headed after were already being raided which kind of defeated the purpose since they werent quick spawns anyway.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;3. Being broke for the longest time is a huge memory of mine that was settled once i found out about the Mountains of Rathe Hill Giants. I not only harvested plat there in groups at first, but lol leveled several times in my late 30's early fourties there. It was after the fact that i realized a few hours in tradeskilling can eventually yield a much better profit that hunting HG's although HG's are more fun to some people.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;2. Another memory that sticks out to me would be my first trip to The Overthere(Vah&amp;nbsp;Shiran heritage lol) &amp;nbsp;to "buy" a spell in my earlier levels. Walking through the middle of the town i see a few guards and decided to see if they conned red or not. before i could even click on them i saw a very familiar message&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;LOADING PLEASE WAIT.........................&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;1. My most fond memory would have to be all of the friends I have made along my way, mainly my very loving, helpful, and understanding Guild.&amp;nbsp; I LOVE ALL OF MY CORRUPTED DREAMERS!!! OH YEAH I FORGOT, IDP BABY!&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>Though too many to choose, here it an attempt:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) Getting my Guardians of the Throne tag from the lovely red-headed princess Lakotah&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) The day I did the final hit for my epic with almost all my friends (which was total overkill for the undead Trakanon) and got to hold my precious beautiful Singing Short Sword.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3) Sky-diving in Eastern Wastes, to the entrance of Kael Drakkal. LOADING...PLEASE WAIT! ;)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4) The day I finally completed my newbie armor for Dais, those orc bones are tough to get your hands on! Especially that ultra-fabled orc fibula.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;5) Getting the epics of my friends. Every time one completes his or hers I am exstatic!</description>
