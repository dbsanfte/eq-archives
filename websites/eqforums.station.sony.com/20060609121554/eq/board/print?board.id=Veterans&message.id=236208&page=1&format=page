				<DIV>Dain 2 is pretty easy, though it's easily the longest mission.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>One big key is to only use CH for healing, and when in doubt heal the Dain.&nbsp; That way, you save mana and can keep on moving.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Generally, we have the Dain pull.&nbsp; Make sure you pull them a ways towards the entrance so you have room for them to run without spawning adds.&nbsp; You should get no more than 4 on any pull, which keeps it easy.&nbsp; Kill the ones that don't run first - they're really the only ones that do damage.&nbsp; Make sure everyone assists.&nbsp; After you kill off all the Master scouts in the pull, start in on the runners.&nbsp; Have everyone who can root keep the scout from running - you really don't need healing with only scouts.&nbsp; You should pretty much never have the adds spawn - once we figured out the event we'd get a set once every 3-4 runs (usually when we were down by the named, since you've got less room there.)</DIV>

<P>I found dain1 and dain2 to be quite easy if time-consuming.&nbsp; I did both with my 3boxed accounts and while&nbsp;dain2 took a long time it wasn't all that difficult.&nbsp; I foudn the named&nbsp;at the end to be much more difficult than dealing with the runners.&nbsp; Dain3 is the one i've only managed to do once, and i sure wish i could find people doing it for xp so i could pick up the aug piece on my other 2 accounts.</P>

<p>Howdy Nodyin,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just a quick comment, I've done Dain 2 on
several of my characters and the giants definately run at 80% on my
server.&nbsp; Please do a mission on The Rathe server and see if your
giants run at 80% or 60%.</p>
<p>thanks,</p>
<p>Z<br></p><br><hr></blockquote>I'm not saying you're wrong, because I've seen it happen, but...<br>
<br>
On The Rathe I just tried Dain 2. The Scout didn't run until I dropped
him to 60% hp. At that point he said his text and ran just like he was
supposed to.<br>
<br>
It's a real weird situation. There actually isn't the number "80" in
any of the scripts attached to these guys anymore - it's definatley set
to 60% or lower.<br>
<br>
Overall there may be something odd going on but the mission is still
stable and fun (the fun part being my opinion) so I'm not super worried
about it.<br><div></div>

<P><BR>Heh, I know the feeling. I've tried to explain to people in various channels that monster missions were not nerfed on numerous occasions. But I guess if there's no guarantee of an instant group, some loot and an AA in 20 minutes it's no good.</P>
<P>Of, course, I'm making generalizations. Not all players are like that. The other day a friend and I managed to get a group to try Fall of the Combine with us, a mosnter mission we'd never tried before and knew nothing about. Of course, for each person willing to try there were 5 more were uninterested because they "don't do MMs" or lost interest when I failed to link awesome loot and promise an easy AA in under 45 minutes, but that's a rant for another time.</P>

				<DIV></DIV>Speaking of learning skills from MMs, one thing I've noticed is that playing with someone who knows all the tricks for getting AE agro and holding agro on multiple mobs makes a huge difference.&nbsp;&nbsp; For some tanks, when I've played a cleric I spend as much time tanking as I do healing myself.&nbsp; For other tanks, its like the mobs are glued to them.&nbsp; This is without any sort of taunt skill for the most part, and no proc weapons either.&nbsp; Just using mob radius proximity agro and making sure to switch to all targets to get them mad enough.

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR><BR><BR>Tis tough for it to die when the evidence says otherwise, that there that might be least a bug that does exist for instanced zones and multiple of mobs in camp. Examples would be the Highpass MM. Even when the last person in is the last to close with the mobs and engage, the untargetted mobs swarm to that person. The same with some of the MPG group trials, particularly the The Mastery of Efficiency trial. One could discount the MPG trials since they have long lockup timers upon a win, but with the MMs and their short lockout timers, it is quite noticeable. It will be even more difficult to sway others away from it, particularly those who spent alot of time in MMs such as Highpass MM on double exp weekends.<BR>

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR><BR><BR>Tis tough for it to die when the evidence says otherwise, that there that might be least a bug that does exist for instanced zones and multiple of mobs in camp. Examples would be the Highpass MM. Even when the last person in is the last to close with the mobs and engage, the untargetted mobs swarm to that person. The same with some of the MPG group trials, particularly the The Mastery of Efficiency trial. One could discount the MPG trials since they have long lockup timers upon a win, but with the MMs and their short lockout timers, it is quite noticeable. It will be even more difficult to sway others away from it, particularly those who spent alot of time in MMs such as Highpass MM on double exp weekends.<BR>

<P>I lost a Dain 3 mission by having the Dain zone in last and parking him at the general.&nbsp; When the tank died to the last named clearly out of target range, the named summoned the Dain and the giant army promptly destroyed him.&nbsp; Zoning in last to get zone aggro does exist and isn't just in instanced zones.&nbsp; It's used to control who takes the DT in PoSky for one example.</P><BR>

<P>Last to zone in zonewide agro happens in Anguish as well, I can confirm.&nbsp; It was rather fun zoning into the instance after a LD near the zone, and being summoned to the area just before Ture before you have really even appeared in the world yet =)</P>
