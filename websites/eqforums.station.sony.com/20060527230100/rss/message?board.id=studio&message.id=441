    <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Nice writeup. I just wanted to add one thing. The xmi2mid program often gets the tempo wrong and loses some information, and as a result the song sometimes plays faster/slower than usual or doesn't sound right. I have been using Awave Studio by FMJSoft to convert my XMI files, so far they have all come out the same length as the originals. Try out the shareware version sometime, you don't have to register to use this feature.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>converting old EQ music into more portable pcm audio</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=studio&amp;message.id=438#M438</link>
      <description>I had originally posted this as a reply to something else somewhere obscure a long while ago, but figured it'd do more good here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First, all of EQ's old world music is in a MIDI format of .xmi, and you need a way to play those files.  Winamp can, or you can look for a utility called xmi2mid (command line driven), which can convert it to a .mid format that more players recognize.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also note that how the music sounds is DIFFERENT on every soundcard.  This is explained below.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The main motivation behind converting the .xmi music to a pcm format, is pcm is compatible with a lot more platforms than MIDI.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-----&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Converting" MIDI (.mid, .xmi, etc) formats into pcm audio formats (.wav, .ogg, .mp3, etc) is not quite as simple as just "running some program". Let me explain how they work real quick.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;MIDI music "only" contains data such as:&lt;br&gt;)what instrument patch to play notes with (flute, piano, trumpet, etc)&lt;br&gt;)what time the note should start playing and how loud&lt;br&gt;)what time a note should stop playing&lt;br&gt;There is NO actual "sound" data stored. It is up to your computer's synthesizer to interpret the above information and generate actual sound from it. As a result, MIDI music sounds different on every synthesizer. Generally the synthesizer is part of your sound card, so MIDI music sounds different on every soundcard it's played on (unless your using a software-based synthesizer).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, files that contain direct representations of PCM audio (.wav, .ogg, .mp3 and such) are a different story. These files "do" contain the actual sounds you hear, so they will sound the same on every computer. That is also why these files aro so much larger, because tens of thousands of air pressure samples are recorded every second.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-----&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, converting from MIDI to PCM audio "is" possible, but as you can see above, there is no direct relationship, so it's a little more complicated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Programs that "just convert" it are likely just using a software synthesizer to generate PCM audio from the MIDI. This synthesizer may sound different than how your used to hearing the music.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are a couple methods that will record exactly what you hear:&lt;br&gt;1:&lt;br&gt;If your sound card supports it, simply set MIDI as the recording source.&lt;br&gt;Open you favorite PCM audio recording program (Creative Wave Studio... Audacity.. whatever), and start recording.&lt;br&gt;Play the MIDI file.&lt;br&gt;Stop recording, and save it in your favorite format.&lt;br&gt;2:&lt;br&gt;If your sound card cannot record directly from MIDI, then you'll need a second computer that has a soundcard with a line in port (most do).&lt;br&gt;Using a normal audio cable (either get one from radio shack or make one or whatever), plug the LINE OUT (normally what you plug the speakers into) port of your computer into the LINE IN port of the other computer.&lt;br&gt;On that other computer, set the LINE IN port as the recording source, and begin recording it your favorite editor.&lt;br&gt;On the first computer just play the MIDI file.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you happen to have a SB Live sound card (or possibly the new audigy, not sure about it), you can do even better:&lt;br&gt;Set "What you hear" as the recording source.&lt;br&gt;In the Soundfont control panal, load in the "synthus2.sf2" file from the EQ directory.&lt;br&gt;Set your EAX preset to something like "ENV - Bathroom" or "ENV - Concert Hall".&lt;br&gt;Now when you play the MIDI, it will use the Everquest soundfont and a similar reverb scheme, which sounds "far" better than on most sound cards.&lt;br&gt;You can record this like normal (keep the recording source set to "what you hear") using either of the above methods.&lt;br&gt;Using this method is gives you results much closer to what the original designers of it intended.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-----&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you happen to have a better synthesiver or soundfont, you might also consider using that, then editing the MIDI file to rebalance the volumes of the channels for your synth.  This can give a lot better quality results than the original designers had concieved.  I'd converted a couple of the themes like this myself, as some of the old world music is pretty decent.</description>

      <description>Thanks a lot for the Soundfont tip, Rarrum. It sounded much different (and better) loading that file into my Audigy Soundfont Bank and setting the reverb. I'm now in the process of recording the old XMI's.</description>
