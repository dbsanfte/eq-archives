    <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Antonius&amp;message.id=265</link>
    <description>&lt;div&gt;I need help to get into  KoD and yxxta. I wil gladly pay a group to help me (Madmax) get  flagged as my guild has no desire to go there. I need to get 4 ground spawns fo rmy 1.5 and have tried for months to get flagged or get piggied into yxxta to get these. They are on a 1 hour real time spawn. If any will help please send tell to Bedazzlerr or Madmax. ihave seen no one shouting to do trials or i would have joined in. All i need so i can do finaly fight after turn ins. So if can help  please let me know and thank you in advance.&lt;/div&gt;</description>
