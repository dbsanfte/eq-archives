				<DIV>&gt;&nbsp; High level spells, a permanent increase to the resistances hardcap </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>This is why I bothered doing those trials.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&gt; and some incredibly good gear.&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I wouldn't call loot that was on par with 2 year old raid loot "incredible". The loot in the trials were not upgrades to me or anyone else I did them with, except on rare occassion someone could upgrade their worst loot with 10-20hp. Considering transportation/clearing/lockout time, the fact that most times all loot rot, and most times no spell rune dropped, I really don't think the rewards from these trials was anywhere near excessive.</DIV>
