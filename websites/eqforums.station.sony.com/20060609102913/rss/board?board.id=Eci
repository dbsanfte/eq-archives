      <title>Server merger scheduled for holiday - can this be rescheduled?</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Eci&amp;message.id=117#M117</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I noticed that the merger of the E'ci and Tunare servers is scheduled for Monday, May 30th.&amp;nbsp; This is Memorial Day in the USA.&amp;nbsp; As&amp;nbsp;this is a national holiday,&amp;nbsp;it means that many will not be at work or school that day.&amp;nbsp; Some of these people might want to play EverQuest on their day off.&amp;nbsp; Unfortunately, since E'ci and Tunare will be down, that will not be an option for them.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I&amp;nbsp;am thus suggesting to SOE that this merger be delayed by one day (to Tuesday, May 31st).&amp;nbsp; Not only would this allow people to play their characters on those two servers on their day off, but it would save SOE money (as they would not have to pay overtime to people doing the work needed to accomplish the merger).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I will post this on the Tunare board as well.&amp;nbsp; Hopefully enough people agree with me to make our voices heard on this matter.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <title>The problem with the Game</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Eci&amp;message.id=113#M113</link>
      <description>The problem with EQ is that it expanded to fast. Not enough time was given between expansions. I love the features that came with the expansions but as each expansion came into being the older content got left behind. Example There have been times when I have been the only person, for several hours mind you, in skyshirne, east caommons, west freeport, rathe mountains, south and north karana, even dreadlands.Even some of the newer content zones such as gunthak, dulak, and abysmal sea (which is one of the greatset places ever if you are into tradeskilling). Forget about doing any LDONS no one, it seems like, is doing them on eci. I guess I am saying that the server mergers will be a good thing if it brings peoples into the older zones again.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Been playing this game for over 4 years now, and&amp;nbsp; havent made any long term friends,&amp;nbsp; because mainly i play during the day { EST} . is there anyone who plays this time?&amp;nbsp; im paying to&amp;nbsp;play with other people, but play the game like im not. so maybe i should just play a single person game. I dont think the merge will help in this . &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>We want Grog!!</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Eci&amp;message.id=99#M99</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;As the final days of E'ci pass by, and the merge looms ahead, We are left remembering the days of old, of tales and trials of this great server. Not to many people can tell a story about the younger years of the server without one name gracing almost every story. That being of GM Grog. Grog's legacy on E'ci dates back many years, And almost anyone that has played the game for any lenght of time has had the pleasure of meeting him. From the days he would throw parties in Gfay, to countless other events he did to add flavor to the world. Sadly, Grog had to move on from EQ, and we now belive he works within EQ2, his Email is still valid and up, so we know he is still hanging around SoE. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;As the server merger comes closer and closer, and E'ci will be shut down and given a new name. We ask for one last party, One last Grog sighting on E'ci. We want to close this chapter of our EQ lives with the man that helped make and mold the server into what it is today. We want to be G-fluxed across G-fay one last time, Be changed into whatever animal he see's fit, have drunken gnome races, just stand around and talk about days gone past. We want our one last farewall. I can think of no better person to give the last big party on E'ci then Grog. Set a day/time and place and we will all be there. Its up to you Grog , I dont think you will let us down :-)&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>Pre-Merger get to know eachother questions and such</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Eci&amp;message.id=84#M84</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I thought it would be a good idea to start a sort of dialogue between our to servers for us to talk about how things are like on each of them, and to possibly figure out what may cause problems before they actually come to pass and solve them now.&amp;nbsp; There is a thread about the server merger already on the Tunare board which I figure can work for this same thing.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;One of the things that I am curious about and has been talked about somewhat on the only somewhat active open raid channel currrently on Tunare is how that atmosphere is going to change.&amp;nbsp; That particular channel has a general rule that anyone can call raids and recruit from the channel just have a seperate channel for the raid,&amp;nbsp;be decent to each other,&amp;nbsp;and aside from that there are no other rules for the channel itself.&amp;nbsp; I've heard that E'ci has a very open progression community and I'm wondering how it works.&amp;nbsp; One of the self-appointed 'leaders' of the open raid channel on Tunare has said he was going to talk to whoever runs the majority of your servers open raids, but I would much rather that it be discussed more as a community thing then one person who thinks he runs the channel talk to the people who usually run your stuff.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Also if you have any questions you all want to know feel free to ask them here or on the&lt;A href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Tunare&amp;amp;message.id=151" target=_blank&gt; thread &lt;/A&gt;over on the &lt;A href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board?board.id=Tunare" target=_blank&gt;Tunare board&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I'm returning to active play after long hiatus and curious to know if there are still open public (non-guild) epic raids being run to the original plane zones (Hate, Fear, Sky, etc.).&amp;nbsp; If so, are there public sign-up boards?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Also, as the Plane of Hate was revamped where single group raids could hunt there, were any of the other original plane zones similarly redone?&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Hello I am posting this to find out if this is SOE policy. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I recently petitioned the following after a bugged occured day after patch that cause me to lose around 1 yellow of lvl 65 experiance. As some background Ive been playing the game since '99 , and never got any actual help from a GM. They have always told me its working as intended ,or sorry I cant help.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;1st petition : Three bodies have dissapeared , and the exp with them. I camped overnite after getting frustrated and they was not there the next day to res. Help would be appreciated I have lost over 1 yellow of 65 exp because of this game bug.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;GM response #1:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Thank you for contacting sony online entertainment. This is regarding corpses disappearing. I sincerely apoligize for the inconvenience caused due to this issue. Currently it seems that you do not have any corpse in the world of your character 'Katur'. As you are not online at the moment, I am not able to verify it. If you have looted your corpse , then delete the ticket or else respond back with complete information. &lt;STRONG&gt;We will reimburse the experiance lost and the items on the corpse, only after investigation.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Gm yaksh&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;My reply as follows:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The corpses that disappeared (there are 3 of them) had nothing on them I think that contributed to the bug myself. There are no corpses in the world , and was none when i logged back in the next morning. That was the prob otherwise I wouldhave had them Res'd, and never needed to petition. I lost nearly a yellow of exp so your help is appreciated.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;GM response 2:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;This is GM Buglex. I am responding to your petition regarding your missing corpses. &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;Unfortunately we will not be able to reimburse the experiance you lost. I am sorry for any inconvenience this issue has caused you. If you have any other issues that require our attention, please remember to delete this ticket, so that you may start a new one. Good luck to you.&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;GM Buglex&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Now since they never took the time to get the information from me , or explain to me why my petition was declined after inclining it would be fixed. I am going to explain exactly what happend.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;My guild was raiding LMM our very first time. For those that have yet to experiance a wipe in the zone it really is quite interesting. I was res'd at the GY and apparently to close to zone because even though its a click on zone i was being zoned without clicking anything. On zoning you meet a bunch of mobs at the portal in HOHa and they quikly kill you. I died twice this way causing 2 naked bodies in HOHa. The final res i got in HoHb was in the right place I didnt zone , and then someone trained us and ... you guessed it another naked corpse. That leaves 3 naked corpses and one dressed/res'd corpse. I was very frustrated zoning on a res is rediculous especially into death. I logged out and figured the next day I could get res's on those bodies. Well the next day I log in the only body i have is the clothed/res'd one. The other bodies have all poofed. I petition and the response is no problem at first then sorry about your luck at the end.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;A customer like myself who owns all expansions and has been a steady paying customer since 99 expects to be treated with a little bit more respect. If you are going to deny my petition the least you can do is explain why. I will never delete this petition. If I stay in the game and if I have another problem it will remind me just how much good petitioning does in this game.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
