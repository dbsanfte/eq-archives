      <description>I've logged in the last few days mainly to raid. I have not interrected with any merchants but the potion merchant and the merchants in Guild Hall, and yet I get rolled back and lose XP. How many people were rolled back? Seems like jsut about everyone. Why didn't SoE just do 1 rollback after they realized they screwed up.Â  You'd think after 7 years, they'd know how to handle these things...&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Anyone else having the stupid port issue again? Seems like the last 2 weeks I've hit exodus right as I'm being killed and it goes off after I hit bind.&amp;nbsp; Now if I'm hitting it late, this ability really needs to somehow be set not to be used up if I'm killed. This is becomeing very frusterating.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Why not leave 2.0 in GD, and just make 1.0 in NToV? Would allow us old school people who enjoyed PoM 1.0 to go there and let the only people who use 2.0(People doing epics Rog/Enc) use 2.0.&amp;nbsp; Anyone else ever notice no one uses PoM now anymore? I sure have.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;Keeping the 1min recast is like taking a crap pie and putting whipcream on top and trying to serv it to us. It's still CRAP!&amp;nbsp; Not worth putting my arguments here because if it's not clear why this is totally BS, you havn't played a wizard long or pre-MB nerf. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;Hey, Lets make our nukes do 10k dmg w/o a crit and just double the aggro, that's a fix to our weak DPS, right?!?!&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=wizardbalance&amp;message.id=3398#M3398</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I've read some posts that state some people no longer use their PoTime legs. I have no idea how they can get away with this and still do max DPS, but the best to you. I'll on avg get summoned from just chaining CF at 90% or so and clicking them once inbetween each nuke.&amp;nbsp; Seeing as their are so many upgrades available for us on pants, and many of us do not want to lose out on the&amp;nbsp;click concussion, what are the chances of making a quest that would allow us to get an Anceint: Concussion click aug? Maybe require the perosn to have had the PoTime legs, and have them handed in along with some sort of quest pieces to get this aug? Sadly the only ancient spell I have is DoI(though I'm told by many wizards they'd rather have that then their A: Concussion).&amp;nbsp; At this point in the game, it's going to be hard to get people to farm Seru or RoV(For this you still need a raid size do to all the adds) when thier drops are just trash and all we're looking for is spells.&amp;nbsp; I'd ventur to say just about every class has had some sort of upgrade to thier Anceint spells aside from the wizards(I know there is mention of this being looked into or talked about in another thread).&amp;nbsp; What do you all think? Would you aug your DoN/Ang gear w/ a click Anceint concussion Aug or would the spell have to see some sort of change to increase the deaggro?&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Favorite Old&amp;nbsp;Zone:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Old PoM (SoE should put the old PoM back in, and just leave the ZI to that one in NToV, and leave the new one where it's at, since I honestly believe we all enjoyed the old one better. Or make a poll to see which the player would have)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Favorite New Zone: RSS&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Least Favorite Old Zone: Really can't think of one, liked most of the old zones, aside form&amp;nbsp;old zones having horrid pathing.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Least Favorite New Zone: Well, My idea of a new zone is PoP+. I dislike PoN, PoD and a few other of the planes that everything sees invis, and there is no room to move around. And ofcourse the new PoM, That zone is just empty now aside form the few people who famr the horse since it is the last remianing mob that can still drop cards.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The whole point of the Coirnav encounter is to get through the first two phases of the encounter fast enough (and clean enough) to leave enough time to DPS Coirnav down. If it takes you 3 minutes to kill Coirnav, you need to complete the first two phases in 12 minutes (it's a 15 minute event). If now you only take 10 seconds to kill Coirnav (go go boom team), you now have a couple more minutes of leeway in the first stages of the event, which changes the encounter considerably in my opinion.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If I recall correctly, Trakanon in Seb has something like 50K HP. During the encounter, the challenge is killing him fast enough to avoid people getting banished or people dieing to the AEs. If your wizard boom team can kill him instantly from range by dropping a group's worth of manaburns, where is the risk in that encounter anymore?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Having the ability to do that much damage in that short of time would break many encounters that are timed events or contain some form of damage over time component (Adds, AEs, etc).&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;You must be some Jelious SK/Necro thinking we might actually have MB become usful again. I know on my server, there are about 0 guild that have more the a few wizards on raids. Like someone else said, you still need a raid to spawn the Avatar. I'm not sure if you've ever done him before, but once you actually make it to Coirnav, killing him isn't all that hard, it's the trash before him. And your likly near oom when this happens. Agian, old content, who cares. I would not even want the ability if there is a 1 minute recast on it. Because on any raid mob, it makes it to where I'd guess to say the most this would be able to be casted is 2 times. If all the wizards on the raid can not use it on a single mob, then why bother having it?&amp;nbsp; It sure the hell isn't going to help me burn down an add fast unless it does 100k damage as all mobs in RS/MPG have about 100k hitpoints.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;As to the stacking, when you run the numbers on the level 70 manaburn above, it might make more sense.&amp;nbsp; While you and the people you know may not abuse a stacking-less mana burn, there are many folks out there that would.&amp;nbsp; You can be assured that the item farmers would create roving raids of wizards with the sole intention of leveling raid-level NPCs in the blink of an eye.&amp;nbsp; It's not something we can allow to happen, so if manaburn is to become a big bang ability once again, the stacking limitation has to remain intact.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Is it not possible to just set a limit to the % a mob's life can be taken by MB? Say the most damage that can be done to Fennin Ro would be 25% of his health.&amp;nbsp; Or do like someone else mentioned earlier, set a limit the amount of MB's that could hit a mob. OR why not just drop the 1 minute recast timer to something like 10-20seconds? Lets face it, if you took a group of wizards to kill somehting w/ MB, and there was only a 10-20seconds recast, chances are verly likly they'd be killed while waiitng for that refreash. Our guild can kill Quarm in around 2 minutes. With a 1 minute recast timer, only 2 wizards can use this ability, which is lame.&amp;nbsp; There has to be another solution to the recast timer. Though the 45k crit nuke sounds nice.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;

If you compare a top end player's lifeburn or IHT to the current implementation of manaburn, it definitely looks odd that they can stack theirs but manaburn can't stack.&amp;nbsp; The thing is that manaburn is a level 59 ability (yay for caffeine) and if you look at harm touch and lifeburn at those levels they're doing significantly less damage.&amp;nbsp; If a new manaburn unlocks that cap and starts hitting for&amp;nbsp;30k damage a pop, without a stacking limiter you're going to run into the exact same issues that got the ability changed in the first place.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
