      <title>Major stacking bug on mez spells (Dec 7 patch)</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Enchanters&amp;message.id=6100#M6100</link>
      <description>Our mez spells Euphoria (L69) and Felicity (L67) are bugged from the Dec 7 patch.&lt;br&gt;The mez spell Wake of Felicity (L69) has been changed but is still in a buggy state.&lt;br&gt;(WOF cannot be overwritten by any other spell except Felicity/Euphoria).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You cannot over-ride Euphoria with any other mez spell except itself now.&lt;br&gt;Similarly Felicity cannot be overwritten by any other lower level spell except by itself and Euphoria (a higher level spell).&lt;br&gt;If you try to cast a lower level mez spell on top of Euphoria/Felicity you will get a "Your spell did not take hold message". Previously all single target mez spells could over-write each other.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;EG: You cannot cast Bliss/Glamor of Kintaz/Dazzle to re-mez over Euphoria.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Other mez spells like Apathy and Bliss do not have this problem.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I found this out the hard way in Tacvi today while trying to keep mezzed the Ukun manasipper with the Hammer of Delusion (cliky Euphoria) and Bliss mez. Verified the bug later with other mez spells.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why this is a major bug:&lt;br&gt;A lower level enchanter cannot overwrite the mez of a higher level enchanter if they are using similar mez spell, they have to use different spells that can stack over each other to overcome this. If lower level spells cannot stack on top of higher level mez spells, the lower level enchanter (and raid/exp grp) is in serious trouble if the higher level chanter dies and the remaining lower level enchanter cannot "take over" the previously mezzed mobs. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is embarrasingly bad for all concerned. I believe the problem is related to the year long attempt to fix the bugs in the Wake of Felicity spell. There has been at least three (3) unsuccesful error plagued attempts to fix the spell, as of the latest patch (Dec 7 &amp; 8) - WOF is still bugged (in a different manner...) and now so is Felicity/Euphoria - the two most commonly used mez spells in the game.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While I appreciate the difficulty of running and maintaining a game like EQ (making MMOGs is HARD...) - this sort of thing can easily have been caught at the testing stage by any enchanter testing the changes on Qeynos trash mobs. Its annoying (and demoralizing at worst) to have to deal with this sort of thing every patch in the past few months.</description>

      <description>This is a freaking debacle.  Look. Sony. Allow me to explain to you how to fix this bug.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;#1: Put Felicity and Euphoria back the way they were.  They should by mez type "2" mezzes. (You seem to have changed this to "3" in the last patch.)&lt;br&gt;#2: Change Wake of Felicity to a type "2" mez. It was Type 1 (The original problem) and you have, for some benighted reason, changed it to type 3.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once WoF, Euphoria, and Felicity are all type 2, our problems are solved. This is embarassing.  Maybe not -quite- as embarassing as referring to every shaman in the game who bought Gift of Mana as an "exploiter" but still.</description>
