				<DIV>Right now the Plane of Mischief is a decent zone, but the quests are gone and the cards are a horribly rare drop from a 3 day spawn. This zone has decent loot for the mid 50's character, but the quest system that was a portion of the zone's effect has all but disappeared. I enjoy questing in Everquest and so do many others, but the sheer difficulty and the high</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The A White Stallion that spawns every three days is farmed consecutively by farmers that are seeking to make easy sell money. I believe a simple reimplementation of the old armors to have the parts drop off of all of the new nameds in the zone with the new zone nameds would bring more questers to the zone and revitalize it. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Having a new armor set for each of the classes that originally lacked one, and the charged effects being rechargible with mana batteries would bring alot of fun back into the zone. I fiercy believe that one of the fun parts of this zone was the quest and reward aspect, that with the revamp left this zone akward. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Could a dev please look into adding the card drops atleast to some more mob loot tables with a fair rarity&nbsp; atleast?</DIV>
