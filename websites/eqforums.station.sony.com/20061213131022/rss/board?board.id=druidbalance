      <title>Druid TSS BP focus / clicky</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=druidbalance&amp;message.id=10877#M10877</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Currently, the druid BP from TSS has 70% heal focus to Adrenaline Surge III, and a clicky DS can be targeted on others / tanks.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Reason for posting was to see what the other druids would rather have seen on this BP, or hopfully, get it changed to.&amp;nbsp; In looking for ideas, we do need to remember what we ask for should be in balance with the game, ie, asking for a 10k nuke clicky nuke would be a waste of time.&amp;nbsp; Also, I dont want to come off as we are never happy, and I know that whatever focus / clicky is added there will be those that will want it to be different, cant please all...just curious as to what the other druids was looking for in the BP.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;U&gt;Focus&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;25% mana preservation to Pure Life III.&amp;nbsp; In the Anguish druid BP, we got 25% mana preservation to Ancient Chlorobon.&amp;nbsp; This was and still is a very popular focus / BP.&amp;nbsp; I personally still use the Anguish BP because of this focus, skiping the Demi BP.&amp;nbsp; I would personally much rather see the mana preservation then the 5% more heal focus.&amp;nbsp; If not get the mana preservation to Pure Life, get the mana preservation for Adrenaline Surge would also be wanted over the heal focus.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;U&gt;Clicky&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Not a huge fan of the DS on the clicky, can live with it, just would not be my first choice.&amp;nbsp; If we stay with the DS, could the timer be reduced down from 15 min to 5 min?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;1. My favorite clicky that druids have ever gotten was the clicky heals that we got on the tacvi hammer, and the vishimtar mask.&amp;nbsp; I can see the hesitation to give us a 3rd clicky heal...but maybe give us clicky Pure Life, and have it share the timer with the tacvi hammer?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;2. From Kunark thro PoP, druids on BPs got the latest group hp regen on the BPs, maybe bring that back?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;3. Clicky Direwood Guard Rk. III.&amp;nbsp; Would be great to free up a spell slot getting this spell on the BP.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;4. Clicky Direwild Skin Rk. III.&amp;nbsp; With the recast timer 5 min (longer?), this would not of course replace the need to keep the spell / buff memed, but would be nice to be able to cast this as a mana free buff once in a&amp;nbsp;while.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;5. I am a large fan of the wizard clicky that they get on the BP, radient mana.&amp;nbsp; Again, would like to see that timer changed from 15 min to 5 min.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Have you guys noticed that druids have become the caster's priest? Epic 1.5+&amp;nbsp;and the mana regen buff. The glory days of the druid is from a completly different game it seems. EQ has evolved so much. People on occasion post their spell wish lists, I think its nice but pointless. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If the class is dotting towards a caster oriented group then why not go all out? Give us buffs to amplify caster dps like shamans do with melee. How about crit or damage % increaser buffs&amp;nbsp;in our spell books that actually make the druid shine and contribute to a group, effectivley. Hell, just add it to our skin-buff line.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Ask anyone in EQ and they will tell you that druids suck or are worthless. I wonder if the Devs even know where the druid class is headed, a whole lot of crap dishing has been happening since PoP, it looks like. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;BLAH BLAH BLAH i feel like im screaming at the air. Screw this I'm getting laid.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I wish we got an upgrade this expansion,&amp;nbsp;I love it so much! Perhaps the upgrade could be a regen/defense proc. 600hp/tick&amp;nbsp;with a chance to proc the&amp;nbsp;600hp defense proc. or hell maybe upgrade them both to 800 or 1000. Nah people are gonna start bashing saying that is too powerful or really dumb druids are gonna say its a bad idea cuz they like being at the bottom of the barrel (losers). Anyways all is good, just wish we had a better class ability aa than that white wolf thing. UGH so cheap.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I was in a group with this configuration it worked really well. Sk's are ac whores so healing was no biggie, lots of mana regen, and i was able to throw in a rain every encounter. Mag debuffed, Bst slowed, epic clicky and the rest is history. Best group ever!&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Just a teeny request from a small druid. As we&amp;nbsp; the got the Zephr line of spells to TSS, just wonder if we can get "zephr" to bind&amp;nbsp; spot to help melees go home after exping. Would be a convenience to everyone and not overpowering.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <title>Have druid heals ever been discussed?</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=druidbalance&amp;message.id=10655#M10655</link>
      <description>I don't play a druid. I don't have a druid twink. I do however have a cleric box and I'm sick of having the seperate keyboard in my lap just to be able to group. At a guess I would say 50 percent of all the active clerics out there are boxes. And only for 1 reason when you need real healing, you need a cleric (though many have a second high purpose of being rezbot).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why can't druids have a frigging cheal, not the trash they got god knows how many expansions ago. Giving druids a real cheal even at 800 mana (with 10 second cast) would make druids an alternative to clerics when you can't find one. Big deal if they can do other things, if they are in group as main healer they aren't doing other things, they're healing and nothing else. At 800 or event 1k mana they won't have the mana to do other things + the 10 second cast won't give them time to be doing all these neat other things.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everyone that I know that bots a cleric did it originally for "in case we can't find a cleric."&amp;nbsp; Unfortunately "in case" has become a full time player. We'd love to ditch the box except when douing but can't because their simply aren't enough real clerics out there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When people bots start ending up in the top 100 on servers there's obviously a problem. (And yes I know it's that sitting healing all the time is boring.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Hi, I raided on my druid yesterday for my first time and while it was very fun I felt really lost as to what I was supposed to be doing.&amp;nbsp; I play on the Sleeper server (up to Luclin unlocked) and was wondering what the druid's typical role is on a raid.&amp;nbsp; Any help you could give me would be much appreciated.&amp;nbsp; I am level 35 atm, but I'll be 52 probably in a couple of weeks.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Remove the stacking issues so wolf form stacks with our skin and mask line. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Make wolf form faster - it should be the second fastest method of travel in game behind only bard speed. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <title>Druid Tree Form request</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=druidbalance&amp;message.id=10538#M10538</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I would like to revisit the concept of our tree form, yet again.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;1st, I feel that tree form is a signature ability of the druid. While I am pleased that our tree form has been updated, graphics wise, the functionabilty of the spell could also use an update, too.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;As it stands it gives us an illusion, root, +2-5 HP regen and -10 FR&amp;nbsp;at level&amp;nbsp;6; Illusion, root, +7-13 HP regen&amp;nbsp;and +2 Mana regen at level&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;36; Illusion, root, +10-13 HP regen and +4 mana regen at level 59. This self buff doesn't stack well with our Skin line of spells (if at all) and therefor is rarely, if ever, used.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;With the introduction of the 'resting' state the usefullness of the HP and mana regen aspects of this line of spells is lessened even further. The attribute of self-root is a highly detremental one for a kiting class and needs to be considered a major drawback in the use of tree form.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The 1st suggestion I have is that tree form allow us the same mana regen that we get from being on a horse. The 'sitting' state of mana regen.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The 2nd suggestion I have is that all forms of tree form have a -Fire Resistance built in. After all, we become wood and ingiteable.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Now I get radical...please bear with me. The 3rd suggestion I have is to&amp;nbsp;allow the stacking of these effects with our current skin line of spells. I don't feel that this is going to overpower our class. Keep in mind that we are rooted while enjoying this benefit.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Now I go overboard...way overboard...the 4th suggestion I have is make tree form a form of aggro management, similar to Feign Death. (No, I havn't lost my mind, but you are allowed to think so) Let me explain my thoughts on this.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Druids have no way of reducing aggro in our toolkit. The only viable option we possess is Evac. Evacing is detremental to for a number of reasons, ie: group is removed from a hunt. Its an all or nothing solution.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Now if we could pop on tree form and reduce aggro we could get the mob off of us and back onto the tank. This could even add to a Sleight of Hand and allow us to not be noticed casting our spells. If this ability was expanded to the depth of Feign Death we could survive a bad pull/group wipe and assist in the recovery operations. Say we had a line of tree form that allowed us to reduce aggro, AND a line of tree form that acted as FD, but with the added modifier of silenceing us...no spell casting. (or even mana regen, etc, like FD does for HP regen...very slowly)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Anyways...there are my thoughts on new abilities of treeform. I invite discussion and if the Druid community likes some, or even most, of my ideas I advocate advancing them to teh Devs for their consideration.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Please be nice. If you don't like it, then you don't like it and be content with mearly saying so. If this post turns into the standard flame-fest that regularly occures on this forum then the Devs won't touch it with an 11 foot pole. It would ne nice to have an intelligent debate for a change on the Druid forum.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Thank you.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=druidbalance&amp;message.id=10534#M10534</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I'm sorry if this has been posted before, I didn't look too hard before I posted this :P&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Would anybody else like some kind of indication to see at a glance when one of your dots crit?&amp;nbsp; Like either a different color, a pair of brackets or parenthasis, or even the word critical so I can set an audio trigger or something.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I have maxxed out all my dot critting AA's, but with all the battle spam, and trying to not die, I can't see at glance when my dots crit.&amp;nbsp; I would love to see a return on all those AA's spent, not that it isn't a nice return now, I just don't SEE it hehe.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;This isn't something for only druids, but since I'm a druid, I thought I'd ask here on the druid boards.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Also, does anybody have any recomendations for some kind of parser for druids damage?&amp;nbsp; I'd just be curious to see how much DPS I'm doing when I'm not the healer in a group or raid.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Thanks :)&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>Time to offically scrap the stance idea</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=druidbalance&amp;message.id=10517#M10517</link>
      <description>After 1.5+ years of debate and bickering, I hate seeing the word "stance."&amp;nbsp; I'ld like the devs to say -offically- that druid stances, as they were proposed during class re-envisioning, will never go live.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If stances were added in the near future, it'ld be like the devs saying "We considered your class under-balanced for the past 1.5+ years while you were paying the same account fees as people with balanced classes, but...."&amp;nbsp; I'm not saying I think our class was out of balance for 1.5+ years (only since TSS imo), but if the devs intended to add stances this entire time and took this long to happen, that'ld be the messege I get.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My final word on the subject is...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are druids who like to nuke more than they like to heal and vice versa, but the bottom line is that there isn't any such thing as a 'healing' or a 'nuking' druid, there is only one type of a druid - A Druid.&amp;nbsp; To be "A Druid" you need not to go into a 'mode' or label yourself to your prefered ability -- you need to be able to do what is of most effectivness at the given moment.&amp;nbsp; There are druids who enjoy doing a certain side of class more so than another side, but any skilled druid is expert at all aspects of the class, and doesn't go through a single play session with out using both healing and DPS extensivly.&amp;nbsp; Druids are likely the last class to be considered one-sided, and promoting one-sidedness over ability-concurrentcy will do nothing but hurt the class.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>The real Issue for Druids is Class identity</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=druidbalance&amp;message.id=10483#M10483</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I mean when is the last time your played your character and really felt like a Druid.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I can remember the first time I saw a mature Druid change into a wolf and take off like a bolt of lightning.&amp;nbsp; I so wanted to be able to do that... That hooked me right there.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The two most endearing memories of my Druid growth was: &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;1. Quad Kiting in wolf form in the open area of Dulak's Harbor lv 53 - 58 approx.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;2. Charm Killing in Plain of Storms.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Not since PoP have I felt I knew where the Druid class was headed (fit in).&amp;nbsp; All the best Druid class utilities now are just outdated.&amp;nbsp; Wolf form is a thing of the past.&amp;nbsp; The new aa really does not fix that.&amp;nbsp; Gates are just a convenience, not a necessity.&amp;nbsp; Quading has been deemed taboo I guess.&amp;nbsp; Remember when everyone would debate whether Druids or Necros were the best kiters based on the Necro high single target dps and our ability to take 4 at a time.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Snare is still useful but not class defining.&amp;nbsp; CC is becoming obsolete.&amp;nbsp; Mobs just hit to hard anymore to think a druid has the time to first aggro then move a mob away.&amp;nbsp; We do have a new spell that helps with that but it's not class defining.&amp;nbsp; etc.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Now we argue about how best to make us into Nukers/Healers.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Really how many of you picked and played your Druid for so many years because we nuked and healed as our primary purpose.&amp;nbsp; It was nice that we could but it wasn't why I became a Druid.&amp;nbsp; Class balance is important and I understand why it needs to be debated.&amp;nbsp; But really I would just like the designers to make me feel like a Druid again.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Is that really too much to ask?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I want players to ask me for wolf form again.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I want to sit and med up while hiding as a tree again.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I want animals to do my bidding again even if it was dangerous.&amp;nbsp; Maybe the new charm will do that.&amp;nbsp; I need to maybe give it more of a chance.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I want other player to wish they had picked a Druid like me again.&amp;nbsp; Instead of wishing I hadn't.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Developers Please Please make me into a Druid again.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Is that really too much to ask?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>This was brought up in a differant thread, but I am making a new one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;People often quote parts of the Prima Kunark Guide.&amp;nbsp; Here is the full passage:&lt;br&gt;Note, this is written by Julien Beasley, a Bard and Druid from an unlisted server.&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;font color="#ffff00"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Guardians of nature, Druids are one of the most versatile classes in Norrath.&amp;nbsp; Druids are a priest class, which means that they have the powerful abilitiy to heal themselves and others.&amp;nbsp; Their connection with nature means animals love them, and many otherwise hostile animals will allow a Druid to pass unharmed through its territory.&amp;nbsp; High-Level Druids can eventually be able to transform themseleves and others into Wolves.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#ffff00"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffff00"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;em&gt;Although Druids can channel the peaceful and healing touch of&#xD;
nature, they also can summon nature's fearsome wrath.&amp;nbsp; Druids have&#xD;
powerful fire and lightning damage spells--so powerful that, at certain&#xD;
points in their development, they are second only to Wizards in their&#xD;
damage-dealing abilities, even outpacing the mighty magician.&amp;nbsp; Druids&#xD;
can also summon swarms of bees that deal damage over time to their foes.&lt;/em&gt; Defenisvely, the Druid can surround himself or his allies with thorny shields that pierce any enemy that dares attack the person behind it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some would argue that the Druid's greatest strength is in his mastery of movement.&amp;nbsp; Druids can call up nature's lupine spirits and bless themselves or others with the Spirit of Wolf, enabling them to run at great speed.&amp;nbsp; Conversely, even the newly apprenticed Druid has the abilitiy to slow down his foes, reducing their speed to a crawl.&amp;nbsp; However the Druid's most powerful movement ability lies in the teleport line of spells, without question.&amp;nbsp; Druids may teleport themselves and others to selected areas throught Norrath, covering the distance of a day's journey in an instant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although a Druid's melee abilities pale compared to those of a Warrior, he is competent in armed combat.&amp;nbsp; Druids are the only caster class in the game able to wield swords, although they are limited to the use of Scimitars.&amp;nbsp; The offensive might of a Druid does not come without a price, Druids may only wear armor of cloth and leather and are forbidden from using chain and plate to protect themselves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Life of a Druid is that of the path of nature, and like nature, they vary from nurturing and loving to wild, furious and unpredictable.&amp;nbsp; The Druid's power ultimately comes from his bond with nature, and woe to the foolish races that make it their practice to define nature under a Druid's watchful eye.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;Same Company, two years later for the Prima Luclin Book:&lt;br&gt;Written by Andrea Silva (Cyrth Thistledown of Bristlebane)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#ffff00"&gt;Druids are one of the priest classes, healers and nurturers who have the ability to cast some damaging spells as well.&amp;nbsp; They are aligned with the good deities and are generally welcome everywhere on Norrath.&amp;nbsp; Druids are limited to leather armor and they are not renowned for their ability to melee or take hits.&amp;nbsp; They do however, have a wide variety of spells and skills that will make them well-rounded characters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You'll find that as a Druid you're an invaluable additon to adventuring groups headed to Luclin.&amp;nbsp; Druids have the ability to teleport themselves and and their groups to various locations throughout the world.&amp;nbsp; They can buff their party with enhancement, such as Spirit of the Wolf (movement rate increase), a line of strength buffs, a protective skin buff which raises a character's hitpoints and armor class, thorn shields and regenerative spells.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Druids can also charm animals and cast fire based direct damage spells.&amp;nbsp; Gifted with the ability to track and forage, Druids are also very self-sufficent when far away from a city.&amp;nbsp; That's just the tip of an iceburg when it comes to the many skills a Druid has in his or her possession.&amp;nbsp; Overall, Druids are a very versatile class and can fill many roles in a group, making them a desired class for many adventuring parties.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;And the current defination on Everquest's site today is:&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#ffff00"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffff00"&gt;Druids are deciples of the wilds, following the teachings of the&#xD;
Norrathian gods of nature.&amp;nbsp; Druids are primarily a magic using class,&#xD;
with the ability to wear leather armor and weild blunt weapons and&#xD;
scimitars.&amp;nbsp; Druidic magic takes many forms, allowing the druid to fill&#xD;
a wide variety of roles when in a group or adventuring alone.&amp;nbsp; Druids&#xD;
poses excellent &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffff00"&gt;healing&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffff00"&gt; abilities, powerful &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffff00"&gt;health&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffff00"&gt; and mana regenerative spells, and valuable enhancements that improve the &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffff00"&gt;health&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffff00"&gt; and armor of the group.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#ffff00"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Why no pets?</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=druidbalance&amp;message.id=10154#M10154</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I'm a newer druid but i'm noticing something druids are always taunted with pet using ability but never to much usefullness. We have lots of charms spells but charm pets just plain suck. they for some moronic reason gave us a pet spell at 55 but.....it's a lvl 30? that doesn't do squat even at 55. We are the only class that can charm but don't even have a chanter type pet. I think this is a little odd. Shaman having a pet and druid not? seems kind of odd also. Just something I find abit retarded.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>What Happened to Harmony Pacify for Level 75?</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=druidbalance&amp;message.id=10121#M10121</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I enjoy pulling for groups. I leveled my druid to 75 and got all my new Tier 1&amp;nbsp;spells. But I did not find any upgrade to the druid&amp;nbsp;outdoor only harmony/pacify spell.&amp;nbsp; The only harmony/pacify spell I have is limited to 70-level mobs maxiumum&amp;nbsp;and it is useless against the higher level mobs in the TSS zones. Is this intentional?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>I like the new expansion.</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=druidbalance&amp;message.id=10073#M10073</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I dont know about you guys but I like the new spell upgrades and the aa's. The new rest feature makes our mana inefficiency less of a hassle. I can lay down way more damage becuase i am not so worried about saving mana for the rest of the group/mission. People that only complain about this new expansion sound like they still don't really understand the druid class. Since we have all of these abilities, ive figured how to use most of them in a singel fight and my dps and hps is just fine. I guess it really depends on the skill of the player. The druid class is a very complex role in a group. If you want a class that only requires the IQ of Room temperature then play any other class.Thats why we have multiple character slots, its not like it so difficult to get to the high end with an alt these days. &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>Shaman takes lead on Nukes...</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=druidbalance&amp;message.id=10020#M10020</link>
      <description>I was&#xD;
surprised to see a shaman landing some rather high crits in a group the&#xD;
other day, so I looked up a few spells on Lucy and was startled to see their "&lt;a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=10017&amp;amp;source=Live" target=_blank&gt;Sting of the Queen&lt;/a&gt;" (73rd level) is higher base damage than our nuke "&lt;a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=10017&amp;amp;source=Live" target=_blank&gt;Equinox Burn&lt;/a&gt;"&#xD;
(74th). Not only is it over a hundred dmg higher at tier1, but it actually costs&#xD;
a bit *less* mana and has a cast time of &lt;u&gt;0.5&lt;/u&gt; with a 12 second recast.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
So theirs is a near-instant nuke which leaves them time for&#xD;
alternately casting dots, slows, resist debuffs, heals, or whatever they're doing&#xD;
besides nuking.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Sting of the Queen: 581 mana, &lt;b&gt;2890&lt;/b&gt; dmg, 0.5 cast, -20 resist mod&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Equinox Burn: 586 mana, &lt;b&gt;2752&lt;/b&gt; dmg, 6.3 cast, 0 resist mod.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Along the way, shaman had already become almost equal with druids in healing,&#xD;
while remaining significantly better at curing disease/poison, while&#xD;
also staying far ahead on DoTs, not to mention they can regenerate far more mana than druids&#xD;
with minimal effort. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But now they get better nukes too?&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;No disrespect intended towards Fenier or other beta druids, but I sure hope they had fun testing quests, tradeskills, or whatever they were focusing on --&#xD;
because for spells, somebody at SOE really dropped the ball and it rolled right off the field without notice. Our class got the short end of several&#xD;
sticks this expansion. &lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

      <title>Swarm of Fireants Nerfed?</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=druidbalance&amp;message.id=10008#M10008</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I could swear I saw Swarm of the Fireants doing like 550ish per tick damage and was finally happy that the line had sorta been unnerfed as it was nerfed in its damage per tick during the reennerfing ("reinvisioning").&amp;nbsp; At 364 per tick, this is once again barely an upgrade, and heck we had LDON dots that pre renerfing wer dong 350 per tick a long time ago.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;With nec dots doing 700-1K in dod and before, is it too much to ask to move our dots a bit more in line?&amp;nbsp; Max damage base is 3,276, but should be 50-100% above our next highest damage spell or 500-600 per tick, and the fire one should be up in the 700 range.&amp;nbsp; Note, nec nukes have not fallen behind our nukes and in fact close the gap a bit, but our dots are not keeping up.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Keep in mind, nobody in a raid is going to be able to stack 2-3+ dots and nukes anyway unless they are in full dps mode, and its not like this is gong to affect our group dps that much cause no time to stack a ton of dots, so will basically help us in solo/duo situations and raid.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The new ranger dot I think is in the 324 per tick range (which frankly I think is more then reasonablly scaled with 70+ content, so not only are we losing ground to necs/shammies/sk's in dots (not sure about encs etc), but rangers who have typically been about 10+ levels behind us in their dots.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Swarm of The Fireants&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;I&gt;Magic-based DoT&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Cast: 3.0 sec&lt;BR&gt;Resist: Magic (-100)&lt;BR&gt;Duration: 9 ticks&lt;BR&gt;&lt;A href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=9878" target=_blank&gt;&lt;FONT color=#990033&gt;Rank 1:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt; Mana: 561, MR Dmg: 364/tick&lt;BR&gt;&lt;A href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=9879" target=_blank&gt;&lt;FONT color=#990033&gt;Rank 2:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt; Mana: 584, MR dmg: 379/tick&lt;BR&gt;&lt;A href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=9880" target=_blank&gt;&lt;FONT color=#990033&gt;Rank 3:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt; Mana: 604, MR dmg: 393/tick&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
