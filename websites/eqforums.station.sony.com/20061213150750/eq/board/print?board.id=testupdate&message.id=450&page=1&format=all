				It's been a while since I've summarized the major changes to Test so here's a brief list of some of the more significant <font color="#cc0000"><b>CODE</b></font> changes that have gone to test lately. Note: Not design data, ie nothing related to item stats, spells or events.<br><br>The usual disclaimers apply: This code is on Test, not Live, there is no promise of this going to live servers, these may only be relevant to test server, etc etc.<br><br>The goal of these posts is to help players on Test know what has been going on with the code so they can try to find bugs in the changes if they are so inclined. If you do find bugs, please do /bug them. We do read the bug reports, every day.<br><br><br><ul><li>The advanced display options window now has an option to enable streaming of textures for visible equipment (the equipment you weild or wear). This saves a good chunk of memory when enabled. Different systems may incur varying degrees of framerate hitch when loads occur and the current settings are to load only one texture per frame (this will likely be tuned over the next couple days). Note that if many textures are required there will be a few frames where items have a default texture on them. The default setting for item texture streaming is off, which should leave the game performing as it did prior to this change where all global assets are loaded at startup time like they always have been. While the texture streaming subsystem can be eventually used throughout the game to further reduce memory requirements, it's currently only set up to enable streaming on player equipment.&nbsp; We're really hoping players test this out because moving forward this will be an important part of managing the large number of global assets we have in EverQuest.<br></li><li>If you die and are going to re-spawn in the same zone, you will no longer zone. All aggro and other side effects of death will remain the same, we are just eliminating the client needlessly reloading datafiles it doesn't need to and the redundant zoning process. Please do look for any misbehavior with this code if you can.<br></li><li>Players can now be resurrected while in the limbo dead state. (ie dead hovering over corpse)</li><li>Chat channels: The "[" key does not auto go to the text box - FIXED</li><li>UI: Players are unable to set up any chat channels to be the default channel in a chat window - FIXED</li><li>Internals of the spell casting system have been cleaned up a bit, please /bug any unusual new spell behavior.</li><li>Network code has had some optimizations made, you may notice less network lag. About 50% less data is sent by the zone to the client, on average, than before.<br></li><li>Movement of flying or swimming NPCs has been improved to properly deal with vertical movement. This corrects a long standing problem with NPCs warping vertically when swimming or flying. <br></li><li>Stability fixes for the zone &amp; client problems that occurred earlier this week have been made.<br></li></ul><br>Last but not least, thanks for your patience with dealing with the test server stability over the past couple days. While we try to keep test as stable as possible sometimes it just doesn't work out that way. We've identified and corrected the problems that started on Monday's update and the situation should be much better now.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>
