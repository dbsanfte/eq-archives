    <description>Could someone at Sony please confirm that boats were taken out of the game due to TECHNICAL ISSUES, not because people hated riding them.&amp;nbsp; I'm getting tired of reading posts of people asking for the boats back as if Sony took them out for the fun of it (or lack thereof).&amp;nbsp; /sigh&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yeah, I'm ranting. :P&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt; I don't recall enjoying boat rides. You couldn't even fish. The only good thing about them was that it took just as long to get from Freeport to Butcherblock as it did for me to take a shower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So boats were good for my roommates.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Back in '99 when EQs graphics engine was near state of the art, spoiler sites hardly existed and travel ANYWHERE was an adventure; boats were a rather beautiful and exciting way to travel. I *STILL* can remember my first sighting of Freeport harbour having traveled all the way from Akanon (sans SoW, maps or twinking....quite something at level 8 or so).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'd STILL travel on them for sentimental reasons so heres hoping you can get them back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As an aside : its a shame the boats mechanics wernt used more - an interzonal NPC (presumably actually 3 NPCs kept in sync across zones)  that people could ride upon - cool! Why did the Akanon spider never got increased in size, shipped to Antonica and used as a form of overland transport? *grin*&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;There already are. Freeport, Butcherblock, Dulak's Harbor and (I think) Overthere all have Static Boats at their docks, possibly other zones as well.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;If boats don't work, I think it'd be a good idea to put the TL gnomes on a timer Nexus Scion style like someone said in an earlier thread. maybe have it go off every 10-15 minutes.  It wouldn't be the same but at least we'd have that downtime to interact with other players/fish that we won't get by just running up and going&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;HAIL A_GNOME_01&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;what ocean of tears&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;So go fish in pond in Plane of Knowledge instead of the Butcherblock docks, if all you want is player interaction. Still get fishing skill ups, and there are a ton more people nearby for you to interact with.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;They need to make a server that is nothing but PoK with about 300 books in it that lead to instance versions of all the zones to please all the anti-classic folks.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And then make a classic server for those of us that actually want a living breathing &amp;quot;realistic&amp;quot; game world to play in.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;I'd like to see both the boats and the gnomes in the game.  The boats would be there on a permanent basis.  You may have to wait awhile, but eventually they'll show up for your journey across the great blue.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Waiting on the docks for that very same boat is Gnom E'Kabob.  He just so happens to be a powerful tinkerer who has invented a device for teleporting.  He invented it so that folks could make it across the oceans much faster than traveling by ship.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;However, being a gnome, he has a problem.  His device to translocate you from Freeport to OoT to Butcherblock requires a few parts to be comlete.  One part is commonly found off of clockwork spiders in Steamfont.  Another part, a small piece of copper, is found only in Blackburrow.  If you would gather these two parts just once for Gnom, he will gladly translocate you anytime you are in a hurry.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Aka, you have to actually ride the boat across OoT to get to Steamfont (if you are Antonica based) for a quest piece, and have to ride the boat across OoT (if you are from Fay) to get the other quest piece.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Once you have done so, you are flagged for the translocater, and have the option of taking the boat or being translocated.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current EQ is not entirely boat-free. Although they don't cross zones, we have the canoes in OOT and the Gwenayne in Halas. I suppose they don't share the same coding as the boats that are in &amp;quot;dry dock&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was (perhaps mistakenly) under the impression that it was a bug in the collision system that broke the boats, possibly the same one that used to make it hard to get out of the water?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I remember boarding a boat to the Abysmal Sea, and watching it slide out from under me when it departed. The Gwenayne at Halas did the same thing. I wonder if that was the bug that finally did it, or if it was just one of many?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wonder if the Gwenayne is usable again? Has anyone tried it?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the love of God lets not put boats back , you guys are freakin crazy. I don´t want to spend another hour travelling from one zone to another on the off chance there´s a group there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not to mention the mental scarrs it would bring back of when I was playing the Uk on my 33k modem and I´d take 10 minutes to zone and by the time I got zoned to the other side I´d completely missed the freakin boat and had to try again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fishing part was clearly said by someone who forgot that u´d get that msg saying u´re moving so you couldn´t fish properly, and the only real interaction with other players was trying to figure out why you all got slaughtered by some big monster thingy 1/2 way along your trip and wondering how the hell you were gonna get your body back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I appreciate your nostalgia, but it´s misplaced. if you want to interact, go to the EC tunnel and join another guy who´s gonna sit there for 8 hours trying to see his banded armour and and learn languages from eachother, or go to freeport and fish there or something, lets no subject the rest of the server to having to pay druids OBSCENE amounts of money for ports like we used to end up doing in the old days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are some really good reasons to have the old continent become useful again, this is not one of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;/shrug, i genuinely liked the boats, they are by far one of my fondest eq memories, id love to see them back and the TL npcs permakilled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;i like the feeling of a real world and of distance travled, but then i can also see why some people would just like to be choose what zone they load in at the char select screen~&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I agree with Arderd.  It's a progressive server, right?  I like my gnomes :)</description>
