    <title>Test Server Update 4/14/2005</title>
    <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=testupdate&amp;message.id=334</link>
    <description>Test was primarily patched to fix the issues with Tradeskills, they should now work as expected.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also included in this patch are:&lt;br&gt;  - Updates to the Atlas window.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  - Updates to the mail system including:&lt;br&gt;      Mail Window:&lt;br&gt;        - New options and address book buttons&lt;br&gt;        - A "Reply To All" button&lt;br&gt;        - A "To" field that is visible in the view pane when reading your e-mail&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;      Mail Composition Window:&lt;br&gt;        - A from field that displays who you are as you send the e-mail (since you can now quickly switch between the mailboxes of all your characters on that server).&lt;br&gt;        - You can now send to multiple recipients by seperating their names with commas (or using an address book name)&lt;br&gt;        - A "synch" button to synchronize your TO field and address book.  This helps adds entries to your address book, or update old ones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;      Address Book Window:&lt;br&gt;        - You can add names, addresses, and notes&lt;br&gt;        - A checkbox "Private" that means during address expansion, the addresses will appear individually - not as the address book name for the group of addresses.&lt;br&gt;        - Automatic update of the "guild" address (this sends a messages to all guild members).  If anybody joins/leaves the guild, this is updated in the address book.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;      Options:&lt;br&gt;        - An address book filename, configurable per character.&lt;br&gt;        - Selecting an existing address will load that address book.&lt;br&gt;        - Selecting a new address book filename will save the current address book to that file.&lt;br&gt;        - Mail forwarding.  If this is turned on, it will forward your characters e-mail to the e-mail address you have registered with your Station Account.&lt;br&gt;        - Audio and text notifications of new e-mail.</description>
