				As far as "original purpose" most of the Charms I have seen still are non-constant.&nbsp; Whether they are based on Gear worn, Weight Carried, Time in a Zone or the most constant Languages Known they all seem very clearly in the same family as "how much cloth armor you wore".&nbsp;&nbsp; While these all have higher potentials than the original I dont think they "bastardize" the original concept at all.<br><br>As far as augments for the slot, the reason people dont want to spend "months in Loast Dungeons" might be because they dont enjoy it and its old.&nbsp; New content, new rewards, not a new concept.&nbsp; Theoretically, if they could code it, theres no reason the Charm Slot Augs couldnt use the same mechanic, a variable based upon some condition.&nbsp; The original Poster is only concerened with theoretical potentials.&nbsp; I doubt he(she) would turn away from a charm with a potential equal to a non charm aug's stats but based on a charm's cariable mechanic of its own.<br><br>The most amusing thing here is really your tone.&nbsp; You obviously loathe raid content and the people who enjoy it, hence the name calling.&nbsp; I'm not sure why you think raiding is a shortcut, but as far as I can see, its no shorter than LDoN would be assuming they didnt place the augs on the first raid level mobs within the content.&nbsp; My guild raids 6 days a week 5ish hours a day, I could finish many LDoNs in this time if thats what I thought was fun.&nbsp; However, I dont enjoy them, I enjoy raiding new content with scripts that make the events seem odd compared to me joining some people and mass slaughtering 100 mobs in a dungeon repeatedly.&nbsp; That just doesnt amuse me after doing the few in each area that I have done.<br><br>In the end the OP simply posted their opinion that the Devs add more powerful augment options via raiding like they have for pretty much every other item slot in the game.&nbsp; I am happy with my DoDH charm aug, but I wouldnt refuse the ability to raid for better augs either.&nbsp; I personally think the Charm slot should be given over to the Tradeskillers, with each different skill making a different style of Charm, and the "best" Charms be aquired via people making attunable items and selling them<br><br><br><div></div>
