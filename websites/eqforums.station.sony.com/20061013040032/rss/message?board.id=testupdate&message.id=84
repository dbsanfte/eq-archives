      <description>Just a few quick notes about what went in recently, this isn't a comprehensive list of everything that's been done lately by any stretch but I wanted to share what I had the time to gather up so that people on Test can know what to check out. Note that some of these bugs are specific to Test only.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- The new audio triggers window is now available to Test. It can be accessed via the EQ menu or you can create a hotkey for it in the Options window. There is a help button on the audio trigger window that explains all the details.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Some more fixes to the new mouse code have been made. We're still working through what we hope are the last of the related issues, please keep /bugging them as you see them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Mounts should again be disappearing when you try to make them swim.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Clickable items should be working in no combat zones again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Guild invites for shrouded players have had the text corrected.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Removed the taunt hotkey from new berzerkers (they never had the ability, shouldn't have had the hotkey)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Large mobs (especially giants) will no longer warp on top of players when fighting. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- The compass window has been modified slightly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- After mouse look is used, the mouse is moved to where it was at the beginning of the mouse look action.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Fixed a bug where mouse was considered active and windows could be moved even though EverQuest was in the background.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- DoD zones have been added to the Atlas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Changed the XML for the chat window to allow p, g, and q to be correctly rendered (they were being cut off).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Personal Tribute should now deactivate while not playing the main character (ie shrouded or monster mission)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Taking a lower level shroud while tribute is activated no longer wipes tribute choices.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- If you augment an evolving items, you can again view "final result" of the item.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Options Window: Players were only seeing the first 25 text color options listedâ€¦  Fixed&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Fixed- If the user died with an item on their cursor, the user would not be able to remove gold from their bank. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Fixed- Boar Mount: Boar is being summoned even if player is not able to do so.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Players in template form (spirit shroud/monster mission) will no longer auto-join a class chat channel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Fixed a crash problem with Find.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Fixed- Spirit Shroud: When in low level shroud form any leadership abilities above four were lost when leaving shroud form.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Fixed- Bandaging other players was not giving any healing effect.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Fixed- NPC:Seru's animations were broken.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Fixed- Pets: HP items were no longer adding to the maximum health of pets. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Fixed- Atlas: Grobb is labeled as Gukta on Atlas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Fixed- Code: If a character dies while LD, Charmed or Feared the corpse can not be dragged by anyone except the owner.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Three new commands have been added:&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;/www &lt;i&gt;website&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;  - Causes your system's web browser to open up the specified website. Note that in fullscreen mode this will make you leave fullscreen when the browser pops up.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;/url &lt;i&gt;URL&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; - Activates the specified URL, which may be something other than a http:// URL, such as an ftp:// URL.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;/system &lt;i&gt;command [arguments]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; - Execute the specified system command. This is functionally identical to opening a command prompt and typing the command directly. NOTE THAT THIS IS A POWER USER COMMAND, and because we don't want an inexperienced computer user to be fooled into doing something they shouldn't do, the user must manually edit their eqclient.ini to enable this command. The help for this command (just type /system by itself) explains what exactly needs to be done to enable this command. The anticipated use for this is for people to make hotkeys to control various popular voice chat software, but due to the general nature of this command it can be used for a lot of things. Using this command, people who use those types of applications can control them via hotkeys configured to run system commands as required by those applications.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks for playing on Test!&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Grumbuk-Dev on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;10-06-2005&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;10:26 AM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

      <description>Yay thanks for mostly meaningless changes! Glad you finally got around to fixing the animations on a mob that people one group for twink loot. How about you guys fix some of the real problems in this expansion:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. The loot on the Council of Nine, Emperor Draygun, Sendai, and Vule events is underpowered.&lt;br&gt;These events are EASILY harder then just about any Anguish encounter except for&lt;br&gt;OMM, yet they have at least 20 less hp/mana, and many of them lack any focus&lt;br&gt;effects (IE the cloth hat from the council).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. Mobs give too little xp. A mob in riftseekers usually nets between 6 and 7&lt;br&gt;percent of an AA per kill. Mobs in ilsilin and the hive have much more hp and roughly the same dps only give 4% per kill. Is this an attempt to keep the old zones in use, or do you just not want people grinding out AA in DoDH.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3. The mission chains are too hard. I have roughly 12500 hp and 2700 ac unbuffed,&lt;br&gt;max shielding, BBoB/2.0 and I was comfortable tanking the regular versions of the&lt;br&gt;the spell missions. I never had any close calls except when we got adds&lt;br&gt;midfight. That, however, means that the average tank from a non-raiding guild is&lt;br&gt;probably going to have a very very rough time of things, if they are even able to&lt;br&gt;do it at all without doubling up on clerics or other siliness. Are these new&lt;br&gt;abilities only meant to be obtained by raiding guilds?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4. The rewards for the some of the regular spell missions suck. I have done every mission in the kelliad, brovil, and jazzard lines and I have destroyed every single reward. Some of the rewards (like the first few 68s) are in line with the difficulty of the missions. Most of the rewards are absolute trash for any players that have the gear required to beat the missions. I realize MPG single group trials have lockouts, but some of the missions are easily harder then mpg trials and give far, far worse loots. It would be nice to even have a melee item with a click effect, like the one caster item. Then at least I would have reason to keep a SINGLE reward out of the FIFTEEN missions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;5. There is no reason to redo most missions. Once you finish a chain there is no reason to redo an part of it except to help someone else get their spell. So what is going to happen to lower level or new players when they reach the levels required for these? If they dont have guildmates to help them through, they are SoL. With the crappy xp, long times, and poor rewards they give I know I will not be redoing any of them except to help a guildmate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;6. Emperor Draygun needs a warning emote like ture when he changes forms. With the amount of damage he heals when he is split, it makes the fight more difficult then it should be. His original form was far to easy, this new form we havnt gotten below 70ish and we kill vishmitar almost every week. Not only does it place an undue amount of stress on the healers (heal tank, heal add tanks, heal draygun to damage him), but it negates necromancer dps because you cant have dots on him when he changes forms or you are screwed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;7. The council of nine effect doesnt reduce melee mitigation by the intended amount. It also cancels all effects of shielding and negates the use of defensive so you have to figure the mitigation will be at LEAST +35% due to no shielding. Not only that but a 36 man limit on a progression event is the essence of retardation. Nothing like telling half the guild to sit out because we dont have 18 active clerics and 10 warriors it would take to do two events at once safely. I have every confidence that we will beat it in its current form (21% is our best so far), but this encounter is overly difficult for something that is supposed to be this expansions version of an MPG raid.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;8. What is the deal with the stupid 36 man and 24 man raids? After PoP when GoD came out everyone complained about 54 man raids and having people sit out. Now after most guilds have trimmed down and built themselves around a 54 man limit, you lower it from there too? That is retarded.</description>

      <description>Yea dont get me started on the new expansion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Has anyone seen the drops from the nameds?  haha its rediculous.&lt;br&gt;Anyone that can kill those nameds is NOT going to need those drops as upgrades.  Hell the augs that drop off some of them arnt even as good as the ones that drop in the trials for Kodtaz access.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;The rewards given for the spell missions are plainly ridiculus.. Honestly.. you wont have ANY tank doing all those missions without being AT LEAST ep geared. I mean.. sure.. i could easily live with the 70 missions requiring Qvic+ geared peeps to complete (on normal), as the spell could be some kind of new ancient or whatnot.. but.. to even consider getting your 68 and 69 spells, it is no way in h.. that you can even consider getting those spells at their respective levels unless you have 5 friends of lvl 70 with EP+ gear dragging you through.. on normal mode of course. And even THEN most of the rewards would most likely not be a upgrade.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Just take the 68 mission #3 (dont remember name) where you get to a instanced version of stoneroot falls, and eventually fight a named spider boss that gets harder the more hp it looses.. at 10% and lower it hits for 3K+ ! And behold.. what do i see in a chest.. a plate bp with 59 ac and 120 or so hp!! yay.. I mean.. suuuure.. the tank tanking that 3K+ hitting mob would surely use that bp as a upgrade.. or the cleric.. or.. uhm.. kinda noone would even consider it tho.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Well.. if the "normal" mode was just a wee bit easier than it is of now, i guess the item rewards be "in-line".. but its the same rewards doing the missions in hard mode too.. i mean.. what gives? Anquish geared peeps doing theese missions on hard mode to get a challenge out of it, dont really consider a 9ac 110 hp necklace with no effects on it as a upgrade tho..&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Its a shame.. truly a shame.. Not to mention the posts popping up about evolving items taking insane long time to "level-up".. 1 aa per 1% xp gained on them? What is the point? For a sword with 5 levels on it.. am i really supposed to not see the end result until i made like 500 aa?? Really? I sure hope there is some bug, or some other mean to gain xp for those items than that. Oh.. i guess you wont earn any evolving item xp when you do monster missions.. as it aint equipped then tho..&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;I have a warrior who went ding 70 today, and as such has few AA, and group based gear.&amp;nbsp; However reading what Zeroe-X wrote about this mob there is NO way i could tank this.&amp;nbsp; I have about 6khp with my clicky buffs, so being able to tank this mob i out of the question.&amp;nbsp; However, despite the fact this spider is way to powerful for me to fight, there is NO way i would use that breastplate as a 70 warrior (and I am pretty sure i must be the worst geared 70 war in all of eq at the moment) as my ornate breastplate (available from about 6 expansions ago at level 62) is better than this.&amp;nbsp; And by a long way.&amp;nbsp; please sort out loot and mob difficulty.&amp;nbsp; This is just stupid.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>Thanks for the update Grumbuk...its great knowing these details.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for the whiners, give it a rest will ya?  If those bugs and your other concerns are that important to you then go play another game or provide some feedback that's constructive in nature.  Don't get on here and give devs flak for taking the time out of their busy day to give the community updates.  Totally rude and uncalled for.</description>

      <description>The dev who updates the code - and is nice enough to take the time to tell us what he did - is NOT the same dev who does the loot or the mission difficulty.  Go start a new thread to whine in [I agree with some of the comments but maintain that this isn't the place for them] this one is about changes that are currently on Test.</description>

      <description>Not only the devs who made the message read these forums. And information can be passed along through the devs as well.</description>

      <description>Aye.  First choice here would be just to upgrade the drops.  Lowering the difficulty = boo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And yea, after they fix that hopefully they can work on FIXING TEST.</description>

      <description>WOW NICE...&lt;br&gt;SO NICE...&lt;br&gt;smell the sarcasm yet?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Im sorry to be an a$$ but seriously...  there are MUCH MORE important changes for you guys to be working on.&lt;br&gt;You want honest feedback?&lt;br&gt;I think your trying to do nothing more than BAIT a heated response with this post.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A couple months ago you posted about some ideas you had to make test better, you were on the right track.. your heart was in the right place.&lt;br&gt;What the HELL is going on with those now?! nothing? ignored?&lt;br&gt;Come on.  You are doing NOTHING but teasing the people that play on test server.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That is all you do for test anymore.  You tease us.&lt;br&gt;You say no one will ever be moved off.  Then move some off, but deny it and try to cover it up.&lt;br&gt;You make a post about how you want to be able to do copy invites for people, then say copies will never happen.&lt;br&gt;I log on, and see nothing more than a copy zerker in the arena with his 2.0 parsing away, while i stare at my 1.5 and /who all a population of 14.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That is all you do is tease us? bait us? is this intentional?</description>

      <description>Honestly are you trying to make people quit?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;beacuse many that have been on since release have left already.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Smart moves you make to drop such loyal customers and supporters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;and then you want us to vote for you for WalkOfGame... /laugh.</description>
