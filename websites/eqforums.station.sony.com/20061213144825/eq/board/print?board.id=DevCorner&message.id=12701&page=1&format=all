<DIV>Prismatic Ring of Resistance - AC + Resist clickie</DIV>
<DIV>Stormeye Band&nbsp; - The clickie is not important, but this is an inventory instant clickie</DIV>

<DIV>As a note, I didn't give anything a 10 because so many of the listed statistics have caps, so a balance with fairly great amounts of everything, but not excessive, still adds up quickly.</DIV><p>Message Edited by Haliken-Innoruuk on <span class=date_text>07-06-2006</span> <span class=time_text>01:02 PM</span>

				<DIV>CLASS:&nbsp; Ranger</DIV>
<DIV>Raiding Experience : Guild recently got into Txevu, we've killed a couple named in there but have yet to make a serious drive towards the boss of the zone (and Tacvi access)</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>HP:&nbsp;&nbsp; Very Important<BR>Mana:&nbsp; Middle importance.&nbsp; Recast on our nukes puts me low only if I don't have a mana regen buff, or if I'm burning Hail of Arrows as fast as I can<BR>Endurance:&nbsp; Zero Importance<BR>AC:&nbsp;&nbsp; Important.&nbsp; It helps when soloing if not bow kiting, and also helps when assisting as a Tank Mezzer</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>HP Regen:&nbsp; Unimportant<BR>Mana Regen:&nbsp; Middle importance.&nbsp; Not that hard to cap, but recast on most nukes make it harder to run out of mana<BR>Endurance Regen:&nbsp; Zero Importance</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Strength:&nbsp; Middle importance until capped; afterwords, only importance is in keeping capped.<BR>Stamina:&nbsp; Very Important.&nbsp; More Sta = more HP.&nbsp; One of three most important stats to try to keep capped, or to get capped.&nbsp; After capped, only importance on gear is in keeping it capped.<BR>Agility:&nbsp; Unimportant.&nbsp; Little impact upon defensive abilities that I've noticed.</DIV>
<DIV>Dexterity:&nbsp; Very Important.&nbsp; One of three most important stats to try to keep capped, or to get capped.&nbsp; After capped, only importance on gear is in keeping it capped.<BR>Charisma:&nbsp; Unimportant.<BR>Intelligence: Zero Importance<BR>Wisdom: Very Important.&nbsp; One of three most important stats to try to keep capped, or to get capped.&nbsp; Third of these character stats after Sta and Dex.&nbsp; After capped, only importance on gear is in keeping it capped.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Cold Resist: <BR>Disease Resist: <BR>Poison Resist: <BR>Magic Resist: <BR>Fire Resist: </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>All resists are equally important.&nbsp; I don't look at these Very Important statistics when looking at gear however, because for the most part resists tend to go upwards as one acquires more and better gear from raids.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Attack:&nbsp; Very Important until one exceeds the cap, then only importance is in keeping at or near the cap<BR>Delay:&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>Damage: <BR>Range: </DIV>
<DIV>Haste:&nbsp; Important.&nbsp; Melee need to keep one (or two, or maybe even three) haste items on them to allow all but one to be upgraded with a non-haste item, but so long as there is at least one worn haste item, the presence of haste on any other potential upgrade is moot (especially with Enchanter haste spells being as high haste as they are).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The other stats in this grouping seem to be intended for weapons.&nbsp; Obviously, a high Range for a ranged attack is desireable - it helps to have a greater pulling range, especially with mob runspeeds nowadays, and the potential to avoid some mob AE's by using ranged instead of melee combat can permit the healers to concentrate more on those who cannot avoid the AE's thusly.&nbsp; Weapon Damage is Important in and of itself.&nbsp; Weapon Delay is also Important in and of itself (high delays on 2 handers reduce the number of ripostes taken and increase the Damage Bonus per hit, and low delays on one handers increase both the number of ripostes taken and the number of times per minute that the Damage Bonus is applied).&nbsp; Taken together, however, you get the Very Important Damage/Delay ratio.&nbsp; The ratio is of more importance than either the damage or the delay is, on their own.&nbsp; As a note, for archery attacks, the Damage on the arrow is Very Important (as opposed to just Important) because it is added to the damage of the bow when the game determines how hard that particular attack hit.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Combat Effects: More procs.&nbsp; 'nuff said.<BR>Shielding: Helps tanks more than it does me.&nbsp; I'll take it, but its Unimportant.<BR>Stun Resist: Helps tanks more than it does me.&nbsp; I'll take it, but its Unimportant.<BR>Strikethrough: Important.&nbsp; Worth keeping between the 25% and 35% marks if possible to do so without augs, especially as I don't get any Strikethrough AA's.<BR>Spell Shield:&nbsp;Important.&nbsp; Reduces the damage from AE nukes that I cannot avoid while raiding.&nbsp; Outside of raids, Unimportant because mobs don't tend to nuke that badly.<BR>Avoidance: Important.&nbsp; see AC.<BR>Accuracy: Important.&nbsp; Fewer misses means more damage dealt in the same amount of time.<BR>DOT Shielding: Important, but only for raiding, as few mobs outside of raids seem to bother with dots, and those that do can typically be cureed by the group in short order (unlike raids where the healers are busy concentrating on the tanks).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Skill Mods: Not sure if weapon skill mods do much of anything.&nbsp; Other skill mods, such as Dodge, Parry, Riposte, and tradeskill mods, can be useful depending on the skill being modified and how often it is used.&nbsp; The Parry +4% mod on my arms that I got in Time, for example, only help when I'm being attacked.<BR>Click Effects: Depends on the effect.<BR>Proc Effects: Depends on the effect.&nbsp; I'm partial to lifetaps, personally, as are many rangers and beastlords in my guild.&nbsp; Most tanks I know prefer stun or other aggro procs though.<BR>Worn Effects: Faerune is an important worn effect, for both the vision and the Enduring Breath component, but only one (or two, for freedom of upgrade purposes) is needed.&nbsp; Most other worn effects have since been changed over to stats (worn ATK, worn Regen, mana regen, etc.) so not too sure what you're looking for here.<BR>Focus Effects: Important.&nbsp; I've even given up an aug slot for Improved Heal V.&nbsp; Improved Damage foci are very useful for nukes, and Burning Affliction foci are very useful for dots (not that I've got many of those heh).&nbsp; The Omens change from ID and BA to elemental-specific nuke and dot combined foci makes it harder to find the appropriate foci for some casters, though the ranger 1.5 and 2.0 have made this a lot easer for me personally.&nbsp; The melee foci are also Important.&nbsp; However, I will sacrifice a melee or spell focus on a piece of gear if the new piece of gear is a clear AC and HP upgrade, especially if the new piece has more HP unaugged than my old piece did augged.&nbsp; The AAAA crafted augs are a very nice method of obtaining foci.</DIV>

				<DIV></DIV>CLASS: Monk
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>HP: (nice, but don't bother, we aren't really used as a tank class so we don't need tons of HP to stand around with a mob and wait on a heal)<BR>Mana: (don't have any so don't bother)<BR>Endurance: 250 (Need Upped quite a bit as that we have no time to med and regain since we are pulling)<BR>AC: 70 (Need Upped quite a bit to prevent being hit as often while pulling)</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>HP Regen: (nice, but don't bother, we need healed in spurts and sitting around waiting on HP isn't something we are really wanting to do or going to do when we have healer watching over us, give it to necros who are trying to counter a side affect)<BR>Mana Regen: (umm... don't bother, again don't have any, don't want any)<BR>Endurance Regen: +4 or +5 (need serious attention in monks who spend our days serving up mobs to people sitting on their butts)</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Strength: 15 (nice for hitting mobs, not so nice for equipment weight, maybe add in a calculation to add a little tolerance to a monks weight restrictions)<BR>Stamina: (Same as HP)<BR>Agility: 20 (the higher the better, need items that concentrate primarily here and Dex)<BR>Dexterity: 20 (the higher the better, need items that concentrate primarily here and Agi)<BR>Charisma: (nice, but don't bother, isn't it part of a class description to be a hermit and not be good with people, vow of poverty, etc...)<BR>Intelligence: (don't bother)<BR>Wisdom: (don't bother)</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Cold Resist: +20 (Higher the better nothing sucks worse then being nuked in the back by a mob)<BR>Disease Resist: +20 (Higher the better nothing sucks worse then being nuked in the back by a mob)<BR>Poison Resist: +20 (Higher the better nothing sucks worse then being nuked in the back by a mob)<BR>Magic Resist: +20 (Higher the better nothing sucks worse then being nuked in the back by a mob)<BR>Fire Resist: +20 (Higher the better nothing sucks worse then being nuked in the back by a mob)<BR></DIV>
<DIV>Attack: +25 (we don't get as much time to DPS as everyone else a lot of the time so might as well make our hits count)<BR>Delay: 5 (need to lower this for the same reasons as above, not to mention we were always suppose to be fast)<BR>Damage: 55 (might be good to give us a bit more to give us more bang for our buck for when we do get a chance to DPS)<BR>Range: 250 is good, gives me a good head start as it always seems that the mobs are faster than me</DIV>
<DIV>Haste: 60% (have you ever thought about letting this stack for a monk)</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Combat Effects: +25 (nice, as I have stated it would be nice to do the same amount of damage as everyone else, since I get so little time)<BR>Shielding: +25 (not nice getting smacked in the back of the head while looking for your group during a pull)<BR>Stun Resist: +25 (nice and great for pulling)<BR>Strikethrough: +25 (I think this ability was made for a monk)<BR>Spell Shield: +25 (not nice getting nuked in the back by a mob)<BR>Avoidance: +25 (yup, I'm not meant to take a hit, I'm just not suppose to get hit at all)<BR>Accuracy: +25 (sure, but I swear all these new abilities are so low in how many points we can get off a piece of armor then why bother)<BR>DOT Shielding: +25 (yikes, ya, need it, second most likely to be DoTTed (tank first), since we are the first to say high to a mob, just ask the undead in Arcstone... first dot, then follow is their golden rule)</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Skill Mods: (to me this is for lower level equipment only and should be more promenant then say stats on lower level equipment and definitely should be found on all low level monk equipment as we have lots of skills that need to be worked on)<BR>Click Effects: (nope, already have a lot going on)<BR>Proc Effects: (yup, this is the way to go with my busy schedule)<BR>Worn Effects: (yup, always nice to have perma-see invis or perma-breath underwater just incase I FD while pulling through a mud puddle)<BR>Focus Effects: (nope, not a caster)<BR></DIV>

<DIV>CLASS: ROGUE</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>As a rogue that is raiding the end game there are only really&nbsp;two things that I look for in loot.&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>1. dps</DIV>
<DIV>How will it increase my dps?&nbsp; My attack is maxed so untill the cap is increased there isn't really anything I can do there.&nbsp;&nbsp; However over on the rogue boards they have parsed that for ever 10 attack I gain roughly 1dps so the more attack the better.</DIV>
<DIV>Accuracy...yes please</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>And the 1 big thing that is important in this area would be +bs damage.&nbsp; It pains me to have to keep my time bp because I am not yet maxed at 125.&nbsp; It was a great start that you guys added 3 items in demi plane with +bs damage on it thank you very much for that, but I just hope that there will be more options in the future.&nbsp; Having to wear gear that is from pop, god, and anguish because I can't afford to replace them due to the decrease in my dps (which is my main role I might add) is very discouraging.&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>So untill my main hand weapon choice is freed up from my 2.0 I will constantly look for other ways to increase my dps.&nbsp; Stagnation isn't good for water and it isn't good for my gear.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>2. Ways to keep my butt alive.</DIV>
<DIV>This would be via hp, or shielding, avoidance, dot shielding, spell shielding, ect....&nbsp; A dead rogue does no dps so I have to avoid agro first, and secondly I have to live through any ae ramp/spell ae that the mobs put out.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Really my stats are maxed so I don't pay attention to them anymore.&nbsp; My resists are very high and untill the cap is raised I won't bother with them.&nbsp; And ac? HA I don't tank there for I care not.</DIV>

				I've played an Enchanter since November of '99 with some breaks in between. Now I play at the top end raiding, so my perspective will be focused there. Mainly in relation to itemization, Enchanters are expected to do the same job they always have but on a very uneven playing field versus mobs compared to the other caster's jobs.<br><br>CLASS: Enchanter<br> <br>HP: Being one of the most frontline casters HP used to be more important than anything. However, as mob dmg went up exponentially, and gear only raised moderately, this went out of focus.<br>Mana: Now the lifeblood of all I do, mana is obviously the most vital to functioning. However, I rarely find my problems [death, et c.] come from a lack of mana<br>Endurance: No impact <br>AC: The caster cap has remain unchanged so long and the way silk classes mitigate make this almost useless. Perhaps thats an issue that needs to be fixed, rather than gear<br> <br>HP Regen: Downtime reducer, even with max regen its not enough to make it that worthwhile<br>Mana Regen: Obviously most important but hard caps make it overly abundant. <br>Endurance Regen: Not important to me, but its also nonexistant I think<br> <br>Strength: Helps me carry that 100k plat and thats about it<br>Stamina: Its important for me to have max sta because its more hp, thats about it<br>Agility: Not important to me<br>Dexterity: Also not important unless Im soloing with Lilac<br>Charisma: The myth stat of enchanters, I'm at the cap and I'd like to think it affected my mez and charm but I believe its such a small help its not important<br>Intelligence: More mana, more tradeskills help, easily capped<br>Wisdom: No relevance to me <br> <br>Resists: Always important but the way resists seem to work makes it not worth the effort to have them maxed for most new content. For old content though and exp groups, max resists are wondeful<br> <br>Combat Effects: No relevance<br>Shielding: Vital to an Ench, perhaps slightly harder to come by. While I'm sure everyone will scream for shielding, I think it would help enchanter survivability<br>Stun Resist: Vital, shaking off that stun during mez intense moments can be the saving factor. Every moment I'm stunned mobs are killing people<br>Strikethrough: No relevance<br>Spell Shield: Very useful and more easily gotten for casters<br>Avoidance: I loathe Avoidance; I'm so far past the cap and it seems they think if they throw an Avoid mod on something, they can leave off something actually useful.<br>Accuracy: No relevance<br>DOT Shielding: Like SS but rarer<br> <br>Skill Mods: Not enough, and the ones that exist don't do anything unless it raises your skill a certain amount. That 8% mod on Time robe is completely useless. The 12% mod on DP back actually does something though since it raises the skill enough points. <br>Click Effects: The few ench specific clickies have been nice, it would be nice to see some more in the future but we've been told they're too unbalancing<br>Proc Effects: No relevance, although I think any caster proc weapons should have a better mod since we suck, but then we might be meleeing all the time<br>Worn Effects: Can't think of any ench specific atm<br>Focus Effects: Probably one of the most frustrating factors of gear planning<br><br>Innoruuk's Irony: the tash focus, is on 2 items. One is from Anguish gloves and the other is an aug from a LDON raid that you can only con people into doing once because its so boring. See, this focus would have been great on DP class item... or you know, any other item option. <br><br>Reagent Conservation: Last seen on an anguish mask, and there was really nothing in between there and reagent conservation V or whatever it was, makes this a useful but almost nonexistant focus. You could always take away the peridots from our rune and alendar line,... but I figure this is a more viable option <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-wink.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0><br><br>Spell Specific mana pres: Seen on almost every DP class item... the 25% Mana preservation. I'm sorry but this is just ridiculous when almost everyone running around in these zones already is going to have 20% Mana pres. That 5% for ONE spell doesn't make it worthwhile. I pray this never shows up again and I'll leave it at that.<br><br>Since they seem set on keeping some focus' capped, perhaps in the higher end the focus range could be decreased. If you want to keep Detrimental Mana Pres at 20%, then say the focus in Demi could be 3-20%, DK could be 5-20%.<br><br>Really, looking back over the past 3 expansions items they are boring, unoriginal and provide very few options for some essential focus' [altho I will say Last Bloods helped this issue to an extent but also caused a bunch of other problems]. Obviously not every item can be a "WOW, I just HAVE to have that" but they are currently nonexistant. And a final note, cookie cutter items are NOT okay, and everyone notices it. It makes item design look lazy and like they don't really care about their job.

<P>Doh... Forgot about the Melee Focus Effects like Cleave and such... guess they need to be more promenant since I forgot they even existed refer to Wycca's post as he is got it down... mainly made this post so that you had a Lower End Monk example too... not everyone finds it easy to max all stats as a monk without getting penalties for weight.</P>
<P>And you missed that in your list of things to look at</P>
<P><FONT color=#ff0099 size=7>WEIGHT </FONT>is crucial to a monk, so on all those items you have labeled "Beast, Druid, Monk" make them light as that Beasts and Druids don't care how much they way... but I got to maintain my girlish figure.</P>

 </div>

 </div>

<div>Haste: Capped for years at 40 to 46.<br>
 </div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Combat Effects: Very important, especially in PvP pre-nerf of 2.0.<br>Shielding: Very important, especially in PvP, AE rampaging mobs, and pulling.&nbsp; Definitely not enough Shielding items for monks.<br>Stun Resist: Very important, especially in PvP<br>Strikethrough: Fairly important<br>Spell Shield: Fairly important<br>Avoidance: Very important, but there is an abundance of items with Avoidance.&nbsp; Is easy to cap.<br>Accuracy: Fairly important, but there is quite a few accuracy items available<br>DOT Shielding: Fairly important.<br>
 </div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Skill Mods: <br>Click Effects: Need more inventory slots available
if we have more clickies.&nbsp; Or possibly much longer buff timers.&nbsp;
Casters clickies are affected by Extended Enhancement, where as Pure
melee isn't.&nbsp; More overhaste clicky options too.<br>Proc Effects: Wish we were able to stun high level mobs, as well as monk 2.0 pre-PvP nerf.<br>Worn Effects: Fairly important.&nbsp; Need more Cleave 5+ gear available.<br>Focus Effects: Monks only have like 2 or 3 Focus that I've seen.&nbsp; Could use a lot more.<br>
-------<br>
<br>
Overall, however, I would like to see itemization equal out across the
board.&nbsp; It's sad to see a plate class get a BP from the exact same raid
mob, but it has 30 more AC, more hps, more resists, and usually more
mods (like Shielding, etc).&nbsp; For example, the Kess BP's.&nbsp; I don't think
gear should have the exact same stats/mods on them, but equal it out a
bit more.&nbsp; For example, if warriors get 100AC + 6% shielding BP, maybe
a different armor-type class would see a 50AC + 4% shielding + 4%
spellshield + 30 additional resists.<br>
<br>
I hope the input helps!<br>

				<div>Thanks for taking the time to do this. Here you go.<br>
<br>
-------<br>CLASS: Enchanter<br>
Progression Level: Tacvi/MPG Trials<br>
</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>HP: Critical.&nbsp; Enchanters get beat on more than any non-tank class.&nbsp; HPs give us a slim chance of surviving it.<br>Mana:
Irrelevant.&nbsp; My gear all has mana on it because gear at this level
does, but I never look at the numbers.&nbsp; I die before I run out of
mana 99% of the time. For that other 1%, there's Gather Mana.<br>Endurance: Obviously Irrelevant.<br>AC: Mostly irrelevant. The current returns on this are so laughable that I can't see giving it any priority.<br>
 </div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>HP Regen: Irrelevant for all useful intents and purposes.<br>Mana
Regen: Was once moderately important, now is another number I don't
even look at.&nbsp; I routinely catch myself looking at a piece of
gearing and thinking "Oh. That has mana regen on it."&nbsp; The cap is
so easy to reach at this level of progression that it's beside the
point.<br>Endurance Regen:&nbsp; This stat doesn't actually EXIST.<br>
 </div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Strength: Irrelevant.<br>Stamina: Good to keep at cap, but so easy at this gear level that it's irrelevant.<br>Agility: Less irrelevant than it used to be, but still not something I'd assign any great priority.<br>Dexterity: Completely worthless.<br>Charisma: Important, and surprisingly hard for an enchanter to keep at cap. <br>Intelligence: Irrelevant. I'm over my cap by something like 150pts.&nbsp; <br>Wisdom: Irrelevant.&nbsp; Not a stat for my class.<br>
 </div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Cold Resist: Moderately useful<br>Disease Resist: Moderately useful<br>Poison Resist: Moderately useful<br>Magic Resist: Moderately useful<br>Fire Resist: Moderately useful </div>

<div>&nbsp;<br>
Generally, unless I have on resist that is falling far behind the
others, I look at "total resists" rather than any single resist in
particular.<br>
<br>
</div>

<div>Attack: Irrelevant.<br>
Delay: Irrelevant.<br>Damage: Irrelevant. I don't even hold a weapon these days.<br>Range: No need.<br>
 </div>

<div>Haste: Irrelevant.<br>
 </div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Combat Effects: Irrelevant.<br>Shielding: Very small returns here,
but I'm working on it just because I have nothing else other than HP to
improve my survivability.<br>Stun Resist: Critical up to cap, irrelevant once that cap is passed. Not getting stunned is crucial.<br>Strikethrough: Irrelevant.<br>Spell Shield: Moderately relevant. Seems very easy to get, and its utility is diminished by our runes.<br>Avoidance: Critical to cap out.&nbsp; Enchanters geat beat down in melee a lot, and this helps us live.<br>Accuracy: Irrelevant.<br>DOT Shielding: Fairly important.&nbsp; Beats out spell shielding because our rune spells don't help against DoTs.<br>
 </div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

Skill Mods: Basically irrelevant.&nbsp; The actual impact of these is so small as to be virtually nonexistant.<br>
Click Effects: Depends on the click, but some are very useful.<br>
Proc Effects: Fun, but not important.<br>
Worn Effects: Faerune is great because I'm lazy.&nbsp; No other worn effects are relevant for me that I can think of.<br>
Focus Effects: Varies from focus to focus.&nbsp; Some are critical
(Detrimental spell haste) others are trash (beneficial range.)<br>
<br>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Before I get too far along, I thought I'd ask for some feedback from players on how they view different stats with respect to the class(es) they play.&nbsp; Obviously, I have my own view on things, but I'd like to know how any why people have their own views.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>What I'd like, is for you to&nbsp;take a look at this list of the basic item stats (feel free to include any others that I left out), and let me know how and why they think they are, or aren't, important to your class.&nbsp; All comments are useful, and feel free to use current items as examples to illustrate your points if you feel the need.&nbsp; Be sure to INCLUDE THE CLASS name, so I can put your feedback in context.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hopefully, I'll gain some new insights that will help me do my job better.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thanks.</div>
<br><hr></blockquote><br><br>You sure you know what your getting in to?&nbsp; As a Anguish geared Ranger and Shaman (and played a mage twink quite a bit) I just have a few general suggestions.&nbsp; Now, my biggest grip in itemization goes along with a items spell focus effects, but there are other issues.<br><br><br>First, look at the itemization of Vex Thal as an example of end zone itemization.&nbsp; Not only did it have a distinct mix of useful and unique items, there was also the lack of weapons which made it worthwhile.&nbsp; It was, and still is, the best itemized end expansion zone in EQ.<br><br>Second, class only items were cool when they first came out in PoP.&nbsp; But by now, with melee using their Epic 2/2.5 and non-melee having to give up their epics to wield (clerics excepted), they have become a waste.&nbsp; Getting 2x necro dagger (Dagger of Death)&nbsp; on ever 2 out of 3 Yihist kills in Tacvi is a beyond ridiculus.&nbsp; Additionally, go4ing to the OoW expansion itemization, beastlords made out.&nbsp; Not only did they get a Bst only 2hander from MPG trials, but they Bst only 1hander off Ture which is a carbon copy of the War/Rang/Rog/Bard/Monk/Bst 1 handed blunt off KtH (along with their Epic).&nbsp; This kind of itemization is pure laziness.<br><br>Third, a class like a shaman or druid is extremly dependent on their gears focus effects.&nbsp; Due to both the offensive and defensive nature of these classes, they need to have focus effects of just about every type.&nbsp; This includes:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; healing focus<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; beneficial mana preservation<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; detrimental mana preservation<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; beneficial spell haste<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; detrimental spell haste<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; beneficial buff duration<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; detrimental debuff/dot duration<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; beneficial spell range (for heals)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; detrimental spell range (more for druid nukes)<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Damage focus for shaman includes<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  Magic (DoTs)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  Poison (DDs, Rains, AEs, DoTs)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  Cold (DD)<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Damage focus for druids includes<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Fire<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  Cold<br><br>In PoP is wasnt too difficult to fill in a focus needs.&nbsp; This is because you had spell Focus that covered more then one line.&nbsp; Conservation of Xegony covered both bene and detri mana pres.&nbsp; Fury of Solusek covered all DDs (I dont believe DoT focus was in the game at this point).&nbsp; <br><br>But now, equiping a shaman has problems in items with different needed focus effects taking the same slot.&nbsp; If I want beneficial mana preservation (Avariciousness of the Ikaav) and I'm in a Anguish level guild (so Anguish minus OMM, Tacvi including Tunat, DoN through YarLir, DoDH - Shyra/Bloodeye) I have limited choices.&nbsp; They include the BP from Tunat, boots from MPG Trial of Adaptation (which isnt normally farmed), the Ring of Deterance from AMV in Ang, the Shroud of Surging Storm from Yarlir (very rare drop, think we have gotten 3 in 30kills).&nbsp; Now, if I got the MPG trial boots then I cant use Anguish boots which has Beneficial Mana pres.&nbsp; So I have to get that from somewhere else.&nbsp; If I wanted posion damage focus, for which there is only one gear option between the Tacvi/MPG level loot and Demi-plane, that being the Eye of Rikk from Rikk.&nbsp; This is a Range so this would force me to drop my Crystal staff which would force me to get a detrimental mana pres somewhere else.&nbsp; The Warbeads of the Magus are nice but then I would loose my beneficial spell haste from 
  Necklace of Grimspirit Beads.&nbsp; So I have to find something else for that.<br><br>What I'm trying to point out here is casters have run into a jigsaw puzzle of items when they need to weigh Spell focus + item focus.&nbsp; Melee dont have to worry about this as Haste or ImpDodge or other melee centric needs dont denegrate and are not as needed.&nbsp; Additionally, for haste, a melee can just xp in a Skylance instance and wait for a 75HP/75mana/40%haste aug to drop...then they never have to worry about haste again.<br><br>Additionally, there are items in the game that make no sense or are just badly itemized.&nbsp; <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=47281" target=_blank>Belt of Contempt</a> for example off Ture.&nbsp; Its All/All but the focus effect applies to 3 classes (Shaman, SK, Necro) and of those 3, the shaman disease dots are worthless in a raid enviroment (and in general IMO).&nbsp; So you now have a All/all item which is just stats to almost all classes.&nbsp; Or shielding on Int caster only items (or even class items).&nbsp; The Mage head item from Qvic has 1% shielding on it.&nbsp; As a int caster, if they are getting hit, then shielding wont do them any good due to their crap AC and mitigation.&nbsp; Bracer of Grievous Harm
      from Tacvi has Fire damage focus on it.&nbsp; Since only Druids can use fire dmg of the 3 leather classes, its a useless focus for Beastlords; had the item had Cold dmg focus, then it would have been better itemized for the Leather Classes.&nbsp;&nbsp; Or Xxeric's Warbraid having Poison damage focus.&nbsp; Even though this item is for int casters, only Necros gain the benefit of the focus.&nbsp; If the Focus were fire, then 3 of the 4 classes could use...even better had the focus been magic based dmg, then every class who could wear could use.&nbsp; Finally, there are some caste only items that look like they were designed for melee only (think haste, atk and accuracy on a int caster item).<br><br>HP Regeneration.&nbsp; This as a whole needs to be rethought.&nbsp; Worn Regen has increased on a gradual level while Mob DPS and AE damage has increased on a exponential level.&nbsp; Whats wrong with players having a worn regen of 150/tic at the end game?&nbsp;&nbsp; Will this really unbalance the game?<br><br>Worn Attack - This is similar to the regen as it has diminished returns also.&nbsp; When you get to 2500+ attack, even the 50more attack from AAs wont make a difference in DPS.&nbsp; Also, this is another issue in that why do caster only gear have attack when casters rarely if ever melee a mob.<br><br>Dmg/Delay on weapons.&nbsp; For the most part, I have no issues here.&nbsp; The main one are piercing drops.&nbsp; For any class other then a rogue (and none epic2/2.5 rogu at that) to be using a poker is someone decreasing their DPS.&nbsp; When desiging pokers, look back at a <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=70710" target=_blank>Crystal Dagger</a> for inspiration.&nbsp; Also on the King/Queen in RS loot table is a <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=70721" target=_blank>Allin's Mace</a> and <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=70722" target=_blank>Crystal Hilted Shinai.</a>&nbsp; In this case, the dagge has a dmg/delay reasonable close to the other weapons (.7 vs .65).&nbsp; Yet a <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=47317" target=_blank>Aneuk Dagger of Eye Gouging</a> from Jelvin has a ratio of .82 making it all but worthless for non-rogues or Apps.&nbsp; The same goes <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=71645" target=_blank>Fang of Kessdona</a> (.8 ratio).&nbsp; Again a item that goes to either non epic2 rogues or to recruits.&nbsp; <br><br>There are several other issues which I'm sure others will point out, but this gives you an idea.<br></div>

2 = I'm well past the point where this is usefull. maybe if it was a
300ac upgrade...maybe...but the returns over the cap are just to low to
make a difference<br>
 </div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>HP Regen: 7 = regen = good<br>Mana Regen: 0<br>Endurance Regen: 5 = important when I die i suppose, but I havn't even bothered with the AA's for this.<br>
 </div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Strength: 1 = 60pts over my cap. no worries <br>Stamina: 1 = 200pts over my cap<br>Agility: 2 = under the cap, but it seems to make no difference<br>Dexterity: 2 = same as agility<br>Charisma: 0 = I wouldn't play an iksar if this was important<br>
Intelligence: 0 = insert witty joke about iksar here<br>
Wisdom: 0 = see above<br>
</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Cold Resist: 5 all resists = good. to many chromatic type AE's to stress one over the other<br>Disease Resist: 5<br>Poison Resist: 5<br>Magic Resist: 5<br>Fire Resist:5 </div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Attack: 2 = over my cap, no worries<br>Delay: 10 - but must be combined with damafe for an acceptable ratio. <br>Damage: 10 - must be combined with delay for acceptable ratio<br>Range: 3 not really a factor. if it's less than time stars (250) it doesn't get the time of day<br>
 </div>

<div>Haste: 2 = highest haste item out there is what, 50%? I'm at 46 so what's the worry.<br>
 </div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Combat Effects: <br>Shielding: 8 every little bit helps<br>Stun Resist: 10 good stuff<br>Strikethrough: 0 not worth it when one riposte fot 5k puts me down 20% hp<br>Spell Shield: 7 every little bit helps<br>Avoidance: 9 - nearing my cap<br>Accuracy: 10 - nuff said. <br>DOT Shielding: 5 doesnt' seem to do much unless you aquire alot of it<br>
 </div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

Skill Mods: 4 = having looked at some of the numbers crunched by
various people, a 10% increase is barely effective, especially on
things like block/dodge, etc. <br>
Click Effects: 6 depends on what it does, and what it stacks with. <br>
Proc Effects: overall, 5. if it's a lifetap, 8, if it's a hate generator, 0<br>
Worn Effects:&nbsp; 7 - I just wish they would stack a bit.&nbsp; dodge
I + dodge III doesn't have to equal dodge IV, but it would be nice to
get something out of it <br>
Focus Effects: pretty much useless. 0<br>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Before I get too far along, I thought I'd ask for some feedback from players on how they view different stats with respect to the class(es) they play.&nbsp; Obviously, I have my own view on things, but I'd like to know how any why people have their own views.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>What I'd like, is for you to&nbsp;take a look at this list of the basic item stats (feel free to include any others that I left out), and let me know how and why they think they are, or aren't, important to your class.&nbsp; All comments are useful, and feel free to use current items as examples to illustrate your points if you feel the need.&nbsp; Be sure to INCLUDE THE CLASS name, so I can put your feedback in context.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hopefully, I'll gain some new insights that will help me do my job better.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thanks.</div>
<div><br><hr><br>Since you have been playing a wizard you already know this, but just to be on the same page:<br>&nbsp;</div>
<div>-------<br>CLASS: Wizard<br></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>HP: Semi-important. We don't tank, but we take AE.<br>Mana: Top importance. An OOM wizard is a waste of space and heals. The situation today is better than it was 1.5 yr ago thanks to 2 mana efficient nukes, but still - once your mana is gone you become useless.<br>Endurance: Zero use.<br>AC: Don't care. We don't tank. When taking an occasional hit from a kited mob avoidance is a lot more importnat.<br> </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>HP Regen: Not important. Especially with HoT potions.<br>Mana Regen: THE Top Importance. Sustained DPS is our weakest spot.<br>Endurance Regen: Zero use.<br> </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Strength: Zero use.<br>Stamina: Zero use. (a few extra HP don't make a difference)<br>Agility: Low importance. Helps avoid melee hits, but that not something a wizard does all the time.<br>Dexterity: Zero use.<br>Charisma: Zero use.<br>Intelligence: Important only at low-medium levels. Very easily maxed with today's gear at top levels.<br>Wisdom: Zero use.<br> </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Cold Resist: Very important (extremely important for raiders). Resisting (at least partially) big AEs means the difference between life and death.<br>Disease Resist: same<br>Poison Resist: same<br>Magic Resist: same<br>Fire Resist: same </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Attack: Zero use.<br>Delay: Zero use.<br>Damage: Zero use.<br>Range: Semi-important. Good for kiting.<br> </div>
<div>Haste: Spell haste -- Very important.<br> </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Combat Effects: Almost zero use (meleeing with a proc weapon is more of an entertainment than practical for a wizard).<br>Shielding: Low importance. We don't tank on a continous basis.<br>Stun Resist: Very important. Both for solo play (not getting stunned by occasional hits) and for raids with nasty stun AE.<br>Strikethrough: Zero use.<br>Spell Shield: Very important for raiders.<br>Avoidance: Semi-important for solo/group players. Less so for raiders.<br>Accuracy: Zero use.<br>DOT Shielding: Very important for raiders. Less so for soloing against DoT casting mobs (HoT potions easily cover normal mob DoTs).<br> </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Skill Mods: Very important for Evocation.<br>Click Effects: Important, depending on the clicky. Epic 2.0 is good. Clicky nukes are good.<br>Proc Effects: Almost zero use (see Combat Effects).<br>Worn Effects: Worn mana regen -- Extremely important.<br>Focus Effects: Very important. And need to get back on par with melee foci/mods. The randomness of 1..N% yields diminishing results.<br>-------</div><br></blockquote></div>

				<DIV>
<DIV>-------<BR>CLASS: Ranger in a DK raiding guild</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>HP:&nbsp; Very important, HP is the stat that never stops giving<BR>Mana: Important <BR>Endurance: Not important since we have no way to use it anyway<BR>AC: Important </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>HP Regen: Important although at the levels of gear I have the cap is easy enough to reach<BR>Mana Regen: Important&nbsp;FT seems a tad rare on ranger items especially in the sub Demiplane levels <BR>Endurance Regen:&nbsp; not important see earlier comment</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Strength: Str seems hard to come by on ranger gear though it like other stats aren't really that important<BR>Stamina: Sta on ranger gear at the high end is pretty decent no real complaints there<BR>Agility:&nbsp; Agi is a tad rare on midlevel ranger gear but overall isn't too bad<BR>Dexterity:&nbsp; Dex is overflowing on ranger gear<BR>Charisma:&nbsp;Useful if you do alot of Traq pulling or get DI cast on you seems a bit hard to cap with ranger gear but not to aweful<BR>Intelligence: who cares&nbsp;<BR>Wisdom: Ranger gear seems to be overflowing with wisdom so everything seems good in this regard</DIV>
<DIV>On stats in general other than stamina they seem for the most part to have too big of an actual visable affect in the game so they would seldom be weighed over other more important factors in gear selection</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Cold Resist: important though is reasonably represented in ranger gear<BR>Disease Resist: important&nbsp; reasonably represented in ranger gear<BR>Poison Resist:&nbsp; important&nbsp; reasonably represented in ranger gear<BR>Magic Resist: Important doesn't seem to be reasonably represented in ranger gear<BR>Fire Resist:&nbsp; important&nbsp; reasonably represented in ranger gear</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Attack: Imporant upto 300 after that irrelevant. ATK was pretty common on time level gear but was rather difficult to aquire on GOD to CoA gear problem seemed resolved post CoA<BR>Delay: this is pretty much tied to damage in the ratio in the end the delay is less important than the ratio of the weapon in quesstion as is the actual damage, though said delay must be considered when determining actual ratio rather than simple ratio do to the application of the damage bonus on mainhand. Additionaly extremely low delay weaponry have a problem with increasing the vulnerability to Damage shields at the same time they maximize the effectiveness of +damage augs<BR>Damage: see above</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Note on damage/delay for bows in general bows in CoA and above just isn't cutting it. Currently each of these 3 bows are extremely underpowered compared to their melee equivelents based on the 85% criteria that has been stated in the past by the developers as a target for bow dps. Ladwenae can get you actual parses and concrete data but essentially in order to hit the 85% of melee target each of these bows need about 25 added to their base damage</DIV>
<DIV><BR>Range: 200+ please <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0></DIV>
<DIV>Haste: Important: for any melee centric class haste is extremely important.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Combat Effects: Relatively important more procs =more dps though not as important as other stats<BR>Shielding: This is important for the raiding ranger and seems to be quite lacking in our high end gear<BR>Stun Resist : Important also very much lacking on much high end ranger gear<BR>Strikethrough: somewhat important seems to be relatively well represented on the gear available to us<BR>Spell Shield: see sheilding<BR>Avoidance: Important but seems to be relatively well represented on high end raid gear<BR>Accuracy: this is one that I focus on quite a bit it is very important but also relatively easy to cap at the high end.<BR>DOT Shielding: once again important to the raiding ranger though it does seem to be more common on our gear than the other types of shielding</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Skill Mods: Mis them would like to see some return<BR>Click Effects: Not enough of them, Would really like to see a few more overhaste items available at the high end prefereably items other than range slots (Ranger class item mayhaps? ;-) Proc Effects: Proc's are fun and many are useful for extra DPS important though behind ratio<BR>Worn Effects: Imporant<BR>Focus Effects: Imporant</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>A note on effects and mods for hybrids we end up in a rough position since we are both casters and melee and in order to attain maximum effectiveness we need both casting and Melee foci. As such items with no foci particularly visable armor slots (see the last two high end ranger wearable sleeves) are particularly annoying please try to avoid this sort of thing in the future.<BR>-------</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>One will notice going through the list that there are very few things I don't value as a ranger. This will probably hold relatively common with all the hybrids to a far greater degree than either of the pure classes. This is pretty much do to the fact that we have both a casting and a melee focus. Rangers are a very versatile class with no single overwelming strength relying instead on a wide and varied toolset&nbsp; to get the job done. As such we cannot get away with focusing on just one aspect of our class to the exclusion of all others. As a ranger not only do I have to worry about offensive melee stats and effects&nbsp;but also defensive as well as all but a couple of&nbsp;focus effects&nbsp;(poison and desease are pretty much the only types of spells we don't have)</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>As such well thought out itemization is extremely important to the&nbsp;effectiveness of the class.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Oh and while your at it can you at least bump the AC on our class DP item to be on par with the Zerker item?</DIV></DIV>

Not seeing as many Mana Preservation focii out there as you used to a few years back (Read: All Caster/Priest Elemental armor sets had Mana Preservation on them somewhere, which has sadly not continued in future quest armor lines), but the other two are easily attainable for us.<br>-------</div><div></div>

<DIV>Skill Mods: Somewhat useful depending on the mod<BR>Click Effects: Insanely important to a Shaman as we never have enough spell slots....<BR>Proc Effects: Not real important<BR>Worn Effects: Somewhat useful<BR>Focus Effects:&nbsp; Shaman I think utilize focus effects to an insane degree.... there is too many focuses we need and certainly not enough item variety on many highly important focuses. Cant possibly stress enough how important focus effects are to us.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Not that there is much to be done about it but I would liek to note....</DIV>
<DIV>Priest archtype gear is mainly gear toward healers of which we are the weakest healer and we usually have different needs than the other Priests.</DIV>
<DIV>Chain gear since we are sharing it with 3 DPS classes tends to be very DPS oriented.</DIV>
<DIV>IE Attack, Accuracy etc which we have very little use for.</DIV>
<DIV>This generally means Shaman have to compete for harder to obtain all/all or multiarchtype gear.</DIV>
<DIV>This combined with the sheer number of focus effects we need makes it very hard to effectively gear a Shaman.</DIV></DIV>

				CLASS: Magician
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>HP: High - This raises our survivability against AE's, being hits, and generally everything. The leading cause of death is lack of HP, everyone wants 'em.<br>Mana: Extremely high. This determines the amount of DPS I can sustain to fulfill my classes role on raids, groups, and soloing. Though, currently after a certain point having a mana pool around my size has turned into a yawn fest waiting for it to regen <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-wink.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0><br>Endurance: Zero use. I can jump all I want already.<br>AC: Personally, I would say low on AC. As a caster AC does not help me mitigate damage as well as any other class, therefore it's a wasted stat for me considering it's minimal returns.<br> </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>HP Regen: Nice to have when soloing. I agree with others that it might be capped too low for todays EQ.<br>Mana Regen: Extremely High. The cap on this needs to have a large increase, if you ask me. Having 10k mana pools as the norm has showed how far the game has moved on over the years, yet we still only have a 15 FT cap (20 with AA's). Hardly a linear progression.<br>Endurance Regen: No need.<br> </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Strength: Not very useful. I have weight reduction bags for that.<br>Stamina: Good for HPs, that's about it. As a resident HP guy I geuss it's semi imporant, but I'd put it at moderate.<br>Agility: Not very.<br>Dexterity: Low to none.<br>Charisma: Low to none.<br>Intelligence: High, but I have over twice the Cap currently.<br>Wisdom: Low to none.<br> </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Cold Resist: All resists are useful in all aspects of the game.<br>Disease Resist: --<br>Poison Resist: --<br>Magic Resist: --<br>Fire Resist:-- </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Attack: None.<br>Delay: None.<br>Damage: None.<br>Range: None.<br> </div>
<div>Haste: None.<br> </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Combat Effects: For fun, no use really though.<br>Shielding: Helps raise my survivability if I get hit. It improves all aspects of the game for me.<br>Stun Resist: Extremely high. Channeling spells thru stuns and being able to run away from a avoided stun is a HUGE part for me.<br>Strikethrough: None.<br>Spell Shield: I'm nearly double the cap on this without trying. It IS extremely useful, just the abundance of it makes the effects less noticable. Though, I'd rather have more of it than none.<br>Avoidance: Pretty decent I suppose. Nowhere near the usefulness on us as tanks of course again. Once more, a huge abbundance.<br>Accuracy: None.<br>DOT Shielding: Refer to spell shielding.<br> </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
Skill Mods: The only useful ones are +specialization skills. Even those have proven to give minimal effects.<br>Click Effects: Very nice to have. It increases my ability to perform well during spell refreshes and also adds on the nice extra buff effects that I need to continue with my damage.<br>Proc Effects: None.<br>Worn Effects: Currently, none.<br>Focus Effects: The leading factor of all casters. Without these, we're useless and fall EXTREMELY far behind melees. Though, when these focus' are moved to new slots every expansion it makes it hard to decide which items to grab.<br> <div></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>HP: Important.&nbsp; This is obvious.&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>Mana: don't care.<br>Endurance: Semi-important, but pool size only postpones the inevitable point where we're stuck regenerating it at a ridiculously low rate.<br>AC: Semi imporant, up to a point.&nbsp; I'm not sure where AC caps for monks are, but it's not something that I actively search for in my upgrades.<br> </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>HP Regen:&nbsp; I'm almost capped, albeit unintentionally.&nbsp; not super important. <br>Mana Regen: don't care.<br>Endurance Regen: would love to see this implemented, but in a responsible way so as not to overpower certain classes(zerkers, mostly)<br> </div>
<div>&nbsp;<br>[these aren't super important to me, as they all max in post-time raiding.&nbsp; for the casual monks, more agility and more dex]<br></div>
<div>Strength: capped <br>Stamina: capped<br>Agility: capped(took me longest to cap)<br>Dexterity: capped<br>Charisma: don't care<br>Intelligence: don't care<br>Wisdom: it's pretty high, as I share an armor archetype with druids/beasts.&nbsp; i don't tradeskill, so it's not super important to me.<br> </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Cold Resist: <br>Disease Resist: <br>Poison Resist: One of my weakest points<br>Magic Resist: High end monk gear is sorely lacking in MR, the rest are pretty easy to pile on.<br>Fire Resist: </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Attack: Important.&nbsp; I'd rather overdo it than underdo it, as atk is important to our dps.<br>Delay: Important.&nbsp; Recent parses are showing favorable dps situations to lower delay weapons even in offhand weapons, as our dual wield rate gets higher and higher.<br>Damage: Obviously important.&nbsp; <br>Range: Monk ranged dps is a joke.&nbsp; I know this isn't the responsibility of the itemization dev, but some kind of range disc for monks would be nice, but nothing overpowered so as not to step on the toes of our neighborhood rogues.<br> </div>
<div>Haste: Would like to see more 45% items, or higher.&nbsp; I have clickable 50% haste, and I'd like to be able to cap or be close to cap when I solo.<br> </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Combat Effects:&nbsp; Procs play a pretty important role in our dps, and this mod is probably the hardest for us to cap.<br>Shielding: Semi-important for offtanking situations, or ae. <br>Stun Resist: Important for pulling.&nbsp; Getting stunned on high end raids can lead to death if we aren't quick on the feign death button.<br>Strikethrough: Fairly important, but also common on monk gear.<br>Spell Shield: I value this stat a lot at the level of raiding that I'm on(Tacvi, about to break anguish).&nbsp; It helps tremendously with AE's.<br>Avoidance: Very important, and fairly easy to cap.&nbsp; I'm not one to turn down avoidance gear.&nbsp; <br>Accuracy:&nbsp; Extremely important from a dps standpoint.&nbsp; I dps more than I pull on raids nowadays, and would like to see more accuracy on gear.&nbsp; I go out of my way to get gear with accuracy on it.<br>DOT Shielding:&nbsp; I don't value this as highly as I value spell shield, but it's nice to have.<br> </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Skill Mods: I love the block mod on my time tunic, and the dodge mod on my neck piece(GoD tongue samples quest) and wouldn't mind seeing this on gear more often.<br>Click Effects: Clickies are fun.&nbsp; I'd like to see more overhaste options(especially at the lower end, even some 3% clickies for easier raids would be nice just to have options.&nbsp; As it stands, there are only a few:&nbsp; Quarm Ear, Tacvi Ring, Zoo Event in Qvic ear, RSS Royals cape, OMM Range, and Mayong Range.&nbsp; I've never seen the ear drop from the zoo event.<br>Proc Effects: See my above statements regarding combat effects.&nbsp; Procs are nice.&nbsp; I'd also like to see more non-elemental +damage augs.&nbsp; The last two expansions have been good about that for monks(Eye of Lycanthrope, and the deathknell 3 dmg+lifetap aug). <br>Worn Effects: All are important.<br>Focus Effects: I'd like to see endurance conservation focuses.<br>-------<br><br>Here's my magelo for a point of reference, if that helps:<br><br>http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1077519<br><br>edit:&nbsp; I wholeheartely agree with the above poster's message about wanting to look like a monk.&nbsp; I don't want leather tunics.&nbsp; I dont' want to look like a druid or a human beastlord.&nbsp; I'd like more chestwrap options, or NPC's that you can turn your armor into for chestwrap options.&nbsp; I don't like shoulderpads;&nbsp; i'd prefer armbands.&nbsp; I like fistwraps, and small unobtrusive bracers.&nbsp; <br><br>The robe look from robe of the lost circle with old models, where the monk still appears bare chested but has the long draping robes-- this is very cool and I'd love to see it with luclin models.&nbsp; Helmets are ugly.&nbsp; I'd love to see actual headbands implemented.<br><br>Weight is a concern as well.&nbsp; I'd like more coin weight reduction options, as it's a crappy deal when I'm farming for plat and I either have to destroy money, or run and bank because I'm losing armor class due to heavy coinage.<br></div><div></div><p>Message Edited by Wonton_Noodle on <span class=date_text>07-06-2006</span> <span class=time_text>06:33 PM</span>

				<font color="#ffffff">CLASS:&nbsp; Necromancer</font>
<div><font color="#ffffff">&nbsp;</font></div>
<div><font color="#ffffff">HP: For many necros including myself, HP is more important than mana to a certain extent.&nbsp; There are 2 reasons.&nbsp; One is because for us, HP is mana, because our lich converts mana to hp and blood magic uses hp to cast spells. The other thing is we find ourselves getting hit a lot either from aggro or from trying to lifetap tank things and the more the HP the better in those cases.</font><font color="#ffffff"><br></font><font color="#ffffff">Mana: Important and definately needed, but not as much as HP.</font><font color="#ffffff"><br></font><font color="#ffffff">Endurance: Do not need, period.</font><font color="#ffffff"><br></font><font color="#ffffff">AC: AC does not help us much, but may help slightly with tap tanking situations.<br> </font></div>
<div><font color="#ffffff">&nbsp;</font></div>
<div><font color="#ffffff">HP Regen: Very important to necros due to lich draining hp, but at the high end it is pretty easy to max.&nbsp; But if the cap is ever raised, more is better.</font><font color="#ffffff"><br></font><font color="#ffffff">Mana Regen: Mana regen is just important to us as other int classes</font><font color="#ffffff"><br></font><font color="#ffffff">Endurance Regen: Not important.<br> </font></div>
<div><font color="#ffffff">&nbsp;</font></div>
<div><font color="#ffffff">Strength: Not important.</font><font color="#ffffff"><br></font><font color="#ffffff">Stamina: Every item has Stamina almost, so most necros are maxed, but if we weren't maxed it would be important for the sake of HP.</font><font color="#ffffff"><br></font><font color="#ffffff">Agility: Not very important, but might help for tap tanking.</font><font color="#ffffff"><br></font><font color="#ffffff">Dexterity: Not important.</font><font color="#ffffff"><br></font><font color="#ffffff">Charisma: Not important except for those charm junkies who think it helps for charming (I never use charm, though).</font><font color="#ffffff"><br></font><font color="#ffffff">Intelligence: Basically same story as Stamina, almost everyone is maxed, but would be important if we weren't maxed.</font><font color="#ffffff"><br></font><font color="#ffffff">Wisdom: Not important.<br> </font></div>

<div><font color="#ffffff">&nbsp;</font></div>
<div><font color="#ffffff">Skill Mods: Alteration, conjuration, and dodge mods would all be nice.&nbsp; Maybe even a mod to increase successful FD or willful death going off.</font><font color="#ffffff"><br></font><font color="#ffffff">Click Effects: Dot click efects are the nicest, since they can stack with newer dots whereas buff effects become obsolete by new spells.&nbsp; Other effects that don't get effected by lvl caps being raised are nice, like trushar's recovery from GoD (spend 4 mana regen, get 20 hp regen). Other effects that would be nice are mana regen effects that stack with our self rune and newer versions of the methodical mind line of clicky effects or others that stack with it.</font><font color="#ffffff"><br></font><font color="#ffffff">Proc Effects: A necro trying to proc is kind of futile, so nothing useful I could see here.</font><font color="#ffffff"><br></font><font color="#ffffff">Worn Effects: Improved dodge is nice, can't think of anything else I guess that wasnt listed above already.&nbsp; The FD/willful death thing could be lumped here too.</font><font color="#ffffff"><br></font><font color="#ffffff">Focus Effects: Focus effects that increase our dot damage and lifetap damage are the most important.&nbsp; Poison and magic would be most important, followed by fire, and disease would be semi useful.&nbsp; The focuses that make detrimental spells (like dots) last longer are very important too (such as bane of the dragorn, etc).&nbsp; Detrimental range increase is also important.&nbsp; Detrimental mana pres and detrimental spell haste are also important.&nbsp; Affliction haste (33% dot spell haste) was awesome but seems to have been replaced totally by 20-23% detrimental haste.&nbsp; Some necros also like healing focus effects once their other ones are finished for pet heals (i'm not to that point yet though).</font><font color="#ffffff"><br></font><font color="#ffffff">-------</font></div><div></div>

<DIV><BR>CLASS:</DIV>
<DIV><BR>HP: Important, but you need AC to back it up when tanking. I despise CoA and its 11 HP augs and 0 </DIV>
<DIV>AC augs, but like the new HP+AC augs as a compromise. Yet, I don't like it when one mob needs to be camped for 4-5 identical uber augs because they are not lore.<BR>Mana: Semi-Important. I think the size of the pool is ok.<BR>Endurance: Not important<BR></DIV>
<DIV>AC: Important. For mitigation and reducing the probability of spikes (or at least that's what they tell me). Maybe SK's overvalue it more than any other class, and maybe the benefits are marginal with as much as 3500AC unbuffed, but I don't like it when the latest expansion's class specific item has less AC than a 3 expansion old item that I'm wearing, despite a fancy focus.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>HP Regen: Not important. Sitting regen was improved, and we have healers and/or lifetaps.<BR></DIV>
<DIV>Mana Regen: Important. I easily get oom in groups, but can conserve some if I have to, but often I struggle at 20% mana for an extended period of time, because of the things I need to do.<BR></DIV>
<DIV>Endurance Regen: Not important. Drained by a handful of bosses&nbsp;(that many?) so I can't HT.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Attack: Not important. But I'm not near the cap as it stands now.<BR></DIV>
<DIV>Delay: Semi-important. I suppose we don't&nbsp;want the lowest delay weapons.<BR></DIV>
<DIV>Damage: We have the highest damage weapons, subject to envy almost like HT once was envied (now it can't stop a cleric mob from healing), and yet our dps is pathetic, while Paladins, our counter-part,&nbsp;became a dps class on undead mobs. Anyway, it's easier to identify an upgrade if dmg/dly are somewhat equal on the current weapon compared to a new one. As a minor point, we don't need to find our class on dual wielder ratio weapons, even if they look good.<BR></DIV>
<DIV>Range: Not important with our current skills.<BR></DIV>
<DIV>Haste: Very important. There is a huge lack of haste items, and fewer if you don't want to downgrade other primary stats (read AC). The CoA helm was a good one, despite lacking other stats, and is hard to replace if you can't get another lasting haste item.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Combat Effects: Semi-important.<BR></DIV>
<DIV>Shielding: Important. Reasonably easy to max.<BR></DIV>
<DIV>Stun Resist: Semi-important.<BR></DIV>
<DIV>Strikethrough: Not important.<BR></DIV>
<DIV>Spell Shield: Important. Less easy to max, when going for shielding/avoidance.<BR></DIV>
<DIV>Avoidance: Important. Reasonably easy to max.<BR></DIV>
<DIV>Accuracy: Not important.<BR></DIV>
<DIV>DOT Shielding: Semi-important.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Skill Mods: Not important. Skills aren't very exciting.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Click Effects: Semi-important. Fun toys, but a disappointment when they don't stack, for non-obvious reasons. Nevermind the Form-buffs, but what does Theft of Hate (short atk tap that would serve us better in the song window) have to do with Touch of the Devourer (lifetap)?</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Proc Effects: Semi-important. They can be a tanking tool, or a slight increase in dps.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Worn Effects: Semi-important. Can be nice tools, but I don't value them extremely high, and I don't think I want them to be more than secondary, or they limit your upgrade choices. I guess there could be a few more Ferocity/Cleave items, without having to sacrifice AC as usual.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Focus Effects: Semi-important. Magic focus is nice for lifetaps, but I find that lifetaps are mostly useful when soloing. Disease/Poison focus is not important to me, since I don't really use those spells. One reason is shortage of spell slots, or at least lack of room for extras in my normal line-up, another is that Disease is resisted a lot, and usually not debuffed. DoT length extension could be useful, and buff length extension is nice to a degree.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>What I lack is a HT focus for our out-dated and even blatantly nerfed (Druid epic) Harm Tickle. There currently is Solusek's Fury, and thanks to the new GM armor/augs there is now a way of obtaining it, other than being in a Time/Ikkinz guild, and lucky. However nice that would be, I have to say I dislike the GM armor. I don't want to raid for tradeskill items, and if lucky, have someone merge them together to items *better* than the pure armor drops from high(er)-end targets, provided I pay an expensive fee.</DIV>

				<DIV>CLASS: WARRIOR
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>HP: It goes without saying that this is important, and I think future items should give Warriors some kind of HP edge over Knights and Paladins, as currently most of it evens out. Knights can tap to give themselves an HP boost, Paladins get self heals, the only method of equalization Warriors have is more raw HP, more so than we currently have.</DIV>
<DIV><BR>Mana: I've heard of this before, but not sure what it is...<BR>Endurance: More critical than ever. I'd like to see items with something like +1 End Regen more than I'd like to see higher END totals though. </DIV>
<DIV><BR>AC: Extremely important</DIV>
<DIV>HP Regen: Nice while soloing, but not all that important, it's simply too small a difference given how hard things hit to be critical.<BR>Mana Regen:&nbsp; Never heard of it<BR>Endurance Regen: More critical than anything other than AC and HP for Warriors</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Strength: Meaningless<BR>Stamina: Meaningless<BR>Agility: Meaningless<BR>Dexterity: Meaningless<BR>Charisma: Meaningless<BR>Intelligence: Meaningless<BR>Wisdom: Meaningless</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Once you hit Qvic, your upgrades quickly surpass your stat caps. What point is there in higher totals when you can hardly ever exceed the cap except through specific spells that apply their own overcap.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Cold Resist: Not that important<BR>Disease Resist: Important<BR>Poison Resist: Important<BR>Magic Resist: This is where Warriors should truly shine against other classes. We're supposed to have an innate resistance, but the class resistance bonus is absolutely, utterly meaningless. When most spell penalties are rounded to the nearest 100 (50 at the lowest), the feeble bonus Warriors get is meaningless. Either Warriors should have a cap innately higher than other classes or we should have a bigger bonus through items.<BR>Fire Resist: Important</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Attack: Meaningless. Currently equipment Time/Qvic level means you hit your Atk Cap, even WITH the AA, before you need to consider item upgrades.<BR>Delay: Not that important, current haste functions in game mean that delay only matters when it's exceptionally high.<BR>Damage: Important.<BR>Range: Not critical, but nice. I'd like to see more nifty effects on range items that give warriors a reason to use them other than for pulling.</DIV>
<DIV>Haste: Critical for Warriors</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Combat Effects: Absolutely imperative for Warriors<BR>Shielding: Extremely important<BR>Stun Resist: With the stun immunity AA, not remotely as important as it once was<BR>Strikethrough: Nice, but not critical<BR>Spell Shield: I think all Warriors should get an innate bonus when wearing Spell Shield items (1.5x as effective) as a measure of their resistance to magic.<BR>Avoidance: Very nice<BR>Accuracy: Not all that important<BR>DOT Shielding: Nice to have, but not a huge factor in gear selection</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Skill Mods: Extremely nice, the +8% to Riposte on Fleshbiter (on top of the major aggro aspect of it) is a prime reason I keep wielding it. It seems like nothing, but it can mean so much<BR>Click Effects: God I love click effects. Other tanks get spell books, Warriors should get more clickies<BR>Proc Effects: Critical in differentiating Warriors from SKs and Paladins, IMHO.<BR>Worn Effects: More!<BR>Focus Effects: EVEN MORE!</DIV>

Healing impact we need. Mana pres beneficial: must have; detrimental; nice to have. Extended range and duration extention are both must have for both beneficial and detrimental. Spell haste is a must have for beneficial, and nice to have for detrimental. IMO.

<P><BR>Here is my rant I posted on an itemization thread recently.&nbsp; The jist is shaman focus effects are craptacularily itemized.&nbsp; Try to get all your focus effects is difficult, since stuff is all over the place.&nbsp; If a focus effect stays on one single slot (ie legs or arms or somewhere) for 2 consecutive expansions, I'd be impressed.&nbsp; Also, since GoD, shamans have had the shaft compared to necromancers for focus effects, especially since our main modes of DPS are the same.&nbsp; I'm not asking to DPS like a necro, but getting the proper focuses for the 2 classes is way out of balance.</P>

				<div></div><div></div>CLASS: (True Battle) Cleric, highest end raider, double marker of Ayonae! (Magelo in Sig)<br>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>HP: Very Important. For groups and raids it reflects how many hits
one can take from loose adds until a tank can recover / take aggro to
prevent you from dieing, also key to harsh DoTs, AE DDs and detrimental
AEs that reduce the hp cap by a significant amount, as it will scale.
For soloing, it affects the rate of healing required by allowing a
cleric to delay using bigger more efficient heals, over using smaller,
less efficient ones. It also means the max number of bad potential
rounds a cleric can take, whilst tanking, taking hits, or soloing (as
it does for all classes), but considering our evasion is so poor, we
need as big a limit as we can, for our class.<br>
<br>Mana:&nbsp; Very Important. Mana is the literal lifeblood for our
class, we are completely dependant on it for doing our job as a whole
class (clickies that a minority have access to shouldn't be factored
into that), and what with increasing mana drains and harsh damage
needing to be countered that people are facing in raids / groups (mana
drains less so, mana sponges thats another matter <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-tongue.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0>), having an ample
supply of mana is key. That said, managing mana efficiently &gt; a
super high mana pool, but more often than not true efficiency is nigh
impossible to achieve- a drain is bound to happen.<br>
<br>Endurance: Useless, only used for jumping <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-tongue.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0><br>
<br>AC: Biased to say important. Clerics are a plate class, and it is
intended for us to have a good mitigation source from our AC, such that
after parsing from the cleric community, we proved our post soft-cap AC
return was severely broken, and Zajeer checked and saw it wasn't what
it was intended to be. He fixed that, and much &lt;3 for the iksar SK,
because now our AC has worth. Being a cleric with one of the highest ac
values unbuffed serverwide for my class (and a decent shield AC to go with it) I can
safely say that AC has saved my ass more times than I can count in
raids and grouping. It is also key again, to the solo aspect for
clerics, because our dps relies on us getting hit / being attacked, and
considering our evasion is poor being a priest class, we need to do
everything we can to minimise damage taken whilst in return, still
doing damage back.<br>
 </div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>HP Regen: So so. Being a healer, HP regen worn is not that
important to me as I am capable of regenning HP via my heals in HoTs or
Direct Burst heals.<br>
<br>Mana Regen: Important. Clerics are the worst off of all priests
when it comes to mana regen, but this is primarily due to our heals
being the more comparitively totally efficient in terms of Average Heal
per Mana Second, and due to the fact we have the heal of CH which has
often been the crux of many issues / debates, however I can safely say
the dusk of CH has already started, as there are several heals already
better suited than CH, with the appropriate foci.<br>
<br>Endurance Regen: Useless, but give it to melees, they DIRELY need it <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0><br>
<br>
 </div>

<div>&nbsp;<br>
Stats in general- people can cap stats quite easily in general these
days especially if they raid, so I would not be too concerned with them
all overal.<br>
<br>
</div>

<div>Strength: Semi-important, being a plate class our armour is heavy. We don't need to be encumbered <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0><br>
<br>Stamina: Important until capped, it provides the a needed boost of hp.<br>
<br>Agility:
So so, it affects AGI avoidance AC and supposedly affects the proc
rates of defensive parry proccers, of which our primary solo tool now,
is one (ward of retribution).<br>
<br>Dexterity: Again like Agi, it affects
the proc rate of weapons marginally? Which one of our tools is the set
of spam0matic hammers.<br>
<br>Charisma: Not that important.<br>
<br>Intelligence: Not important.<br>
<br>Wisdom: Important to the class as a whole, but wisdom is easy to
cap for most of the population these days. If it provided a post cap
return based mana / x amount of wisdom, akin to how AC works, it would
make wisdom more appreciated, as many people are hundreds above the cap.<br>
 </div>

<div>&nbsp;<br>
Well, despite the fact most AEs&nbsp; in raids have checks that
completely negate the benefit of resists, meaning merely a resist
depends on the roll of a too many sided dice, of which the sucess would
be the Vishimtar DoN resist aa. In general however, I deem them
important, I have faith in resists, such that I have once resisted most
AEs mata muram has had to throw at me, and am thankful it happened
(Silence resisted, Gaze emote... &gt;&lt<img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-wink.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0><br>
<br>
</div>

<div>Cold Resist: Semi important.<br>Disease Resist: Semi important.<br>Poison Resist: Semi important.<br>Magic Resist: Semi important.<br>Fire Resist: Semi important. </div>

<div>&nbsp;<br>
Clerics are the least dependant on melee weapons, our melee dps is appaling, but we derive most of our dps via defensive means.<br>
<br>
</div>

<div>Attack: Not important<br>Delay: Not important<br>Damage: Not important<br>Range: Not important </div>

<div>Haste: Not important- haste doesn't increase proc rate, with haste our melee dps hardly rises, we miss too much anyways.<br>
<br>
"Addition" Proc: Important- our spam hammer line is one of our 'dps'
means, however, the hammers are not the dps people expect them to be
even with their proc rate. The best hammer currently (Daybreak, Bringer
of Light) parses at 30-35 burst dps with crit aa's, 20-25 dps in normal
settings. A slight boost on them would be a nice thing, as we are one
of if not the most dps challenged classes in the game.<br>
 </div>

<div>&nbsp;<br>
<br>
</div>

<div>Combat Effects: So so, useful on weapons with timelapse, but not with spam hammers that already have the 630% mod proc rate.<br>
<br>Shielding: Important, shielding is useful to everyone, and especially us for soloing reasons (see above for ac)<br>
<br>Stun Resist: Important, but a bit bleh being sketchy as it is RNG
based on whether you stun resist or not, useful in all areas of EQ
however.<br>
<br>Strikethrough: Useless, ST does not avoid ripostes but it merely
bypasses them, our melee dps is too low for this to be a concern.<br>
<br>Spell Shield: Important. Spell shield is the single biggest
mitigator for spell damage, such that it exponentially scales as DD
base increases, saving far more hps than people care to admit <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0><br>
<br>Avoidance: Important. Priests in general get hit by mobs for a
hitrate of 60%, with capped avoidance this shifts to ~50%, which is a
huge dps cutdown. Evasion &gt; mitigation for surviving, not being hit
at all is a great thing. That said, very easy to max now.<br>
<br>Accuracy: Not important. We miss too much base without accuracy, an
improvement in 1-2% hitrate will hardly do much for ~10 melee dps.<br>
<br>DOT Shielding: Important as again it is a fixed benefit / tick
but... its way way too abundant in comparison to other mods. I think
there are people with even 70+% lol.<br>
 </div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

Skill Mods: Specialisation Alt 12% is an example of a great skill mod
that people place not so much worth in. It is a fixed additional 1%
mana preservation to alteration spells, assuming Alt Speci is capped at
200. +dodge % or others like that, are not so useful for clerics,
because our innate dodge skill is capped at a low 80.<br>
<br>
Click Effects: &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 clickies, my bank and bags are full of
them, useful and useless, I just love em <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0> I really do have too much
though... &gt;&lt;<br>
<br>
Proc Effects:&nbsp; See above<br>
<br>
Worn Effects: If this counts worn DS then I say yes, it is quite
important, because DS is critical for any efficient damage when a
cleric solos, we do more damage over a long period of time with damage
shields and marks, than we ever do with ward. Improved Dodge is decent,
its not a huge huge benefit, but its still decent. Cleave is fun but
its not that useful <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-tongue.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0><br>
<br>
Focus Effects: IMPORTANT. Casters are extremely dependant on foci to
achieve their best / average performances with their spells. However,
currently, foci are at the most 1-65%, which is a 1/65 chance of
hitting any of the numbers. This is a large dice to roll, and makes us
very dependant on RNG, even with foci that are at the most 40%. The way
to alleviate this in general, whilst still being an upgrade, would be
to produce items with foci that have a raised minimum from 1%. It
reduces the amount of values RNG can pick, whilst raising the average,
improving average sustainability of heals, dots nukes and so forth.
Other than that, I am happy with the progression of all other foci.<br><br>
<br>
Hope this helps Merloc <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0>
