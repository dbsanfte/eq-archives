<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>HP: Lack of hitpoints causes death, so definately important. However, having more hitpoints doesnt allow me to tank better. Not as important as AC/Avoid/Shielding and other things that reduce damage taken.<BR>Mana: I definately need mana because I depend on my spells.<BR>Endurance:&nbsp;I have never seen my endurance bard drop... So&nbsp;I dont know.&nbsp;<BR>AC: This is absolutely critical.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>HP Regen: Nice to have.<BR>Mana Regen: We dont get a chance to sit and med, so definately important.<BR>Endurance Regen: Not important.&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Strength: I find str, sta, agi, dex, and wisdom to be very important... However my stats have been above the hard cap for the last several expansions, so I take them for granted.<BR>Stamina: <BR>Agility: <BR>Dexterity: <BR>Charisma: <BR>Intelligence: <BR>Wisdom: </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Cold Resist: All resists are situational to the content.&nbsp;Resisting an NPC spell effect can be crucial to an event. &nbsp;<BR>Disease Resist: <BR>Poison Resist: <BR>Magic Resist: <BR>Fire Resist: </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Attack: Never really noticed a difference, I dont have a whole lot of input as my damage output isnt that great and my role is really a tank who can toss out nice heals.<BR>Delay: <BR>Damage: <BR>Range: </DIV>
<DIV>Haste: </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Combat Effects: <BR>Shielding: I have picked some up, but I dont really notice a difference in my tanking ability. My understanding is it that it is more noticable against NPC that hit really hard.<BR>Stun Resist: I want to max this as nothing is worse than pulling an NPC and being stunned while it gets to take cheap shots.<BR>Strikethrough: This helps me do more damage since I usually attack monsters from the front.<BR>Spell Shield: Dont pay much attention to it.<BR>Avoidance: I notice a big difference in tanking with this.<BR>Accuracy: Dont pay much attention to it.<BR>DOT Shielding: Dont pay much attention to it.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Skill Mods: I have never had a skill mod item.<BR>Click Effects: I like clicky ac/mana regen/resists. <BR>Proc Effects: I like heal procs on my weapons.<BR>Worn Effects: I used to dread giving up my faerune item, but now that it is an AA it isnt so bad.<BR>Focus Effects: Improved Dodge, Parry are awesome. I want to get cleave and ferocity eventually.<BR></DIV></DIV>
