				Yeah, I just got my Mage from max KoS to apprehensive to CoH people to the Chardok raid spots, and the goblins in the FM caves were definitely the easy spot to do so. They literally die in five seconds to the epic pet, and about 1/3 drops a skin and/or one or more salts. I'd go there for two to three hours and come out with a ten-slot backpack full of skins and salts... between that and some XP grinding in Droga with guild groups it took me 3-4 evenings.<br><br>FM caves are pretty boring, but the fast way to raise faction. Now, if only I hadn't pressed 'shift' rather than 'ctrl' a couple of times and accidentally handed in whole stacks rather than single skins and salts...
