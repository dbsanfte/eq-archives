<DIV>CT needs to be looked into. And when I say that, I mean ALL of the reptile mobs there need to drop some goddamn Great Reptile Hides and not in some messed up 1:100 ratio like they already drop at off of the Raptor mobs in there.<BR><BR>Edit: Or VP needs its mob density lowered and the wandering see invis mobs taken out to make it possible to solo, albeit still inefficiently, for Great Reptile Hides.<BR></DIV><BR>

<BR></BLOCKQUOTE>Why?<BR><BR>
<HR>
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR><BR><BR>Because it is completely unbalanced for the races that need Great Reptile Pieces to make Master's DoN armour, and for several of those, that is the best skillup path for tailoring since Velious tailoring got **SMURF** all over when DoN came out leaving less than half of the things you could skill up on from at their original trivial levels. Not only that, but the people that would make it / want it made could not even hunt in VP even if they somehow managed to luck out and get flagged for it.<BR><BR>The only way to currently get those pieces currently are if you have a bot that is flagged and can go there and tank the mobs easily, or know someone that is keyed for the zone and actually wants to go there. Finding people with the keys is one thing, finding someone that actually wants to go there is a whole other problem.<BR>

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>Aye this is a problem for a lot of master stuff. Piles of gravel are also a pain. Meanwhile, Vah Shir get Yttrium for smithing, which drops like crazy in the deep.
