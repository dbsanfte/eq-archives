				I know the devs already know of the Zanivar quest triggers in befallen where Zanivar wont move. However the triggers themselves seem to be working fine. If you go further in the zone going back and forth to answer the text, eventually he will head down to his final spot next to the Urn. Which by the way, the main urn and like 3 out of the 5 urn spawns are human models. So anyway, you get through all the Urns and it looks like finally it triggers Zanivar to attack. Kill him and you can loot the map. Well from there your stuck, unless you have gate. There is no NPC to zone you out like some of the other instances. Ive had the same problem with under the field of bone quest. Once you get done you best have gate or your stuck.

<DIV>the griffin mission in west commons ws extremely buggy last night. the nubies where on a rampage, they run at sow speed, slaughter your party,(ALL the nubies come in a bunch), then when you respawn, they track right to you at the zone in, (as if your agro wasn't lost on death), and procced to corpse camp/death loop you. as it is there is no way to complete the mission. This insanity starts once you find 6 eggs.</DIV>

				I completed all 5 Halloween Quests. I had 4 Bristlebane tickets prior to particpating in and completing the final quest given by the puppet. I used illusion I received as reward from other quest and attempted to talk with Zigab Ribshard in PoK. He does not acknowledge that I have completed all the quests and just gives the beginning text and replies. I have tried several different illusions and none seem to work. <br><br>Any help on this??<br><br>Thanks,

<DIV>The task, Find Fribblebrap 4: The Korlach, &nbsp;is ejecting my group at 3 hours left of the original 6, and again at 1 hour left.&nbsp;&nbsp; It uncompletes any objectives you did while inside.&nbsp; The very vague goal of "find the alchemist' is just a slaughter x number of mobs.&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The time we found that out, we cleared from ZI to the far campfire room and back.. only to&nbsp;hit the 3 hour mark&nbsp;and a zone full of respawns between us and named, so it boots us and recreates the instance.&nbsp; bam, have to kill x number of mobs again, but only got 2 hours till next respawn of the zone.&nbsp; The next time after, we moved straight to the campfire room and killed.. killing respawns weren't enough to fill the quota for popping named, boom, ejected.&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Not to mention.. when you go to the cocoon, there 2 spiders guarding the door near bridge.. 3 inside the first room, 3 inside upstairs, and 3 in the way back room.&nbsp; If respawns happen in the first room before you open the cocoon, the 4 mobs that get triggered to agro your party as you watch the NPC run off will turn out to be 8 mobs.. 2 pairs of spawns in the exact same spot.&nbsp; We even saw triples once.&nbsp;&nbsp; Our only way to get out of that mess was to have the warrior stand in the middle and cyclone when they all were triggered to agro us... then do laps around the lake as NPC reached his objective, zone.&nbsp; </DIV>

<DIV>I've run into a problem with the "Basic Training" task from the tutorial.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I've had a low-level rogue for a long time before the new tutorial was made (his original purpose was to run around Kaladim harvesting mushrooms so my main could use them for making Kaladim Constitutionals). Though I never really played him aside from that, I'd occasionally pass a few items down that my other characters had either outgrown or couldn't use. As a result, at some point, his starting Dagger* got deleted to make way for better items.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I recently moved him into the tutorial to run him through some of the tasks when I was bored, but could never finish the Basic Training task...more specifically, the step where you give your weapon to Absor to have it upgraded. I obviously cannot do that because I no longer have the weapon he accepts, and cannot buy it anywhere since I believe it is NODROP.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>So my question is: is there any way those few of us who have lost or otherwise discarded that weapon can get another one, either through a hail, perhaps a kill, perhaps an equivalent tradeable item can be added, etc. Alternatively, perhaps we could just skip this step by telling him we [do not need an upgrade] or something.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I know it's probably not a big deal, and the task works fine for other alts I've created afterwards and kept their starting weapons. But it's going to drive me crazy to not be able to finish it. <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0> Thanks.</DIV>

				<DIV>I am a human magician. This is to let you know that Barrenzin's 4th task directs me to <STRONG>East</STRONG> Commonlands to kill Dervish Cutthroats, and more. I spent several hours looking for DCs in East Commonlands, to no avail. I eventually crossed over to West Commonlands and, lo and behold, was able to find the DC's and carry out all the 4th-task requirements there ---- in <STRONG>West</STRONG> Commonlands.

<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Having completed the 4th task and reaped its rewards, I expected&nbsp;Barrenzin to give me a 5th task. Instead he gave the 4th task once again, which I completed a second time (no rewards, of course). So I went back to Barrenzin and, to my surprise, he gave me&nbsp;his 6th and 7th tasks ---- but no&nbsp;5th task. I completed both the 6th and 7th tasks and Barrenzin now says he has no more tasks for 'someone of my abilities'. </DIV>

<DIV>So where do I go next to get more tasks?</DIV>

<DIV>Barrenzin does offer a 5th Trial - however it is a Group Trial (need at least 2 members - not sure if it is minimum level driven or average level driven, but I believe the minimum level is 15) - Use the Keyword "Group" and you should be able to get the task (assuming you have the approprate group).

				<div></div>It appears that the mobs in permafrost that drop pieces for the warrior 1.0 epic no longer exist. The ice giants and normal goblins have been replaced by drakes and young/elder goblins respectively. Please investigate this issue, for until this gets fixed, warriors like myself wont be able to finish their epics.

<P>What class was the character you completed this quest with TerminatDiem?&nbsp; I just ran through this and received a reward upon completion.&nbsp; Just as a double check as well, was this the first time you'd done the quest?</P>
