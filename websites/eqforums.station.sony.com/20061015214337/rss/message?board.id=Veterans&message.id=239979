      <description>Add spawn rate during the first phase was the same for us but was&#xD;
definately less during second phase. From reading the above, it seems&#xD;
people have quite different experiences with the add spawn rate in the&#xD;
new version.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Changes to make the event longer would be bad. We have enough&#xD;
marathons. Tweaking up the chaos factor would be much better as long as&#xD;
a huge roll of the dice is not re-introduced.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;The change was very Performeresque indeed, from&amp;nbsp;incredibly rough to a pushover.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Hopefully we'll end up with an end product, where we find a middle ground.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;As I said to Wycca last night when it was clear we were going to beat about five seconds after we hit Phase 2 for the first time last night, as it stands, if you can get to the event, there's really&amp;nbsp;no convincing reason imo that you shouldn't be able to beat this encounter as is with very limited attempts from scratch.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Hats off to Assent and Tide for their previous victories, and while I do firmly believe a change was in order to address the AE problems, I'm certain that I am not alone when I say most of the high-end community doesn't want to just blink and have content fall over dead, so without passing further judgement until it is remedied, I hope it doesn't take too long to arrive at the final destination of appropriate difficulty.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;The change in the AE didn't bother me so much.... that got rid of 20king and getting stuck in the rafters.&amp;nbsp; I personally like the change to the distance of the AE, even if it's&amp;nbsp;a little funny at first.&amp;nbsp; Their HPs don't need to be doubled either, altho returning them to what they were previously wouldn't be to bad - yesterday was the first time we ever killed one before the second AE.&amp;nbsp; Increasing the add spawn will help a bit.&amp;nbsp; If you're worried about guilds being overwhelmed just give mezzables a better chance to spawn.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Just getting rid of the FD so you didn't need 8 warriors was more then enough to make the event beatable.... if you wanted to tune it down just a little so more could beat the event, then reducing their hps slightly while leaving the rest of the event intact would have been a wiser option.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;From what everyone was saying before, with the Enforcers being "Thuuli&#xD;
clones", I'm going to gather they actually used Zi-Thuuli's PBAE&#xD;
flux.&amp;nbsp; Is that correct?&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
If that's true, then, yeah, that'd be pretty brutal with all 4 in&#xD;
succession.&amp;nbsp; From that, the only change that might have been&#xD;
needed was, while moving them over to their own AE, make it 200 range&#xD;
and Line-Of-Sight.&amp;nbsp; That'd probably have made the event difficult&#xD;
but doable.&amp;nbsp; Also, from my, admittedly limited interaction on the&#xD;
subject, I'm not hearing anyone complain too much that the FD is gone.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
On the subject of the Enforcer HP, it's possible due to the changes, the&#xD;
preception of their HP has changed.&amp;nbsp; I'm agnostic about their&#xD;
original HP, but I have seen how Thuuli's FD can cripple your DPS&#xD;
output.&amp;nbsp; Add in fairly fast-reload fluxes and you've got a recipe&#xD;
for lowering a guild's DPS output by a lot.&amp;nbsp; So Prathun will have&#xD;
to comment on their HP.&amp;nbsp; Who knows, maybe Prathun added a reverse&#xD;
mitigation setting?&amp;nbsp; Many things can effect how fast they die&#xD;
without changing their Hitpoints.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
As it stands, this isn't at the same level as the Wailing&#xD;
Sisters.&amp;nbsp; I'd say around Tris Wallos III, so a little easier than&#xD;
Redfang, but not too much.&amp;nbsp; Definitely not Sullon Zek level,&#xD;
that's certain.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

      <description>The Deathknell changes pretty much ended up like i tough it would. ie: way too much tuning down. From doing the event pre-nerf it was in fact beatable and didnt need much tuning. The only problem, really, was the four flux. All they needed was making it hatelist, blockable by walls or smaller PBAE range. All the other fix were unnecessary.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I believe the point of being against a tuning down change is to actually soften it so it isnt too much (Like it happenned with Vish, Tris, Performer,&amp;nbsp; and now Enforcers). That kind of change, for me, make an event unfun. I am aware that it is not everyone who are like me and really don't care much about loot. I really don't mind what is the RvR of anything, I care for RiE (Risks in Encounter) and thats why I prefer fights like OMM. Which btw never really been "farmed" because the majority care for RvR. It would have reach the farmed status if the BPs only dropped from him (like it use to be).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;What I liked at first about DK is the fact that its a very small raid zone with only 4 encounters. Most of those event are "Time capped" and its a perfect one night raid. Personnally, I don't want to spend a whole night snoozing for loot, since i don't care much about it. I want to spend a night executing a series of challenging encounters and feel a sens of accomplishment doing it. I believe thats what Deathknell should be about.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Many people might differ and just want to be able to plow through it mindlessly, it's there point of view. I also agree that there should be events for everyone. For example Tris, an event that i really dont like, but it's a perfect encounter for Parsers. The hard part of designing encounters isnt building the event itself, but please all the players.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Ok, maybe im all wrong here, and if it was over nerfed thats cool bring it up a little, but to compare the 1st mob in zone to the 'bottlenecks' and end zone boss (omm and bat boy respectivly) seems a bit like comparing apples to oranges.&amp;nbsp; Now dont get me wrong challenging is fun, but it is what it is, nothing wrong with having easier, medium and Tough in an end zone.&amp;nbsp; In fact thats kinda of the way it should be imo.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;p.s. Im a 90% 6-7 day a week raider(for the last 2 years at least;p) who cares more about playing and having fun than most else.&amp;nbsp; But everyone isnt like me and I readily accept that.&amp;nbsp; Sure these zones should be challenging and 'exclusive per se, just not to the extent that its becomes greatly unfun.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;This was far easier then Redfang, and much easier then Tris.&amp;nbsp; How many times did it take you defeat Redfang and Tris, and how many times did it take you to beat the Enforcers.&amp;nbsp; That should be a red light right there.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;Tris:&amp;nbsp; Two attempts on the first night (the second of which was really late with lots of key people missing) and then Tris died first try the next night.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>I will agree with most and say that the event is too easy as it&#xD;
stands.&amp;nbsp; It has alot of potential as a fun event however with the&#xD;
right cocktail - I like the base design, and I like how it can reward&#xD;
various strats.&amp;nbsp; Given that there is only 4 events (I'm going on&#xD;
others comments here) - it would stand to reason that the 4 events&#xD;
would be more on the harder side than the easier.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Some tweaks I could see making the fight more fun-&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Phase 1 - More adds imo (1.5x, maybe even 2x as much)&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Phase 2 - Up enforcer hp by 2x, and slightly increase frequency of AE-&#xD;
ideally you will want each team and the main raid to have to deal with&#xD;
the ae, but not enough to cause the encounter to be unbalanced.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
Likewise a little more AE height probably wouldn't be amiss- jumping&#xD;
5ft in the air was sorta funny, I don't want to be stuck on the&#xD;
ceiling, but most classes should suffer some fall damage imo- it should&#xD;
hurt your dps with the knockback not be annoying.&amp;nbsp; They were a&#xD;
total pushover as it stands - the AE was a joke.&amp;nbsp; Increase the&#xD;
amount of adds in that phase similar to phase 1 also IMO.&amp;nbsp; Lastly,&#xD;
I think a 20% increase in the firing of the spreading stone may work&#xD;
also- our knights/shm/dru didn't have tons to do after&#xD;
debuffing/slowing on phase 2.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
The best thing Prathun did with raid design was allowing an event to&#xD;
cater to all types of guilds.&amp;nbsp; There should be benefits/negatives&#xD;
to having more tanks/healers, for being balanced, and for having more&#xD;
dps.&amp;nbsp; Every type of guild should face different challenges in an&#xD;
event, while not being unable to beat it without changing their makeup&#xD;
significantly.&amp;nbsp; I hope that any changes reflect that mantra.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The bottlenecks of the event were the FD (and once it was "removed,"&#xD;
the bad server data that would occasionally[frequently] put it in the event again)&#xD;
and the time of the year causing people to play Real Life.&amp;nbsp; If you&#xD;
put the event in the form it was two nights ago plus a staggering of&#xD;
the fluxes, it'll be fine.&amp;nbsp; And maybe the upheaval to like halfway&#xD;
up the wall, not all the way to the rafters.&amp;nbsp; But getting stuck really wasn't too&#xD;
much of an issue when tanks were able to keep aggro without the&#xD;
FD.&amp;nbsp; Last nights' 2 inch flux was roflcopter.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

      <description>Veni Vidi Gigli... We came, we saw, we laughed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After getting very close to beating the event as it was- (good practice!) this was fairly anticlimactic. Total losses 1 overnuking wiz and 1 overdoting necro...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;oh well, it's the entry level event aka Zi-Thuuli, right?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>The event went from pretty fun and very hard (it's fatal flaw being that bad luck could essentially wipe you)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To a complete snooze-fest bore.&amp;nbsp; Experienced it today, was simply stunned at the gimping of it.&amp;nbsp; Even a day of reading the posts in this thread didn't prepare us for how laughable it now is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It doesn't need a little fine-tuning right now, it needs drastic revamping, to get it a LOT closer to it's previous form.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sad to say but the previous version was less frustrating than the current incarnation :(&lt;br&gt;</description>
