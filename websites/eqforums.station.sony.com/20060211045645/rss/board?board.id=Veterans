      <title>Druid Damage Over Time Spells:  WTH Did You People Do??</title>

      <description>First of all, I HOPE THIS IS A BUG&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My Guild was doing Vule tonight and I was laying the smack down with 9 of my DoTs, 4 clicky and the rest cast.  But I noticed something very strange.  The castable DoTs were doinig very little damage, even on a Debuffed Vule.  So, moused over the spell icons and and held the right mouse button down to get the spell info.  Here it is:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wasp Swarm (level 70)  Causes between 97 and  289 damage per tick  for 54 seconds&lt;br&gt;Winged Death (level 53) Causes between 66 and 122 damage per tick  for 54 seconds&lt;br&gt;Drifting Death (level 40)  Causes between 69 and 91 damage per tick for 54 seconds&lt;br&gt;Vengeance of The Sun (level 69) Causes between 156 and 412 damage per tick for 30 seconds&lt;br&gt;Vengeance of Nature (level 55) Causes between 72 and 174 damage per tick for 30 seconds&lt;br&gt;Vengeance of the Wild (level  48) Causes between 71 and 124 damage per tick for 30 seconds&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now here is what Lucy says, as of the last Lucy update on 12-19-2005&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wasp Swarm Causes between 283 and 289 damage per tick for 54 seconds&lt;br&gt;Winged Death Causes between 113 and 122 damage per tick for 54 seconds&lt;br&gt;Drifting Death Causes 91 damage per tick for 54 seconds&lt;br&gt;Vengeance of the Sun Causes between 408 and 412 damage per tick for 30 seconds&lt;br&gt;Vengeance of Nature Causes between 170 and 174 damage per tick for 30 seconds&lt;br&gt;Vengeance of the Wild Causes between 114 and 124 damage per tick for 30 seconds&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And NOW for our Clicky DoTs:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Orb of Clinging Death (Swarming Death Clicky) Causes between 102 and 225 damage per tick for 54 Seconds...Should be 216 to 224 Damage per tick for 54 Seconds&lt;br&gt;Blade of The Tempest (Tempest Wrath Clicky) Causes 75 Damage...Should be 75 damage per tick for 2 minutes&lt;br&gt;Nature Walker's Bracer (Drones of Doom Clicky) Causes between 34 and 71 damage per tick for 48 seconds....should be  62 to 71 damage per tick for 48 Seconds&lt;br&gt;Naturewalker's Scimitar (Wrath of Nature Clicky) Causes 55 damage per tick for 3 minutes...UNCHANGED&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have no idea what is going on here but if this is not a bug and it is a nerf then it is unacceptable.  We have had our spells changed time and again.  But at least we have been informed for the most part that changes were going to be made.  But this Ninja nerfing, if it is indeed SoE's doing, is just plain dirty pool.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Earthkeeper Nanoq MajicBlade&lt;br&gt;70 Natureguard&lt;br&gt;The Elitists&lt;br&gt;The Tribunal&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Evac without reloading? Get all corpse?</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Veterans&amp;message.id=181378#M181378</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;Is it possible to evac without having to reload?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In the very beginning, evac to inzone was quick. But with the bug of inability to remove aggro, we are forced to reload whenever we evac.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Now bard to fade memory without any problem, can the programmer change the codes so that it is possible to evac or succor without reloading?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;BTW, can I get all the stuff of my corpse with one command instead of looting every piece one by one? I have become better at retrieving my corpse for many year.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;here 10  requests devs. i hope you can consider these things!=p&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;1- lower requirment to start instences to 2 people, or even 1( i know necros n shamans can solo lot of em)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;2- add more races to monks(frog and kitty), its sad you have to choose between being blind or an ugly lizzy with 20% exp penality!  also just add all the classes to frogs already!=p&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;3- update old ui with por. make a log in poll, i bet you'll be surpised at how many still use the old UI. the new one is almost unusable for me, cant even tell what i have buffed of memmed with those icons&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;4- Fix crashing Demiplane And Queen events. its sad how much these end zones crash.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;5- read the top 10 for classes every once in a while. does anyone at the dev team actualy read those?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;6- un moderate the chat general channels. at least stuck charater channel unmod that so i can at least talk to the gm when i get stuck in an insteced&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;7- for people that dont own ldon, make it so they able to log in when they camp in an instenced&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;8- either make dodh raid augs better then anguish one groupable augs or just add type 7 to dodh augs so they at least able to fit on tradeskill armor.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;9- for love of god up the Scale drop rate a tad for cultured armor, no one does don  much anymore sense the creator nerf so scales are just becoming more rare and at outragus prices!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;10- let level 70s make Essence emeralds. people are sitting full exp with maxed aa getting massive yellow spam every time they try to camp something or do  a task . at least let these people be able to make something with their exp. this may be to much to ask and would take lot more of yoru focus to make but you could even put in something called soulstones(made from level 70s) for these people for an upgraded type EE spell for various classes(like summon to corpse for mages and FD for shamans(like thier ring)) .&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;i dont see this stuff as to much to ask, would you at least consier it? its about having something to log into, not dumbing down the game!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Barter Ripoffs</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Veterans&amp;message.id=181348#M181348</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;As it currently stands, the Barter system is horribly flawed and a haven for scumbag ripoff artists.  Here's the problem...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Scam_Artist_01 sets himself up in /barter mode.  He offers to purchase Uber_Tradeskilldrop_01 for 20,000pp.  He also sets up another buyline to purchase the exact same item for 100pp.  Two instances of the same item for two drastically different prices.  You, the seller click on the scumbag and up pops the barter sell screen and there is that item.  Woot!  20kpp is going to look nice in your bank account!  You click sell, and...  100pp!  What?  No confirmation screen asking you if you want to sell said item for said amount?  No information at all.  The only way you could possibly know is to look in the /barter screen and see both lines and look at the number of items the purchaser is willing to buy.  Usually he will buy (1-5) of the high priced one and (200+) of the low priced one.  This is really sleazy and needs looking at by the devs.  Please check this out!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>A new LFG tag</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Veterans&amp;message.id=181314#M181314</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;  I'm going to start using another tag in my lfg info instead of the normal places I'de like to group. This tag will be &amp;quot;Charity&amp;quot; and will mean &amp;quot;I'm bored so if anyone needs out of group help while I'm lfg feel free to send a tell&amp;quot;. This won't apply to raids however becuase this is help I'm offering WHILE I'm lfg and not instead of trying to find a group. The most likely candidates for this would be folks in places like valor that need a tank to help them out or in places like BoT trying to take on a named.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;   I feel if everyone else did this type of charity it'de really benefit the whole game. Since sitting around lfg is boring as ever may as well help others if I can. I can only hope this becomes a widely understood concept.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Have you ever thought years from now that you'll be telling your kids/grandkids about EQ and about how much fun, tough, etc things were?&lt;br&gt;1) Will you still be playing?&lt;br&gt;2) Will you have all the expansions?&lt;br&gt;3) Will you still be having fun?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I know I have at least 30 years left before I ever retire, so do you see this as a good leisurely activity for when you retire?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What technological advances do you think will evolve EQ beyond it's current gameplay?&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>No, not server, not boats, not, dunno, whatever.&lt;br&gt;Was chatting a few days ago with guildees and we got round to the inevitable nostalgia trip, and how the game has improved so much.  One thing commented upon was the bolts of energy flying across the sky that used to exist.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I remember being in EC, either at Orc1 or Tunnels buying things, and looking across the landscape and see a 'missed' caster bolt go slowly arcing across the sky.  Kind of showed that there was another group doing battle in the distance.  I'd pause a moment and watch the bolt fly off into the horizon, and if lower than usual, slowly lighting up the landscape as it passed near the walls of the zone.  Happened rarely enough that I don't think I've got an old screenshot laying around alas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What was it btw? Was it a mob died as the caster fired off their nuke at the slightly wrong time?  Not played a caster, but never really understood how an instant spell caused the bolt (perhaps that was why it was removed).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Silly thing I know, lets get back to the usual flames.  Thank you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;First off, thanks for EQ titanium. I have always wanted to two box and this has made it very affordable. Question though. After playing EQ for years I have accumulated every expansion so far offered for a toatl of 10 sequences of EQ. This has chewed up approximately 13 -14 gigs of space on my HD. However, EQ Titanium only uses 3.7 gigs.  Anyone know why?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Now all I need is 4 more computers and 8 more arms and I can do my own mini-raids as well as have my own guild.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Can someone comfirm what I was told at my local EB store today?  I was told that our copies would not be delivered to any EB store untill the 22nd, due to sony delivery schedule of disks.  Is this true?  If so then the only way to play the expansion on the 21st is to order it from sony and download it online, sorry but I find many things wrong with this method of distrubution if this holds true.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;So, I haven't used shrouds yet but was planning to this weekend to group with a low level friend.  The question is, I know I receive xp while shrouded at the same level that the shroud is, (IE. a blue lvl 20 mob gives me the xp a lvl 20 mob would despite my &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; lvl), but when I die, (hey it could happen  =), is my death penalty the same amount of xp I would lose at lvl 20 or at my &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; lvl?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Cuz it would be very wrong if I gain xp at the lvl 20 rate and lose it at the lvl 56 rate.  Ouch!  =)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Coldwind and the Dreaded "Remove it" gift! -(Dev's this needs to be fixed!)</title>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;After spending 3 months and many many hours of work, my guild and I finally finished all 5 Curse of the Blood raids. We happily moved into DS,figured out  the &amp;quot;Misty for you&amp;quot; arc and finally defeated Vule for the 1st time.  I was luckily selected to use my Lense of the Bound Eye to flag the 1st 6 people in my guild. So, unsure of what exactly we are doing we head to Nekt Forest where we think the correct quest is to combine the Vule's eye and the lensse. So, I get to Coldwind and I can't seem to figure out the right thing to say to get the mission to turn them both in. I have people yapping away and being very impatient as I try to read through all the gibberish. I am following all the bracket text as best as I can when I finally find the correct thing to say. I get the mission and combine the 2 items and head back to the CC npc to get my Monocle of Blood. I am ecstatic to say the least! &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Well, the next day I get up and check my AA's only to find that I am now missing 5/5 Curse of the bloods.  I am pissed to say the very least. I petition and look on the boards to find that I, by accidently, said &amp;quot;Remove it&amp;quot; to Coldwind and thus I am out 3 months of work and many annoying Queen fights. I petition and twice I am told you're SOL. I have been playing since the game went live and generally try to stay very current on all important path's of progression, but I am very angry at the way this occured. (I know I should have read more closely and that is not the point)   Why, would the Developers stick in so crucial of a progression changer with&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ffff00"&gt;NO confirmation box&lt;/font&gt;?  I think that this is very. very, very poor structure.  I just lost too many hours of work and many missed hours of sleep to get to where I am, only to have it all removed because in a sleep deprived moment, I accidently say the wrong thing?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I am resigned to the fact that I have to hope my guild will redo all the 5 raids so I can get them back, BUT I really think that the Developers dropped the ball.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Please for the love of all that is Holy, put a dang confirmation box in the game anytime you are about to cause some one to lose many days of work. I really think is shows poor fore thought. I don't pay station access x2 for this kind of stuff.  Also, please return some level of customer service to this game besides giving me some link I can follow to see how dumb I was for not reading closer.  Give us a reason to say something positive about Sony for a change. (i.e. Option: [Are you really really sure you want to be an idiot and remove all 5 curses?] Brackets! :smileysurprised:&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Hello,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Me and my group of friends have attempted this mission a few times now and got the cursor loot without any problems in easy/hard mode. What is causing problem is the optional part which involves killing the named in the tower.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Whenever we are fighting in the direction of the boss the task suddenly ends for everyone and we get ported back to stoneroot. The mission timer has around 5 hours left , but still the mission ends everytime. Is there some sort of invisable timer before boss depops and task ends or are we missing something here ? Its like 20 min from cursor loot till task ends, so i guess we would need a pretty good dps to fight to the boss within the limit if that is the case.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Thanks for any help!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;-Tiberion of Tunare&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>The real problem with MMs</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Veterans&amp;message.id=181121#M181121</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;If they didn't make forming a group so difficult they wouldn't need MM in the first place.  The time it takes to form a group, get to your location, start killing, recover (if possible) from a death or 2 or complete wipe, makes the average group not that great at getting exp.  And don't give me the same old bull crap about how it is not that hard.  I have been playing this game for 6 years and know how it is done.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I just see things from others eyes and not my own tunnel vision experience.  Folks who want to enjoy this game, who do not raid, like to have alts, it is tough to get some toons strong enough to get decent exp. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;To have an effective tank, you have to be level 70, 200 aa's and 13k+ HPs.  So how can I get to that point without these MM's, EFFECTIVELY.  I am not talking easy, just effective.  Again, I have played for 6 years and do not want to spend the amount of time I did to get my main up that high.  I want the choice of what class I might want to play since there always seems to be an issue finding a tank, cleric or slower, at least on my server and depending on time of day.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I am not pro MMs but how else can they develop something that allows people to play any class, in any group, and get good exp.  I am not talking your uber or upper ended person.   How can I get all my spells/combat abilities if it takes high end folks to handle RS/Illisian type mobs.  How can I do the DODH spell mission runs when 13k tanks get chewed up like a silk wearer and healers go OOM even healing a great tank.  My main is far from weak and it still took me over a year to get OOW spells and still only have a couple DODH spell missions complete.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So I'm checking out EQ Player's Advanced Item Search (which is pretty cool, but the data on items is a little lacking), and I see you can search for weapons with Bane Damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's on the list?  For one thing, did you know there is a Mosquito Bane Damage item?  Heh.  I could use that on a hot summer day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I get to thinking, I need me an Iksar bane damage 2-hander for my new Gnome Shadow Knight.  Alas, Iksar isn't even in the list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what's this?  GNOME is listed under possibilities for bane damage weapons?!  Fortunately there were no results, but I'm deeply offended that Gnome is on the list and Iksar is not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only other player-race in the list is Human.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least throw a Halfling in there, if not Ogre or Troll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;/grrr&lt;br&gt;-- C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'd be a little happier if I could at least get a Bane Damage (Fly) for when I'm grouping with Ogres and Trolls.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
