&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana size=5&gt;I think that the Dire Charm should be upgraded to a higher level. Right now it is only to level 64. We need it to at least be to a 68 and that would help alot.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Dire Charm is actually 46 max level mobs&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I was actually flinching away from my screen at that font.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;If there was mercy or justice in this world one of the forum halflings would just lock out and delete this and about 99% of the other enchanter forum threads.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;We're never going to see any movement on the "class re-envisionment", we'll get a Dev to actually address the issues we've pushed up, and out "top 10" is a black hole.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>I think Dire Charm should absolutely be reworked in some way.  I personally would have liked to see it chaned to an AA that, when activated, would make the next charm spell cast last full duration.  This is essentially what Edict of Command is supposed to be.  However, Edict requires DC as a prereq.  I think Edict would be selectively useful, though I would like to see a 36 minute reuse on it, but with DC as a prereq, I don't think I'll be getting this for a long while.  DC is essentially worthless in the game as it stands now.  Reworking it won't be easy, but it has to be looked at.</description>

I wonder who thought of this weird number.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also there is the Problem of reverse charming, I bet that names will be immune to this charm.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Killing what? I fully expect it to follow the omens rules of charming.&amp;nbsp; Possibly even retro to the ealier expansions.&amp;nbsp; Though if it isn't, there are few things I could kill with it that I can't already do now.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>I tell you why I think it's broken: it's useless outside of PoP zones. You can't use it anywhere in GoD, OoW, DoN or DoDH. The last time I used it was for messing around in Kael.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We should get the option of a refund for a useless that they have driven into the ground.</description>

&lt;P&gt;That doesn't mean that DC is broken. DC works just fine. There's just a lack of mobs in the expansions you name above (although the start zones of GoD and OoW you can DC just fine in), but that doesn't mean that DC is broken.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The expansions have simply evolved past Dire Charm, thats all..... Dire Charm itself is not broken.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The fact that you cannot use DC in most zones&amp;nbsp;from the GoD expansion and all expansions after that, still does not mean that it is "broken" as some people like to refer it to. Something is "broken" when it does not work. Dire Charm is still working pretty much the same as when PoP came out.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;What newer content zones need is level 46 mobs to be charmed. Let some of the random spawns in OoW zones be&amp;nbsp;"a young dragorn" or "an ukun youngling" or something like that.... every puller in a group will very soon know that that is a dire charmable mob and will ask the enchanter in the group if he needs a DC pet.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I think there should be DC mobs in most (not all, but certainly a lot more then now) zones in the newer expansions. The DC pets can hit for 170 damage, and in the Planes it was a nice add-on to DPS to scrape a few k hp from a mob. They certainly aren't meant for long duration tanking, they would just be trashed by the hard hitting mobs in OoW expansions. If you want a sturdy pet, you will simply need to take the risk of charming one with your regular charm spells.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Conslusion: DC is not broken. Zones simply lack DC mobs.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I still use it a lot on Epic 1.0 raids though in old world and kunark zones..... most zones that have a Epic 1.0 mob in them have something thats direcharmable as well.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

If you want DC to be useful again but you don't want to categorize it as "broken" in some way, then you would have to label all the zones with no DC mobs as broken.  Personally, I would say let's just fix the AA.</description>

It's really that simple.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;HR&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;P&gt;The fact that you cannot use DC in most zones from the GoD expansion and all expansions after that, still does not mean that it is "broken" as some people like to refer it to. Something is "broken" when it does not work. Dire Charm is still working pretty much the same as when PoP came out.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let me ask it this way - if we had gotten no new mezzes after Bliss, would you consider mezzing broken?</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I'm not in favor of refunding the AA's.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/FONT&gt;I think that most who bought this AA either had plenty of time to enjoy its usefulness (eg, bought it before OoW came out), or should have thought a little harder before buying it to begin with.&amp;nbsp; I'd love to see DC mobs in newer zones, and I wouldn't mind an Advanced DC AA.&amp;nbsp; However, I put it into the "fun AA's" category rather than the "broken AA's" category.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

How would you feel if, say, Spellcasting Fury only worked on nukes up to level 60.  Would that then become a "fun AA" because you can still use it if you mem old spells?</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana size=3&gt;Having given this considerable thought I would like them to add extra levels DC will work on as they have with the ranger headshot AA so we can purchase an increase do our DC ability. I accept they will have to tweak the mobs when charmed thats not the issue. If rangers and I presum,e rogues assainate have been allowed to go up our DC should go up as well.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana size=3&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana size=3&gt;Just my 2pp&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
