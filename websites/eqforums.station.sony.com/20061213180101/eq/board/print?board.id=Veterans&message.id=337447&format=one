				Actually charm slot augs across the board would be kinda kewl. Let's face it, there's pretty much 3 that 85 percent of the population have, ldon which if you weren't around for when it was released you prolly aren't gonna max now, The slipgears which took no skill to get and was upgraded to, The wanderlust, which also required little skill. I didn't know about the dod raid ones.<br><br><br>Having some more that actually took effort to get would be nice. Raid and group/quest wise.<br><br><div></div>
