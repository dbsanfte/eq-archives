      <title>Puller OOR?  No xp for group!</title>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;So you are chain pulling for your group.&amp;nbsp; The current mob is getting low on health, so you run off to pull another mob.&amp;nbsp; While you are off getting the mob, the rest of the group finishes off the previous mob...and no one gets xp because you are too far from the group.&amp;nbsp; This is incredibly frustrating.&amp;nbsp; The group is then pissed at you, because they got no xp.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;This has always been an incredible frustration to me.&amp;nbsp; I took a break from EQ for a few months, and I come back, and it seems the range has been reduced even more.&amp;nbsp; I thought this was my imagination, until it was confirmed that the range was decreased.&amp;nbsp; I just cannot understand this.&amp;nbsp; To me, this is THE most frustrating thing about EQ.&amp;nbsp; Is the purpose to prevent chain pulling for some strange reason?&amp;nbsp; I'm thinking it has something to do with trying to prevent people from grouping up with other soloers so they can solo and still get the group bonus.&amp;nbsp; If so, there HAS to be a better way to prevent that.&amp;nbsp; Maybe if the person is OOR and they didn't do any damage to the mob then no one gets xp.&amp;nbsp; As it is, its main function is to prevent people from chain pulling.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Just base the exp bonus on the number of group members in range of the kill.  Everyone still gets exp, slightly reduced if puller is oor, can't be exploited by scattered soloers.</description>

      <description>As already stated many times, there is no reason we should have to accomodate for a KNOWN BUG. This has been going on for years now and only now are the GMs finally looking into it? As to that, what is the current status of this? Almost 4 months now that they were supposed to look into it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also already stated, this bug has nothing to do with soloers grouping....if you are a soloer, you don't group, if you group then you are a grouper. If you are grouped and in a different part of the zone, you still get party experience and not a solo experience + group bonus. Even if you did, this bug would not stop that from happening. In fact, it would probably encourage just such a thing. You are solo, you are the only one pulling....if you aren't around when the mob dies, that's your own **SMURF** fault not your &amp;quot;solo&amp;quot; buddy half a zone away dealing with his own mob(s).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is obvious that this is a bug and needs to be fixed as this is causing an undesirable effect on groups. People get upset at the puller because they don't account for the bug, but the people should be getting pissed off at SOE for not fixing the bug in the first place.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let me ask you this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If everyone in the group is &lt;strong&gt;on the hate list&lt;/strong&gt; of the mob but not everyone is in &amp;quot;experience range&amp;quot; at the time the mob dies how can there be an exploit? Obviously at some point during the fight everyone either damaged the mob or casted on a fellow group member which should earn them a share of the xp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If people are soloing or AFK at a safe point they are &lt;strong&gt;not on the hate list&lt;/strong&gt; and the rest of the group gets xp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sounds to me like it was first coded that &lt;strong&gt;no one gets xp if anyone is oor &lt;/strong&gt;and was then changed to &lt;strong&gt;no one gets xp if anyone on the hate list is oor&lt;/strong&gt; probably because of complains about afk people that stayed behind and ruined the xp for everyone. The coding as it is atm does not make any sense. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>It doesn't matter whether you are on the hate list or not. You don't have to have touched the mob a single time or even looked at it to get exp if you are in the group that killed it. It is simply if you are the one that pulled the mob, getting what I call &amp;quot;initial aggro&amp;quot;, and then go out of exp range and don't return to that range before the mob is dead, your entire group loses out on exp. However, if somebody else in the group goes out of exp range while the mob is killed, only that person misses out on the exp. Also, death or any other form of zoning as well as successfully FDing are all ways to remove the &amp;quot;initial aggro&amp;quot; flag from somebody.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was never coded where if a single person was oor that nobody got the exp. I really just think that it was coded to avoid somebody sitting an alt at zone meanwhile the main is off somewhere slaying mobs and gaining no risk exp to the alt. Of course this is ridiculous because somebody will simply have their alt sitting nearby to avoid that. I have done so already *shrug*. What should be done is either expand the exp range a good amount or make it zone wide experience....which I don't think the latter is a great idea, but if it's the only way to fix this problem, it should be done. We have some very large zones in the game and if a group is able to kill the mobs in their group's area before the spawns can repopulate, the group shouldn't, then, be inadvertantly punished when the puller is forced to go out of exp range to get more mobs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Really what should be done, is if you are on the hatelist of the mob, and you are in the group that did the most damage to the mob, then you should get xp, regardless of where in the zone you are.  At this point, I don't think it is a game design issue (it is past that point...it is an admitted bug and is not &amp;quot;working as intended&amp;quot;).  It is a code issue.  Who knows whether it will ever get fixed or not though.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Are there workarounds that you can do?  Yes, but they all suck.  I see my job as puller, to time pulls to come in right as the previous mob dies.  This is just not possible in many zones in many groups, with this bug.  There are always going to be times where the mob dies quicker then you anticipated...due to a wizard/mage crit or what have you.  I like truely challenging pulls.  What I don't like is stupid bugs like this that cause my group to lose xp for no good reason.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I'm sure there is most likely a defect report or, whatever they call it, on this issue.  And I am betting it has a very low priority/urgency, and it is unlikely it will ever get addressed.  The reason it has a low priority, is because of limited customer complaints because most people think it is intentional to prevent some solo group xp exploit.  it isn't, but that is the common misconception.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;If you tried to base xp off of a mob's hate list there are a number of classes that would complain about this. The 2 main classes that would be complaining are the main pulling classes - bards &amp;amp; monks. If your proposed model was introduced, then lets say the puller goes out to get the next mob only they aggro 2 mobs. The bard uses FM or the monk uses FD to clear aggro from their pull but they've also the cleared aggro from the mob in camp. If the monk pops back up before the mob dies and didn't get the random mem wipe from FD, xp is still received. Bards on the other hand will not get xp unless they speedy gonzales their arse back to camp just to get back on the hate list. This is essentially replacing 1 problem for another, only you won't hear complaints from the rest of the group since they were still on the hate list :smileyvery-happy:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Personally, I don't see a better way to implement the xp reward than it currently is other than increasing the range needed to be within in order to receive xp. You can't make it zonewide due to obvious exploits that would involve and I don't think you can do a hate list model for the reason mentioned above. With me being a monk with run 8, it is aggravating when I'm in RS or MPG, leave when the mob is at 90% health to go pull the next mob, and occasionally don't make it back in range to get xp.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;hr&gt;Raffle wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;If you tried to base xp off of a mob's hate list there are a number of classes that would complain about this. The 2 main classes that would be complaining are the main pulling classes - bards &amp;amp; monks. If your proposed model was introduced, then lets say the puller goes out to get the next mob only they aggro 2 mobs. The bard uses FM or the monk uses FD to clear aggro from their pull but they've also the cleared aggro from the mob in camp. If the monk pops back up before the mob dies and didn't get the random mem wipe from FD, xp is still received. Bards on the other hand will not get xp unless they speedy gonzales their arse back to camp just to get back on the hate list. This is essentially replacing 1 problem for another, only you won't hear complaints from the rest of the group since they were still on the hate list :smileyvery-happy:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Yeah, but I think the solution that the game designers have in mind is to have the group get xp, but the person OOR not get xp.  I think that is unfair to the puller (but better then the current situation).  In any case, the range as it currently is, is way to small.  The devs don't see this as a priority though, so I don't have much hope of anything being done to address it.&lt;br&gt;</description>

      <description>It should be a priority for them. It is one of the most prevalent bugs in EQ at this point.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>We just have to keep complaining about it then.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

If they put me on ignore then I guess they're just wasting bandwidth with all the posts I'll have about it. They'd be better off banning me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
