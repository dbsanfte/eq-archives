<DIV>i completely agree though, hate was one of my favorite places to hang out, but now i will probably never go back due to the 5 minute timer on everything in the zone. the 5 minute timer should only be on the maestro and inny, but i guess it wont happen until enough people complain.<BR>

<DIV>Alright.. I felt I had to say something... but this is kind of sad... that people have come to completely avoid some of their FAVORITE places SOLELY because they are forced to the playstyle we had before this out of combat rest system came along... </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Don't get me wrong... I love the new OOC system... but... that is kind of sad... I've played this game since 1999? and every now and then I kind of miss the old days... but I'm still here.. and I still love EverQuest... and I absolutely love TSS... so... you really shouldn't take the OOC system for granted.. and maybe sit there and regen your mana like you used to... or maybe think about how it used to be.. 6+ years ago... when you had to /book to regen mana and your entire screen was covered and you couldn't see a **SMURF** thing... lol </DIV></BLOCKQUOTE></DIV>
