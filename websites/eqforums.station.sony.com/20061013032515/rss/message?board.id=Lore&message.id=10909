      <description>&lt;div&gt;I thought I would make a post on this subject since in several posts a lot is referred to maybe the Elddar made this or maybe they did that.  Thus, maybe if we start to compile some of the things we are now coming across in PoR and the Tak Ruins we can start to elliminate some of the questions in the other threads.  For instance did the Elddar have the power to make the Combine Spires?  Did they possess the power to destroy Zeb's curse? etc...&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Given the information available to us, I am 100% of the position that the "pyramids" were constructed by the Elddar - and if the lore changes, that it was the original intent for them to have constructed the pyramids themselves.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;In North Ro there area&amp;nbsp; series of ruins that have ostensibly been identified as Takish-Hiz's...if not linked directly to the main palace and odeon, the subsequent parts of the city around it, including guard towers.&amp;nbsp; They all reach relatively the same height out of the sand, and one of these ruins is inhabitted by the ghost of Queen Tak'Yaliz, the last queen of Elddar Forest.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Taking into consideration the fact that there is a pyramid buried in the center of Elven culture at the same height and style as the rest of the ruins, it seems only logical that this existed at leaste at the time of the Elddar.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Going to the other side of the mountains however, you enter Befallen, which at one time was identified as part of the ruins of Takish-Hiz by Lanys T'Vyl when she set up fort there.&amp;nbsp; Recent information has given rise to the fact that it is actually a former Elven military outpost...so saying that it is connected to Takish-Hiz would not be entirely unplausible, it would be like saying that Miramir air base is a part of San Diego.&amp;nbsp; Just outside of Befallen, of similar architecture, is the West Commons pyramid.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The only other pyramids are those in the Dreadlands, the one that doesn't work in South Karana, the one in Nektulos Forest, and the one in West Karana.&amp;nbsp; There is also one in the Temple of Cazic Thule.&amp;nbsp; It's possible the Temple was built around it.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;These Pyramids are not seen on Faydwer or Odus, and the only time they leave Antonica are when they are built in conjunction with the Combine Empire on the Dreadlands.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;What we have recently learned is that the Elddar Empire pre-dates the Rallosian Empire, as the pre-cursed Vorzek are seen in the Elddar Forest, so it is unlikely that these pyramids were used by the Rallosian Empire.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I speculate that these pyramids were a method of transportation across Tunaria at the height of the Elddar Empire.&amp;nbsp; When the Combine Empire rose, and fled to Dreadlands - recent evidence I've found suggests that the Combine Empire did, indeed, reach as far as Kunark, or at least far enough to interact with several Iksar, and leave their mark on the Dreadlands.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I theorize that the elves who were a part of the Loyalist Combine, in the hopes of creating with Grieg Venificus a powerful enough teleportation "City", built these pyramids in conjunction with the Combine Empire.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I believe that with the decline of the Elddar Empire, that these things have fallen to relative disrepair with little, to no, maintenance and now they are simply used by wizards wantonly.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;A further note on this, I went through and read the Journal of Al'Kabor.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;It says that there are Combine spires surrounding each of the pyramids.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;If you look at the Combine Spires, they are nothing like the four spires that surround the pyramids.&amp;nbsp; Al'Kabor was wrong in his examination thereof - the two show no similarities except that they both have four long protrusions.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Here's a question: what exactly is the connection between the modern Takish Hiz of the sand elves, the Takish Hiz ruins uncovered by Karana, and the pristine Takish Hiz accessable courtesy of Druzzil Ro and Tunare?  It's clear that the ruins and the pristine city are simply reflections of each other in different time periods, but where does the sand elven labyrinth fit into it?  I would have liked to have been able to see some of the areas form the LDoN's in their pre-Solusek form.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Okay, you have the ruins of Takish Hiz, right?  This is the Takish Hiz that you visit when you go back in time to the Elddar Forest.  But then, you have the Takish Hiz where the LDoN's take place.  Now, though you're supposed to be visiting the Takish Hiz of old in Elddar Forest, the areas of the city that the LDoN's consisted of aren't present.  So, if the Takish Hiz in the LDoN's wasn't around back in the Elddar's time, as the new Elddar Forest zone would seem to indicate, when was it added onto the city and who added it?</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I suspect it's there, you just don't have access to it, it's in a different section of Tunaria than Druzzil Ro has sent you to.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;If you notice, you're sent back to the palace, the palace is clearly in a different section than the observatory and so on.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;That's a good point, and it's what I was leaning toward.  It just seems odd to me that the palace of Takish Hiz is not only completely seperate from the city proper, but it is apparently unconnected and surrounded by enemies.  I guess it's entirely possible that the Rallosians have stabbed into the city so thoroughly that the various sections have been divided up, which would place this a lot closer in time to the city's actual fall than I originally thought.</description>

      <description>I haven't visited much of the Elddar forest yet so I'm not sure; but maybe the palace we are going to is the equivalent of the "Summer retreat" for the Elves, a place to go to escape some of the pressures of city life and stuff?</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Has anyone uncoverred anything on the different factions that split that allowed some to venture to what is now Felwithe, etc.. Also, I went checking on my wiz and if you cast a &amp;quot;Combine Portal Spell&amp;quot; it takes you to a pyramid like portal platform not one of the regular spires that have timers that take you to the nexus.  Are the spells then labelled incorrect?  If they are not, then wouldn't it be correct to say that the elddar were the ones that created the great spires?  Also, do not forget that there are druid rings that are used for transport and an unused set of rings as well.  I also heard someone mention lycanthropy/Innorruk worshippers from within the Elddar camp....does anyone have any info to back up that claim as well?</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;Intereting you mention Cazic thule.&amp;nbsp; Ezedriel. if you are correct about the pyramids that would raise the possibility that the eddlars. or one of their three sub races possibly could of built Cazic Thule.

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Maybe the Amygdalans built it.  If the Maps of Myrist are to be believed (I know, I know, I'm just mentioning it as an aside), it was transported from the Plane of Fear to Norrath by Cazic-Thule himself, if I remember correctly.</description>
