&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;I&gt;The EverQuest Guide Program is a program of volunteers. These volunteers dedicate their own time and energy to enrich the world of Norrath. As a "Thank you" to them, Guides of the month have and will be chosen for their exemplary contributions. &lt;/I&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;I&gt;Heralds speak of a strange occurrence outside of Blackburrow. Rumors spread of a few small gnome reporters trying to capture an image of a young Human bard standing tall before the Gnolls. The story grows as does the number of Gnolls defeated. What can be gathered as truth though is a small questionnaire being passed around about Shaighla. &lt;/I&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;H2 align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=165 src="http://eq2players.station.sony.com/images/en/guides/guide_of_the_month/EQ_GoM_0106_sm.jpg" width=200 border=0&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;FONT size=5&gt;Guide Shaighla&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;1. Why did you become a Guide? &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;I became a guide way back in 2001. The game has come such a long way. With my 20 years of RL customer service, I set out as a young guide to treat the players in the game the way I related my customers. I wanted to treat the other players with respect, dignity, empathy, and real concern. I listened to their complaints, gave them an ear and suggested ways they could help avoid situations and repair them on their own. I always believed in letting the player control their destiny. I used my god given tools to help when I could and explained with empathy when I couldn't do what they wished. I always attempted to give them advice as to other routes to get a satisfactory solution to their problem. I never forgot there was a real person behind the character.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;2. What games do you guide on? For how long? &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;I put all my efforts into Everquest 1. I have often considered going to other games, but I like to keep a balance in all I do. I'm not yet ready to give up my friends in this Norrath or the adventures I enjoy, so I am not yet ready to move on. I'm a little leery of splitting my time in two directions, but the day may come. I've been a guide twice, my time is getting close to 2 years combined.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;3. What is your guide race and class? &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;My guide is race is human and I am a bard. At heart I want to entertain the masses.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;4. What is your favorite color? &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;My favorite color is blue. It became my favorite color the first time I hailed a blue skinned Dark Elf. They were so cute with their well formed bodies. I then vowed to only wear blue and keep my hair a grey/blue shade to go with it. My love of blue is in no doubt a direct result of the illegitimate blood line. My mother's Great Grandpappy is said to be a Dark Elf himself.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;5. What is your favorite land (zone)? Why? &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;My favorite land is Qeynos Hills and the river banks of West Karana. These were my earliest hunting grounds, and where I ran in the fields of wild flowers in my youth. I'll never forget the fear of the first Giant that stood on me, the first diseased grizzly that bit me, or the first time I lost my body down a tree stump in Black Burrow. The hills and dungeons of my earliest youth will always be held the fondest in my heart.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;6. What has been your best or favorite moment as a Guide? &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;My favorite moment as a guide has to be the Harvest Event this year in which GM Deodan stepped in to play one of the actors when my partner was ill and had to leave. This was the costume event and low and behold, one of the citizens came traipsing out of the Beholder entranceway (where we sent them to get changed) dressed as GM Deodan himself and spoofed him verbally! This actor had no idea he was doing this to his namesake. I was laughing so hard I could hardly type and it was very well done. This definitely a memorable moment for me. There have been many other memorable moments, but this one does stand out.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;7. What is your favorite quest, event, or knowledge circle? What do you do the most of? &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;I have loved my time on Stormhammer with the opportunity to play in the GM events each week. These are definitely my favorite and will really miss them now that Stormhammer has ended. Second to these, I love to roam the lands and chat with people doing boring camps and threaten to hunt gnomes and offer them Genduxcis (Duck Duck, sp) sand....uhm...Gnome sandwiches. People in small groups are my favorite. It's so hard to pick a favorite!&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;8. What has been your worst of least favorite moment as being a Guide? &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;I'm a very optimistic person so picking a least or worst moment as a guide is far more difficult then a favorite. I like to learn my lesson quickly from the bad and move on to the good. My least favorite would be back in November 2002 when a serious personal matter took me away from guiding. Writing my resignation letter was my worst moment. I'm glad I could eventually come back.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;9. As a player have you every run into any Guides and events? &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;Unbelievably, I have yet to ever run into a guide event as a player during my time online. I have however, run into guides occasionally and I like to chat to them and tease them and just torment them! Well gotta have some fun.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;10. What is your favorite thing about this Game? &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;My favorite thing about the game is the definitely the people. It's wonderful to be able to sit in my office and have a social realm to play on! I've met and gone on trips with many of the people I've played with over the years, and miss my friends and guild mates when I can't play. The people keep me here, both guiding and playing.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;11. What do you plan to do in the future as a Guide? Any goals? &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;My goals as a guide mimic my goals in life. Keep a healthy balance in all I do. I guide, play and enjoy RL in a balance and I hope to continue that. As my RL is less busy I may have more time to commit to guiding and possibly could add EverQuest II as a game and guide to my enjoyment at some point this year. Part of me would like to join a training team or maybe become a Senior Guide, but I would have to give that some serious thought. I have to be certain I have enough of me available to give any role I take it's full due. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;Thank you for the honour of being a first Guide of the Month. "Shaighla bows to all and holds up her Valtron's brew in Cheers."&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
