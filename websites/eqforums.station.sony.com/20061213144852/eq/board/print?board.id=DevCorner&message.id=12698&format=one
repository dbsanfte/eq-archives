<blockquote><div>-------<br>CLASS: Monk<br>
</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>HP: Important up to a point, less important after it becomes
acceptable to take several rounds from mobs you run into (but never not
important)<br>Mana: Not important<br>Endurance: Not terribly important
past a point (I have nothing to spend end on if burning after a point -
on plows regen is the issue, not pool size)<br>AC:Important up to a
point - Once you're above the soft cap its not terribly important, the
rate of return isnt optimal for a leather class, so its a hard stat to
focus on imo.&nbsp; I'd like more, but I just don't see SoE ever
getting away from the armor archtype blinders.<br>
 </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>HP Regen: Not really important- I'm capped, but 45 regen doesnt do much against the 1k-10k hitters I run into, even in exp grps<br>Mana Regen: Not important<br>Endurance
Regen: Important to a point, it takes about 30-40minutes in an exp
group with constant use to go through an end bar, unfortunatly it takes
even longer to refill.&nbsp; We just don't have much to use end on, so
unless that changes, its only marginally useful.<br>
 </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Strength: I'm capped, its not terribly useful.&nbsp; I also have
an archiac weight penalty, what good does it do me besides a few atk
and end?<br>Stamina: Likewise capped , not useful except for some hp, some end.<br>Agility: Likewise capped, only useful for a few pitiful (very few) avoidance ac and some end.<br>Dexterity: Likewise capped, only useful for minor proc gains and some end.<br>Charisma: Likewise capped- not useful, im LONG passed the merchant cap, and likewise its only minorly beneficial on DI fires.<br>Intelligence: Not capped - only useful in tradeskills.<br>Wisdom:Capped
- only useful in tradeskills...its rather hard to come by at lower
levels, meaning melee have an inherrant tradeskill disadvantage.<br>
 </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Cold Resist: Almost capped - the resist system has its problems,
but I enjoy having 600 vs all self buffed, semi-useful on some aes
(mostly older content)<br>Disease Resist: See above<br>Poison Resist: See above<br>Magic Resist: See above<br>Fire Resist:See above<br>
 </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Attack: Useful, unfortunatly its easy to cap....not useful after that<br>Delay: I'm beginning to see rounding errors on monk weapons at low delay, I'm still gathering concrete evidence though<br>Damage: Useful duh~<br>Range:250 or so on throwing is useful, under that sorta sucks.<br>
 </div>
<div>Haste: I've been capped at 40-45% on items for about 6yrs
now.....but nice to have a decent selection available for moving gear
around (its currently on like 3 items I have- or will be soon)<br>
 </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Combat Effects: Pretty much useful only for dps procs...which don't exist in abundance anymore due to dmg augs being more dps<br>Shielding: Useful, but not my major focus - i prefer to not take hits<br>Stun
Resist: Not really useful as a monk at all, although I think i may end
up near cap just because it works out that way eventually<br>Strikethrough: Very useful, sorta hard to get, I want to be sure im at 35% if possible at all times.<br>Spell
Shield: Very useful, harder to get until DK, I aim for 35%.&nbsp;
Harder to raise due to rareness on melee gear until DK - casters in
guild are at like 50% easily - no monk serverwide has 35% I believe.<br>Avoidance: Useful, unfortunatly everyone and their brother has 100 and its on all sorts of gear.<br>Accuracy:
Very useful, unfortunatly the cap needs to be raised imo.&nbsp;
Probably on the short list of most-desired mods for any dps class. <br>DOT
Shielding:Moderatly useful, depends alot on amount of DoT AE
itemization (currently not tons in game), harder to raise, needs to be
on more melee gear. Ditto as spell shielding.<br>
 </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Skill Mods: +Block% fairly useful (and too **SMURF** rare, 1 weapon in
luclin, time tunic, anguish legs...thats it), +Dodge% not so much, the
rest are....there are no others in game for monks really =/<br>Click
Effects: More needed!&nbsp; Lots of stacking issues though - especially
more overhaste, too **SMURF** rare.&nbsp; Other clickies like monk class
items (anguish tunic, vish cloak) are rather lame imo - especially the
vish cloak, why put in a 1200dd clicky that takes away from your dps
when clicking? not a large upgrade at all....<br>Proc Effects:
Zzzzzzzzzzzzz...boring for awhile now.&nbsp; Fiery Strike V, VII,
VIIII, IX, XI, XIXIXIXVIIIIVIVIOSDUIDOMGIMSOBORED.....oh and bring back
Serpents Bite - and upgrade it...seriously a proc that is missing from
monk weapons!<br>Worn Effects: You need more +FK dmg mods, um, I can't
really think of anything else in this category.&nbsp; Too bad that 10
fk is only worth about 2-2.5dps though.<br>Focus Effects: Yaay~....look down<br>
  <br>
Improved Block = very useful, too rare on items though (IB4 is only on
2 items, my class only items, and a rare bracer from a zone not
condusive to farming), its also very rare on lower lvl items vs
say....Parry items that pop up all over.<br>
Improved Dodge = semi useful, but not nearly as much as block, decent itemization currently.<br>
Ferocity = not too useful for a monk, going from 5 to 6 added about
5dps....its a very lame focus for monsk, we need alternatives...<br>
Cleave = pretty useful, not a huge dps increase but still seeing decent gains, itemization for monk is nice.<br>
Other mods = Um, at one point or another a few other mods have appeared
on gear...unfortunatly, theyre not very useful (ie anguish tunic's
focus only adds about 2-3dps at most), melee need serious help.<br>-------</div></blockquote><br><div></div>
