      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Is there any reason why I can't talk on the sony chat boards when I log in and try to talk  in the General chat channel it says its moderated.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why not? Are you afraid we will actually see the 5 canned letters you have prepared...news flash we've all seen them already and its the major problem we have with your laughable customer service.  Doesnt matter anyway you can always continue your recently adopted method of censorship and lock or make post like these disappear and be happy in your own little world that there are no problems with the way you do business.   However your player base knows and sooner or later it all comes back to you ignoring the issues. This may make you meet your departments current business metrics but short term solutions and hiding real problems is never the answer if you want a sustainable even halfway ethical business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words addressing problems no matter how difficult they are is always better in the long run rather than waiting until they blow up in your face or you could sweep them under the rug and pretend they don't exist.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Because addressing specific customer service issues and responses is not permitted on the forums.&amp;nbsp; These forums are for talking to Devs and fellow community members.&amp;nbsp; It is not a place to seek CS assistance.&amp;nbsp; Offering your feedback about CS here does not reach CS which is why at the request of the CS manager I redirect all cs issue to email &lt;A href="mailto:eqcs@soe.sony.com" target=_blank&gt;eqcs@soe.sony.com&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past, I had never gotten a responce to e-mails. However, the most recent issue that I had I did receive a responce, and had a continuing dialog for several days over the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, don't bash on Kytherea over this. She is not in charge of CS. She is not in charge of CS. She is not in charge of CS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I said it 3 times, did you get it yet?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can whine all you want, you will not get any responce on the boards to CS issues.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Hrm, funny but I thought we were talking to community members.&amp;nbsp; It just so happens that the discussion is not something you like.&amp;nbsp; Maybe we dont want to reach CS because we realize the outsourced people SOE use cant or wont do anything and want to compare stories with fellow players.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Maybe you should just suck it up and create a CS forum for us to talk to fellow community members about how poorly we are treated.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Jareth-CTV on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;04-13-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;01:19 PM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I foresee this thread being locked due to a difference of opinion on SOE's behalf.  Before it gets locked, I would like to agree, again, that CS is dismal.  Forcing the general chat rooms into a moderated status is about the stupidest thing SOE could propose as policy.  Why can't SOE just come clean with us, admit that their CS is utter crap, and allow us to chat amongst ourselves for answers we know no one at SOE is willing to provide?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Chat amongst yourselves about general chat moderation all you wish, but do no get specific about GM Bob said this or did that or start posting reposnes from CS on the boards.&amp;nbsp; Specific instances are not permitted.&amp;nbsp; I simply gave the OP the method to offer feedback about the changes but have not said that people had to stop posting their opinions.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;And the complaining about "godwin"ing does exactly what?&amp;nbsp; How could I avoid the comparison of selective censorship to Germany?&amp;nbsp; Did I say Nazism?&amp;nbsp; Nope, I said Germany.&amp;nbsp; And if you aren't aware of censorship in pre-n.a.z.i. (EDIT:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;smurfing the word n.a.z.i. is&amp;nbsp;almost proof&amp;nbsp;to me that I've hit the nail on the head) &amp;nbsp;Germany then perhaps a quick course at your local community college.&amp;nbsp; But lets go back and edit that post to say...&amp;nbsp; McCarthyism.&amp;nbsp; Close enough.&amp;nbsp; Forced to censor something out of fear of loosing a job/life/family/being labeled a communist/whatever.&amp;nbsp; In any way shape or form censorship is bad.&amp;nbsp; Especially considering this is an American game, and one of the motivating factors in the revolution was censorship.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;As for long winded...&amp;nbsp; Well if that's what you want to call it, I don't care.&amp;nbsp; When I am debating something I do tend to get long winded to ensure I present all relevant facts.&amp;nbsp; That's what they teach you when you learn to..... debate.&amp;nbsp; But of course this is such a blanket statement it causes me to wonder if you actually looked at some of my prior posts or if you just took a shot in the dark.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Oh, and if I had lost there wouldn't be quite so many threads making the same types of arguements I've already made.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Jareth-CTV on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;04-13-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;02:44 PM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Kytherea... I was wondering if you would be able to let me know why there isn't a GM in the general chat as a matter of course any more? I used to really enjoy (and often would make a point of) logging into chat half an hour or an hour before my scheduled raid time to have a chat and meet some new people. It was also nice to be able to have a bit of banter with the GM/GM's and everyone else in the channel and was generally a nice place to hang out in. It was also nice to be able to help out fellow players who came into the channel with their wide variety of questions wether they were techie questions, in game questions or how best to roast a chicken :)&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I was not given an explanation as to why it was decided to no longer have a GM in general chat at all times.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Oh I can give you that explanation:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Some very brilliant SOE executive had the following epiphany:&amp;nbsp; "Our CS really is crap.&amp;nbsp; On our general chat channels, it's still crap, but we're paying someone to be present to provide crap.&amp;nbsp; However, if we remove that person, we still get the crap CS, but now we don't actually have to pay anyone!&amp;nbsp; Hell I get to save ONE FULL FTE, AND STILL provide THE EXACT SAME level of CS!&amp;nbsp; BRILLIANT!!!&amp;nbsp; WHERE'S THE ETHER!!?!?!&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;lt;large inhalation&amp;gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;OH MAN BETTER YET!!!!&amp;nbsp; If we turn off the ability for the customer to chat to each other in our general chat channel, they can't complain to each other about how crappy the CS is!&amp;nbsp; This &lt;EM&gt;REDUCES&lt;/EM&gt; the complaints AND saves us money!&amp;nbsp; WOOT BONUS FOR ME!!!&amp;nbsp; MORE ETHER!!!"&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by --MadHaxor-- on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;04-14-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;01:34 PM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey Kyth is it true that as long as there is a GM in the channel (IE Stuck Char room) that it is supposed to be unlocked?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Cause if thats the case its not and someone needs to look into it. Stuck Char is locked down and you can not talk freely in&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;it even when a GM is there :smileysad: . Just thought I would let you know if you didnt all ready&lt;/p&gt;</description>
