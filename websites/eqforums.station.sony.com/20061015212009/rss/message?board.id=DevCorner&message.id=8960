    <title>Broken or Unfinished *Quests* - report them here</title>
    <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=DevCorner&amp;message.id=8960</link>
    <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Ok, I'm going to start off a new thread for reporting Broken or Unfinished quests.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;For clarity, I would suggest trying to stick to&amp;nbsp;a general format as follows:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;OL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Quest name &amp;amp; details (zone, NPCs involved, items needed)&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;What's broken or unfinished &amp;amp; why do you think so?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I'll start things off, even though concerns about the quest below&amp;nbsp;are in the Tradeskills Top 10, this is the Quest forum so it's appropriate to post it here.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1. Grand Robe / Tunic of the Oracle + Phylactery&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Quest starts with Sir Artanis in North FP, but essentially you have to hand in 6 books to the Oracle's assistant Jeylar in&amp;nbsp; Ocean of Tears, which will result in the Robe or Tunic.&amp;nbsp; At the same time, the assistant gradually reveals a recipe to make a Phylactery, and hands you no-drop components along the way.&amp;nbsp; Link to a full write up: &lt;A href="http://www.gamesnet.org/KyrosKrane/Oracle/" target=_blank&gt;http://www.gamesnet.org/KyrosKrane/Oracle/&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2. What's broken or unfinished?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;a) &lt;U&gt;possibly broken:&lt;/U&gt; Ghoul of Takish Hiz.&amp;nbsp; This Ghoul can spawn in South Ro or Oasis of Marr, but is ridiculously rare in either zone, and when he does show up to add insult to injury he reportedly doesn't always drop the Spiritual Anchor needed for the Phylactery&amp;nbsp; (I lucked out but others are really frustrated.)&amp;nbsp; Please review spawn / drop rate and verify if this is working as intended.&amp;nbsp; Maybe he is stuck in zone geometry, or something.&amp;nbsp; Who knows? Consider increasing spawn rate slightly with guaranteed drop of Spiritual Anchor.&amp;nbsp; note: check with dev Maddoc, he may already be reviewing this.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;b) &lt;U&gt;unfinished&lt;/U&gt;?: Mana Crystals.&amp;nbsp; If you have been lucky enough to get the above-mentioned item and do finish the recipe and end up with your Phylactery, you ALSO receive Mana Crystals (no-drop).&amp;nbsp; There is absolutely no indication what these are for, it feels unfinished...speculation is that it is a way of making more vials of Palatable Mana (see earlier step of Phylactery recipe) (either used directly in the recipe or presented to an NPC who then hands you more no-drop Sea Foam Sugar.&amp;nbsp; Or it may be for something else altogether.&amp;nbsp; No one knows, but it seems dumb that this should be received as part of the end combine if it has no purpose whatsoever.&amp;nbsp; Please review, if they have a use, make the Assistant drop a hint or something.&amp;nbsp; If it doesn't have a use, remove it so we don't all drive ourselves crazy, we beg you!&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Thanks!&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;The Sunderock Geyser quest in SUnderrock appears broken. I completed the quest given by Anaflaax or whatever npc name is (the big drake butterfly) and did not get the screen to choose an item. I successfully completed this task on my cleric. My enchanter got the next quest "Kill Ooozes" but cannot get the first quest again. I petitioned, but all I get is "sorry" known bug..too bad for you. If I cant repeat the quest, then I can't get the reward. Not nice.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Quest Broken:&amp;nbsp; 'Sunderock Geyser' quest.&amp;nbsp; When it first was available you were given the option between 3 rewards.&amp;nbsp; Had to kill 20 of 1 type of drake and 10 of another.&amp;nbsp; Very simple.&amp;nbsp; About a week ago I completed it and went back to talk to the quest-giver Anaglass in Sunderock and was given nothing but an experience message and no reward.&amp;nbsp; Did a /bug report and petitioned it 3 times before receiving a message from a GM that it was truly, in fact, a known bug and that Developer's were diligently looking into it.&amp;nbsp; Hoping that is the case.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Was hoping to get an answer when it will be fixed.&amp;nbsp; Thanks in advance.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>Re: Quest Broken:&amp;nbsp; 'Sunderock Geyser' quest.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&amp;nbsp;I did this one with a friend before the last patch and got a&#xD;
choice of&amp;nbsp; 3, took Emerald of the Oasis. When I went back to help&#xD;
another friend with the same task he got nothing but a little XP. He&#xD;
petitioned it and was told by one GM that he would check it out,&#xD;
afterwards he was told by a 2nd GM that he was out of luck and it&#xD;
appears that XP is all you get. The second GM was somewhat&amp;nbsp; cocky&#xD;
with him. I tend to think that the original reward is what it was meant&#xD;
to be, not just XP. We are on the Stromm server, not sure if that&#xD;
matters but stated anyways.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&amp;nbsp;There is another new task that seems to be not working right,&#xD;
which is the Charm of Lore task.&amp;nbsp; I've handed in a few of the&#xD;
items, which are listed on Allakhazam,&amp;nbsp; and did not receive the&#xD;
charm. The only option given to me was XP. Similar problem to the&#xD;
Sunderock Geyser quest. I'm hesitant on taking any more TSS quests at&#xD;
the moment until this is fixed wondering if rewards will be given after&#xD;
the fact or if everyone that's done these is out of luck.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
P.S.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Pity, looks like a pretty good expansion too&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I too am doing the Wizard 1.5 Epic quest and am very unsatisfied at the results from the /petition feature on the bug in Twilight Sea. I have petitioned twice because of this bug in Twilight sea and both times got a response of " SOE already knows about this, thanks we are closing this issue" &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;Ok, the tunnel in Twilight Sea is broke.&amp;nbsp; . I got that, heck I petitioned it, I would like to have some help here. I cannot get to the side of the zone that has a ground spawned item. This is an item that would take me a whole 5 minutes to get without the slightest bit of difficulty and the bug is preventing this. Now I don't wish to have more than access to this side of the zone or the item being dropped into my inventory as it is less than trivial to acquire.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;This is not going to be a game changing feat or something that is out of line to ask. I have spent months working to get to this point, not counting the time others have spent helping me,&amp;nbsp;and now I am halted simply by a Game Designers bug, a flaw on the design side of the game. Now I have done two petitions and have been told I am 'SOL' by the SOE representatives. Does this seem fair or logic driven?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;If I could have some help or at least treated like I am a paying customer of Sony and not a child who has had his toy broken I would appreciate it. I am currently paying for three accounts and two of them have been up for over 5 years and all three have full expansions. This all means that thousands of my dollars have been spent through SOE and a bit of customer service that treated me as such would be nice. I don't mean to take this out on the reader or seem a bit angry, I am simply stating how I am feeling about this situation as a customer and trying to bring it a bit of attention.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;Thickened Jawbones from skeletal thugs&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;For the saurek claw club quests&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Claws from Saurek Shredders, Saurek Deathmaws, Saurek Claw Beast, and Firefall Saurek&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Apparently none of these items drop anymore. I know they did long ago because I saw them years ago, however having recently taken two characters from level 5 to 25 almost exclusively in Shadeweaver's I have not seen a single one of any of these items.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Not exactly a quest, but apparently broken:&amp;nbsp; At least the following MM's - Fairy MM in Nek Forest, Dain I and Dain III in IK.&amp;nbsp; These are the only MM's members of my Povar guild have attempted since TSS came out.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Common issues:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;If your monster is killed at any point the following happens:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;You respawn in the instance.&lt;BR&gt;You cannot cast.&lt;BR&gt;You cannot heal&lt;BR&gt;You cannot target a mob&lt;BR&gt;You cannot melee a mob&lt;BR&gt;You do not get aggro from a mob&lt;BR&gt;You do not get credit for task stages completed&lt;BR&gt;You cannot zone out.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;You can log off, and log back in.&amp;nbsp; You will be out of task and group, and need to be added to both.&lt;BR&gt;If no task stage has been completed in the interim, you will have credit for old stages and will get credit for new ones&lt;BR&gt;You will be able to interact with mobs and group members as normal&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;This alters some strategies in Fairy (travel as a pack) and Dain I - if kiting, zone don't die (or die after task stage complete)&lt;BR&gt;It makes some MM's very much harder, particularly Dain III where it is hard to avoid all deaths on the final pull, and threfore having some or most of the group lose credit for the win if that happens.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I have /bug reported this on Fairies and Dains, as have others in my guild.&amp;nbsp; I am posting here in hopes of elevating attention.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Seriously does anyone from SoE ever read these and if they do why cannot we get any response what so ever from you jerks?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I posted many days ago about the Shackle of Tynnonium quest being broken and have heard NOTHING. Other monks can complete this quest cause the tomb keeper didnt hand them the Pure White Tomb. I asked a GM to give me a tomb that was working and they wont so here i sit with tomb in hand and cannot loot the Sealed Journal in Nurga cause it is not spawning. Can you atleast tell me you know about this problem and are working on it or should i just take my money and go somewhere else cause this is not ok. No business can run by not answering their customers questions. You guys need to start answering my questions and **SMURF** soon or im gone. Consider this SoE's warning since no one answers emails either and your Customer service on the phone is near worthless.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;Well, I got a very helpful GM response tonight when I got home from work.&amp;nbsp; The GM said he copied my toon and tried it and it worked, but what HE did was only&amp;nbsp;/say "make totem".&amp;nbsp; I used the phrase from Allahk and it doesn't work.&amp;nbsp; I used "make totem" and it works fine.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; WHAT a difference between "make the totem" and "make totem" !&amp;nbsp; /boggles</description>

&lt;P&gt;As to the Adventure stone, Home city or Rathe Mountains&amp;nbsp;(before Trolls kicked the Frogs out of Innothule Swamp) were options to get quests started.&amp;nbsp; Once you get Dialog started and get preflag, head to any LDoN camp and answer all the questions for Stone.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I cant remember NPC in Rathe Mountains or if they are still there or not, would be an inn either near lake Rathetear or in area where Hill Giants were moved to in NE corner of zone.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;hi, &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; the frikkin shackle of tynnonium quest is bugged if you recieve a pure white tomb for your final item.&amp;nbsp; the sealed journal is not ground spawning.&amp;nbsp; fix this crap now.&amp;nbsp; i really love dumping 48 hours into a quest then having the last step bugged.&amp;nbsp; thanks and die soe.. this has been a known and reported bug for going on 2 months now.....&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;...just adding another log to the fire.&amp;nbsp; i hope everyone here sees how little soe gives a **SMURF** about how buggy their games are.&amp;nbsp; this really speaks highly of new games they are marketing such as VSoH.&amp;nbsp; run brad run, they're making you look like a fool already.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;Someone cited necklace quests for priest long long ago in this thread, I would like to see someone actually finish the barbarian shaman newbie necklace quests. I know the guy that started the quests had left the company long long ago, but cant anyone just throw something in there to finish it?</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;Broken Quest Shaman Epic 1.0&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Server Tribunal&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Zone - Erudins Crossing&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Issue: Required NPC ( female ogre shaman) Ooglyn is not spawning. This NPC is required for the epic quest progression. All walk throughs I have researched have reported a 2 hour spawn time. ( as sony will not make these NPC's untargetable )&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Having camped at the correct location for a period of 6 hours, no spawn.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Could you please have a look at this issue, I am unsure if its just a Tribunal Server issue or all.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Needless to say there are alot of budding young shaman out there who are frustrated that one of their key class specific quest seems to be in limbo...&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I checked &amp;nbsp;with a few guys in the server wide shammy channel and yeah I am not alone in this. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Appreciate some answer on this when you can, thanks&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Samples of Corruption&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;With a charmed mob in camp the zone has crashed 3 times. Clicking back on the door to get back in resets the blood count to 0. This has happened at random. Tends to happen after the charm mobs enrage wears off. Happened with 1 blood to go.... 4 to go..... and 6 to go.... So it is rather frustarteing to say the least.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Wizard 1.5 quest is broken until a dev can fix the underwater tunnel in Twilight Sea. This is currently blocked by an invisible barrier preventing movement to the north area of the zone, where a groundspawn is. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Can it be noted as a bug so that GMs can at least hand over the drop.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Being able to kill GIrplan Guardian, the SUn REvenant and the hard bits sucks when I cant finish my epic&amp;nbsp;due to a stupid groundspawn blocked by SOE bug:(&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Beastlord 2.0 - Shar Vahl - Elder Animist Muada&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;To begin, the beastlord hails&amp;nbsp;Elder Animist Muada and is given Peculiar Unshapen Piece of Wood and is sent out to gather 4 other items, Fierce Spirit Clay, the Eerie Medallions of the Grimling Colonel and Grimling General, and Scalding Blood.&amp;nbsp; When the beastlord returns with these, he is&amp;nbsp;suppsed to be&amp;nbsp;able to return to Elder Animist Muada and /say to him "I am ready to make the totem" and receive Combined Essence and Elders Totem Mold.&amp;nbsp; This allows him to perform his combines.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;As Xirtket posted on Allakhazam last month,&amp;nbsp;we're having a failure at this point.&amp;nbsp; Muada instead replies with 1.5 text about the [Helm] of the Feral.&amp;nbsp; Any beastlord at this point has completed his Helm of the Feral long ago.&amp;nbsp; I happen to have mine in the bank, so I went back and got it, and put it on and went through the text again. It didn't make a difference.&amp;nbsp; I went back through&amp;nbsp;all the dialogue as if I were at the beginning of my 2.0 and that didn't work either.&amp;nbsp; I don't want to destroy the Helm of the Feral to see if that breaks the cycle&amp;nbsp;because getting it back would be a huge pain.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I /bugged this before Serpent's Spine release and hoped that things would be fine afterwards, but no such luck.&amp;nbsp; I /petitioned yesterday and the reply was a) we don't know about this issue [now you do]; b) are you talking to the right NPC [I am]; c)&amp;nbsp;talk to other beastlords [I talked to several who had there 2.0s and they didn't have the problem when they got theirs, but it does exist now]; d) make sure you're hailing the right NPC in the proper manner [I've checked my typing&amp;nbsp;and redone it twenty times; I've started completely over about 5 times, and YES, Muada is the right NPC]; e) visit the forums on this web site&amp;nbsp;[I did a search on every page for&amp;nbsp;Muada - - no postings].&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Any assistance would be appreciated.&amp;nbsp; I've been visiting and trying this dialogue with Muada for 3 weeks since I killed the big gnoll and got the scalding blood.&lt;/P&gt;</description>
