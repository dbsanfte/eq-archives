&lt;P&gt;I'm guessing that it will most likely be killing the end bosses of that expansion knowing how Sony is.&amp;nbsp; If yer lucky, they may throw in a GM event to it.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Like how the GM's brought out the old Mayong Mistmoore model and had a little event in Mistmoore pre-Kunark release.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>There are alot of discussions on what the unlocking mechanisms will be, which is obviously unknowable until the server goes live and we start triggering them. I'm wondering, though, how we'll know what the mechanisms are even &lt;i&gt;after&lt;/i&gt; we trigger them. Will there be a server-wide message that says, for example, "Lord Nagafen has fallen! A fragment of an ancient map is found buried deep within his treasure horde," so we know that part of the unlocking mechanism has been solved? Maybe a Storybook entry along the same lines, but somewhat more developed? Or will we just keep killing mobs and doing quests until one day the boat to Kunark (or the gnome, depending) just suddenly becomes active, with no indication of why or what the steps were along the way?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm really hoping for the Storybook entry approach. Tie it all together in a storyline that fleshes out the progression so it feels like a grand in-game quest instead of just a real world tech thing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Lame, beat me to it.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I would assume there would be a server wide message each time one of the criteria is met to unlock the next expansion. But even if it is not...I'm sure there would have to be a patch to unlock and let the players log into the new place. Also...if it is done to quickly, I read somewhere in an interview with one of the Dev. that they will put a time constraint with it also. Meaning you unlock the next expansion, but too early in the dev's eyes and they say "Yay, you did it! However the content will not be unlocked for awhile. ENJOY!" He said he expects that the progression server will take approx. a year to catch up to the current servers. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;** My hope is that they see a lot of people quite around Velious/Luclin change over time and realize they should make a server that is a progression server, but stops after you unlock Velious. That was mine and my friends favorite time. Yes we played more, but off and on. EQ became very anti-social after that. If you had a high-level already and you wanted a new char... PL time (which PLing was fun..and i can't wait to do it, but it did stop a lot of low level chars grouping). Now most MMORPG's are no where near the interaction with other players as EQ was in the beginning. **&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Furthermore..speaking of unlocking. With Kunark, yes I am sure Naggy will probably be part of unlock and so on. However, what about when it comes to LDoN (even though I will probably have stopped playing by this point)? What do we have to do to unlock the next expansion after LDoN? Just log countless hours doing adventures? Or like LoY? Hmmmm....&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Oh well, I plan on stopping playing right around when Luclin hits the market. Up through Velious and a little into Luclin until it gets dumb again (before you freak out about me calling EQ dumb after Velious, realize it is just my own feeling and opinion).&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>I hope it's not just killing the "final boss" of an expansion but more like a collection quest from raid bosses and at the end of that collection quest another final epic encounter spawns that unlocks the new expansion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Example:&lt;br&gt;A rare item collector desires certain artifacts from certain creatures in the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A Globule of Sheer Terror from Cazic-Thule&lt;br&gt;A Black Banshee's Heart from Innoruuk&lt;br&gt;A Searing Dragon's Fang from Lord Nagafen&lt;br&gt;A Frozen Dragon Heartstring from Lady Vox&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bring them all back to the collector and he rewards you with an accursed map that he acquired off of a sailor that had gone mad after a voyage he made.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After receiving the map and "opening" it, the Ghost of a Great Shissar Warlord spawns and attacks you (and should you fail the encounter anyone who was in the party after spawning it will be able to hail the collector again after he respawns and spawn it again).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After defeating the Shissar you loot the map and upon identifying it, it suggests that you deliver this map to a ship's captain, then a worldwide emote sounds, "Upon the discovery of a strange map, the city of Qeynos is announcing a discovery mission to an unknown continent" and one week later, BOOM, Kunark.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>The great thing about EQ is that it has so much lore that it would be pretty easy to write a script like that and make it fit.&amp;nbsp; Hell you could use the same collector every time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;if there's a general chat, watch for a steady stream of "ikksssssssaaarr" and people ending their words with a lot of S'sssssssssssssss.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;At least that what all the people who rolled iksars were doing in shout when kunark first launched.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>No, y'all are misunderstanding me. I'm not asking how we'll know &lt;i&gt;when&lt;/i&gt; the triggers have been completed; I'm asking how we'll know &lt;i&gt;what &lt;/i&gt;those&#xD;
triggers were. For instance, let's say Nagafen, Vox and Innoruuk have&#xD;
all been killed, and Kunark still isn't open. Then some guild clears&#xD;
Fear, killing Cazic Thule himself in the process, and suddenly Kunark&#xD;
is open. Well great! I guess then we'll know that Fear was part of the&#xD;
unlocking mechanism, but were Vox and Nagafen? Was Hate? Or was the&#xD;
whole bloody thing just about clearing Fear? For that matter, could a&#xD;
dozen other things have been part of it and no one knew it? Was it&#xD;
enough to kill Inny, or did the Maestro have to die too? Were there&#xD;
non-raid components that were completed along the way by random people&#xD;
on-server? &lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
My point is that without some sort of message as each part of the&#xD;
unlocking mechanism is completed, we could end up unlocking the next&#xD;
expansion without really knowing how the heck we did it.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Boy I hope not.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;When Progression servers 2 through N launch, people will know exactly what unlocked so they will focus on that.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If we don't know what the triggers are, people can still only speculate.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I really think this server will be a success and we will see more progression servers, so I'd hate to have them ruined by knowing exactly how to do it.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

Still, that's the way it's always been for quests, progressive raid&#xD;
targets, etc., yet those have obviously been designed with success&#xD;
indicators along the way (e.g. flagging messages, intermediate quest&#xD;
items, NPC dialogue, and so on). How much less satisfying would it be&#xD;
to run around hailing and killing random mobs and NPCs until one day -&#xD;
*poof* - your Epic just appears in your inventory, with no progressive&#xD;
storyline along the way to tell you how and why you got it?&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
I suppose I'm countering, or at least modifying, my own initial concern&#xD;
here, but truthfully, the number of plausible triggers is limited, so&#xD;
it's&#xD;
inevitable that the progression mechanism will be (roughly) known in&#xD;
the community once it's been solved. Dispensing with in-game messages&#xD;
will, at best, leave it open to some minor real world speculation, at&#xD;
the cost of in-game immersion/storyline.&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
