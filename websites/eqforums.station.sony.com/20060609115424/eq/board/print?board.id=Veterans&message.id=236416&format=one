</BLOCKQUOTE><BR><BR><BR>Tis tough for it to die when the evidence says otherwise, that there that might be least a bug that does exist for instanced zones and multiple of mobs in camp. Examples would be the Highpass MM. Even when the last person in is the last to close with the mobs and engage, the untargetted mobs swarm to that person. The same with some of the MPG group trials, particularly the The Mastery of Efficiency trial. One could discount the MPG trials since they have long lockup timers upon a win, but with the MMs and their short lockout timers, it is quite noticeable. It will be even more difficult to sway others away from it, particularly those who spent alot of time in MMs such as Highpass MM on double exp weekends.<BR>

<P>I lost a Dain 3 mission by having the Dain zone in last and parking him at the general.&nbsp; When the tank died to the last named clearly out of target range, the named summoned the Dain and the giant army promptly destroyed him.&nbsp; Zoning in last to get zone aggro does exist and isn't just in instanced zones.&nbsp; It's used to control who takes the DT in PoSky for one example.</P>
