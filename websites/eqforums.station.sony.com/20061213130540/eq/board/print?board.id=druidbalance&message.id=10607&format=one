<p>A couple AAs spent on 2 wizards has the same effect and it has much less risk and management involved to complete.&nbsp; I doubt by raid leader would even endorse such a tactic and probably laugh at me for suggesting it.&nbsp; In exchange this spell is now useful in groups - because right now i only use it for powerleveling.</p><br><hr></blockquote>For some reason, this makes me visualize a DoN weather dragon dropping like a rock.&nbsp; (Var`lir? Am I spelling that right?)<br><br>It's a nice idea, but it breaks any content with a weak AE rampage.<br></div>
