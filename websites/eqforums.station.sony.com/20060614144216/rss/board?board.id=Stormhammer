      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I don't know how many of us are still actively playing but I hope some of you will come try out the new Progression Server.&amp;nbsp; I know I probably shouldn't say this cause it might violate something but several times over the last 5 days when I hit /who all GM on the beta server I saw Zaltaran's name come up.&amp;nbsp; Seeing how we haven't been doing any Agency Raids here I assume he is here working on the new server.&amp;nbsp; I know Maddoc and a few other Devs are here working but deep down I hope some of our GMs like Deodan and Lydrea might come to help out with the opening of the new server.&amp;nbsp; I am already a member of a raiding guild that will be starting here head strong.&amp;nbsp; If any Legends people are planning on coming to this new server please post here and if you are serious about staying here and having fun reliving the old days I might be able to get you guilded.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>Alright, so I had about 5 character on Stormhammer when I quit about a year and half ago.  I decided to come back, but can't seem to find those characters.  When I goto eqplayers.com, I see them listed as being on Stormhammer, but how do I move them back to their native servers?&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Hello friends and refugees.  I am working on a tribute to our good times on Stormhammer.  Unfortunately for me my hard disk did not want to leave the server either, and slagged itself shortly after logging out for the last time, taking most of my screenshots with it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How can you help?  Well, if you have screen shots from events with the Agency, or any of the last few weeks, please send them to me. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;vexx@sigalarm.com&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thank you very much!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vexx&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>King Karon Event</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Stormhammer&amp;message.id=2015#M2015</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;Since there was like 100 people in attendance and only about 9 made it to see the King in 3 hours,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;we were told to email our roleplay to the King. The Movelogs won't interfere with this being done&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;will it? And second question would be how long will this take to handle? (Because do we need to be offline&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;for this to be taken care of?) I am sure a post maybe made to explain but I figured maybe some questions could be&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;submitted before the post is made. The whole thing was a little confusing for those that didn't get to talk to the King,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;nobody knew what to expect and we really don't know now.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I took off work and played all day and waited with everyone else for hours and it was a little disapointing to&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;not get everyone through. Not that its anyones fault, time constraints and a huge amount of people attended.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But, I am just curious if we wll hear something in a few days or is it going to be weeks?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The day was extremely fun, the PVGM war was long and brutal. And the PVP section was crazy to say the least,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I think some thought they were organized ganged up on if it just so happened more than one person was on them.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Several tmes durring the fight I had 3 or more random people on me. If someone is in trouble they get taken out&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;pretty quick. I dn't even like PVP but I enjoyed it all, even getting killed by a few people at the end.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The King event was really cool, propably one of the best planned events I've seen. Too bad we were so limited on time.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Really would of like to have had my turn as a final event before leaving.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Farewell - From Ashes ..</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Stormhammer&amp;message.id=2004#M2004</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face="Comic Sans MS"&gt;&lt;p align="justify"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;After receiving a number of requests from people for an explanation as to why I (Ashes) left Stormhammer in the manner I did, I have given the matter some thought and have decided to explain my reasons to you all.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="justify"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="justify"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;Many of you will no doubt remember the GM run *event* in the Overthere a week or two ago. The event in itself was a fun one, but what happened at the end left a *lot* of people feeling angry. The GM in charge of that particular event was Deodan, and we were asked to random 2000 on a Shield of the Planar Assassin, a quite magnificent shield indeed - the highest roll would win. Well, I nearly fell off of my chair when I actually *won* the item - but, in a quite astonishing manner the GM refused to hand me my reward because someone had pointed out to him that I was not level 70. Well, fair enough, or was it? In my opinion no, because we weren’t told beforehand that one had to be level 70 in order to receive the shield. Many, many people argued on my behalf, and one person (Abyssmal) was actually removed from the zone for his protests. As soon as I was told I was not to get my reward, I simply left the zone, and sat alone in Steamfont Mountains. For well over an hour I had tell after tell after tell letting me know that everyone thought I had been treated badly.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="justify"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="justify"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;I try never to do things in the heat of the moment, so slept on the matter - and the following morning I felt so annoyed that I decided to write a protest to the GM. I mentioned in my letter that I genuinely felt that GM Deodan had not been fair, and that if the matter was not *put right* I would not attend any further events - furthermore, I would not be attending any Agency runs either. Xurdaben had asked us all to Email him of any target we would like to have a shot at - so I asked for a trip to the PoSky in the hope of perhaps getting my Necromancer 1.0 epic completed. In the Email to Deodan I asked that any trip to the PoSky on my behalf be ignored.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="justify"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="justify"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;GM Deodan did reply to me - we had a long chat about the matter, and he was rather courteous in telling me that he had made a genuine error by not announcing that one had to be level 70 to roll. Okay - well, my reply was to tell him that in *my* opinion the shield should *never* have been offered as a reward at a level 55+ event - after all, not *everyone* was level 70. Between us, we agreed that the shield should not have been set as a reward.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="justify"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="justify"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="justify"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;I don’t *want* to be level 70 - I play in the style that *I* want to - I pay my&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="justify"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;own fee and am more than entitled to farm AA points rather than level if I so wish. Heck, I stayed in the Plane of Nightmare for a whole year and made 256 AA points when I was level 56! I only levelled to 65 so that I could enter Time!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="justify"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="justify"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;Anyway, due to overwhelming requests to turn up for the events from my friends on Stormhammer, I tried to put the matter behind me and see out the last two weeks of *fun* - but I knew for sure that if any further wrongdoings were to happen then I’d leave the server.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="justify"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="justify"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;A few days ago there was another event, again, run by GM Deodan which saw us all running around looking for rare items that drop from Dragons! Three Dragons were killed, and the reward was to be the chance of rolling on an Ogre Illusion Cape - whose name escapes me at this moment in time.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="justify"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="justify"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;The event ended and I’m so sorry to say that once again the rules set by GM Deodan were extraordinarily unfair - heavily favouring those that were level 70. In fact, if I recall correctly a level 70 had no fewer than *three* chances to win one of these items, yet anyone that was under level 70 only had one chance - again, to me this is was most unfair! I made my feelings known in the raid channel, and refused to roll on anything. The event was marked on the Legends calendar as being for level 51+, so I think it only fair that *everyone* that was 51+ and had attended should be given the same *three* chances there and then. I gated away, and once again I left my PC with a feeling of wrongdoings by GM Deodan. Again I slept on the matter, and the following morning I mentioned to my good friends Scientia and Aceso that I felt that I would not be able to stay on the server attending events when there is such an obvious bias towards those that chose to level to 70.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="justify"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="justify"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;I took a few more hours at the request of my friends to reconsider, but honestly, I did not want to continue to go to the remaining events only to be left feeling upset at the end of them. When GM Lydrea came on duty I asked her to contact me and I then asked her to move Ashes away from Stormhammer. GM Lydrea was totally wonderful to me, and asked me to stay, but I had to be true to my own word - so less than five minutes later Ashes was moved to Firiona Vie and my other suite of characters, including Chinqua the Wizard, who many old-timers to Stormhammer will no doubt remember were move logged to Maelin.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="justify"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="justify"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;I had been a member of the Stormhammer community since the very first day - and had made many, many friends during my four years there. I gave Xurdaben an Amulet of Necropotance and a pre-nerf Circlet of Shadows as my gifts to you all - these items were *meant* to be rolled on at an Agency event, but so far as I’m aware these items have not been offered to you - so if you happen to read this please DO remind Xurdaben to offer these items to you all to roll on.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="justify"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="justify"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;It just remains for me to say my thank you to several people here - Firstly to GM Lydrea for being so wonderful and for looking after us all. Xurdaben and Night Wing for their efforts in seeing that we managed to gain access to Time - and conquering the all fearsome Quarm - without cheese I might add!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="justify"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="justify"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;I’d like that thank Piebelly for helping me so very often, Tharkis for all the punts, it won’t be the same with out you bud. Scientia and Vexx too, I’ll miss you both. Fanta, yes, you and I had a few serious and rather heated exchanges of words from time-to-time, but thank you *very* much for all that you gave to the Stormhammer community by way of raid-leading and the *numerous* items you freely gave away. Giantt, simply the best raid leader I’ve ever had the honour of working under. Turaar, you were fabulous too, I hope you manage to make that *perfect* Ranger one day. Lepracon, stay in touch neighbour! Kazdrina - without doubt, you *do* have the very *best* milkshakes! /wink ..&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="justify"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="justify"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;Lastly but by no means least, I’d like to thank Synthesis for allowing me to be part of the family.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="justify"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="justify"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;Farewell my friends - and thank you *so* much for the memories!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="justify"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="justify"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;Ashes, Stormhammer Necromancer - proud of *not* being level 70!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="justify"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;I haven't done&amp;nbsp;an event thread&amp;nbsp;in a while, and since this is one of my last chances to do so, here's the link: &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;A href="http://www.stormhammer.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=5396" target=_blank&gt;http://www.stormhammer.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=5396&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Deodan and Lydrea (and possibly more?) put on a great show, it was fun having so many people in attendance. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Thanks again for a great evening :)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <title>Does this seem fair to you?</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Stormhammer&amp;message.id=1982#M1982</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Durring the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://legends.everquest.station.sony.com/eventview.jsp?o=67130"&gt;&lt;font color="#ffffff"&gt;Genie in a Bottle 51+&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt; event everyone was awarded the frog illusion mask from the war.  Immediately after the event it was linked in the EQevent chat, where Fanta then asked for the GM to send her a tell. That very evening Fanta was witnessed turning into not only a Frog but a Troll (the other war illusion item) while waiting for the Hangman Event. When asked this is the GM response;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;CommentID: 9705557&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Mon Jan 23 12:10:03 2006&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;CS Agent: Greetings this is GM Lydrea&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Thank you for your petition and I am sorry for your feeling of wrong doing. Fanta did recieve a mask and a cloak but not for just asking for them or saying something in EQevent about them. They were awarded to her for past quests where she was awarded an item and the item was not given to her. If you were to ask her she will tell you exactly when and where these quests were given and why she was given them.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Thank You,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;GM Lydrea&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In a followup to this question it was also stated concerning the Quest involving Razzelda that those that would help were told ahead of time that they would recieve a spinzoflobberator.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Not only is it obvious why these specific items were given, because Fanta saw what had been given in the previous event. (I mean come on she had them the very same day) But also if the quests were past quests then as is the case with Razzelda's quest the award would have been chosen at that time. There doesn't seem to be any reason why the award would change to war items for a past quest now, when war items were not previously allowed awarded.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;(Not to mention one of the past items that was awarded Fanta that she didn't recieve very well could of been the shield from the Lonely Guardian event where it was awarded to Ashes and then it was determined he was too low to use it (even though the past precedent has always been 'they can grow into it') Fanta was incorrectly called as next in line, when someone pointed out other people had rolled higher than her.)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It is also wrong for some of the best items ever given out are to a single person with no one else given the same opportunity to win the same award. And under a veil of secrecy. (While waiting for the Hangman event Fanta turned into both a Frog and Troll and when asked about it she said the GMs must be having fun.) Why lie if not to cover up what had been done?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I realize I am probably ruining my chances at recieving anything in the last week of stormhammer, but so far it seems I have nothing to lose..I rarely get awarded anything anyway. Usually I go to events just to not roll on awards I have no way of using anyway. The favoratism is horribly obvious on this server, most people are just afraid to say anything. Certain people can go up and ask for a quest from a GM and get one and a nice award, and other people ask for one and are told 'not at this time'.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I really hate this but this kind of thing has really ruined my view of stormhammer, I was one that wanted to see it stay as a server but now I don't think so. A lot of what goes on is really a popularity contest, how much you suck up does make a difference. Everyone knows it, just not all will admit it. Everyone also knows which GMs they can get the most out of, they will pick which events to go to based on who leads it. That should tell you something.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Hikarii on &lt;span class="date_text"&gt;01-25-2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;02:51 PM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>I'm makeing this post in hopes someone at SOE will listen</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Stormhammer&amp;message.id=1980#M1980</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;I have been on Legends off and on since its release Feburary after Luclin was launched.  My first character then was Dabrix a level 55 epic human monk.  I was from Lanys and ended up running into one of Lanys's top monks while I was there, Sarthis who taught me a few things.  Since then I have been on the server about every other month.  Yes I was a Day 1 person but I have not been here full time like Phaed or Tharkis.   But on 4 different accounts and about 10 characters  I put my time and a ton of my money's worth in it since I was useing 2 accounts at the same time while I was here.  I have come here to comment on the issue of people being able to go to Firiona Vie. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I am sure no one that works for SOE will listen to this and take me seriously but I will give it a shot.  From what I have heard , and Im sure other people have too, a lot of people might be considering quitting the game all together after the server is brought down.  I myself came here only for the GM events.  Some of my charaters were  Dundada, Venicore (3 times) Tweadle, Tweedlebot, Dabrixx was here 3 times also hehe, Tilluian, and Gombaah most recently. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I never even managed to get these guys any real levels as I capped off around 55 on a few and with Gombaah 59.  With the help of a few people here I was able to complete Tweadle's Mage epic in about a week, which i think is a new record for a mage epic hehe. I also did Gombaah's shaman epic in about the same time thanks to Denon's army helping me in Fear and help from Phaed, Spriggan and Spriggin on my final battles in City of Mist. I really came here for the events.  They were the most fun I have ever had in this game being a guy that played since  pre-kunark.  I tried to make all 3 events a day and therefore my leveling suffered greatly as was evident when after I transfered off I made it to 64 in only 4 days with Gombaah being on my new server.  Down to my point.  Right now Gombaah and Tilluian are sitting on 7th Hammer because Lanys has always been my true home server even though most of the characters I grew up with EXPing  Alnaraon, Ralanon, Cuukey, Mezzah, Keadre, Gothor, Kamakuk, Dondor and many other old schoolers  have moved on I returned there to continue my fun. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The problem is both Gombaah and Tilluian were both created Firiona Vie.  Alot of their gear is from zones they are 5-10 levels away from entering from expansions I dont even have yet and some drops are raid loot because they were created on Firiona Vie and thus bought all of it in the bazzar. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I am making this post to argue for Legends characters being able to transfer to the Firiona Vie server.  In the rules it specificaly states that no character shall transfer off of the firiona vie server yet I have two on the on Seventh Hammer proudly displaying my &amp;quot;of Firiona Vie' tags.  Since I was able to move my characters off of Firiona Vie to a new server it should only be fair that players currently on Stormhammer should have the option to move a single character per account to Firiona Vie if they choose to do so.  We have been loyal to Stormhammer and the higher ups have taken this great server away from us and pretty much taken a huge dump on our heads.   Both the players and our great GM staff. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I only want the equal chance that people should be able to move to Firiona Vie as I had the chance to move to another server instead of going back to Firiona Vie.  That would be the only action that would be fair.  If they allowed me off of Firiona Vie breaking their own rules then people here should have the chance to be able to transfer there if they choose to do so.  I  am not here to start trouble as I have the upmost respect for Lydrea, Anahadu, and Deodan , but I feel people should have the option of going to Firiona if they choose as I had the same option of not going back to Firiona Vie.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Thanks,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Thomas Ruffin&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;So far from all the tells ive recieved nobody that has moved has kept there Vet AAs ,Does anyone have some solid info ?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;How many will not bother to play after legends ? I myself dont know if i can bring myself to grind and to scripts that never change we know exactly what every mob is gonna cast ,what its gonna hit for and when nowdays.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;Now unless yer in a guild thats on the hub of a new content will things be new at all and be honest the average legends player nowdays has no hope of getting in these kind of guilds.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;So ill stick this last month out and maybe try a normal server for a billing cycle then theres a darn good chance pie will put his lolli away and fade away from EQ forever.....&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <title>Closed Legends Account Surprise / Lessons Learned</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Stormhammer&amp;message.id=1959#M1959</link>
      <description>Tuesday I went to log into Everquest, and much to my surprise I found that my account status was "Closed".  This was not a problem with the credit card, as they don't refuse charges like that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What had happened is that the end of the billing cycle had arrived, and because they were no longer charging the Legends fee, they insted closed the account.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What you have to do to resolve this (many thanks to Naladini!) is go to the account page and re-sign up including your credit card information.  The Legends option won't be available, but just sign up for the regular service or whatever options you want.  You can still log onto stormhammer, and all of your characters are still there (at least mine were).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So as your billing dates hit, you may find that your account will "auto-close" much to your surprise.  Even better, you will find there is no way to post to this very board to ask for help, because your station login is GONE!  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And, if you are very lucky it can happen when SOE support is gone for the week, and you can be left stumped unless someone kind helps you out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vexx</description>
