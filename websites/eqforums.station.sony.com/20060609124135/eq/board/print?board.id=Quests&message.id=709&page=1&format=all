				<DIV>A very simple way to curb this problem is to apply some task masters that give varying quests, difficulties and faction hits that are pro-RoS. Apply some RoS agents throughout the Faydarks and Venril Sathir domains. Offering a variety of quests that are difficult and give large rewards to smaller hits. Design them with varying degrees of faction reward and time, bt basically have the faction be able to go from dubious to ally in about a 3-4 hour play session via tasks and allow these tasks to be groupible.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Have&nbsp; assassination missions availible:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>1. Bringing the head of Kazon Stormhammer and his guards-yield 1 faction level to equal about </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>2. Slaying and bring the heads of some of the nobles in HHK to yield about half a faction level.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>3. Heads of several Antonican Bard guild leaders for about 900 hits/instant ally.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>4. Wiping out the remaining Agents of Mistmoore in LFay.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Exploration missions:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>1. Kill x vampires, get some flesh samples and turn back in for faction.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>2. Mission that has you exploring the castle and then returning back for reconiscence and then get a faction reward.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>3. Gain reconiscence about the&nbsp; bard guilds and their extent of power in all cities. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>4. Discovering what happened to the remaining Agents of Mistmoore.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Raid Tasks that you can do for a large faction hit:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>1. Completing the Hindin event and finding the ancient artifact that a RoS agent is also intersting in finding. Get a large faction hit for this.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>2. Complete the bard event in the castle, and get a large faction hit after discovering the extent of the power the leaders have in the castle. </DIV>
