      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I know I haven't posted in awhile, but this is something that is really bugging me and I had to vent.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I'm not sure how many of you are aware of Coke's promotion that is going on right now, called My Coke Rewards.&amp;nbsp; Basically you save up bottle caps and flaps from 12-packs, they have codes on them, you enter the codes, save up points, and buy stuff with the points.&amp;nbsp; Sounds pretty good right?&amp;nbsp; Well,&amp;nbsp;I've noticed&amp;nbsp;something about this promotion that is total BS.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;According to their rules, you may only enter 10 codes per day.&amp;nbsp; A 20 ounce bottle = 3 points, a 12 pack = 10 points.&amp;nbsp; So the most amount of points you can accrue in 1 day is 100.&amp;nbsp; Am I right so far?&amp;nbsp; Ok I'll continue.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;They offer all kinds of prizes, ranging from bottles of Coke, to music downloads, to magazine subscriptions, even trips to various places.&amp;nbsp; The most expensive item they offer is the red couch from American Idol.&amp;nbsp; Now here is the bogus part.&amp;nbsp; The couch costs 56,000 points.&amp;nbsp; Therefore you'd have to&amp;nbsp;accrue 100&amp;nbsp;points per day for 560 days.&amp;nbsp; I'm still correct, right?&amp;nbsp; Okay here's the punchline.&amp;nbsp; The contest runs from February 27, 2006, to January 15, 2007, but you can only enter codes until December 31, 2006.&amp;nbsp; That's only 10 months.&amp;nbsp; Around 300 days.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Therefore, it's physically impossible to win several of the large prizes in that promotion.&amp;nbsp; How can they even&amp;nbsp;justify offering&amp;nbsp;them as&amp;nbsp;prizes?????&amp;nbsp; Isn't that illegal or something, false advertising?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I could continue on with how incredibly tedious it is to enter the codes, how terribly the codes are printed on the boxes and under the caps, how they mysteriously erased my points from the first day I entered the promotion, how they expect you to save up EACH AND EVERY CAP AND CARDBOARD FLAP WITH A CODE ON IT until 90 days AFTER you've received a prize or they can yank it back from you... I could go on and on.&amp;nbsp; But I'll save my breath.&amp;nbsp; Let's just say, I won't be saving those caps anymore.&amp;nbsp; Thanks, but no thanks Coke.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;That's it.&amp;nbsp; Thanks for letting me vent.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Doenut on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;06-12-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;09:45 PM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Just a warning from a former regular Coke drinker.&amp;nbsp; I would seriously look at getting yourself used to Diet Coke 'cause drinking that much Coke is setting yourself up for diabetes.&amp;nbsp; I used to drink as much regular Coke as you do (and still do but in Diet Coke).&amp;nbsp; Now, I have to check my blood sugar twice a day, take medicine and watch my diet.&amp;nbsp; It really sucks, so if you can head it off by cutting back on sugar, do it.</description>

      <description>Not to mention too much cola cna decalcify your teeth and stuff. At least that's what my dentist told me. I've been cutting back on cola's and pops in general a lot lately (usually do in the summers) switching to juices and chocomilk mainly, and water.</description>

      <description>Is there a way multiple accounts can combine to buy a prize? Or is the 10 per day a hard limit, or just something they say?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just for kicks, you might want to contact them and point out the impossibility; don't threaten or anything just ask for clarification, outlining what you did there. Maybe there's another item you can buy that has more points or something. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I wouldn't stress too much about the "Keep all the hard copies of the points" clause; that's clearly just a butt-covering for their lawyers I suspect.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Yah, are you sure there aren't consumer based ways to win or accumulate larger point values?&amp;nbsp; Like entering a code cap for a chance to win&amp;nbsp;a large amount of points?&amp;nbsp; These types of tactics are great for companies.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;By leaving the accumulation of points to a random person, they run the chance of having that person never actually taking the time to do it.&amp;nbsp; Thus, they possibility of winning is there, but they leave it up to the consumer to take all the necessary actions.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Kind of like rebates.&amp;nbsp; It took me like 20 minutes to fill out all the paperwork so I could get a $15 dollar rebate on a pair of walkie-talkies... I am 100% convinced that there are plenty of people that bought that item with the perception of a rebated price that either gave up, couldn't be bothered, or simply forgot to claim their rebate check (that of course has an expiration date)....&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;... the promise of a chance of winning something only has to be backed with the actual possibility of winning something... it doesn't necessarily mean you have any "good" chance.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>Yeah that's the point of those "Mail In Rebates"; the fact that many people don't bother to send them in and stuff makes it profitable for the companies involved, even if the rebated price is a loss for the product.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ie Company makes a Gadget for 100$, sells it for 125$ and offers a 50$ mail in rebate. Technically, they are selling it for a 25$ loss, but as long as less than 50% of the people who buy it turn in the rebate, they will still make money. And experience has shown that betting that less than X% of the consumers will send in the rebate is a safe bet. (Sounds shady in some ways, but it's a good opportunity for us. Since most aren't turned in, the Companies feel freeer to offer bigger rebates, and for those who turn it in, they get a steal basically. )&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Back to the coke points though, there has to be some loophole somewhere to give SOMEONE a chance to get enough points. IIRC, isn't it against hte law to offer prizes that can't be won or something like that?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(And Pepsi has done contests like this as well, usually every summer. Don't know if they had 'unbuyable' prizes though)</description>

&lt;P&gt;One person bought up 7 million Pepsi points to&amp;nbsp;win the commercial-endorsed fighter jet from Pepsi.&amp;nbsp; He filed a bunch of lawsuits, but it was dismissed when the courts decided that&amp;nbsp;the idea&amp;nbsp;behind winning the jet in the commercial was an obvious joke, and that a disclaimer was unnecessary.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;If you're really interested in bringing this out... make abso-positively sure that the item is unwinnable in ANY possible way.&amp;nbsp; All they need is to prove they made&amp;nbsp;a SINGLE cap-code&amp;nbsp;that gives you say a million points to prove that&amp;nbsp;any item is indeed winnable.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>Not sure but by the tone of the OP, I suspect it's academic curiousity... unless the OP *REALLY* wants an American Idol couch.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I did notice that after the first few commercial runnings, the Pepsi commercial with the Jet did add the disclaimer anyways, to cover their butt. (Much like RedBull has added the disclaimer on their commercials). I guess there is a certain degree of realisticness when it comes to these types of contests. Advertising that you can "Win the Brooklyn Bridge" would be unrealistic. But advertising you could "Win(/buy) the American Idol couch" does seem realistic. Just curious about HOW you could 'buy' it now.</description>

&lt;P&gt;Most order forms allow you to purchase any un-earned points necessary from the company.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Pepsi's was 10 cents per point, which allowed for the attempt of a multi-billion dollar plane&amp;nbsp;purchase attempt for the bargain price of&amp;nbsp;only $700 million.&lt;/P&gt;</description>
