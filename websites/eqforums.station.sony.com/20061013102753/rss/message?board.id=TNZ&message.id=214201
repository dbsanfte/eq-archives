    <description>&lt;DIV&gt;We'll be scaling the experience rewards for monster missions so that the tougher ones give better rewards than the easier ones, but the missions already give less experience than you could get playing your normal character&amp;nbsp;elsewhere.&amp;nbsp; The amount of experience you gain is based off doing an LDoN adventure at your level, but toned down a bit as compensation for the lack of risk involved (although that can be argued since risk boils down to time in the end and spending too long to finish a MM is a risk in itself).&amp;nbsp; The biggest difference is that with a MM you get it all in one lump sum when you change back to your main character which makes it feel like a lot more experience.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;One thing I would like to do is implement an economy for missions such that the amount of experience (or points for LDoN and DoN style missions) scales based on how often the missions are being completed.&amp;nbsp; That way it encourages people to try different missions instead of doing the same one over and over.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;While leveling up my wizard alt in Monster missions last night, I noticed a problem.&amp;nbsp; At levels 38-39 I was getting about 30% of a level per mission completed.&amp;nbsp; After I dinged 40 however, this dropped to 15%.&amp;nbsp; When I finally got to 41 (and still true at 42) I was back to 30% again.&amp;nbsp; I seem to recall that the way hell levels were removed was by adding a multiplier to your xp gained at those levels, it seems that this multiplier is not being applied to monster mission experience.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;AA = Alternate Ability. At level 51, a character has the ability to devert part or all of their experience they receive to a different experience table then their character level experience table. Doing this will result in the character receiving what is called AA points which they can use to "purchase" alternate abilities for the character. Examples of such AAs are Combat Fury (grants critical hits with all melee attacks) and Spell Casting Fury (grants critical hits with spell casting attacks).&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;BTW if you see MM abberviation as stated some places in this thread, it is the abberviation for Monster Missions. These are special missions granted by&amp;nbsp;special NPCs in the game where your character is altered (temparorily) to some other race and class to complete a specific mission assigned to you. (Or it could be the abberviation for the zone of Mistmoore&amp;nbsp;:smileyhappy:&amp;nbsp; then it also could be a kind of popular candy made in the US.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;:smileytongue: )&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;On the&amp;nbsp;other topic being&amp;nbsp;discussed,&amp;nbsp;it does not supprise me that we&amp;nbsp;can see the hell levels with&amp;nbsp;MMs. To my knowledge, the way that the hell levels were defeated was by granting a character in that level extra experience with each kill that would sum up to the total experience needed for the level. For example, if the level required you to gain 2 times as much experience in the level to make the next one, you gained 2x the amount of normal experience on a per kill basis. The amount of XP needed for each level for any character was not altered, it was only that during that level, you gained a bonus per kill.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;This meant that any experience received that was not achieved through the normal killing experience mechanism was exempt from this change. For example, quest completion was not altered in this way. If you made your experience for a level by completing only quests, you would require approxatemly 2x the number of quest completions to achieve a hell level.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Same is true with the MMs. The reason being that your&amp;nbsp;character is being granted a flat amount of experience based on your level and a difficulty factor assigned to the mission. You are not achieving it via the kill NPCs mechanism and therefore not getting the kill bonus that occurs that one of the hell levels. This can be seen when a mission is repeated several times with different number of actual kills in the missions. They still produce the same amount of experience for the mission so long as your level stays the same.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;It should also be noted that MMs do not counter the hybrid experience penalty as well for much the same reason. The old hybrid experience penalty was defeated by granting hybrid classes an experience bonus on a per kill basis. Since this bonus is not being added to the flat rate of the MM experience, the hybrid classes are also experiencing their old penalties.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Finally, it should be noted that the experience table is what is called and expenitial graph. Basically, it is (level-1) to the 3rd power. As with all expenitial equations, the "slop" at any given point is always increasing. If you travel along the graph, it will alway be getting a little "harder" and "harder" with each subsequent level. This results in the preception of the player that things do not "feel" right when they are working on the next level. At least with the character level experience table, this is true. AA experience table does not have this problem since it is a consent. The same amount of experienced to make your 1st AA is the same amount of experience needed to make your 1000th AA. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The reason I being this up is because many people say that when the make level 50 (or some other level number), they say that things have become extremely difficult to make level so something must be wrong. But nothing is wrong in that level, it is just that they are starting to notice the expentitial factor of the equation. Remember at the very low levels of 1, 2, 3, 4, etc., you leveled really fast and at level 20, you are not leveling as fast as you did at 1.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

There's so much you'll need to catch up on, it's hard to know where to start.  AA = Alternate Advancment.  They've been around since Shadows of Luclin, and we've gone through Planes of Power, Gates of Discord, Omens of War, Dragons of Norrath and Depths of Darkhollow, at least, since then.  These are abilities you earn by redirecting some of your incoming experience to a separate AA pool.  You don't need to worry about them until you're over 50.&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Neebat on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;11-17-2005&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;09:19 AM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;sony says hell levels were removed but my 55 monk dont agree he's on 19 hours + and has gained 2 yellow bubs of exp!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;That would include the 5 hours last night in POV chain pulling avg grp lvl of 59, &amp;nbsp;4 hours in GoD zones full group.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;No credit going to AA'S all normal exp.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;No death's in those 19 hours&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Its amazing how people can forget these things.&amp;nbsp; The original hell levels were indeed 30,35,40,45, and 50.&amp;nbsp; These are the levels where the experience multiplier was increased.&amp;nbsp; With Kunark when levels 51-60 were added the multiplier was increased every level, but there were&amp;nbsp;3 levels where it increased by a larger amount, level 51, level 54 and level 59.&amp;nbsp; This where the confusion probably comes from, as the post 50 hell levels were indeed 1 below the multiples of 5.&amp;nbsp; 55 was indeed never a hell level.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;(The old numbers)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Level 29:2437xp&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Level 30:5311xp&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Level 31:3070xp&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Level 34:3703xp&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Level 35:8215xp&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Level 36:4537xp&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Level 39:5336xp&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Level 40:12017xp&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Level 41:6397xp&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;etc.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Those are the old numbers, which haven't been valid since 2002 (but a google search can still bring them up pretty fast).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Further leveling of my wizard in monster missions yesterday did show expected experience returns from 42-44, and again double experience required in 45.&amp;nbsp; Testing on a second character showed similiar results for level 30 compared to level 29.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>I miss hell levels.  Sure, it was hell, but if you were leveling fast, it gave you a chance to catch up on skill-ups, and when you finally pushed through it, watching experience flow in was a reward in itself.  Sure, if you died you lost more yellow, but the actual exp. lost was the same as before.  It just looked like more because it takes less exp. to fill up your bar.</description>

      <description>Well, I'll trust you, since SoE never bothered to tell me what the exact formulas were.  However, when I died in hell or post-hell levels, it took me about the same time to re-gain the experience.  Trust me, I play an enchanter, and have done a LOT of research on what happens when you die. ;)  Actually that's only half-true ... my group knew the stuff a chanter had to endure, and did a good job at keeping me alive.  I was just not afraid enough of dying.</description>

      <description>The numbers were gathered on the old gameplay boards.&lt;br&gt;Allegedly by using ShowEQ, since, as you note, Sony would not tell us.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, after these numbers (and also the very graphic in my post a bit above) had been circulating on the boards a while, Sony finally admitted that their math "may be a bit off" and actually look at it, found hell levels to be existent and finally corrected them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course we had been treated to weeks of "you are seeing things, there are no hell levels, just shut up, willya?" before that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just one of the many occasions over the years where player were able to prove that some people at Sony should do their job (like, doing basic math, or checking facts) before coming to the boards and accuse the players as liars for several weeks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, things definitely have improved.&lt;br&gt;We still have Sony people coming to here claiming that "but on test it is working fine, so it must work fine on production", when in fact, it doesn't (like the Helloween tasks). But at least the response time and the correction is much faster now :)&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Dodger_APPA on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;11-13-2005&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;02:45 PM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Okay - well I've throroughly read this post, reviewed the graph, tried to click on the spreadsheet... and all I can tell you is that my personal experience at turning 51 has been a shock.&amp;nbsp; I feel like I was an innocent little lamb that was fed sweet grass and alfalfae and now somebody has just kicked me to the curb and told me to go eat grass in the desert!&amp;nbsp; I don't have the math equations and I don't have a graph, but something truly has happened at 51 that has made the days of&amp;nbsp;a few little gold ticks (2% of a level) per a dark blue conned mob seem like it doesn't exist anymore. I'm getting like 5% of a 1% experience (what the heck does that make it per mob - .0005?).&amp;nbsp; I don't have the percentages on my&amp;nbsp;exp or&amp;nbsp;AA bars but I can tell you that when I kill a dark blue mob solo with all points going to exp only, I receive one little tinyblue tick (actually a tiny bit under that).&amp;nbsp; I've never seen that before.

So 35 was a hell level when it was harder than 36.  As bad as 51 is, it's not as bad as 52.  Even 54 which seems so difficult takes less experience than 55.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is still one hell level left, and that's 59.  In the run from "Ding 59!" to "Ding 61!", the mid-point is slightly over halfway through 59.</description>

      <description>I did the math and either that equation is wrong, or the graph is mislabeled, or I am missing something.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If it’s true that the equation for the amount of experience one must get in level X in order to advance to level X + 1 is given by&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;EXP Total in Level X = (X - 1) * (X - 1) * (X - 1) * ExpConstant * RaceClassConstant&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;then, at no level does the experience required to advance ever decrease from the previous level.  Let’s look at some numbers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;EXP Total in Level 28 = 27*27*27*10*RaceClassConstant = 196,830 * RaceClassConstant&lt;br&gt; EXP Total in Level 29 = 28*28*28*10*RaceClassConstant = 219,520 * RaceClassConstant&lt;br&gt;EXP Total in Level 30 = 29*29*29*11*RaceClassConstant = 268,279 * RaceClassConstant&lt;br&gt; EXP Total in Level 31 = 30*30*30*11*RaceClassConstant = 297,000 * RaceClassConstant&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Regardless of what the particular RaceClassConstant is, the amount of experience required in any level always increases.  So, when that graph is labeled “experience need to reach the next level” I cannot see from the above equation how any level could require less experience than the previous level.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you are talking about percentage increases from the previous level, I can see a point, &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;% incr in EXP in level 29 v. 28 = (219,520 – 196,830)/196,830 = 11.5%&lt;br&gt;% incr in EXP in level 30 v. 29 = (268,279 – 219,520)/219,520 = 22.2%&lt;br&gt;% incr in EXP in level 31 v. 30 = (297,000 – 268,279)/268,279 = 10.7%&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;the percentage increase in EXP required for a level rises dramatically in a so-called “hell” level and does decrease in the level following the hell level.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But why judge the difficulty of a level based on its comparative difficulty to the last level?  Level 31 is just as hard (harder, in fact) as 30 in terms of experience required to finish the level.  Is it that once you’ve completed a hell level you’re “used to it” and it feels normal to you?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can't one make the analogy to a runner who runs 8K, 9K, 10K, 11K for four days, and then the next day must run 16K, then 17K, then 18K…?  Surely the 16K is a hell run.  But does the 17K seem any easier because the jump from 16 to 17 is much smaller than the jump from 11 to 16?  It wouldn't seem so to me.</description>

      <description>Ahhh!  Thank you!  I knew something was amiss.  I'll go back to my spreadsheets.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks for the explanation.

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;This is just my guess.&amp;nbsp; I think that there are multiple modifiers on XP, some of which are level and zone specific.&amp;nbsp; When you are fighting in a hot zone especially, it is common&amp;nbsp;to see a dramatic drop in XP per mob at certain levels.&amp;nbsp; For me, the upper 40's were blazingly fast in Scarlet Desert, with a slightly noticable drop per level.&amp;nbsp; Then I hit 51 and XP literally, and shockingly, cut in half from the previous level.&amp;nbsp; (So much for blazing through my first 12 AAs like I had planned.)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;As far as I can tell, the ZEM simply cuts off at a certain character level.&amp;nbsp; Otherwise you would continue to get decent (or "full") XP fighting LBs in a hot zone, which is a poor risk:reward ratio, and is therefore cut off by the Devs.&amp;nbsp; And rightly so, in my opinion.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Any other opinions out there?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Or Devs who would care to clarify this one for us?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Thanks&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
