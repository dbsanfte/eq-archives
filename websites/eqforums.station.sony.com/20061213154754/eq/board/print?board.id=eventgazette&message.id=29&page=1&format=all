<P><FONT color=#ffffff size=5>Senior Guide Greang</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ffffff>Wow! Talk about a curve ball. I didn't even expect this, lol. I am truly surprised, and happy <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ffffff>&nbsp;</FONT><B><FONT color=#ffffff>1. Why did you become a Guide?</FONT></B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT color=#ffffff>I became a Guide because of my first experience with one, back in 2002. The Guide was extremely helpful and encouraged me to look into becoming one, and I have to say that green name and flashy sword was cool. So, I filled out the application and have never regretted it.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT color=#ffffff>&nbsp;</FONT><B><FONT color=#ffffff>2. What games do you guide on? For how long?</FONT></B><FONT color=#ffffff>&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT color=#ffffff>I currently Guide on EQ-PC, on the Povar server. I joined the program in 2002. I also guided in the EQ-II Guide Program for a bit, but I had to resign due to time constraints - though, I must say, it was a ton of fun!</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B><FONT color=#ffffff>3. What is your guide race and class?</FONT></B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT color=#ffffff>I am an Iksar Monk, but I am known for liking to go around in Dark Elf skin from time to time <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-wink.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B><FONT color=#ffffff>4. What is your favorite color? </FONT></B><FONT color=#ffffff>&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT color=#ffffff>My favorite color would have to be...blue. Its nice. Its soothing. And its just plain cool! <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-wink.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B><FONT color=#ffffff>5. What is your favorite land (zone)? Why?</FONT></B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT color=#ffffff>My favorite zone - thats a tough one. I have to say Dreadlands. It is very big, with a lot of mountains and snowstorms, and then those huge spires which are always fun to sit atop, or jump off of.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B><FONT color=#ffffff>6. What has been your best or favorite moment as a Guide?</FONT></B><FONT color=#ffffff>&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT color=#ffffff>My favorite time as a Guide was when I was on Stormhammer. Being able to interact and do events with CSRs was exciting. My favorite moment, though, is when I was promoted to Senior Guide. I had that as my goal for a while and I was happy that I was able to accomplish that <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B><FONT color=#ffffff>7. What is your favorite quest, event, or knowledge circle? What do you do the most of?</FONT></B><FONT color=#ffffff>&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT color=#ffffff>My favorite quest is Neon Lights - The quest with a little Gnome going around asking for people to help him get ingredients for fireworks, and then he is able to give away fireworks once completed. It really gets things lit up. I participate in events most often though. Povar tries to do at least one event a week, and the players seem to really like that. </FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B><FONT color=#ffffff>8. What has been your worst of least favorite moment as being a Guide?</FONT></B><FONT color=#ffffff>&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT color=#ffffff>My least favorite moment as a Guide is when my schedule in real life would force me to take a leave of absence.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B><FONT color=#ffffff>9. As a player have you every run into any Guides and events?</FONT></B><FONT color=#ffffff>&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT color=#ffffff>Yes. In fact, I won one of them on my at-the-time level 43 Necro - a PVP event for mid-range level players.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B><FONT color=#ffffff>10. What is your favorite thing about this Game?</FONT></B><FONT color=#ffffff>&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT color=#ffffff>My favorite thing about EQ is the community it generates, and the amount of fun you can have by simply roleplaying. Better yet, it seems that whenever I'm on my avatar roleplaying, every player gets into it and makes it fun.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B><FONT color=#ffffff>11. What do you plan to do in the future as a Guide? Any goals?</FONT></B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT color=#ffffff>My sole goal in the Guide Program is to put in whatever I can in order to help it succeed. I've already achieved one of my goals, which was to become a Senior, and as such I have been given the opportunity to administer a server's Guide team. Perhaps one day I will be able to help even further by administering one of the teams the Guide Program has, or maybe even be a part of the Elder Guide team - but, more important than rank, my main goal remains constant, which is to put in as much time as I can in order to help the Program progress and help players have a great time. <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
