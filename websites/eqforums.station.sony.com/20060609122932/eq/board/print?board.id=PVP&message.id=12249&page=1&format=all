				<DIV>
<DIV>I did a little research into how spell resists work PvP, and I found some interesting things.&nbsp; How hard a spell is to resist doesn't seem to be based on the level of the spell, at all.&nbsp; In short, I think that's wrong.&nbsp; My level 70 ancient spells that required a lot of work to get should be **SMURF** tough to resist, and they need to be if I'm going to have much shot at killing melee characters simiarly leveled and geared to me.&nbsp; Here's why:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I have about a 10K mana pool on my level 70 necro with nearly 1100 aa and gear that is 275-300 mana/hp per piece.&nbsp; I have a level 70 War alt with gear that isn't quite as good, and not nearly as many aa (about 200).&nbsp; He's 11K HP unbuffed, and 13.8 or so with typical cleric and shammy buffs.&nbsp; If his resists were as high as mine (around 500) I don't think I could kill him even if he just stood there.&nbsp; The reason is spell casting efficiency.&nbsp; To kill him, even with just walking around buffs, I'd need to do at least 1.4 HP of damage for every 1 unit of mana that it cost me to cast a spell.&nbsp; In the limited testing that I've done, I can barely muster that against my War alt even with resists of only around 300 or so.&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>My most reliable spell against players is my level 70 ancient tap.&nbsp; At full eficiency, it does about 2.2 HP of damage for every point of mana that it costs (1300HP for 598 mana).&nbsp; Against a player at my level though, it is never going to hit for full pop.&nbsp; It doesn't even hit for full pop against my War alt.&nbsp; It's true that it will crit sometimes, but even the crits are for the base damage of the spell, or less.&nbsp; Against my War alt, it lands for an average of&nbsp;780 points of damage tested over 50 trials, and again, his resists are only around 300, so he did not resist the spell often.&nbsp; That's an efficiency of 1.30.&nbsp; In other words, <STRONG>I would be unlikely to kill him with this spell before I ran out of mana even if he just stood there </STRONG>and he is not comparable to my Necro.&nbsp; Throw a heal pot&nbsp;into the equation, and he is literally unkillable.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Some of my other spells (especially dots) are more mana efficient than my big tap, but they are unlikely to land against a player with resists equal to mine.&nbsp; Because of that,&nbsp;their&nbsp;practical efficiency is probably less than the tap (I'll do more testing and report the result here).&nbsp; Here's why:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>There are three parameters that SOE uses to determine whether a spell will be resisted PVP.&nbsp; pvpresistbase, pvpresistcap, and pvpresistcalc.&nbsp; These are completely independant of the resist checks that you are used to seeing.&nbsp; Those only relate to whether a mob can resist the spell.&nbsp; I'm not privvy to how these interact to determine whether a spell lands against a player or not, but I can tell you from testing that big negative numbers in the resist base and resistcap make a spell more likely to land.&nbsp; Small negative numbers, or positive numbers probably means that the spell will land seldom, if at all, against a well geared player.&nbsp; pvpresistcalc looks to be related to the level of the spell (65 and up spells seem to have a 136 calc).&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Here are the numbers for some of my best spells:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Ancient Touch of Orshiak (usually lands)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pvpresistbase: -300 pvpresistcap: -400 pvpresistcalc: 136</DIV>
<DIV>Fang of Death (usually&nbsp;lands)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pvpresistbase: -300 pvpresistcap: -400 pvpresistcalc: 136</DIV>
<DIV>Blood of Thule (sometimes land if debuff)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pvpresistbase: -137 pvpresistcap: -194 pvpresistcalc: 136</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Chaos Venom (never lands)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pvpresistbase: -42&nbsp;&nbsp; pvpresistcap: -159 pvpresistcalc: 136</DIV>
<DIV>Pyre of Mori (never lands)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pvpresistbase: -42&nbsp;&nbsp; pvpresistcap: -159 pvpresistcalc: 136</DIV>
<DIV>Descecrating Darkness (never lands)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pvpresistbase: -42&nbsp;&nbsp; pvpresistcap: -159 pvpresistcalc: 136</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Of these, Blood of Thule is the only dot that has much of a shot at landing, and it's a 65 spell.&nbsp; As has been reported here, spells like Splurt and Pyrocuror do land, but they would not even approach the mana efficiency needed to kill a 13K + player (who will usually hit&nbsp;a heal pot for&nbsp;a few K more)&nbsp;even with a 10K mana pool.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>There is no rhyme or reason to these right now.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorry, but a&nbsp;65 spell shouldn't be harder to resist than the 70 spell in the same line.&nbsp; 70 Ancient spells that are **SMURF** hard to get because they drop from raid mobs and are no-drop should be **SMURF** hard to resist, no?&nbsp; We (casters) should get better weapons for doing the hard stuff, just like the melees.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>If anyone out there has a 'toon with 500ish resists and 13K or more HP&nbsp;and wouldn't mind helping me do a little testing, I'd love to update this with more results to give Pinhead a some more ammo to take to SOE.</DIV>
