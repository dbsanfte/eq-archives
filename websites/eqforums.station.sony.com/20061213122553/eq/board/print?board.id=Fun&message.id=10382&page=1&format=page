				<DIV></DIV>That would be tonight. I was handing out candy and in-between I was playing EQ. A kid comes to the door pokes his head in and says "Sweet You are playing EQ! (he could not have been more then 6 years old" I was like yeah, I play Everquest and he went got his dad because apparently he plays also lol. Only other EQ player I have met that lives in my town. Was neat.

				Trick or treating one year in northern Canada, it was so cold that many of the plastic costumes<br>
and masks were cracking or shattering from the cold.<br>
After a few houses where we feebly tried holding bits of broken masks in front of our faces<br>
to disguise ourselves, we gave up and wrapped our scarves around around our heads<br>
claiming we were colourful mummies.<br>
<br>
Labrador circa 1969.<br>
