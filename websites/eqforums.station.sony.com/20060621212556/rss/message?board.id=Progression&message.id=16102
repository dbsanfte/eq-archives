    <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Have they ever stated whether they are going to revert or even just fix the new zones? I'm talking about zones like Nek specifically - the pathing is so terrible as to be nearly unbearable and the scarcity of content is absurd. Imagine several hundred want-to-be Dark Elf necros running around Nek, their pets randomly going off&amp;nbsp;on wild nature hikes and everything they pull acting like its a game a football and they're running the ball. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Has anyone else noticed this? The revamped newbie zones are Hell as far as I can tell and that's with a grand total of 2 people in the zone. Let's multiply that a few hundred times, add a touch of insane competition, and finally complete the whole thing with some nice Drano in the eye. &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;Theres a new new Nek on test server but it sucks too. I don't think they are going to revert any zones.</description>
