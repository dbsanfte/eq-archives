<DIV>On the 8th of June, 2006, we have added 3 files to your computer through the EverQuest patcher:<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>DXTest.dll<BR>DXUpgrade.txt<BR>DirectXTest.exe</BLOCKQUOTE><BR><BR>These files are added directly to the EverQuest directory and are for testing the ability of your computer to play the game once we update it for the new graphics engine, slated for the next big Live Update... which is coming soon.<BR><BR>To test your computer's ability to play the game after the next big Live Update, merely go into the EverQuest directory (usually C:\Program Files\Sony\EverQuest\, or similar) and run the DirectXTest program.<BR><BR>A few people, using older computers or video cards, will no longer be able to play the game when that big update happens.<BR><BR>There are fixes, however, which require upgrading primarily the video device. Some computers will have on-board video devices which cannot be upgraded without replacing the entire motherboard.<BR><BR><BR>
<HR>
<BR><BR>Once you run the DirectXTest program, a few errors may happen:<BR><BR>* <FONT color=orange>This application has failed to start because d3dx9_30.dll was not found. Re-installing the application may fix this problem.</FONT><BR><BR>This usually means that the April 2006 update for DirectX 9.0 has not been installed. If your machine doesn't have the latest DirectX9.0c runtimes, please go to <A href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=56513&amp;clcid=0x409" target=_blank><FONT color=#fac400>http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=56513&amp;clcid=0x409</FONT></A> and following the instructions there.<BR><BR>If this fails, the following solution should work for you:<BR>If you use the Windows Update to update to DirectX 9.0C, you will be unable to play the Test Server at this time due to a missing file, d3dx9_30.dll, in the Windows Update patch series. This error manifests itself as a dialog that appears when you run testeqgame.exe (the game client) and tells the user the program could not be initialize due to being unable to find the critical file/component d3dx9_30.dll. The file itself is available as a part of the April 2006 DirectX 9.0C SDK redistributable distribution. To solve this situation, follow the following steps to reinstall DirectX 9.0C from the redistributable distribution:<BR>1. Get the April 2006 DirectX 9.0C redistributable version (Caution: Download is about 52 MB) at:<BR><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=fb73d860-5af1-45e5-bac0-9bc7a5254203&amp;DisplayLang=en" target=_blank><FONT color=#fac400>http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=fb73d860-5af1-45e5-bac0-9bc7a5254203&amp;DisplayLang=en</FONT></A><BR>2. Run directx_apr2006_redist.exe. Extract the files to an easily identifiable directory.<BR>3. Go to the directory the files were extracted to in step 2. Run "DXSETUP.EXE" from that directory.<BR>4. Accept the license agreement. Allow the installer to update the DirectX components.<BR><BR><BR>* <FONT color=orange>Unable to load DXTest.dll</FONT><BR><BR>This means that the DXTest.dll file was either corrupted or did not load properly (possibly due to another error message previously seen). Try to re-patch the game using the full file scan found in the Advanced menu on the Patcher and then test the program again once the full scan has completed.<BR><BR><BR>* <FONT color=orange>Your machine is not ready for the upgrade. Please look in DXUpgrade.txt for instructions on how to upgrade your machine.</FONT><BR><BR>This means that your computer is not capable of the features that the game is going to require once the update occurs. Please follow the steps in the DXUpgrade.txt file and test again. If this continues to fail, please contact your computer's manufacturer or local technician for assistance in upgrading your video device and/or entire computer with full DirectX 9.0c support, including full Shader Model 2.0 support in hardware.
