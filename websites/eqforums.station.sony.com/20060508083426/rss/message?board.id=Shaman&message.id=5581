    <description>&lt;div&gt;I read they are making the path to 300 smoother and cheaper in the patch message. With this being the case,  should shaman who were already 300 be happy.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I mean all this will do is take the market which may have 20 master alchemist, and make it so everyones alt shaman can skill up easy.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I'm sure if your not 300 yet, your happy about the changes due to the fact you will probly be able to hit 300 with 1/3 the cost that the previous shaman had to spend. Myself, I find the cost reduction a kick in the butt to all those that worked, and spent the money to max alchemy out.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The don potions are the same. However, we can no longer make Gate potion's. EQtraders say it is obsolete. So, unless they changed the name, we can't make them anymore.</description>

      <description>You did it when you did, how you did, and you had the benefits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don't expect a whole bushel of would-be Alchemists to have been sitting around, saying &amp;quot;I really really want to hit 300, but I don't have the energy to do it&amp;quot;, but who will now become avid combiners overnight. Sure, some who were already on that path will get there quicker, and a few more may start it, but it's not like they patch you to 300 on login.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some people do Alchemy, some don't; the majority of the ones who don't still won't.</description>

      <description>It seems expensinve to me because it's my only cash drain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have friends who do every tradeskill on various toons, and they unanimously agree that Alchemy is the cheapest, and is among the very easiest.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;do you think new players to the game should only reach end of DoDh content in 7 years time too?&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>I think the path to 300 only cost me about.. 150k or 200 total, and im REALLY lazy and dont farm stuff for myself usually. The only parts I farmed were NBLs in seb so i could get from 279 to 300, which only took about 4 hours.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first thought that went through my head after reading the OP was &amp;quot;Was/is alchemy really considered expensive to raise?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have an erudite wizard with all the standard tradeskills maxed.  My current main is a froglok shaman on which I am working up tradeskills.  The shaman has been at 300 in alchemy for qutie some time.  Reflecting back on when I did alchemy I just don't see how it could be considered expensive.   After having done all the other tradeskills, sans tinkering,  alchemy seems to have already been ridiculously cheap to max.  *shrug*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If its cheaper now, I dont really care personally because it never seemed very expensive(or difficult) before.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
