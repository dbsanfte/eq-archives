    <description>It would be nice to see mana regen go up, for all classes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking as an int caster with a largish mana pool(~10K), and the best mana regen in the game as a necro, I do find myself going OOM quite a bit on raids.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As it stands, I am not complaining about MY current situation.&amp;nbsp; I am rather pleased as a necro, but I can definately see why other classes are complaining.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think the idea of Mana pool based regen is a good one, in that all mana pools for a given class archetype should regen mana at roughly the same rate (excluding buffs).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I also think that mana regen should be based apon your int/wiz as well.&amp;nbsp; The higher your int/wiz, the better your mana regen is.&amp;nbsp; That way having a huge amount of int does a little more than give you negligable return on your mana pool size.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyhow, keep throwing ideas around guys, it can only help.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-KK&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;P.S.

      <title>Mana Regen Clickies &amp; stacking</title>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;For the Devs to consider:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Mana pools keep growing. Mana regen does not. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;There are some nice mana regen clickies out there, but a rigid no stacking policy. True, there are a few that do stack, but the general rule is limited stacking.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Perhaps its time to reevaluate this? Therefor I propose: Lessen the stacking restrictions...a little. Perhaps a big mana regen item can now stack with a minor regen item. Or mana regen clickes can stack only when you're grouped, or in a raid. Or introduce a line of AA's that allow %'s of stacking mana clickes. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;As a Druid, when I'm on a raid and I run out of mana, I totally useless. (please! no debate on druid abilites here!) The same applies to most casters w/o mana.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;....or a minor bump&amp;nbsp;of the&amp;nbsp;Flowing Thought cap?&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I've been wishing the devs would increase mana regen for a very, very long time. If you can't afford the mana regen items, if there isn't access to a mind buff, if there is no way or you just don't want to bother with a mind fix, what do you do?&amp;nbsp; Sit around for 5-10 mins waiting for mana to recover? What a waste of time. Never understood it - and never will. Seven years in the making and eq1 still relies on an old and antequated time sink. Please someone explain to me, why this is fun?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The devs could in an instance haul eq1 out of the past and do something utterly positive that will make the game rock on whole new level. Yet they don't do it - so in those moments when you are sitting around, thinking, 'this is really dull - this is really boring' it becomes obvious what must change to rekindle the gameplay. Seriously, we've fell alseep at the keyboard on occasions - a game that makes you do that is just wrong.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please increase the basic mana regen &lt;i&gt;extensively&amp;nbsp; &lt;/i&gt;- and also do the same for health, as that too really needs a boost.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;We didn't realise at all that out of combat hp/mana/end regen was anywhere near being revised.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If it is anticipated for the new expansion then it is major news to us and very welcome. But we hope, even if this is long overdue, that the devs are bold about it - no half hearted measures, no skimping, no shirking the issue; they must make drastic changes to mana/hp regen and completely remove the tedium.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So anyone, from the barren newbie without a coin and any item to their name to the ubber raider, with all the gear they can buy and loot, can recover mana and hitpoints within an acceptable (and relevant) amount of time - and then get back into the gameplay.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;Which is a good thing but as a clr who's moving away from Ch and into Lights more( and more accessible) mana regen will make our lives much easier.&amp;nbsp; By more accessible I mean just on a few raid targets through an expansion giving more classes a shot at them.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This goes for casuals too im sure, the mpg eff trials were a fantastic idea that helped alot of casters(particularly priests!) greatly.&amp;nbsp; Click mana items are a wonderful item.&amp;nbsp; I know i've been veryhappy to loot each one I've been fortunalte to come across.&amp;nbsp; Even the ones which have gone straight to the bag.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Its nice for those raiders who have the classes and gear to bea ble to set up their raids so that they can stay at 80m during the course of their raids.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;For most people that situation just doesnt happen.&amp;nbsp; In many raids people consistently run out of mana.&amp;nbsp; In many groups people either run lom or slow cast to conserve mana.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Suggesting that people be careful with their casting and slow cast spells so that they dont run oom is just diverting the thread.&amp;nbsp; (In a major boss fight it may actually be betetr to run oom as quickly as possible in order to be able to sit and regen mana more efficiently.)&amp;nbsp; If a caster is dps, then he is going to convert x mana into y damage...quickly, slowly, whatever...doesnt matter.&amp;nbsp; Healing is a different case of course.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;For average people in group situtations mana regen is not holding up. Spells have become more expensive over time and mana regen has not increased to balance this.&amp;nbsp; Either more aa to raise the regen cap another 10 points or so, raising the cap straight up, or some blend of the two is badly needed.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Sliggoth&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;I respectfully disagree, and here is why:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;1) The only players that are exceeding the FT cap of 20 (including EM5 aa's) by a significant degree are hardcore raiders.&amp;nbsp; They may have as much as FT50-FT60 in gear on, maybe even higher.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I don't think it's much higher than that, although I could be mistaken.&amp;nbsp; Most players at L70 with decent gear will be in the FT20-FT40 range.&amp;nbsp; That increase, when compared to the mana cost of spells since Velious era as well as the manapool increase will not "break the game".&amp;nbsp; It will make regen a little faster, downtime a little shorter, but certainly won't trivialize anything.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;2) Most encounters these days are built around strategy and&amp;nbsp;class balance.&amp;nbsp; I don't believe there are many Xegony-style fights where you are required to sustain 30-40min+ of constant casting.&amp;nbsp; Therefore, the increased mana-regen will not trivialize anything.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I would wager that most high-end content is not difficult because certain classes are running out of mana, rather it is difficult due to the demands of the encounter.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;If there is a noticeable effect on the game by increasing the mana-regen to match the worn FT total, certainly some kind of scale of diminishing returns could be put in place to increase regen but respect the integrity of most encounters.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Here's the thing though..a lot of those "strategic encounters" where people would have ft 50-80 also have times where there's an extended full burn (or 15).&amp;nbsp; What would 200 to 550 more mana regen per min due to the encounters in DoB tier 2 (besides gimp them into oblivion)?&amp;nbsp; Razorthorne with nobody running OOM or even close?&amp;nbsp; The way encounters are set up, they're balanced (or seem to be) around an appropriate gearing level and expected mana regen/dps potentials raid wide..when one of those facets of an encounter greatly exceeds what it was designed around, the challenge of that encounter goes away.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I can see 5 more FT/mana regen, possibly 10..if new content later this year(?) is really difficult, but beyond that I think it's overkill and would trivial the existing content.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The difficulty in acquiring ft is very low.&amp;nbsp; The one-time reward augs(most of them) from DODH found there way onto backpack items the day they showed up on my cursor.&amp;nbsp; It's almost trivial, if you go through DoN, LDoN etc to get 25-45ft.&amp;nbsp; I have around 45 worn atm..and I haven't worked at it since PoP.&amp;nbsp; Some people might lose some hps/mana if they converted a lot of augs to ft(if the cap were removed) but that'd be their choice.&amp;nbsp; I think a wizard would be better off with an additional ft30 instead of 500 mana..&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;i&gt;"The difficulty in acquiring ft is very low."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The difficulty in acquiring HP regen is very low. &lt;br&gt;So... let's have monks and rogues lose a few hit points every time they swing a weapon.

And really it doesn't matter that FT is easier to get than it used to be -- once we reach the cap, any more does us no good. We've only gotten the cap raised a tiny amount in five years.

Fat lot of good one extra point of mana regen does me (Mask of the Wild over Mask of the Forest) and two extra points from C6 from VoQ do me when I gained several thousand mana b/w PoP and OoW, that was BEFORE I even got into the second guild I was ever in and got to the point I am at now. Mana regen from items needs to be, at the very least, doubled and the mana regen from spells needs a large boost with the next expansion instead of a piddling one or two more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;This is not about which class can regen mana faster, or why they should, or how they do it....this is about a long neglected aspect of the game.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Remember, mana pools are increasing.....mana regen is not.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;We can try some innovative ideas on mana savings...raising specization skills, adjusting the bottom range of conservation items. We can think about raising FT caps and stacking mana item clickies. We can consider lowering mana costs. We can raise the issue of AE's overwriting our mana regen buffs...&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;...but another useless rant about who's class is best is not going to be productive in ANY WAY! If you feel the urge to 'add' a CLASS statement here you are torpedoing this thread. STOP IT!&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;My orginal post was about stacking mana regen clickies. I have added some other ideas. Ideas that wil effect the entire game, not just one class over another. Becasue fo this we need to proced VERY carefully. This is a major apple cart, we don't want to upset it.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;IF a mob is supposed to attack our mana regen, then we have to trust the SoE will balance the fight around this fact. But are trash mobs supposed to do this as well? (sorry, don't have any flashy examples right off the top of my head) IF a boss mob is supposed to attack our mana regen, where is our chance to defend? Where is the player SKILL involved? Or do I just sit there and take it....&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Many threads have been posted about mana regen abilites being overwritten by AE's, so far I've not seen anything about repairing this. Is it a bug? A glitch? Is it working as intended? Are we casters supposed to go OOM during a battle and sit there completely useless? (a burden on the rest of the guild?) That's not game balance, that's mean spirited. Total lack of SoE communication about this is frustrating. Lets get the official word, please.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I also play a ranger. Freshly rez I can stand up and start contributing to a fight without a sinlge buff and zero mana/end. Granted, not much....but still some. AS a caster freshly rezed I can do....nothing. But med. Or get a mana dump from a necro. (do necros like that? I think not.) I can click a mod rod, but I had to pester a Mage for that. I can't cast my own mana regen buffs....but I CAN CLICK MY MANA REGEN CLICKES! &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;...Which brings us full circle....how about loosening the restriction on stacking mana regen clickes? Hmmmmmm? All I want to do is contribute to my guild and get back into the fight. In short...I want to PLAY, not sit around and watch helplessly as my team continues on. Is THAT too much to ask?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I just had another thought about stacking mana regen clickies.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;EG: Dead, freshly rezed, zero mana, zero class-specific-mana-regen-buffs.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Goal: To get back into the game asap.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Since I have no mana and no player cast mana regen buffs (C6, SA,etc) how about allowing ALL mana regen clickes to stack with full benefits UNTIL A PLAYER CASTS ONE ON ME. Or I cast one myself?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I loot my corpse, open my bag of clickes and cast what I have and they stack....but when I get any player buffs(including self buffs) ALL the clickes go poof! This would be something only usefull under certain conditions and wouldn't overpower the casters under normal conditions.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Or....perhaps it's time to investigate being rezed with a minimum amount of mana....not the 50% that you get in MM's...say 10% or so. Just enough to be able to contribute to the fight in a small way, or be able to rebuff myself and get back into my 'normal' mana regen abilities.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Or... perhaps 'rez effects' allow us to cast class specific mana regen buffs for no cost? No other type of spell, just Mask, Oak, C6, Lich, whatever?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;There are solutions out there, we just have to open our minds and accept that we're not going to get outragious mana regen capablites.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>Slight aside to the mana regen issue, but does anyone know why the&#xD;
+mana regen spells from items ( starting from Koadiac's robe off Emp&#xD;
Ssra all the way to Mata &amp;amp; Mayong's versions) is on a 27 minute&#xD;
timer?&amp;nbsp; All of the "Form of" and most other self-buffs via items&#xD;
are on a 36 minute timer.&amp;nbsp; It's not a terribly annoying issue, but&#xD;
I've been curious and I wouldn't mind them on a 36 minute timer.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>i wouldn't be suprised if it were possible to exceed FT 100 by swaping out a lot of augs and armor.. FT is so common its impossible not to hit the cap.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;granted this would be a severe hp/mana hit.. but double/triple mana regen depending on your class?&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;It definately does not take a hardcore player to exceed the flowing thought cap.&amp;nbsp; Nonhardcore players hit the cap when LDoN came out with augments.&amp;nbsp; At this stage, many casual players had Coldain Prayer Shawl (+3), LDoN aug(+3), LDoN aug(+2), LDoN aug(+1), and a myriad of items to fill the last 6 mana regen to hit the 15 cap.&amp;nbsp; Tipt augment(+2), Itraer Vius sleeves(+2), Ring War necklace(+2) or Ring War helmet(+2).&amp;nbsp; The list goes on and on, and this was many expansions ago.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Now, it's easier than anything to cap your mana regeneration.&amp;nbsp; Just wheel and deal in bazaar for a month - you can do that solo.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Many encounters are designed based upon how long players can survive without mana regeneration spells.&amp;nbsp; When their AE drains are landing on everyone, the FT cap is what you work with.&amp;nbsp; Remove that cap, and a ton of encounters are trivilized.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I did like the idea for an AA that would raise the minimum bonus of preservation mods.&amp;nbsp; That was definately interesting.&lt;/P&gt;</description>
