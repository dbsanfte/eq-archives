				<DIV>ok lemme say something as a vetran event goer ive got somwhere around 2500 events under my belt. ive won a whole 3 things on roll ive lead(been raidleader and incharge of lewt distroy next to the gm)&nbsp;close to 150 or so events. all the gear i wear none of ir was won on rolls i only had&nbsp;2 peices i actively wore after ive won the roll.&nbsp; there is gear ive won on events i will keep wearing till i am in time/god most likely these items ive been awarded for my roleplay skills and my attendance. these events were designed 2 make eq more fun for some of us vetran players that have been around for many years and loot is only secondary to me but i guess that comes w/ the fact that i only roll if 1 of 2 thing; 1. its a upgrade, 2. it's open greed roll cuz its not a upgrade for anyone their(that does not mean a upgrade for their twink only the toon that is present)</DIV>
