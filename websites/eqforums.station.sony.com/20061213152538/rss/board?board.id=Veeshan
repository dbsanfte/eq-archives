      <title>Eulogy for a server</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Veeshan&amp;message.id=119#M119</link>
      <description>I first started playing EQ in October 2002.  I had no real idea of what the game was like; I was just looking to get away from Magic: the Gathering (both the paper and online versions).  A friend I had met while playing MTGO advised me to start on the Veeshan server and to add her characters to my friends list.  About a week after that, I helped her do a transfer from one character to another, and that was all I ever saw of her on EQ.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What a difference 30 months makes.  Today is almost exactly 2.5 years after I first started playing, to within a couple of days.  I remember reading of this new expansion that had been released just as I started, this Planes of Power.  I read at that time of the harsh trials in the Plane of Justice, the fierce fights against a crystal dragon in the Plane of Valor, epic battles in the Bastion of Thunder, and the near-impossible barrier that was the Rathe Council.  Here I am, much later, following in the same footsteps of those who had been at the bleeding edge when I was selling banded armor out of Freeport, too scared to leave the East Commonlands, even to zone into the West Commonlands.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I advanced in my own way, spending many a beloved hour in South Karana, soloing gnolls, and later in Guk, where I lived for most of 20 levels.  I made many friends during this time.  Most have moved on to other games, quit EQ, or otherwise moved on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Through it all, one person has remained paramount for me.  I met Magratt when we were in our 20's, levelling in the basement of Highkeep.  None of us at the time had any real idea what the heck we were doing, but we all agreed it was a blast and were having the time of our lives.  Maggy used to wield this insanely huge and wicked-looking black hammer, and she quickly earned the moniker of "tanking druid."  We hit it off at once, and she convinced me to join this guild she was in called Sanctus Aemilius.  From then on, we were inseperable.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I remember seeing the griffin up in East Commons one day, conning yellow and scowling at me.  Just as I was about to flee the zone, I got a tell from Maggy saying hi -- she'd just logged on.  I quickly asked her if she wanted a challenge, and she said sure.  She hustled over to EC, and the two of us duo'ed the griffin, surrounded by several onlookers in their teens, cheering wildly as we ended this horrid nemesis of their lowbie experience.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once I reached level 40, I decided it was time to begin on my epic.  My first challenge was to face down Sir Lucan d'Lere, and with the help of Maggy and several other friends, Lucan was dispatched with haste.  As our brave crew stumbled into North Freeport, giddy with the joy of victory and drained at the effort we had to put forth, I proposed to Magratt, and to my eternal delight, she accepted.  Just over two years ago, Magratt and I married in the Jaggedpine Forest, a light-hearted celebration attended by just a few close friends.  We jointly selected our surname of Sylvanblade, and I can think of nothing that would ever make me change it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This sounds inconsequential when told in this way, but there are simply no words to describe how profound an effect this had on me.  My whole experience changed -- it was no longer just a game, it was almost an alternate life.  I had found someone very special to me, and that fact uplifted EQ from mere bits and bytes to a true joy and delight, an escape from the pains and pressures of real life.  Most of my EQ game time since then has been dedicated at least in part to Maggy, and I hope she enjoyed our times together as much as I did.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;During this time, I have had good experiences and bad.  I got into a trade war with Famelin (anyone still remember him?), eventually supplanting him as the most well-known tradeskiller on Veeshan.  I advanced through the Planes, eventually getting Elemental flagged.  Friends came and went, and finally, just a few weeks ago, Maggy decided that EQ was no longer her cup of tea.  I was devastated, but I understood how EQ could become boring, repetitive, and uninteresting, especially compared to an active, fun-filled life in the real world.  I treasure every moment we spent together, and I know that it would never have been possible had I not been advised to select Veeshan as my starting server.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As I write this little essay, I'm listening to Luther Vandross croon on the radio, "I'd rather have bad times with you than good times with someone else."  That summarizes my feelings of Veeshan.  I had some wonderful times with this server -- I've made some very special friends, and it would never have happened had I selected another.  Mentally, I know that this server merge is effectively just a change in name, that all my friends will still be there ... those who still play, anyway.  I know that there will be many new players, with opportunities to make even more friends.  Mentally, I know little will change.  Maybe it's a change for the better.  Maybe it will aid in the long term life of the game.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Emotionally, I know that Veeshan is dead.  All that it stood for, all the accomplishments in its history ... all the personal history that I have built with friends and enemies, allies and crooks, all will change.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Veeshan has served me well as a home away from home.  To that, I owe it many thanks.  It will not be forgotten.  Veeshan lives and prospers, and it will continue to do so as long as we carry its legacy in our hearts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I remain, &lt;br&gt;Yours truly,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sir KyrosKrane Sylvanblade of Veeshan&lt;br&gt;Lord of Erollisi Marr&lt;br&gt;Lightbringer and Sentry of Passion&lt;br&gt;Almost-Master Artisan&lt;br&gt;Defender of Firiona Vie&lt;br&gt;Eternal Resident of Veeshan</description>

      <title>The fall of Veeshan. :(</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Veeshan&amp;message.id=113#M113</link>
      <description>The newest merger updates out and as reported&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4/25 Veeshan merges with Luclin and will be listed as Luclin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Veeshan will be no more and will be renamed Luclin. So much for support for one of the originals. However I must say the merger isn't a total loss, 2 servers= twice the players= twice the groups, although for many lag could become a problem. Good luck everyone, after 4/25/2005 we will be on Luclin.</description>

      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Veeshan&amp;message.id=110#M110</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;New Producer Letter says they'll be opening a poll to vote for which name you want your new server to keep.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;A href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=64042" target=_blank&gt;http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=64042&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Make sure to mark Veeshan when the poll is released. Must keep one of the original servers going&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>Response to Brenlo's "The Coffee Diaries"</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Veeshan&amp;message.id=84#M84</link>
      <description>&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Courier New" color=#3366cc size=4&gt;Brenlo I encourage you to respond to this as I am not flaming you just stating my perceptions based on your post.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Courier New" color=#3366cc size=4&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Courier New" color=#3366cc size=4&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Courier New" color=#3366cc size=4&gt;First, I 100% agree with merging servers.&amp;nbsp; It has to be done for the longevity of EQLive.&amp;nbsp; But was the state of each server really taken into account?&amp;nbsp; I have attempted to find the "concrete" source of what was taken into account, in which case I have not be able to find or it isn't posted.&amp;nbsp; What I did read amounted to taking into consideration the peak usage of each server.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Courier New" color=#3366cc size=4&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Courier New" color=#3366cc size=4&gt;It is 100% likely that I cannot find this information if the complete information is located in one place I would greatly appreciate the location and page of the post.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Courier New" color=#3366cc size=4&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Courier New" color=#3366cc size=4&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Courier New" color=#3366cc size=4&gt;The reason why I don't believe that the state of each server was taken into account is because you don't put 10 PoTime level guilds on one server...&amp;nbsp; I would hope that you would try not to mix servers that have anarchy with some level of extra-guild cooperation...&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Courier New" color=#3366cc size=4&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Courier New" color=#3366cc size=4&gt;You have the title community manager, but do you know the state of your communities?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Courier New" color=#3366cc size=4&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Courier New" color=#3366cc size=4&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Courier New" color=#3366cc size=4&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Courier New" color=#3366cc size=4&gt;Second, if you talk to any psychiatrist about your opinion of legacy and heritage they would say that you’re in denial.&amp;nbsp; (Only flame sorry.)&amp;nbsp; Brenlo your posting name defines who you are and what your place is in the EQ world.&amp;nbsp; I would wager that more then 50% of the active players know who you are as Brenlo.&amp;nbsp; The fact of the matter is FoH isn't around any more and soon neither will Veeshan.&amp;nbsp; If we take Brenlo away from you and make you, per se, Abby your personality will change and so will the communities perception of you.&amp;nbsp; A name defines the people of the EQ Community that was so important in days past.&amp;nbsp; The name that you take away will destroy the identity of two communities because of bad planning and lack of community involvement.&amp;nbsp; Will the communities rebuild... yes.&amp;nbsp; In a manner quite similar to the community left in ruins by Alexander the Great.&amp;nbsp; Lost self identity and lost heritage. (IMO)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Courier New" color=#3366cc size=4&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Courier New" color=#3366cc size=4&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Courier New" color=#3366cc size=4&gt;I am also a realist so...&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Courier New" color=#3366cc size=4&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Courier New" color=#3366cc size=4&gt;Let's see the open and honest EQLive that we were promised...&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Courier New" color=#3366cc size=4&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Courier New" color=#3366cc size=4&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Courier New" color=#3366cc size=4&gt;Information I would like to see posted...&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Courier New" color=#3366cc size=4&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Courier New" color=#3366cc size=4&gt;1) All questions that were presented in determining which servers would merge with each other.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Courier New" color=#3366cc size=4&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Courier New" color=#3366cc size=4&gt;2) Current Level data.&amp;nbsp; IE Number of active characters per server (logged in last 6 months) lvl 1-10, lvl 11-20, ECT.&amp;nbsp; &amp;amp; Number of guilded vs. unguilded characters per level group.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Courier New" color=#3366cc size=4&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Courier New" color=#3366cc size=4&gt;3) Guild Statistics.&amp;nbsp; IE Number of active guilds per stage per server.&amp;nbsp; Post-Time, Time, PoP, Pre-PoP.&amp;nbsp; Active guilds defined as 10+ members, whereas 10+ members have logged in the last 6 months). Post-Time is defined as 50% or more of guild is Qvic+ flagged.&amp;nbsp; Time is defined as 50% or more of guild is Time flagged, whereas more then 50% of the guild has entered Time in the past 2 months.&amp;nbsp; PoP is defined as 50% or more of guild is flagged for any level of PoP.&amp;nbsp; Pre-PoP is defined as none of the above.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Courier New" color=#3366cc size=4&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Courier New" color=#3366cc size=4&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Courier New" color=#3366cc size=4&gt;Yes, I do realize that you might find this all quasi upsetting but your opinion is also shadowed by your position and your name is not being taken away.&amp;nbsp; You have already stated that you are much more into EQ2 now then EQ1, which distances yourself from this community.&amp;nbsp; (Not intended to be a flame but does seem harsh, I am sorry.)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Courier New" color=#3366cc size=4&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Courier New" color=#3366cc size=4&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Courier New" color=#3366cc size=4&gt;Feel better soon and try to drink some water it's much better for you anyways.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Courier New" color=#3366cc size=4&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Courier New" color=#3366cc size=4&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Courier New" color=#3366cc size=4&gt;Pucnit&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Courier New" color=#3366cc size=4&gt;Servant of Veeshan&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Courier New" color=#3366cc size=4&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Courier New" color=#3366cc size=4&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Courier New" color=#3366cc size=4&gt;PS:&amp;nbsp; The NIMBY thing wouldn't apply as much if SoE had actively informed the community sooner and had asked for suggestions before server merges were announced.&amp;nbsp; Now instead of people offering land you have people fighting to save it.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Courier New" color=#3366cc size=4&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Courier New" color=#3366cc size=4&gt;PSS: When ever I do updates to my server I also use Veeshan as my lore setting. (dragon or world)&amp;nbsp; I really don't want to go through all the history books and learn about some VT mob that I've whipped 9234239048 times with a rusty sword.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>Well it seems Veeshan will be merging with Luclin and taking the Luclin name... Yes I am outraged but according to SOE they have the larger server population. That day will be a very sad day and I wish they would reconsider keeping the name Veeshan since it is one of the original servers... Sure they are offering titles but Veeshan has been a part of most of our lives for 5+ years... So hopefully we can get an in game petition going to keep the Veeshan name.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kariny Skullhead 62 Cleric Leader of &lt;br&gt;Balkerain Ravensong 66 Bard</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Since most (all?) mobs in Mistmoore were moved when Mistmoore got revamped does "A Mistmoore Guard" still spawn?&amp;nbsp; If so, what zone and any other details would be great.&amp;nbsp; If this mob no longer spawns how did you find out since the GMs so helpfully answered my petitions with "ask other players ... we cannot tell you if a mob has been taken out of the game"&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Thank you for any assistance you may be able to give me.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <title>death-loop at Firiona Vie town</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Veeshan&amp;message.id=66#M66</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3&gt;Hello.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3&gt;I have a trouble of death-loop in Firiona Vie town.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3&gt;My druid's bind point is Firiona Vie bank. When I know server down of yesterday, I casted gate spell.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3&gt;Usually FV is safety zone for druids, acutually, I always bought RoK spells. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3&gt;But&amp;nbsp;druid was killed by Dragoon(it seems dark elvish) inside the town.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3&gt;When I returned to bind point by that death, I typed /q at once.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3&gt;But I'm afraid my druid has a problem of death-loop still now, so I cannot login by my druid.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3&gt;Then I changed to my other character, and sent a petition(ID:3088922).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3&gt;I waited GM of veshan-server appears and resolve my issue.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3&gt;But I've never seen any GM on veeshan-server over 27 hours.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3&gt;Why GM didn't login to veeshan-server? &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3&gt;Is this your service for payment ?(So I cannot order DoN for your NICE service)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3&gt;I complained this issue at general chat. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3&gt;Any GM saids me "login to your server by your other character, soon GM will resolve your issue" . &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3&gt;What is "soon" ?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3&gt;How long I cannot play by druid? May I play by my other character?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3&gt;Must&amp;nbsp;druid lose all exp by this accident ?(Because naked corpse will fade away faster than equipped corpse, and I waited long time on veeshan-server. I think all GM cannot rez except corpse.)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>Veeshan, the questions that remain unsolved</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Veeshan&amp;message.id=59#M59</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I question alot of things on this server out of the many many moons I been playing on veeshan.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;1. Why when Clerics LFG theirs no warriors LFG? and Vis Versa?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;2. Why is the good guilds these days recruiting nothing but gimps?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;3. why cant good players get into guilds but gimps and people who cant play the their class can?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;4. Why is veeshan vault considered a true source of info to 99% of veeshan?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;5. Why are people so stupid on veeshan server? No common sense, lack of skill, and just plain out ruins it for everyone?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;6. Why is it GM's help one person but not the other?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;7. Why do people trust pick up raids when most of the time its gonna be unsuccessful.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;as the days go in in Veeshan, the Gimp level of players is increasing day by day, its to the point some of the best guilds on veeshan which include COE, AG, OTB, is just recruiting gimps galore, people with no common sense, no skill of the game, just power leveling fools with crush bone gear that some how manage to get in good guilds before the well experienced well equipped player will. and I now asI look at it, its just no wonder we got nothing but gimps anymore on this server, all the good players is just fed up with it and going to either EQ2 or WOW, I mean pretty soon its gonna be called Gimp Quest.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Is there an active server raid channel? I have heard or a couple and tried them and both had maybe 3 people in them.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I know this is a long shot since it seems almost nobody comes to this server board :smileytongue:&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
