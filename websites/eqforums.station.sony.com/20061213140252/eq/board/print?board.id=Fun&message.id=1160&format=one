				<DIV><FONT size=2>My wife got me into the game. I was very sceptical of the whole online thing, never having had much fun playing other games on the internet.&nbsp; While I still may gripe about SOME players, by wife and I have found it to be a great way to do something together every night while I am away. I have spent the last year working out of state and living in a hotel room, so for 4 nights a week there is an opportunity for us to interact, albeitly through our toons. Anyone knows that a relationship needs interaction to stay alive. EQ is our way of doing that.</FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT size=2>I laugh at myself now when I used to chuckle about her collecting spiderling silks and wondering why the hell a guy would run into the group with some monster chasing him, then fall to the ground, just so the others could start hitting it.. what craziness is THIS?</FONT></DIV>
