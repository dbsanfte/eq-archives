      <title>How to fix the glossy and metalic scale problem!</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Trade&amp;message.id=10410#M10410</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;make scales and glossy drop in dodh instences and por instences(maybe drop in a new form to fit the lore)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;its silly how rare these are and sense the creator nerf these are becomign more and more rare to get. when por comes out i think lot of don groups will be as common as ldon groups(occasional on a blue moon!) which will make it imposible to get scales to make armor! make the scales drop with current content(sense the current always replaces the old!)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;what do you think?&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>DoN curltural armor questions</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Trade&amp;message.id=10405#M10405</link>
      <description>I started to do the quests for the DoN curltural armor and have a couple questions.&lt;br&gt;1. Do you need to have your tradeskills up to make the armor?&lt;br&gt;2. If so, what tradeskill levels are needed to make Journeyman, Expert, Master...?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I know I had more questions, but can't think of them now, so I guess thats it. Thanks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Fleeting Quiver ??</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Trade&amp;message.id=10383#M10383</link>
      <description>For years there has been the question, does this quiver give bow haste or does it not ?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have had one equipped for as long as I can remember.  Even with Endless Quiver I still carry a variety of different arrows in it.  I have done various tests at different levels, with different bows, with other haste items and haste buffs.  It has been my findings that if the Fleeting Quiver is equiped you do get some added bow haste.  The quiver  indicates it is a weight reduction item and I beleive there is some fomula for determining the haste.  There are many threads on this item on many boards, and as many opinions as there are posters on the subject.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now my question &amp;quot; Ngreth &amp;quot; if you would be so kind as to comment.  If this is a Bow Haste item, why not just say on it &amp;quot; Bow Haste 20 % &amp;quot;, like we do with every other haste item in the game ? ? ?  I can see no reason to keep it &amp;quot;mystified&amp;quot; as to it's usefulness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In my humble opinion no Ranger should leave home without it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Coarse silks / MDS / GDH</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Trade&amp;message.id=10321#M10321</link>
      <description>Did they recently reduce the drop rate on coarse silk, MDS, and GDH in the nest mission, Clues?  I used to farm clues and get usually 1 silk + either 1 scale or 1 hide.  Sometimes I'd go a whole mission without seeing anything, but it was rare.  I've done 6 clues missions over the past 2 days and seen 1 MDS, 0 silks, 0 GDH, and we've been clearing every drake/spider in zone.  With the advent of last bloods, don armor is in much higher demand, so perhaps it's time to have the components drop a little more frequently.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Attention Alchemists!</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Trade&amp;message.id=10265#M10265</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size=4&gt;Attention Alchemists!&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;We've made some dramatic changes to the Alchemy Tradeskill which include both the recipes as well as the products. We've taken some time to evaluate the Alchemy skill as a whole and make some very substantial changes in per-combine pricing, sellback pricing, skill-up paths, and product desirability -- All of which will prove to be beneficial for patrons of the skill. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Now, without getting too deep into the changes made, and without spoiling some of the things you'll see in the expansion… We would like to take a moment here to briefly mention the more intrusive changes in the hopes that you will be able to more adequately prepare yourselves for them.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;First, we have modified nearly every alchemical recipe that currently exists in game, and when these changes get pushed out to the Live servers, many of the old recipes will no longer work. This means you may find a number of the ingredients you have been carefully stockpiling for months are no longer valid. This also means that it is recommended that you use them up before the next update (which is currently scheduled for the 21st.)&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Second, we have modified nearly every vendor purchased alchemical herb that currently exists in game, as well as adding a host of new herbs that we use in the new recipes. There are no cases where we increased the value of an herb, so stockpiling vendor purchased herbs now in the hopes of gaining money is a bit of a futile attempt. We do not recommend it.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Finally, we do not ordinarily announce changes of this nature, however… Given the amount of time and money that some alchemists have spent gathering materials, we would hate to see them suddenly become useless overnight. Please make sure that you use your time and items wisely and as soon as you can. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I just got my first 6 peices of DoN cultural armor and was seriously disappointed to see that I can't wear it! The armor is TOO HEAVY. Apparently, the GM symbols weight 0.5 stones each. Can someone somewhere please save me! I'm so frustrated right now. I shouldn't have to place my bags in the bank or buy levels of packrat (does that even work for worn gear?! I don't know many monks who've bought it.) I've literally been saving up &amp;amp; doing missions nonstop trying to gather the required ingredients and I'm over weight. /sigh&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please!

      <title>Cultural Smithing Question for a Dev</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Trade&amp;message.id=10224#M10224</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;Question for you why is there Cultural Armor for a race, when the race that wears it can not make it, and the race that makes it can not wear it? What I am talking about is is Blackened Darkscale Armor which can only be made by Ogres and only be worn by Trolls. Being a Troll SK and blacksmith I would love to be able to make this stuff to give to my pet. There is no mid range armor a Troll can make and the DoD stuff is totally out of the question, to give it to a pet.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;I was wondering if there is a reason the vendor purchased portion of the DoN cultural armor is so expensive. I have farmed alot of the dropped pieces, but can not afford the vendor sold items to really use this as a skill up path. Is this what was intended, and should i just give up. I would not mind so much if I could vendor sell the results (the Experts armor just does not sell in bazaar on Tribunal), or could tribute it atleast so that its not a total loss.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Thanks,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Heracy&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Review of GM cultural tailor armor possible ?</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Trade&amp;message.id=10167#M10167</link>
      <description>I am wondering if GM cutulral tailored armor is going to be redesigned, here's what I see.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For plate and chain armor, the high AC on both armor makes them desirable items even for high end raiders.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For leather and silk armor, who are not so dependent on AC (especially silk wearer), the difference between Grandmaster and Master armor is very little, therefore, someone wearing a suit of Master tailored armor will be almost as the same as someone wearing a suit of GM tailored armor.  However, someone wearing a full GM plate armor will benefit much more from the high ac, this holds especially true with the DoDH augs such as lastblood and bazu stone augmented armor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So if it's possible, it'd be nice to add some extra stats on the Grandmaster version of silk armor such as spell shielding and such to make them worthwhile as compared to many readily available cheap bazaar substitutes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Bows n Arrows since pop  (ngreth?)</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Trade&amp;message.id=10135#M10135</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr size="1"&gt;&lt;!--   / icon and title   --&gt;&lt;!--   message   --&gt;&lt;div&gt;OK - we understand that there is some form of concern of archery being somewhat overpowered, differant than envisioned - or whatever. Got it. That said - There are dropped Bows that are far greater in power than trade skilled bows. These are sure to empower the users of said bows to get better damage output with their bows... etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PoP brought in the Nightmare and Elemental bows made from tradeskillers. At the time they blew away all previous tradeskilled bows. PoPs best dropped Ele bows were about equal to the and the 3? Tier 3 droped bows. Since then each expansion has released greater and greated bows - just as all other gear gets upgrades with the new content.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;DoN released a completly new cultural line of gear (third version? IIRC Velious relieased the first tier of cultural and somewhere there was a big cultural upgrade between Luclin and POP - and then POP smithing/ tailoring was a viable competitor). Over time and expansions there are some dramatic upgrades in what armor can be made with tradeskills. GoD released some new recipees that were the flavor of the month for a bit for velium gemed weapons.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;GoD, Omens in the least released new bow recipees and all new expansions (maybe not DoD -- I will have to double check) have released new arrow recipees. However - these are all geared towards alternate skill up routes thru dropped items some rare some common some purchased at vendors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yet -- with the exception of the drakespine arrows - there has been no upgrade bows tradescrafted by players since PoP. Pop. Since pop we have had LDON, LoY, GoD, Omens, DoN, DoD and the best tradeskilled bows are from 7 expansions ago. 7. 7 expansions. Other than the &amp;quot;fun&amp;quot; of tradeskilling - the value of being a maxed out fletcher hasnt' changed since pop drakespine arrow notwithstanding. If there is a concern for players making bows that are too great - make them hard to get parts for. Maybe not raid only drops - maybe so. Maybe the end results can be attunable or no drop. but something. I mean is there any way to throw the fletchers a bone here. I mean anyone that was savy enough to have a higher than average tailoring or smithing skill has been able to step up and do the DoN cultural quests and provide some great products to players. with 3 augment slots.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From fletchers... bits of the new augment, a few alternate routes to skill up - but otherwise -zip. Since pop.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway we can expect Fletching to have any game enhancing value other than a bit part in quests? a new set of cultural bows? Arrows? Raided fletching components? Fletching quests commensurate with the DoN /DoD quests? Anything? note the luke warm simmer on the eqtraders fletching forum for the last 2 years... I think the fletchers are... marginalized and would like to make products for the player base to make some return on the time invested to master the trade.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>I need some silk thread for a quest. I bought a sowing kit and combined 2 spiderling webs and I got  silk thread. But that was yesterday. Today try as I may, it won't combine. Does anyone know what I am doing wrong?  Thanks&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
