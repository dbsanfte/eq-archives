      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;MT used /ran 100 or /ran 500 (basically a ran system from a high #) and the highest person won - in many pickup groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EMarr used the alpha random, where they (for a 6 person group) might do something like /ran 1 8 (tossing out the #1 and #8 rolls and rerolling if they came up because statistics had showed the polars will come up more often than average on a small range - and then looking aphabetically to see who won it).  Or they'd do the /ran 1 6 with the same.  If the lowest possible # came up, the 1st person in the alphabet won it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Was a challenge getting both sides to talk instead of just go &amp;quot;that doesn't make sense&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;that's an old non efficient system&amp;quot;.  Both sides had merit.  (MT folks for example, preferred everyone rolling because then you had the responsibility for a bad roll; versus putting your luck in the hands of a pick up person you didn't know.  EMarr folks said why have to sort through all those rolls, just do 1 roll only.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;There is a thread about this in the &amp;quot;veteran&amp;quot; forum on the first page.   Take a look for it as a developer posted there and indicated what should be done for reimbursement (known issue they're working on and they are reimbursing for it currently).  I would post the information here but do not recall what specifically was mentioned.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;When I was in a casual family guild we did things like the following.  I'd be happy to provide more details in an PM on these boards or cross server tell if desired.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;1)  Drunken race across the karanas&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;2)  If the guild needs &amp;quot;money&amp;quot; find a zone that drops good stuff (rathe mountains, OOT, or anywhre else that money drops today), have the higher levels buff help the lower levels earn exp at that same time.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;3)  Aid stations where you go heal/buff folks (can set up anywhere folks are playing these days at the levels you have online)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;4)  Fishing contests&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;5)  Everyone grabs an alt/main around the same level with a few higher folks as chaperones - then go to Nurga for example or one of the LoY zones (and dungeon crawl).  Any place works here.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;6)  Encourage communication on the message board your guild has; set up things like &amp;quot;start the story adding only 3 words and the person below continues it&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;describe the person above you&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;tell me your favorite story about EQ&amp;quot; or something else that gets folks chatting.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;7)  Have higher members &amp;quot;shroud&amp;quot; down to lower levels and group with members.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;8)  See if any members have a &amp;quot;quest&amp;quot; they want to do - jboots, anything works here.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;9)  Depending which groups have enough levels online, you can have a couple groups standing next to each other in some exp zone and then just bring pulls to them (not a raid but it's a precursor).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;My personal preference as a raider/questor/grouper/camper would be every 9 months have an expansion; or do a mini one at 6 months then a full fledged, complicated long lasting one at 9-12 months.  DoDH was one of the first expansions that barely had anyone completing it before the next expansion came out.  There should be *some* distance after a number of guilds first complete it and when the new expansion comes out.  Not a ton or more folks leave the game cause they're tired of farming (think PoP/GoD era here) or are stuck wtihout new content for too long of a period of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having nothing to do in the game should be equal a concern to SoE as having too much to do in the game (and no one to do it with because folks don't stay in old content).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;~~&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Also did you notice the other day there was a Problem for Raiders one that could have been delt with till a Later patch but it got an emergany patch.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not sure if I'm thinking of the same emergency patch as you had but if I am, it couldn't wait until later.  It had the same impact as the instances crashing but in a different way - people couldn't play.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;:(  Another 2 hours has passed and a regular non-fabled spawned yet again.  We had killed the one 2 hours ago; and if the spawn timer was a guaranteed 12 hours, he would have been this pop for sure since we've been in zone for most of that time.  (Unless he changes back from a fabled to a regular if not killed.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total Friday night (6.75 hours); yesterday (5 hours); today (10 hours).  Not one fabled yet.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I must be getting a bad RNG then or the spawn isn't 8 hours guaranteed this year like the Triton person above said.  I've been in zone since 1:43pm central today (it's 9:52pm central).  No fabled and the king just spawned as a regular.  We left him up the entire time since we knew the latest he'd been killed was 11:43am central.  We finally killed him at 7:43pm central and just got the respawn - a regular king.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So it's been 8 hours since we got in zone with no fabled (at least 10 hours since a fabled could have popped).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just purchased this with my AH refund (at the 940-950 AA point) as a raider working on Vi**SMURF**ar, OMM and starting DoDh/PoR progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There definitely are a lot of other AA's more needed; however, you'll know when it's time to get this (when the content you're doing means a complete waste for the raid if a rezzer doesn't get out ... and frequently doesn't). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; - Some zones are easy to get back to if you die; some like Jelvan/AMV in Anguish for example, the raid basically has to summon and scrap the event or start over on reclearing the whole zone again if there's no rezzer/cother that lived).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;With some skills there were multiple locations you could &amp;quot;farm&amp;quot; the drops, and even with wyverns, you can split up the area (right side, SS side) when others want to come in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With holgresh, it's harder because there's only a few wanderers outside the cave, but not enough to warrant anything.  Usually I get 1, lucky days I might get 2 furs per clearing of the cave.  So it's tedious (like everything else) but also harder to split up when someone else is in zone.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, prior to PoR and with not much time spent in DoDH (some but not a ton yet), I know a few &amp;quot;casual&amp;quot; warrior friends who have 11k unbuffed (don't recall the AC level to be honest but it's appropriate for the HP range).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People have just given over a dozen (closer to 20) potential upgrades on gear, augments, right click effects, quests to further stats, etc. that should take quite a while to complete.  I DO call that &amp;quot;far from the end&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But keep in mind; this is ONE magelo from one warrior.  He's not decked out too bad, and as you said, he probably put a lot of time in so far to get as far as he has, which means he's on the higher end of the &amp;quot;casual&amp;quot; spectrum and as such should NOT be held up as the &amp;quot;average casual warrior&amp;quot; anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;~~&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not to get smart but 2/3 of 17k/3k = 11.4k HP / 2k AC.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;I can say that you do NOT need to turn in all 10 at the same time as I turned in the original 8 tongue samples together; and then it was several  months until I turned in the remaining to &amp;quot;zum&amp;quot; tongue samples together.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And the person above is correct; you need all 10 to be the &amp;quot;samples&amp;quot; (mixed with that white ground spawn stuff in Natimbi) - they won't take the tongues itself.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It is a fact to say that ALL raiders play more than the regular joe schmoe that only plays a few hours a week or less.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Hopefully you realized you might get called out on this.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn't a fact.  I guess my guild would be what you call &amp;quot;2nd tier high end&amp;quot;.  We've downed all but OOM, VIsh - and we're working on DoDh access and will be sniffing around PoR.  We have numerous raiders who raid 1 day a week (4-6 hours) and they are fully flagged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THE difference is this ~ ~ ~ It's as much HOW they spend their time as how MUCH time they spend that's the difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;~~&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And there's no hard fast rules on what a raider's mana/hp should be at.  Since I'm a cleric, I'll speak to cleric levels.  My guild cleric mana average is 9253, median is 9280.  But that comes with a standard deviation of almost 1200 (that means we have a 7300 mana cleric whose active as well as an 11k cleric).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by crystilla on &lt;span class="date_text"&gt;03-15-2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;06:46 PM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by crystilla on &lt;span class="date_text"&gt;03-15-2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;06:47 PM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aye, we've used whoever we have with the right tools.  Often it's clerics but occasionally it fit better with druids.  In all of GoD, we never used any chains (not with ikk raid trials, not with Qvic, not with Inkut'ta or Txevu) until Tacvi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was refreshing to get away from them after all the chain heavy stuff PoP required (it might not be needed now with all the level, aa and gear increases but the 1-2 years after PoP came out it was).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DoDh brings chains back into the picture again (and we still use in Anguish for now on all non-OMM named, but it's only a 3 person chain).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(When we first killed Quarm 2 years ago, we were the only guild on the server that used an all druid chain, protecting them with a cleric group healer/curer.  For us, it was the best setup since we've never been a strong shaman/curer guild # wise.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As someone who has 5 of the 7 done (just need to finish brewing and pottery), I had heard they were modifying something with the trophies but had not heard that it would grant you the % skill you are currently at when you did the certificate combine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Correct me if I'm wrong, but the % it's listed as really isn't affecting your chance at a skillup as the trophy is not going to suddenly say 9% geerlok instead of 8% because you're &amp;quot;so far through the level&amp;quot; right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I'm right, having it show you the # is just ornamental and doesn't affect anything and therefore not needed.  I'm not sad I didn't wait to do my combines (and I wouldn't be sad even if I could have had a 10% geerlok instead of a 8% one if I'd waited).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
