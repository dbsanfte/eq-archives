				<P>Ok Ashlanne, let me see if I understand this.</P>
<P>1. Croc warders are always tiny.&nbsp;&nbsp;No problems appear to be plaguing them.</P>
<P>2. Low level beastlords have small pets.&nbsp; No problems appear to be plaguing them.</P>
<P>3. High level beastlords have large pets that can only be shrunk once and are STILL too large.</P>
<P><BR>Where is the difficulty here?&nbsp; Brenlo stated that shrinking warders more than once would re-introduce another problem.&nbsp; What problem is that?&nbsp; The only problem I ever encountered with warders was a pathing issue that resulted only when the warder tried to walk up stairs when max shrunk, or over an object that was taller than my warder.&nbsp; To that I must say, big deal.&nbsp; In the 3 zones in the entire game where that's an issue I'll just use Summon Companion or unsuspend my pet when I get around the annoying parts.</P>
<P>Further, why are the croc warders still tiny?&nbsp; Why are the other warder types that grow up into huge warders STILL tiny&nbsp;at low levels?&nbsp; Shouldn't they also have been increased in size to avoid whatever problem supposedly exists for double/triple shrunk warders?</P>
