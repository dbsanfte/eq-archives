&lt;P&gt;Never heard of it.&amp;nbsp; Doesn't really surprise me unless the 1st season is already out on DVD.&amp;nbsp; I choose not to get AFN (Armed Forces Network, the only American programing available in Germany) due to the lack of commercials (programing is provided for free by the major networks as long as there are no commercials).&amp;nbsp; To fill the place of commercial breaks, there is all kind "useful information" that I find quite boring.&amp;nbsp; I just watch the German programs.&amp;nbsp; They may be a little behind what is currently on stateside, but I can deal with that and the translations are usually pretty good with good voice comparisons as well.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Anyway, how do you lose a room?&amp;nbsp; :smileytongue:&amp;nbsp; And can they make a whole season of trying to find this one room?&amp;nbsp; I think that would take as long as one commercial break&amp;nbsp; :smileyvery-happy:&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>The Lost Room is a 3 episode Miniseries on Sci Fi (and Space in Canada, surprisingly they are showing them concurrently). And it's been very intriguing so far. I'm glad they're keeping the 3 eps back to back to back. Been watching it the past two nights and loving it; a very intriguing situation, and the objects and their abilities are just very puzzling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Plus I like the fact that it seems more intelligent than standard TV tends to be. There have been relatively few "WTH did you do THAT?!?" moments; and the Main Character seems smart but not super smart and has a lot of ingenuity. (He came up with a very workable and plausible solution to get the item out of the safe before I even thought about it, and his solution didn't come out of no where, it had been properly foreshadowed.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I do hope they keep it as just a 3 ep miniseries and don't try to spin it out into a full series. Though it has the potential to keep going, I'm not sure it has the legs to go a full season. The pace it's going at now has been quick but felt appropriate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(The polaroid window to the past was a neat item too for that matter, and I'm wondering what the fish's power is. :) )&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now the big question tonite will be who the key item is. In my IRC chat channel someone suspected that the key is someone we've seen before, which seems plausible. Not sure who it would be though.</description>

      <description>I was looking for a list of the items and their powers, but I can't find one. Here's what I remember:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Key - turns any doorway into room entrance/exit&lt;br&gt;Comb - stops time for  a few seconds&lt;br&gt;Glasses - inhibits combustion&lt;br&gt;Ticket - sends people to the town with the motel&lt;br&gt;Cards - makes people crazy (for a while)?&lt;br&gt;Clock - ?&lt;br&gt;Shoelace - ?&lt;br&gt;...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;...and they're all indestructable, and none of them work in the room.</description>
