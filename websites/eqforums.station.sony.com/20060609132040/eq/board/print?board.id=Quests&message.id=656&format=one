<P>I saw Ashlanne's recent <A href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Quests&amp;message.id=652" target=_blank>Quest issue list </A>post and noticed the list of broken tasks.&nbsp; I realized I hadn't addressed or updated everyone on all of the fixes and findings regarding these, so here goes.</P>
<P>
<HR>

<P></P>
<P>The following tasks are believed broken. Please see the seperate Broken Tasks forum for details. (Some might be fixed now, but it doesn't say so!)</P>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Lost in Petrification </STRONG>- Kill 10 sathirian protectors in DL.&nbsp; No such mob exists. </LI></UL>
<P>
<HR>

<P>This may have been fixed before I had a chance to look at it.&nbsp; When I checked on this task the only kill requirements I found were killing 10 petrifier cockatrices and killing 10 stonegazer cockatrices.&nbsp; If anyone runs into this issue again or if they currently have a task with this issue, please let us know.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>

<LI><STRONG>Whirling Dervish</STRONG>, a short task.&nbsp;- Explore the iksar tower on the north-east island of Timorous Deep. Task does not update.&nbsp; 
<HR>
</LI>
<P>I just attempted this task on a live server today and it updated correctly for me.&nbsp; Is this still an issue?&nbsp; If so, can you give me the /loc that you are at when you are expecting the task to update?</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>

<LI><STRONG>Wooly Adventures </STRONG>- There is no blue compass line directing you to Droganoth Hrothgar in Everfrost Peaks. 
<HR>
</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This was another task I ran through on a live server and the blue line appeared on my compass after I had completed the first two sections of the task.&nbsp; Is anyone still having this problem?</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>

<LI><STRONG>Scary Caves&nbsp;from Dreadlands </STRONG>- It says to explore the courtyard on the left just inside the castle. But it doesn't trigger unless you go to the courtyard on the right just inside the castle.&nbsp; 
<HR>
</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr **SMURF**"MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P>This has been corrected on Test and now reads, "explore the courtyard on the right just inside the castle."&nbsp; This should be fixed on live servers with the next update.<BR></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>

<LI><STRONG>Keeping Order </STRONG>- Exploring the entrance of the cave in Firiona Vie that leads to the dreadlands doesn't update the task. 
<HR>
</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr **SMURF**"MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P>This task and all others involving exploring sections of Firiona Vie should be working correctly.&nbsp; The fix I mentioned earlier about those tasks not updating was included in the previous update.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>

<LI><STRONG>Keeping The Goblins Out from Lavastorm </STRONG>- The task does not update when you loot&nbsp;Cinder Goblin Toes. 
<HR>
</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr **SMURF**"MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P>As Gordish mentioned this task is now updating properly, but I will look into the issue brought up about it's completion text.<BR></P>
<P>
<HR>

<P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI><STRONG>Drolvargs and Drachnids </STRONG>- Exploring the ruins in the center of the forest of the firiona vie zone doesn't update the task. 
<HR>
</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<DIV>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr>
<P>As with the Keeping Order task this task should be working correctly now as well.</P>
<P>Since it didn't get included in Ashlanne's post I also wanted to mention that the Nok, Nok Who's Powder task was also fixed.&nbsp; </P>
<P>If any of these tasks are still having trouble or if there are new issues you come across, please continue to let us know.</P>
<P><STRONG></STRONG>&nbsp;</P></BLOCKQUOTE></DIV>
