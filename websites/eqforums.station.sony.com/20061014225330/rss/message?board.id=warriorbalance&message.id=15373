    <description>&lt;div&gt;Since the couple other long threads at the top of this forum have regressed to the point no one wants to actually &amp;quot;discuss&amp;quot; anything in lieu of insults, hyperbole, and gross generalizations, I thought I'd start a new thread.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;-----------&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;A) TANKING&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;a) 1h/shield - Obviously a big issue with many warriors, so let's start here.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;What are the perceived problems that have been raised?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;1) Maintaining aggro&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;2) DPS loss&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;3) Loss in &amp;quot;tanking&amp;quot; advantage over knights who are using 1h/shield because points 1 and 2 make 1h/shield an unviable day to day solution&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So my question here is, what do warriors envision a *feasible* solution is (use your opinion on what feasible means I guess, even though we all know there are knights and warriors that are completely ridiculous in their requests and expectations)?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;What is an acceptable dps loss from dual wield and 2h fighting to use a 1h/shield set up?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;What is needed in order to allow aggro to be maintained day to day in the 1h/shield set up? A feasibility caveat here would have to be something that didn't trivialize aggro in other set ups such that tank switching becomes super easy on raids, as apparently SoE finds a need to give warriors less than stellar aggro as some sort of raid strategy or some junk.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;What is an acceptable gap in tanking ability between warriors and knights? And don't through out some junk number, I want to know in given situations, because different situations are different.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;For example, if the dps taken difference is due to better warrior MITIGATION then the higher the gear level (i.e. ac) then the % advantage will get lower and lower the better your gear or the weaker the mob.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;When offering solutions (better itemization for warrior specific gear? better return on raw ac? higher skill caps (presumably possible in code now)) think about the effect on differing levels of play. Talking about what the difference is right now between different levels of play is good too, because maybe its ok if something disproportionately helps one end of the scale.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;b) Endurance Regen&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Not much to say about this, its insane they they haven't done anything about this, as there are a ton of things they could do to fix this &amp;quot;problem&amp;quot; in a matter of days, which begs the question of whether the devs simply do not want warriors to have good aggro control.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;B) DPS&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;1) Dual wield weapon ratios haven't scaled as well as 2h ratios for warriors&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;2) General dps advantage relative to knights has degraded as a consequence of this and itemization (warriors mainhanding bbob you're going to have to expect the dps gap to be degraded when knights are upgrading)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;3) Paladin Vanquish Undead aa gives them unfair dps advantage against undead&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I'm a paladin, let me say that these are things I've seen raised in a level-headed (sometimes) fashion on these boards and by people I know. Obviously, I love vanquish and don't see a problem with it, *many* warriors do. I am not a fan of addition by subtraction when it comes to a game like this, in most cases I'd prefer to give other classes something to compensate (wouldn't hurt my feelings to give warriors an aa ability that gave them &amp;quot;slays&amp;quot; versus some other type of mob). My opinion on that issue out in the open.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;---------------------------&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Look, it is apparent to any reasonable person that warriors are supposed to take less dps than knights and are supposed to do more melee dps. But, there is a lot of room for *reasoned* discussion on the particulars and where those gaps should be.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So it would be nice to do without the flames, and get some concrete opinions on what these gaps *should* be and where they currently are, and how changes could be implemented to accomplish going from where they are to where they should be. I know there are issues I missed, so bring them up to. I'm absolutely sick of all the ranting and whining and hyperbole going on in this forum (and anywhere else knight/warrior issues come up), so it would be real nice if this didn't regress either. It is hard to lock on to what warriors &amp;quot;need&amp;quot; when the vast majority of posts are by a handful of people that spend an inordinate amount of those posts complaining in generalized terms.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;Since the couple other long threads at the top of this forum have regressed to the point no one wants to actually "discuss" anything in lieu of insults, hyperbole, and gross generalizations, I thought I'd start a new thread.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;-----------&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;A) TANKING&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;a) 1h/shield - Obviously a big issue with many warriors, so let's start here.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;What are the perceived problems that have been raised?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;1) Maintaining aggro&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;2) DPS loss&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;3) Loss in "tanking" advantage over knights who are using 1h/shield because points 1 and 2 make 1h/shield an unviable day to day solution&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So my question here is, what do warriors envision a *feasible* solution is (use your opinion on what feasible means I guess, even though we all know there are knights and warriors that are completely ridiculous in their requests and expectations)?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;What is an acceptable dps loss from dual wield and 2h fighting to use a 1h/shield set up?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;What is needed in order to allow aggro to be maintained day to day in the 1h/shield set up? A feasibility caveat here would have to be something that didn't trivialize aggro in other set ups such that tank switching becomes super easy on raids, as apparently SoE finds a need to give warriors less than stellar aggro as some sort of raid strategy or some junk.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;What is an acceptable gap in tanking ability between warriors and knights? And don't through out some junk number, I want to know in given situations, because different situations are different.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;For example, if the dps taken difference is due to better warrior MITIGATION then the higher the gear level (i.e. ac) then the % advantage will get lower and lower the better your gear or the weaker the mob.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;When offering solutions (better itemization for warrior specific gear? better return on raw ac? higher skill caps (presumably possible in code now)) think about the effect on differing levels of play. Talking about what the difference is right now between different levels of play is good too, because maybe its ok if something disproportionately helps one end of the scale.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;b) Endurance Regen&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Not much to say about this, its insane they they haven't done anything about this, as there are a ton of things they could do to fix this "problem" in a matter of days, which begs the question of whether the devs simply do not want warriors to have good aggro control.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;B) DPS&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;1) Dual wield weapon ratios haven't scaled as well as 2h ratios for warriors&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;2) General dps advantage relative to knights has degraded as a consequence of this and itemization (warriors mainhanding bbob you're going to have to expect the dps gap to be degraded when knights are upgrading)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;3) Paladin Vanquish Undead aa gives them unfair dps advantage against undead&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;U&gt;A. 1. Tanking - Maintaining aggro, loss of dps, 1h/shield tanking....&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Ok. Warriors taunts are timed like 1 minute between. Paladins use a stun which virtually recycle immediately. Warriors Endurance regens very slowly. Mana items are plentiful which increase mana regen. So basiclally Paladins ability to generate high speed long term taunting is unlimited. Shadow Knight us mana too, so same thing. And they get the same level basic taunt as warriors. Warriors have had the discipline taunts added but not a real improvement because we are severaly limited by endurance.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Ever notice that there doesn't seem to be any mobs in Norath that don't resist the stunning portion of our taunts? PTA, COC even anger/eb procs. I have never seen any mob not resist this. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Loss of DPS? - The biggest problem for warriors is that we get an upgrade to our primary weapon every 4 or 5 expansions. I'm still using BoBB and I'm kill Mayong weekly and am in Deathknell. Why? Becase every expansion since Velious SOE has created class specific weapons for knights. The alternative weapons are kind of suck in my opinion.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Have you also noticed there's a whole lot more Undead stuff in the game now? Basically they are tailoring the game for knights. Granted live or undead warrior dps remains the same. So do our weapons. They seldom change.&amp;nbsp;It would have been great for our epics to be something more usefull then a permanent off hand weapon. But SOE chose to make our weapon useless. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Basically warriors in EQ are an after thought. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;1h/Shields - 1 suck alternatives for 1 hand weapons plus the shield's aggro proc doesn't work.&amp;nbsp; I seldom use a shield. There are very few mobs which warrant it's use. They need to consider putting in a double(triple) bash aaxp&amp;nbsp;like double riposte have a chance to swing more then one time. Fix the shield proc to actually generate aggro. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;The biggest thing to help warriors with aggro is getting the rest of the raid to practice raid skills 101 and control their own aggro. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;U&gt;Endurance Regen&lt;/U&gt; - i've talked about this. I click off SA 100 times an hour. Seems like if it's going to always be a nuisance to me how about we give it an endurance regen component. Not going to happen becuase SOE will never do anything positive for warriors.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;U&gt;DPS -&lt;/U&gt; The game is being slanted toward knights in the way of weapons. Every expansion SOE pulls out at least 1 knight specific weapon per high end zone. Same with monks, beastlords, rogues and bards. All these classes get upgrades and improvements. Warriors get the choice of fighting over weapons which anybody can use. Well the anybody can use weapons are not replacements to class specific weapons. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;How about disciplines? &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I still use defensive and evasive. I haven't used anything else since they come up when I tank. I popped on Stonewall a few times but you see you get snared with that one. So backing up is impossible. The other problem with it is, if the npc casts a snare spell on you, the defensive effects are negated. You're left double snared, getting hit for full damage and losing endurance. But hey warriors don't fret, we'll give you a high end taunt which is actually a dot which uses 3 times the amount of endurance as a knight's mana using&amp;nbsp;stun spell uses. Well I hope not knight is actually stunning when a warrior is supposed to be on a named.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Don't you think in 15 levels+ warriors would be just about due for something kind of real upgrade? If we aren't going to get a new discipline then how about giving&amp;nbsp;warriorrs at least and AAXPs to increase their dps during using either and/or aaxps to increase their duration or mitigation? Maybe even aaxps to reduce the recycle time? Apparently Evasive and Defensive are our baseline tanking disciplines. Seems to me we should get better over time.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;How about more dps type skills? Or maybe aaxps to increase their duration?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffff00&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Well anyway, it is pointless to say anything in a thread that's 10+ pages long.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffff00&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&amp;nbsp;Even more pointless to say anything to SOE about doing something to improve warriors.&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffff00&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&amp;nbsp;Even more pointless to say anything to SOE about doing something to improve warriors.&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;There are a few things that you did overlook a bit in why things are the way they are.&amp;nbsp; You brought up bards and rogues as sharing weapons that are BRD/ROG only.&amp;nbsp; This is rather common in a lot of things with those two.&amp;nbsp; They share gear that is similarily bard/rogue, as well as weaponry.&amp;nbsp; Granted the game has moved a bit away from the shared gear, but the weapons remain the same.&amp;nbsp; This is also very similar with H2H and Blunt weapons for monks and beastlords.&amp;nbsp; They share a very similar weapon set and gear set... shouldn't be a surprise.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The one point that I will say that you have a point on is that Warriors generally do not get their own class only type weapon lately.&amp;nbsp; This, however, as posted by a dev, is backlash of the added utility you guys recieved in the Bazu line of agro generation.&amp;nbsp; Do I see this as right?&amp;nbsp; No.&amp;nbsp; Warriors deserve their own class weapons similar to everyone else, but the down side is that they will end up very similar in ratio to other 1h weapons you already weild.&amp;nbsp; One thing no warrior seems to notice is that knights take a huge hit to dps switching to 1handers over adequate, similar level 2handers.&amp;nbsp; There is an astronomical difference between the dps our 1.5 does and Hopebringer.&amp;nbsp; There is a huge difference between our 2.0 and Blade of Forgotten Faith.&amp;nbsp; This is due in a large part to the fact that our AAs are geared to two hander use and they do not work on one hand weapons at all.&amp;nbsp; Though for 1handers they look like they have stellar and insane ratios... those ratios don't equate to much in a Knight's hands.&amp;nbsp; Then again... where are the complaints that casters have 24/24 ratio weapons with 854 dd procs that are purchasable in the bazaar or easily obtained?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I play a 70/1k+ Paladin.&amp;nbsp; I do ask this... where is all of this magical undead you speak of?&amp;nbsp; Let's see here, at lvl 70, if I want to exp off of undead I have the choice of 70.X missions, a few other random missions, and Ruins of Illsalin.&amp;nbsp; In prophecy, there is the Arcstone dead, which are pointless for me to hunt with a group as they are solo material thus a waste of time for me to group for.&amp;nbsp; I saw some undead in devastation.. but in trying to exp there, it is not even close to a fun place to hunt.&amp;nbsp; One too many times have my groups been clipped by a roaming army.&amp;nbsp; If the undead take over Rage, thats another zone.&amp;nbsp; However, I have seen that scenario once since PoR has been live.&amp;nbsp; There are undead in ToB also, but it's an insane place to exp and the rewards just are not worth it in the end.&amp;nbsp; Yes, there is a decent amount of undead, but it tailors to clerics and necros as well.&amp;nbsp; Never mind that clerics do have an AA DoT that can do 32k damage.&amp;nbsp; Oh yeah, and having a zone of pure undead makes it a viable place for a necro to be group friendly if slowers aren't too available, along with having mezzes and other nice tools for undead.&amp;nbsp; But yes, once again, let's focus on the fact that Paladin utility is the only thing worth mentioning in the same breath as undead.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;One last thing to add to this... how many groups do you actually see in Illsalin exping on a day to day basis?&amp;nbsp; One, maybe?&amp;nbsp; Ironic.. for as powerful as VU3 is touted to be... how come no one is taking Paladins there in droves and exploiting it?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I agree full well that warriors need a boost, that endurance needs to be unbroken.&amp;nbsp; However, you also made a comment in the cost differences... let me ask this, What does your melee agro cost you?&amp;nbsp; Nothing.&amp;nbsp; Do you realize that Paladins chain stunning costs roughly the same throughout a fight as bazu?&amp;nbsp; Generally the result is the same, some dumb DPS class will inevitably steal agro.&amp;nbsp; This happens to Knights and Warriors alike.&amp;nbsp; While I agree that endurance needs endurance regen similar to mana regen, the funny part is that once again, we have another Warrior wanting to have the exact same things as casters, only with a yellow bar instead of blue.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;When you state Resist, do you mean Resist or Immune?&amp;nbsp; There are tons of mobs in the high end exp game that are even immune to Paladin stuns.&amp;nbsp; There are few they take hold on, and as you mentioned undead earlier... all undead in DoD and PoR are unstunable no matter what level they are.&amp;nbsp; Even so, if it's resisted or immune, it matters not as they still generate agro just the same.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;As for Defensive/Evasive... They have been upgraded, but you know... if they were not as powerful as they were when they came out... don't you think they would have been made more powerful yet?&amp;nbsp; Somehow Defensive seems far more powerful now days than it did versus Nagafen... I wonder why that is.&amp;nbsp; You got new lines added... rampage and ae taunt and incite/bazu line.&amp;nbsp; They haven't upgraded Evasive or Defensive... they haven't upgraded CH either and that's been around longer than defensive.&amp;nbsp; Is there any sense in that either?&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Then use a shield BB, tell your comrades to learn better agro controle. It isn't difficult. Get your ac higher and you'll tank better, that isn't hard to figure either. Has nothing to do with spells, my lifetaps are useless against something that can one round me. Time&amp;nbsp;I finish casting I'm at my bind point. The biggest thing is that my health isn't spiky against yard trash or xp mobs anymore, wich makes sense considering I'm a primary tank class and I have maxed defensive aa's, plus decent gear.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Frodlin, the only part you complained about was the joke. I don't see you haveing any difficlty doing anything on the high end of the game, you have over 20k hps yes? Obviously EQ hasn't treated you that poorly. Just because high end knights can't tank easy groupale xp mobs doesn't mean a hill of beans because your both over geared for the content anyway.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Heimdall: Technically knights have melee skills very close to warriors because as unholy, holy warriors, they don't actually need to learn spells at all. They pray to thier god and he GRANTS them spells. I didn't find some obscure tome or somethign&amp;nbsp;I just said "hey Inny, I did some hateful things here and here and over here...what say a refill huh?" to wich Inny says "Good work you wretched follower, here's some more spells and magic to spread my word" ( evil laugh is optional).&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;BB, in todays game almost all of my side abilites are useless, I seldom pull because A) I don't like pulling singles and B) so many other people pull better than I do. Fear doesn't work, snare doesn't work very well anymore either and you can stop runners too. I have not summoned a corpse in 2 years, been in a raid guild for 16 months and not once have&amp;nbsp;I summoned anybody's corpse. My mana taps only work so well because several criters actually resist it, meaning it doesn't do anything.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;FD is difficult to use in a pulling situation because so many casters just keep casting, they don't care if you are off their target they just keep fireing away, breaking your FD and you have to start over, too bad that while&amp;nbsp;your casting FD the mob has started casting again.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;My real power is agro control and tanking. The other intersting thing is that you mention how sk's have been soloing old raid mobs FOR YEARS. That alone should tell you where the developers stand compared to your theory. Not only are they at odds with your definition but apparently have been FOR YEARS.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;Yes BB, I do have decent raid gear that warriors tanked to get me.

      <description>&lt;font color="#6666ff"&gt;ok there's no need to go completely BB about sk abilities either, i'll just go and clarify the way i see it&amp;nbsp; ;P&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;hr&gt;Sharbreena wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&#xD;

other people pull better than I do.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#6666ff"&gt;not wanting to pull isn't a class problem.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
the main reason a lot fo SK's dont often pull is because most content&#xD;
doesnt need it, there are many places that groups can XP while having a&#xD;
warrior pull.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
but yes there are 4 classes who can pull better thenSK's can in most situations.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Fear doesn't work,&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#6666ff"&gt;well, technically i suppose it works, but your pretty much right, its useless at level 70 ;)&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
there is no reason for a lvl 70 sk to get the lvl 66 and 67 fear spells.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;snare doesn't work very well anymore either and you can stop runners too. &lt;br&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#6666ff"&gt;snare works just fine except for the resist rate because ew're using using the snare we got at lvl 61 in PoP.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;p&gt;I have not summoned a corpse in 2 years, been in a raid guild for 16 months and not once have&amp;nbsp;I summoned anybody's corpse. &lt;br&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#6666ff"&gt;SC has been pointless except on 1 raid that&#xD;
i know of [xegony] since the lobby summon system came in, its faster to&#xD;
lobby sumon, med int he guild hall pond and run back with all your gear&#xD;
on then trying to summon corpse.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;p&gt;My mana taps only work so well because several criters actually resist it, meaning it doesn't do anything.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#6666ff"&gt;only disease immune mobs, like AMV, resist bites, they have a -500 disease check.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
bards and necro's are still better at giving mana to multiple people over and above regular buffs.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#6666ff"&gt;while its true that it can be a problem with&#xD;
caster mobs, and the AA we get to fix that doesnt actually do anything&#xD;
useful, FD is still quite useful, but not for tanking.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;My real power is agro control and tanking. &lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#6666ff"&gt;dread gaze is also our unigue ability,&#xD;
though cyclone is certainly good enough for warriors when the damage&#xD;
wont be a problem. [like kiting the mort delt adds in tacvi, i used to&#xD;
do that but we discovered its actually easier to have a warrior do it&#xD;
since they can instantly agro and not have to stand around for 1.5&#xD;
seconds trying to cast.]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;p&gt;The other intersting thing is that you mention how sk's have been&#xD;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;font color="#6666ff"&gt;the problem is not what the devs think, the&#xD;
devs dont care what BB says, the problem really is that other players&#xD;
start thinking what BB .etc says is actually true, when 99% of it is&#xD;
just made up/overblown.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
then they get annoyed when "SOE doesnt fix it" and quit playing, or worse, roll a sk.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
particularly for players who are somewhat new to the game, most of the&#xD;
people who have been around a while already know who your talking about&#xD;

Exactly the same as SKs aren't balanced assuming they're casting lifetaps every so blah blah often.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Say the best aug'd shield in the game now gives the equivalent of 750 ac on other gear... does having that much ac make a tank take 15% less dps.... no it doesnt lol. &lt;br&gt;SK (look at our class board) are the biggest proponents of ac &amp;gt; all in the game atm and even the biggest ac fans of them don't think it does anything like this (the talk is of a couple % dps tops going from 3000 to 4000ac)... so is it somehow different for warriors?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shield block is a seperate issue, it won't scale with shield ac mudflation so we can omit this for discussion atm.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Naubi on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;06-29-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;12:00 PM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

You honestly can't distinguish between fact and fiction making them the same to you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warriors are disadvantaged since in their raid role they MUST have as high of a maximum HP buffer as possible while maintaning acceptable AC.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Knight are ADVANTAGED since they can &lt;u&gt;replenish&lt;/u&gt; their HP's at a prodigious rate using combat self-healing so powerful it allows you to solo Vindi (for example) while Warirors can not.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If our DPS+Mitigation + Avoidance + defensive spells/disciplines/clickies/abilites were equal Knights would not enjoy such a &lt;u&gt;huge&lt;/u&gt; advantange where as with all things related to tanking superiority and heavy DPS (excepting vs undead) the advantage SHOULD be in favor of Warriors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If shields were such a little matter of no consequence, your &lt;u&gt;dishonest switching of position&lt;/u&gt; between innate Warrior DPS/aggro improvements when using a shield vs SoE as was done for Knights having shield appropriate weapons for Warirors would not have occured - nor would your at odds with the facts post above.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh, and virtually every Warrior in the game KNOWS why we rolled our class - it was for the tanking superiority a pure archetype class was promised, had for a very long time, and should have. They see things done to change this and they don't care what BB says, they care about setting the game arright.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We didn't roll Beserkers or ANY form of hybrid with intended lesser tanking in exchange for outside of tank archetype abilities.

our passive tanking ability, and against mobs that do pisspot dps, it&#xD;
can make us seem overpowered. However, anyone who knows anything about&#xD;
defensive procs realizes that getting hit 6 times for 200 damage each,&#xD;
and getting hit once for 1200 damage, are going to do VASTLY different&#xD;
things. And guess what? Today's group mobs favor the 1200 hits model.&#xD;
So yeah, crap argument. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;If our DPS+Mitigation + Avoidance + defensive spells/disciplines/clickies/abilites were equal Knights would not enjoy such a &lt;u&gt;huge&lt;/u&gt;&#xD;
advantange where as with all things related to tanking superiority and&#xD;
heavy DPS (excepting vs undead) the advantage SHOULD be in favor of&#xD;
Warriors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;If shields were such a little matter of no consequence, your &lt;u&gt;dishonest switching of position&lt;/u&gt;&#xD;
between innate Warrior DPS/aggro improvements when using a shield vs&#xD;
SoE as was done for Knights having shield appropriate weapons for&#xD;
Warirors would not have occured - nor would your at odds with the facts&#xD;
post above.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Can't speak for other knights, but I use shields for 3 things.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&amp;nbsp;1) Stroking my magelo e-peen&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&amp;nbsp;2) Staying alive on raids for 30 seconds longer after the warriors go down&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&amp;nbsp;3) Blade of Forgotten Faith procs on raid mobs with AE's&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
That's all. In groups, I'm not willing to have my mediocre dps become pathetic dps by switching to a shield.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;Oh, and virtually every Warrior in the game KNOWS why we rolled our&#xD;
class - it was for the tanking superiority a pure archetype class was&#xD;
promised, had for a very long time, and should have. They see things&#xD;
done to change this and they don't care what BB says, they care about&#xD;
setting the game arright.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We didn't roll Beserkers or ANY form&#xD;
of hybrid with intended lesser tanking in exchange for outside of tank&#xD;
archetype abilities. Not one Warrior EVER has posted give us Tank&#xD;
Parity(and Spellbook Parity) and we CERTAINLY will not accept Tank&#xD;
Parity(and Knight Spellbook Superiority).&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Battleblade-Xegony on &lt;span class="date_text"&gt;06-29-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="time_text"&gt;05:59 AM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Golgolath on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;06-29-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;08:11 AM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Funny how you mention that Sharbreena...&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Yes BB, I do have decent raid gear that warriors tanked to get me. That's what cannon fodder does, serve the Nobility.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;You claim to be an avid follower of D&amp;amp;D, must I remind you who became both Nobility AND Royalty in D&amp;amp;D?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; It certainly wasn't Paladins or Anti-Paladins.... was fighters who got to the top, grunts, cannon fodder... actually if you even knew what cannon fodder was, you wouldn't even be using the term to apply to someone on your own team.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;In EQ, with no land owners, "Nobility" is nothing more than a title that Knights like to bestow upon themselves to make themselves feel superior without having to do anything in the case of Paladins... in the case of Dark Elf Shadowknights, it's a way for the Necromancers, led by Xon Quexil to make you think you're more important than you actually are.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Step into the Lodge of the dead... it takes one look around to tell who's the man in charge, and he ain't no "Nobility"&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;You can group with who ever you want BB, that is your right. Just like&amp;nbsp;I can group with who ever&amp;nbsp;I want. Proper balance would mean niether of us would need the other to do anything group wise. You won't fail if you don't have me along and I won't fail if&amp;nbsp;I don't have you along, provided the group knows what they are doing of course.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;"Proper balance would mean..."&lt;br&gt;Proper balance means like Rangers, the two other warrior hybrid classes lose tanking capability in exchange for the outside of the tank archtype capabilities they CHOSE rather than the pure archetype tanking superiority Warriors are entitled to.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"...I won't fail if&amp;nbsp;I don't have you along..."&lt;br&gt;Actually Sharbreena the majority of the gear you have on your character would not be there without Warriors and that tanking superiority we are entitled to. Although you are still invited to pull for my group, just as your brother warrior hybrid, Rangers, are welcome to DPS.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Battleblade-Xegony on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;06-27-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;09:15 PM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;I do actually think they "deserve" it. Though more in a contextual manner, knights sold out to get greater power afterall.&amp;nbsp;The game lacks the actual mechanics to demonstrate the price that would have. So we have problems implamenting balance, since some classes are actually trying to be "unbalanced" to begin with.</description>

&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;To get those spell casting abilities, you sold out on some of your melee training.&amp;nbsp; Your melee skills should be far enough behind for warriors to be able to just barely out tank you after you bring those spell skills into play.&amp;nbsp; But they don't.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;Clearly the actions of the devs over the last few expansions mean basically that the only people who have any real power over the tanking equation regardless of all the blowhard posts on this message board don't agree with your vision Frodlin. The 3 tanking classes are reasonable balanced. Otherwise we'd see changes.</description>

      <description>And keep firmly in mind that "re-envisionment" is NOT a fixed goal/there we did it and we're done proposition. It's ongoing and always will be.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SoE would have to be blind not to see how well assemetrical balance works in WoW and how badly Tank Parity (and Knight Spellbook Superiority) has worked in EQ. They broke faith with players taht chose classes based on their representations. And for what? 1/10th of the player base of the #1 MMoRPG?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh, I'm absolutely fine with Knights tanking like Warriors. SoE can begin converting you to Warriors tonight afaic. Heck they can convert Rangers too so all three warrior hybrid part tanks can shrug off the outside of the tanking achetype capabilities they didn't after all want and be a Warrior.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The last time the tanking balance was OK was in GoD prior to the adjustment. Knight needing those one-time to suceed flags got them - each and every last one of them. Was the Wariror Central Defining Ability important in the group game? You bet. Do Paladins Cleance in the group game? Res, heal, buff? Do SK's summon pets, corpses, HT, FD/Pet pull?? You bet they do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There was exactly one class cheated and two that urged SoE to cheat them. Two that pressed the button that said make us PART warriors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No, I've yet to have a Druid or Shaman be MH for any group I'm in and I never will.&amp;nbsp; They too pressed versatile class buttons and are no more entitled to heal like the Prime Healer than you are to tank like the Primary Tank.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Spellbook equals power Frodlin, you said it yourself, the true POWER of the spell book. That's what magic is all about, power. Knights didn't sell thier soul to be less than, but to be greater than. Now I realize the roleplay aspect of power seeking sk's&amp;nbsp;poses difficulty for the game play aspect. But lets not mince words here, no knight, particularly the sk's, "created" their character to be some half and half twit. They did it for power.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The main problem is how to you balance a powermad class that uses magic to cheat against a regular Joe class that is, well..... a regular Joe. Sk's are warriorss that can wield melee weapons with skill and use magic to harness power that a normal person probably shouldn't ever wield. It could be argued that magic users in general all seek this.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I also mentioned in a different post that trying to balance a&amp;nbsp; warrior,&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;more simple class.&amp;nbsp;Against a more complicated warrior/caster class ...particularly when it comes to how my aa stack compared to yours, is pretty much impossible. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Now perhaps some of your suggestions could balance the field more, more power to ya if they do in fact balance the differences between us with out the perverbial "nerf". I still say there will be more trouble ahead when I reach 75, because&amp;nbsp;I will have acess to even more powerful spells. While you will get a few more hps, maybe a couple discaplines.&amp;nbsp;The spells trump the hps, they do it so well that "Defensive" had to be invented to save a class that would be extict without it. We all know this. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Tell me,&amp;nbsp;with out defensive and mobs that required it, how many warriors would there be today? &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Power, it all comes down to power. Once knights, through gear, aa and spells reach a break point ( and we might be seeing it) They superceed most warriors in pretty much everything except a few rare cursed boss mobs that require "defensive". That's the golden crutch, your "magic" bullet. Cause we all know that equally geared progression wise, anything you can tank without defensive, I can tank. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</description>
