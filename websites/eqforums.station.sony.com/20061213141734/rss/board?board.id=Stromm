      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Stromm&amp;message.id=759#M759</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;This is to let stormm know, a guild that has been around for many years has merged. Mythic heroes has merged with Harbringers of lost souls to form Heroes of lost souls. I doubt that Mythic heroes will be quickly forgotten since at its peak it had other 500 members.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <title>Guild Looking for Members (This may be for you)</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Stromm&amp;message.id=753#M753</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Band of Sands, BoS, is looking for members all races, all sizes, all class, all levels yes any and all are welcome with us. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Our current membership stands at 131 toons with pretty much all level ranges. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;We are a very casual guild, meaning you do what you want. &lt;FONT size=2&gt;This guild will always be a casual guild, meaning you do what you want. You're not required to raid, you're not required to solo and your not required to participate in anything you do not wish too. That also means that you can raid, you can solo, you can do what you want and I encourage all members to feel free to ask for help or organize for them self anything they want to do.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;We look for nice fun people no stress. We want to make freinds and help each other&amp;nbsp;when we can.&amp;nbsp;The leader and&amp;nbsp;his wife are on almost every single day, officers are almost always around. We tend to have a more adult membership, meaning,&amp;nbsp;most members are from 20 to 50 years old, several couples always fun to group with, members actual locations span from&amp;nbsp;USA coast to coast all the way into Canada and heck we just LOVE the game. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;We would really like to boost our active member base to allow us the options of help others with epics and the like. Come join us at Band of Sands and make some new freinds. If interested just ask any memeber for an officer and they will gladly find someone to help you out and welcome you to your family. Thanks and stay safe out there.&amp;nbsp; &lt;A href="http://www.xdude.com/bandofsands/index.php" target=_blank&gt;http://www.xdude.com/bandofsands/index.php&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I'm really enjoying the new expansion.&amp;nbsp; I am really trying to stay completely within its content and see if it works as advertised and was wondering if there are enough other players out there that would be interested in starting a guild dedicated to doing this and only leaving for things like epics, (if we need them...who knows?), and certain other things , like tradeskill items for instance,&amp;nbsp;that don't drop in the expansion.&amp;nbsp; Just an idea.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Stromm&amp;message.id=748#M748</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I would like to participate in any old world open raids people might be conducting (shaman of only level 52 right now). It would also be nice to get in on an open raid in Fear, as I am in need of a Child's Tear for my epic. My guild tried it recently without success, and I don't know when we might get around to giving it another go.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>Looking for a late night family</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Stromm&amp;message.id=746#M746</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I am looking for a guild that operates late at night (midnight in california or 6pm in Australia). I work the swing shift at work and cant get online before midnight. This makes it very difficult to do anything with normal guilds who have many of their events during the evening, and the only thing left when i log in are a bunch of AFK statues in the guild&amp;nbsp;hall and/or bazaar mules. If your guild has something more compatible with my schedule, please let me know. I dont care about which server it is on, I can always make a character there, and probably it would be my main since it would see the most playing. I have been playing EQ for 2 years now and I have a level 70 necro on Stromm, so Im not a newbie, but I do have alot of catching up to do, and learning of the higher content. Anyway, please send an email to &lt;A href="mailto:flit_tastic@yahoo.com" target=_blank&gt;flit_tastic@yahoo.com&lt;/A&gt; and let me know if you think I may be a good fit.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Thank you&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If there is a guild out there who does LDoNs and groups together alot...I would be more than interested in joining your august ranks.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

We currently need talented people who are looking to progress through the Planes of Power progression. We will work as a guild to improve our raiding skills and gear to further our progression. We have a Ventrillo voice server and a dedicated management team in place to make sure the guild is moving the the right direction. We just need soldiers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We also allow guests to come on our raids, provided they have registered to come on our website at http://riseoftheungulates.guildportal.com/&amp;nbsp; Guests receive 4/5ths the DKP of a full member but may bid and beat members, provided they have more DKP. Please stop by and check out calendar to see if we are having any convenient raiding days scheduled for you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Dawn of  New Era Recruitment</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Stromm&amp;message.id=728#M728</link>
      <description>Dawn of a New Era is a casual raiding guild that is currently raiding twice a week (Tuesdays and Fridays). Most of our players are in the central time zone. We are looking for new talent to fill our roster. You do not need any previous raiding experience to join us, you just have to be willing to learn. We have beating on Luclin endgame pinatas recently and are making them spill their loot all over. The guild is also going to move swiftly through Planes of Power (we have allready started early flagging for it) as soon as we are done plundering Vex Thal for all it is worth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dawn of a New Era is a DKP style guild that rewards the players that put in the most time at raids (it is really hard to fall behind much with our current 2 raids a week). We have a system in place to prevent inflation, where the all DKP spent at a raid is redistibuted back to the members who attended the raid.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are currently recruiting level 65+ players (though exceptional cases can be made). Please visit http://dawnofanewera.guildportal.com to apply, or feel free to contact: Lamdon, Aendail, Ishaca, Opaquely, Haneysma or Lefurjah in game for more questions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Stromm&amp;message.id=720#M720</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;Are there any guilds on Stromm that do a lot of day time (EST) grouping and/or raiding? I generally can play from about 9 or 10 AM EST until 4PM EST. My main is a level 68 Nec with about 200 aa's. I am looking for a guild where i can grow the toon, greatly improve his gear, and start doing DoDH spell missions, MPG trials etc. I have been playing for less than a year so it has taken me some time to elarn my class well, but I am ready and willing to learn the high end now if anyone can steer me somewhere that I can have the chance to do it.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Sarinth's Saturday Afternoon Raid ~ PoP Progression</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Stromm&amp;message.id=714#M714</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarinth's Saturday Aftternoon Raids - SSAR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Meeting Location:&lt;/b&gt; In Plane of Tranquility outside of the CoD caves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Target:&lt;/b&gt; To be announced. I will employ scouts to each zone to determine what is up, poll the raid @ 11:45 A.M. EST for needs, and decide upon that as well as other factors. Basically, any Pre-Elemental that is up has the chance to get smacked down.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Raid Start Time:&lt;/b&gt; We move out at 12:00 Noon EST / 9:00 A.M. PST. Please be at the Meeting Location 15 minutes prior to start time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Raid Leader:&lt;/b&gt; Sarinth - of course.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Back-up Raid Leader:&lt;/b&gt; To Be Announced.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Level Requirements:&lt;/b&gt; 55+&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Required Items/Abilities:&lt;/b&gt; Healing Spells/Potions, Shrink Spell/Device, Invisibility Spell/Device&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Main Raid Chat:&lt;/b&gt; /rs - Please keep /rs free of any chatter during the raid. Any chatter should be reserved for the General Chat Channel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;General Chat Channel:&lt;/b&gt; /join ssarbackflag&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Raid Channel for Healers:&lt;/b&gt; /join ssarheal&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Raid Channel for Tanks:&lt;/b&gt; /join ssartank&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Loot Rules:&lt;/b&gt; All loot is Need Before Greed. All NO DROP loot except EP'S &amp;amp; SP'S will be, /ran 1000 where it drops, one item per person per raid, unless not wanted by anyone else. Any EP'S or SP'S and other non-NO DROP Stat Items will be looted by the main looter and /ran 1000 after the raid. The one item per person per raid rule is still in effect. Which means, if you received a NO DROP item during the raid, you will not roll on any items after the raid unless no one else needs the drops.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sarinth's Expectations:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;LISTEN&lt;/b&gt; - Listening to directions coming from /rs is an integral part of a successful raid. Anyone found to be a habitual offender of this request, will have repercussions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;DO NOT SPEAK IN /RS&lt;/b&gt; - Ties in with the first one. If people are chatting in this channel, then it is much more difficult to pick out the needed instructions. Anyone found to be a habitual offender of this rule will have repercussions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;DO NOT ARGUE&lt;/b&gt; - Arguing with the Raid Leader, Back-Up Raid Leaders, or Designated Class Representatives in public forums (/rs, /ssarbackflag, etc.) will instantly get the boot, basically, send a tell. No if's and's or but's on this subject.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;SHRINK&lt;/b&gt; - Keep yourself maximum shrunk. Exceptions to this rule are the tanks so the raid &amp;amp; especially raid healers can have optimal visibility of the person they need to heal/assist/look after/etc.&lt;/div&gt;</description>
