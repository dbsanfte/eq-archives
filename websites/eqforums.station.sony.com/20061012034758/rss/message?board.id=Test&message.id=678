      <description>&lt;font color="#9966ff"&gt;Sorry for so many posts - I tried to post it all together and it told me 2k character limit so I divided it up trying to guess how much would fit.  If I had the ability to edit my posts I would condense it to less but I can't so there it is.  If a mod wants to cut and past into less posts that would be ok with me. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Discussion probably belongs in the other thread but I thought a posted log would be nice for those who wanted to be there but couldn't.  I cut out some /say but only if it wasn't related to topic and I cut out any /guild etc but I think everything that was said is there as it was said.  To save a little space I cut out the full date/time stamp and only left the time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
