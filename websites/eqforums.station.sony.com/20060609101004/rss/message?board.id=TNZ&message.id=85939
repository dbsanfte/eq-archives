    <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;gt;Onomatopoeia, your simplistic view of the situation isn't reality. The expansions, PoP and GoD,&amp;nbsp;were marketed towards more than the uber raiders--so we buy and notice that we need to play like an uber-raider to progress anywhere...and your solution is for everyone to just go back to Velious?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;In PoP you can get to everywhere except Sol Ro and the EPs with a single group via alt entry quests.&amp;nbsp; In the locked zones a guild that couldn't reach them couldn't kill any of the raid targets anyway.&amp;nbsp; There were 3 and 4 group instance raids in the tier 1 and 2 zones and small raid targets in BoT and Tactics.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;In GoD you can single group to KoD Taz and Yxxta, which have single group instance content with 160+hp/mana drops.&amp;nbsp; You can go no further though, but by then it has got really hard.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I suggested certain things in Velious as being suitable for a small, occasional raid force with limited time available.&amp;nbsp; My point is that there is content out there to suit all needs if you are prepared to look for it.&amp;nbsp; What is wrong with questing SS armour anyway?&amp;nbsp; My cleric got a new set of greaves on Saturday from HoT / SS and very pleased with them she is too.&amp;nbsp; 80hp/70 mana is not to be sneezed at by any means.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Original EQ - awesome, equal footing for adventure&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Kunark - Minor Keying, but overall equal footing&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Velious - Minor Keying and best expansion to date&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Luclin - Moderate Keying, aliens, transporters, the beginning of the downfall of EQ&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Planes of Power - Heavy flagging required, mass numbers and playtime required.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;LDoN - Work your ass off to get points to buy sub-par gear.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;See, my friends who play 20+ hours a day have been linking me what they have been getting in upper GoD zones, and Aug's those items are 300+ hp for 1 piece. For me to ever consider getting to GoD, I first need to get through Elementals and PoTime, then my guild can survive GoD, maybe. But to do all that, you have to be able to raid for months at 10+ hours a day.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Whoa....I understand accomplishment and all that. I understand working for what you get, hell I have been working for every little piece of gear for over four years--but the level of required people and time has become insane. Maybe that's why, on our server, 3 guilds are still the only ones in PoTime.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If all flagging was dropped tomorrow, we wouldn't be on equal footing with those who did go through all the flagging, but things wouldn't feel so cut off. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The gap between those who have and those who have-not has never been wider. I have a BST friend who is 12k raid buffed due to GoD gear. This...I won't even talk about the saturation of hp gear by SOE...but this is getting rediculous. Now, the only people who can get the new gear--are people who were able to get through PoTime....&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;...classic.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Solution? Drop flagging requirements for PoP and give guilds a fighting chance for advancement. This artificial cockblock method must really make upper tier guilds happy. Do something SoE, or do we all have to invest 16+ hours every day, with 70 man raids,&amp;nbsp;just to get somewhere?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Like pop flags or not...you have to admit that they cause a lot of conflict and hate in the game...just reading this thread proves that (its not a healthy discussion of opposing views, its plain arguing).&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Something that is so contentious ought to be reviewed by Sony...games that cease to be fun, cease to raise revenue.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;Bugger, I knew asking a qiz question would cause problems! :smileysurprised:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;They will need to tweak the non EP road to GoD I think. If everyone uses Luclin etc then they need to cut and randomise the pop times to avoid queues, SSra the new KC? They also need to upgrade many of the old world zones and make LDoN gear available for resale (for poits credit) back to the adventure merchants. It takes far too long to purchase anything considering no one buys mid level LDoN stuff. This make the rewards far too long in coming.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;The solution is not removing the flagging system but rather do away with the huge death penalties, removing the no drops making everything tradable, and making alternate ways for smaller groups to get flagged. If you own the expansions and have the appropriate level, you should be able to reap their rewards no matter what your playing style. SOE should make gear level appropriate but remove the no drop part. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;This is a very fun game to be involved in but many of these barriers need to be addressed by SOE.:smileywink:&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

It's already about twenty times easier to do *everything* in EQ now than it was before, with PoK, widespread 96% rezzes, and graveyards everywhere.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And all making everything tradable would do is encourage more bottomfeeding. Right now the only thing standing in the way of total economic collapse is the fact that most things in the medium and high end are no drop.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I can't help but say "Thank god people like you aren't in charge of the game", but it seems that even so the game just gets easier and duller as the powers that be bow to those who want everything, now, for no effort at all (that's you).</description>

      <description>For me and most my friends the problem isn't equipment envy.  The problem is that you need the equipment to make any reasonable use of the expansions.  Sony needs to make money on the expansions to keep the game alive and there is not enough content to make the expansions really worth while to folks like me. (I'm speaking of GoD and also from what I fear OOW will be).  I'd really like to have a refund on GoD.  So what the end up doing is putting in one or two nifty things and the regular folks cough up the bucks to pay for the expansion content for the upper tiered guilds. I don't want to do that any more.  The reasonable thing is to have most the content that almost anyone can enjoy and a few zones that upper levels only can enjoy as part of an expansion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I want to enjoy the journey.  I've lost the company of a lot of friends because I've refused to level madly through the game.  I want to go to new places and enjoy and learn them without having to wait for things to be green.  Or having to raid much (if at all). When you guys talk about working hard to get stuff.. it shouldn't BE work it should be fun.  I all the time hear about the drudgery of keying and back keying.  It shouldn't be drudgery it should be fun.  They need to find a way to make progression fun because the game, like life, isn't really about being there it's about getting there.  (I'm not saying everyone else should enjoy the game the same way I do only that this is the way I play it.)  To allow me to play the game the way I have enjoyed it up till now then say 'no! you must raid  now you must mindlessly work on keys now" is just rude.</description>

      <description>Don't snub gear just because it's from old expansions.  The game is designed in such a way that there's a reasonbly logical progression of gear.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Last night my guild was working on the Rathe encounter.  Being able to make a credible attempt at the encounter does in fact require a large number of people with a large number of flags with a large amount of good gear.  But do you know where we were 18 months ago?  NToV, gearing up. I suspect a few members still have some isolated items from ToV equipped.  I know for a fact at least 2 guilds coming up behind us spent their time in ToV as well.   It's still a completely valid starting point for a guild, and certainly not to be snubbed.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We more or less skipped Luclin outside of isolated targets (Grieg, the AR mobs, Burrower Beast, 1 THO kill (never again!), occasional SSRA targets). And for reasons I don't recall, pretty much everone got an emp key, so we did kill emp once or twice. We mostly skipped Luclin because 2 guilds had SSRA and VT locked down, and low-level PoP was wide open.  Those guilds have moved on, though, and VT is most often cleared by semi-open raids these days.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mostly we hit the BoT towers.  They reset every few hours, so it's not hard to find something up to kill.  Again, don't knock the gear, I'm still using some stuff from the towers, as are most of my guildies.  These aren't very difficult encounters (only sand tower is hard at all) and the loot at the point you get it is quite exciting.   Did we hit the towers over and over and over?  Yeah, we did, but we got a lot of nice loot, had a lot of fun, and every raid night a lot of guildies logged happy with their new stuff.  A guild of 30ish could have a lot of fun farming these towers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The PoP flag encounters are hard if you're coming to them in a true progession style.  They will challenge your patience.  You will lose.  Several times, to most of them.  But it's all the better when you win.  My guild had particular difficulty with RZtW.  I don't even know how many times we ran through that script.  But you know what I do remember?  Literally jumping out of my chair and yelling the night we did beat him.      My favorite EQ moment ever.  I'd been a member of my guild for a reasonable amount of time at that point, but that was the moment I became    committed to the guild to the very end.  We'd faced a major challenge, been hit with major frustration, showed a couple of cracks, but in the end we managed to all work together flawlessly and we came through it.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think PoP is a marvellously designed expansion for guilds.  As you move along, you're *forced* to learn to play better as a guild.  With the exception of a few "gimmes" (Fennin Ro and his boy Sol Ro come to mind), the encounters become increasingly more difficult and require increasingly more coordination with your raid force.   That's good for guilds, learning to work together with ever increasing precision and teamwork.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PoP takes time, and it takes effort. So be it.  I wouldn't have it any other way.</description>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;Something that just struck me after reading thread after thread of the same thing in this envy debate.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The assumption that people in Ep/Time just magically had SoE wave a hand over them and bless them with access. They all did all the lower-end/Older expansion content to get there. And the leaders did it in gear that was one expansion old. Without spoiler sites handing out strats on how to kill every mob in the game.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Sometimes I think that a lot of the people that want to have equal access to EP/Time/GoD gear while only playing 5 hours a week have only been playing this game since PoP or later. They don't seem to grasp that people fought Vox/Naggy in Banded and Bronze armor, a FBSS with 21% haste and no stats on it was godly, Shaman stat buffs actually meant something, and if you had a weapon with&amp;nbsp;a 3:1 ratio you were Uber. You can buy "Casual Uberness" in the Bazaar or from LDoN&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;LDoN gets boring. Time gets boring the 40th time you're through it also I bet. Stop prepetuating the myth that &lt;STRONG&gt;ALL &lt;/STRONG&gt;of GoD needs Elemental+ gear to do. Natimbi can now be done by a group of low 50s in decent gear. Decent like Cultural Armor, recommended level 45, player made. You know, the stuff that you can buy that is better than the Skyshrine Quest armor people mentioned raiding for that wasn't good enough for you? All the GoD zones were re-tuned. In Natimbi, none of the animals are KoS anymore. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;People complaining that places other than PoP have lone and tiresome corpse runs? Well gee, if you raided anything before PoP that was what you were in for. You want to play in GoD? That's what you're in for. And in GoD there are mobs that see through Rogue SoS, so better have a Necro in group to summon those bodies. And some Cloudy Potions since you'll have to run back to the zone to get summoned.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I was the 10th player the day my first guild was formed. I was level 3 and had never left Everfrost Canyons that day. Had to spend 2 days in Gfay waiting for a GM to come certify us. I was in that guild for 2+ years, leaving it 3 months ago. I tried and tried to get us started on a progression. Plate cycle in Kael, then Arena. Working faction and getting Thurg armor. &lt;STRONG&gt;More important than any of that was learning how to coordinate on a raid&lt;/STRONG&gt;. Finally getting to a point to try Halls of Testing in ToV. Had a nice run through first time. Had a very cool Ranger friend from one of the Server's top guilds nursemaid us through it. Had nice drop rate. People went en mass to SS to finish their armors. 75% were vocally disappointed in the end result. Our problem? We were doing this last November, and mudflation and trickle down, most everyone had better stuff already. But HoT is where you learn &lt;STRONG&gt;how&lt;/STRONG&gt; to raid. How to deal with things like AE and Gaters. But in the Loot First culture that EQ is more and more becomming, raiding all but stopped aside from an occasional epic. We became a LDoN guild. No one wanted to put in the time to learn since gearing up was not necessary. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Flagging is a blessing and a curse. I really don't see a ton of stuff in PoV that really necessitated having to pass that darned PoJ trial to kill. The Trial dynamic is completely different from the grouping dynamic in the zone it unlocks. Sony did the right thing when they unlocked Tier 2 and some of Tier 3 awhile back, even though it did turn BoT into Karnors 2.0. The only Tier 3 zone that remains flagged has an alternate entry quest that is one groupable in Plane of Storms. There really are not enough "camps" in Elementals to let in anyone that is 65 for example.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Without a single piece of raid loot, I have tanked all 100 mobs in an Vxed GoD trial. With no Enchanter pet crutch. We ran into trouble at the very end and did not get chance to hail because of a wipe, but we did drop named that dropped a great hybrid cloak that rotted because we had none on trial :(&amp;nbsp; Before saying there is nothing to do outside Elemental flagged zones, go out and try. If you or your group can do a Hard LDoN (remember that? The ones that are boring to death?) then you can do the trials to get flagged for KT in GoD.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;P&gt;Thank you for your comments, this has helped my understanding a lot&amp;nbsp; :smileyhappy:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I had no idea drops were so good at the Chardok ent on the Burning Staff, getting 40 drops over 2 days (8hours playing time) sounds good to me. We thought the drops at Royals would be better.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I am in a 3 year old, off peak guild on an old server. We are not whiny PL'd 65's. We just got a shock when we discovered the bottleneck for elementals.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I now think we will avoid elemental planes altogether. We will kill Luclin and other mobs and maybe do Ssra a couple of times a month (Saturday nights for big Raids, rest of the week LDoN and small events)&amp;nbsp;and in a year we will have our 40 active players (3-4 group raids) upgeared to do GoD. We want challenge but we also want fun, doing Ssra every saturday for months wouldnt be fun&amp;nbsp;. VT shards arent fun from what I have read, and not a lot of challenge since they have to be farmed and if you cant farm them then wayyyy too time consuming on top of the normal time. Farming VP keys looks like its un fun also, Trak is only up occassionally, it will take months to get all the teeth.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;In the meantime we will hope for changes to old world zones and LDoN scaling for less than 36 person raids and less than 6 person groups.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The biggest issue apart from all that is the freezing/rebooting bug its causing us to cancel events and lose members :smileymad:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;SSRA might surprise you =)&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;It is up there with places like NToV for fun factor. The encounters are well designed and although the mobs are all pretty similar looking, there's enough atmosphere and lore for you to actually think "What have I done???" when you awaken the Cursed, Destroyer of Gods... The loot and droprate is also very good (especially for cursed cycle) and there are enough different targets of different difficulty that it will keep you busy for a while =) Recommend you start with Rhag cycle and work from there =)&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;VT key shard camp isn't as bad as people say. But VT itself really is as bad as people say. It's a very /yawn zone and not friendly to casuals because it takes a loooong time to clear.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Be sure to stop by in Griegs End at some point and kill Grieg Venecius. I love that zone =)&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;Onomatopoeia, your simplistic view of the situation isn't reality. The expansions, PoP and GoD,&amp;nbsp;were marketed towards more than the uber raiders--so we buy and notice that we need to play like an uber-raider to progress anywhere...and your solution is for everyone to just go back to Velious?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;In PoP you can get to everywhere except Sol Ro and the EPs with a single group via alt entry quests.&amp;nbsp; In the locked zones a guild that couldn't reach them couldn't kill any of the raid targets anyway.&amp;nbsp; There were 3 and 4 group instance raids in the tier 1 and 2 zones and small raid targets in BoT and Tactics.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;In GoD you can single group to KoD Taz and Yxxta, which have single group instance content with 160+hp/mana drops.&amp;nbsp; You can go no further though, but by then it has got really hard.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I suggested certain things in Velious as being suitable for a small, occasional raid force with limited time available.&amp;nbsp; My point is that there is content out there to suit all needs if you are prepared to look for it.&amp;nbsp; What is wrong with questing SS armour anyway?&amp;nbsp; My cleric got a new set of greaves on Saturday from HoT / SS and very pleased with them she is too.&amp;nbsp; 80hp/70 mana is not to be sneezed at by any means.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Yeah, actially wanted&amp;nbsp; to comment on this too.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Original EQ - awesome, equal footing for adventure&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;- 2-3 month long booking lists for planes and dragfons.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 5-6 hour lines in Lower Guk to get into&amp;nbsp;major item camps.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; High-end guilds living in Planes, to the exclusion of everyone else.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Kunark - Minor Keying, but overall equal footing&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;- Kunark made things somewhat better, introducing a lot of new content.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; But unless you were in a guild that could mobilize and bring a heavy raid force into zone in 10-15 minutes, you could forget about taking a shot at dragons and mobs like VS.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Only hard to key for zone was Veeshan's Peak.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; And if&amp;nbsp; had to have one heck of raid force to raid VP.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Velious - Minor Keying and best expansion to date&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;- in fact, original Velious required everyone to make the journey to the rings in WL and CS and pick up a shard at those rings before they could be ported in via port spells.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; And given that WL ring had Wuoshi guarding it, and you needed a quested key to get onto CS from SS, getting into deep Velious was a VERY involved process.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Eventually, anyone could get a port to deep Velious - an equivalent of opening up Tier 2/3 PoP - but still, only strongest and fast moving guilds had any chance of raiding named in KD, DN, and ToV. - and eventually ST.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Everyone else got yard trash.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Luclin - Moderate Keying, aliens, transporters, the beginning of the downfall of EQ&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;- Transporters first appeared in Kunark.&amp;nbsp; Ever been to firepot room?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Aliens - just cause they resemble something you might see on X-files, they are hardly your Agent Mulder's aliens.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;They are primitive, shamanistic tribes, akin to goblins.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; No 'flying saucers' there.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; About the only flying saucer in the game is in original EQ - Qeynos.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; And in what sense is it EQ downfall?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Luclin introduced content for all levels throughout, added a lot more high-end content,&amp;nbsp; with only one locked zone.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; And in that single locked zone, you needed one heck of a raid to&amp;nbsp;take down any named.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Planes of Power - Heavy flagging required, mass numbers and playtime required.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;- Aside from 6 top zones, everything can be reached via small-group effort.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;LDoN - Work your ass off to get points to buy sub-par gear.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;- One thing LDoN did is shook up the 'sit and grind' scene.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I think that overall, people's skills in a small group have improved across the board.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The fast-paced nature of LDoNs made everyone to reconsider the issues of efficiency, strategy, mana conservation, and other things.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; LDoN is also content that is always available when you are ready for it, not vice versa.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Points and gear for them are just an icing on the cake.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;Someone posted a fantastic indepth guide of how smaller guilds can get their mitts on some&amp;nbsp;really lovely GoD items in the Veterans part of the board. Probably on page 2 now but well worth a read. &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;First id hardly call LDoN gear sub-par it is in line with Teir 3 boss mob gear in PoP.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Second the time sink for Luclin imo by far is way worse than any flag.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;[QUOTE]then you are SoL if your midsized guild can't raid 12 hours a day for months to get through PoTime.[QUOTE]&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;statements like this just relay the ignorance some have about the process.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;My guild never raids more than 4 hours at a time for a total of more than 20 hours a week, we're almost EP flagged.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Another guild on the same server raids no more than 4 hours at a time for a total of more than 20 hours a week (this is their rule in their charter, it's a hard rule they NEVER break) they killed quarm over a month ago.,&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;PoP progression doesn't take huge timesinks, it takes precision, coordination and a willingness to work hard, not raid 12 hours a day.&amp;nbsp; I get sick of seeing statements like this.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
