    <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana size=2&gt;The following changes to the Demi-Plane of Blood will go live on the same day that Prophecy of Ro launches.&amp;nbsp; There were far too many changes to list in the patch message, so they have been listed in their entirety here.&amp;nbsp; Most changes were meant to address bugs or loopholes in raids.&amp;nbsp; A few changes were to address difficulty.&amp;nbsp; The most important change was to add&amp;nbsp;bonuses I had intended to include in the zone&amp;nbsp;from the&amp;nbsp;beginning,&amp;nbsp;but&amp;nbsp;was unable to&amp;nbsp;in time for Darkhollow's launch.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana size=2&gt;Redfang:&lt;BR&gt;The blooddrinker bats will no longer assign themselves as pets to Redfang. This is what was causing him to auto-aggro when he respawned.&amp;nbsp; Though it might be tempting to avoid re-aggroing him to take a reprieve from the fight, there are &lt;EM&gt;serious&lt;/EM&gt; drawbacks to leaving Redfang up unaggroed for too long.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Zi-thuuli:&lt;BR&gt;Nothing.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Hatchet:&lt;BR&gt;Hatchet will continue to "chase" people all the way down to 10% health.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Previously he would stop using this hazard after he had been&amp;nbsp;trapped four times.&lt;BR&gt;If Hatchet goes prone, he can no longer follow through with any axe tosses that may be pending. A message will indicate this to the affected player.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sisters:&lt;BR&gt;The bats near the bedrooms are now part of this event. They will only spawn when the Sisters event is activated, and they'll deactivate&amp;nbsp;after successfully completing the event.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Tris:&lt;BR&gt;Increased hit points slightly.&lt;BR&gt;Increased the rate at which she changes forms slightly.&lt;BR&gt;The chest should no longer have a chance to double&amp;nbsp;or triple spawn on a win if multiple priests landed a cure spell simultaneously.&lt;BR&gt;Some of the werewolf adds are no longer mezzable.&lt;BR&gt;The orc adds will now walk in the room with Tris instead of bunching up outside.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Devlin:&lt;BR&gt;Changed the pathing in Devlin's room and increased his height. His pathing appears to be MUCH better.&lt;BR&gt;As an additional safety precaution, added a tether to Devlin that will teleport him back to his room if he strays too far away from spawn.&lt;BR&gt;When Devlin throws a bottle at someone, a text warning will now display to everyone nearby, similar to the message that you see when Hatchet is about to chase someone.&lt;BR&gt;Fixed the problem with Devlin's&amp;nbsp;adds not depopping on success&amp;nbsp;or failure.&lt;BR&gt;When Devlin's shield is broken, he'll now wield a broken shield (no graphic) in his offhand. This will prevent him from gaining DPS due to dual wield. I hope this will promote breaking the shield, whereas before guilds may have avoided it due to the drawback.&lt;BR&gt;Mana Weave no longer counts as a fire spell for breaking Devlin's shield.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Roley:&lt;BR&gt;Roley and Adrianna now spawn at a static location in the ballroom, which should help prevent initial&amp;nbsp;warping at the beginning of the event.&lt;BR&gt;As an additional safety precaution, added a tether to Roley and Adrianna that will warp them back to their room if they stray too far away from spawn. This will help mitigate warping, but also means they must be fought in the ballroom.&lt;BR&gt;The chests will no longer cast their 'fine red mist' trap if hit by a stray AE spell.&lt;BR&gt;The twitching skeleton NPC in the lab no longer spawns.&lt;BR&gt;As mentioned above, the bats in the bedrooms are now part of the Sister's event and will not interfere with the Roley event.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Performer:&lt;BR&gt;Blueblood and the Spinstress are immune to Song of Highsun.&lt;BR&gt;Removed the drops from the adds in this event so corpses won't litter the room and contribute to lag.&lt;BR&gt;The Performer is now rooted in place.&lt;BR&gt;Less adds will spawn, per wave, in the later phases of the event.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Mayong:&lt;BR&gt;Increased attack speed slightly.&lt;BR&gt;The named gargoyles will now respawn properly between attempts.&lt;BR&gt;Zombie and drachnid trash mobs should no longer path high enough to add while fighting Mayong.&lt;BR&gt;Mayong's AE slash ability will now correctly hit the people closest to him instead of killing everyone not close to him.&lt;BR&gt;Fixed the typo in Mayong's hail text.&lt;BR&gt;You no longer need to sneak to speak to Mayong and trigger the encounter.&lt;BR&gt;It should now be more obvious what your choices meant when triggering the Mayong fight.&lt;BR&gt;Bonus rewards for killing Mayong are now in.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;General Changes:&lt;BR&gt;The spinstun screech spell now has half the arc width as before and decreased duration.&lt;BR&gt;All four flags received for doing the AE blocker quest will now show up on EQ players profiles, and the descriptions should make more sense.&lt;BR&gt;The dinner invitation will now be added to your keyring when you click the statue in West Korlach.&lt;BR&gt;Fixed the typo when you click into Demi-Plane after killing Mayong.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>We continue to have significant pathing issues during the Performer event (usually hit us late in the event around 15/16 min mark). As others have said mobs come into the room, get agro'd and run back out and around "the block" and back in with 10-15 other mobs. Have these issues been fixed on test, and if so can we expect a push to live server in the next major patch?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; -Gardor</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Its crazy to me how much trash killing is required in dpob, and even anguish.&amp;nbsp; Remember how cool it was in Txevu when all you did was kill one trash mob, maybe two then set up and fought a named?&amp;nbsp; It was great, the named fight may have been 30 min's long but wouldnt you rather do something interesting that involved a little concentration then mindlessly kill trash forever?&amp;nbsp; Dpob drives me nuts, kill trash forever, kill more trash, kill some more trash all my guild does all night is kill trash.&amp;nbsp; Kill trash to spawn Zt, 4 times mind you, kill trash for sisters event, wow thats fun for 10% of the raid (the other 90% kills trash), kill more trash mobs to spawn redfang (and kill adds during Redfang I love it)&amp;nbsp; wow its just kill trash kill trash kill trash.&amp;nbsp; I kill a lot of trash in xp groups too, its not so boring then, but when I raid I like to kill named mobs that drop cool loot.&amp;nbsp; Not trash and then named mobs that drop more monk only items (thanks ture!! glad 2 of our paladins have a boff, all of our monks and consequently all our monk alts with flags have that sweet monk only item)&amp;nbsp;((and wow, thats cool that 1 pure melee class and 3 of the hybrids get class specific items in anguish no one else wow good call on that)).&amp;nbsp; /rant off.&amp;nbsp; Is it possible to look at how loot tables are determined on raid mobs, our plate and silk wearers are getting killed by how much leather and chain drops, and everyone gets killed on class specific items.&amp;nbsp; I realize there are only so many ways to set up a high end raid zone but I think most are a little trash heavy, we all dont need to max that raid leadership so yeah.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Pathing there is horrible. A simple warp when in sister's corridor leads to major train coming from Hatchet / laboratory room. I don 't even talk of a mob falling down a bridge coming back by the tunnel and the whole castle. That's becoming a bit boring and disappointing to play in such zone at get killed simply cause you can 't always fight in a big open area !&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Ganellon on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;09-04-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;10:31 PM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

      <description>I think the pathing issues with Demiplane will go live with the next patch, they appear to be impossible to reproduce on beta server.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Torrath from my experience certain mobs do not spawn him at all, and even after a fail we have never had him not spawn for us. Keep at it sometimes you get really unlucky spawning him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prathun can you please consider making the Mayong fight shorter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I dont mind the initial phase, but from the point where he goes active until the 50 minutes snorefest to get him killed the only thing that is really hard besides bugs like warping exploding zombies or warps is if half the raid falls asleep .....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Double the effect on the clicks of half his HPs or something like that, because in its current state his very unfun to fight because it just takes to darn long....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ohh and /mourn Performer 1.0 even tho its a little better now than the first change.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;Since when?&amp;nbsp; He's been rooted for a very long time.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The only time he moves is if he is summoned by an NPC and stays rooted at the new location, then you just have to highsun him back home and can blur him or what have you.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;He is and he isn't.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Its not summon, he *sticks* to some of the mobs, even if they aren't beating on him, he will follow them around.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Blueblood and Spinstress are the worst, he'll stick right to them and follow them around.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Seems if he's within melee range he'll keep creeping up slightly and "stick" to them.&amp;nbsp; Had him follow mobs right into a pillar before, which caused the tank to lose agro and the mob turned on Perf and killed him.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;For being rooted he's constantly never in his home spot.&amp;nbsp; He won't chase players, and he doesn't chase most mobs, but he will definately stick to some of them and follow them around.&amp;nbsp; Blueblood being the worst one I've seen.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>btw Pathing is teh suck. Performer adds still path out and around training you. Tris adds now somethings when dragging them North run out the room randomly aggroing everything in the room before it.</description>

      <description>For the love of all that is holy someone please fix the pathing on the mobs in the performer event. Last 3 times my guild has done him we lost solely because of mobs runing into the room a tank grabs agro and for no resone the mob turns and runs back out of the room and agro's the orcs that are not apart of the event (meaning we prity much loss once two ae stun orcs are in the room) it is getting realy anoying to try a event that we know we can do and yet loss because of *blank* glitchs. k thanks /rant off&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>No show as in we killed trash for over an hour, and the 4th version never spawned.  Usually he comes out within 10 trash after the inital pop.  We killed probably 50-60 trash, and finally just moved on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>We had our 1st run at Zi-Thulli last night, and lost at 10%.  He &amp;quot;reset&amp;quot; and so we had to kill the 3 early versions again, but the final version never spawned.  Needless to say it was rather disheartening to waste all that time and have him be a no show at the final push.  I don't imagine it will happen again now we understand the encounter and will probably beat it upon a new instance, but worth a fix I'd think to save people disapointment in the future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
