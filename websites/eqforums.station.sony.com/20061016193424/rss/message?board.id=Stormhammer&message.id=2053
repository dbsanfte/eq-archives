    <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I don't know how many of us are still actively playing but I hope some of you will come try out the new Progression Server.&amp;nbsp; I know I probably shouldn't say this cause it might violate something but several times over the last 5 days when I hit /who all GM on the beta server I saw Zaltaran's name come up.&amp;nbsp; Seeing how we haven't been doing any Agency Raids here I assume he is here working on the new server.&amp;nbsp; I know Maddoc and a few other Devs are here working but deep down I hope some of our GMs like Deodan and Lydrea might come to help out with the opening of the new server.&amp;nbsp; I am already a member of a raiding guild that will be starting here head strong.&amp;nbsp; If any Legends people are planning on coming to this new server please post here and if you are serious about staying here and having fun reliving the old days I might be able to get you guilded.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
