				<DIV>I got the ring last night.&nbsp; After turning in the picks for the belt, I headed to Sol Ro and killed goblins until I got 4 fiery ores (maybe 15-20 minutes).&nbsp; Welnik would not accept my ores.&nbsp; So I&nbsp;camped right there, and came back about an hour later.&nbsp; I handed him the ores and he gave 3 of them back.&nbsp; SO, I killed fire drakes until I got another ore.&nbsp; Welnik&nbsp;still wouldn't take my ores but at least he gave them all back.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>At that point I gave up and went to Abysmal to work on baking.&nbsp; When I ran out of eggs, I figured I'd kill 2 birds with 1 stone; farm basilisk eggs and try to get the ring again.&nbsp; So I returned to Lavastorm (about 2 hours had passed since my last turn in attempt).&nbsp; This time, before handing him the ores, I said, "something extra" and he gave me the quest dialog again.&nbsp; I turned in the ores, and he gave me the ring and 3 of the ores back.&nbsp; No idea what time it was in the game.. I do know it was way past my bedtime IRL though.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Good luck to those attempting the quest.&nbsp; The ring is worth it.&nbsp; If Welnik won't accept the ores at first,&nbsp;do something else for a few hours then go back and try again.</DIV>
