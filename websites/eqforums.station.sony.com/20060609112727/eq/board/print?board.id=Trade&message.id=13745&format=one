				<DIV>This was not to show improved results.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>This was in response to people saying "when I got my trophy, I started failing more often" and this shows that within a reasonable range this is not true.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>there will be some variance since we are dealing with random numbers.&nbsp; And there is no <STRONG>good</STRONG> way to test this with enough tests and large enough numbers to smooth out the variance that randomness gives.&nbsp; If we make a bot to do it, people will say the bot itself skewed the numbers, and we just do not have the resources to dedicate a person to doing enough tests with large enough numbers to smooth out the variance that the randomness will give.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>This test is enough though to show reasonably that adding a mod is not making you fail more often.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>And in response to a question above...&nbsp; 295 is when a 335 trivial turns to 95% chance.&nbsp; (294 is 94.5% chance)</DIV>
