      <description>I'm sick and damned tired of high level people making lower level zones utterly useless for the people they are intended for, IE: people of lower levels.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's pretty damned hard to level up a lower level toon in L Guk for example when every five minutes you either lose all the mobs that you can kill to higher levels who don't bother to invis to get in, they just kill everything in their path, or you get trained out by some damned fool who would rather train the zone than die.   "Yeah, right.. I'm gonna die someplace that's a ten minute run" was the exact comment I got from one such rude bastage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you want to do fabled mobs for high end people, here's an idea.. Put them in high end zones?</description>

Guk, hunting between the bedroom/skelly room area and the entrance.&lt;br&gt;This guy trained up from Frenzy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And for a few other comments....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How could I possibly have instigated it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The bottom line is that training other players because you are too lazy to fight your way out, or too cheap to pop off a gate potion to get out is inarguably rude and inconsiderate. If you can't see this, you're as rude as inconsiderate as they are.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sadly, this kind of attitude is the dominant one today, however. Therefore, SOE should take this attitude into account when deciding on the locations of high level drops for high levels, since they won't bother policing the game to keep the rude/crude out of it.&lt;br&gt;After all, I do believe that intentionally training or interfering with the play of others is against the Play Nice Policy, is it not?</description>

&lt;P&gt;This is the&amp;nbsp;part I will comment on, just because someone can't get a gate potion does not mean they are 'too cheap' to use one. Not everyone can afford potions for their non-casters. Even high levels. I just get tired of hearing people say that because you don't get this, or use that that you are too cheap or not playing the game right because you don't have tons of plat.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Oh, and I doubt you have never ran a train to a zone line the whole time you've played EQ. If someone gives warning that the train is coming, then you have a chance to get out of the train's way. Especially if you were playing your necro, FD and Invis do work well.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

It's very possible that he can't blow them off indiscriminatly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, that does not mean that he can't kill his way out, does it?  After all, he killed his way in, didn't he?&lt;br&gt;Any toon high enough to be looking at fableds in the bottom of L Guk is certainly capable of fighting their way to the zone without training out. Hell, I've done it with my cleric.(low 60's at the time).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As I said. There is NO EXCUSE for training the zone just because you are too lazy or inconsiderate. period.</description>

There is NO EXCUSE for training the zone just because you are too lazy or inconsiderate. period.&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hundreds, if not thousands of pedestrians are hurt and killed in Hit and run accidents each year. For their own safety I demand that all vehicles be removed off the road immediately.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A bit of an extreme analogy, but demanding Fabled be removed NOW because of a few bad experiences is similarly extreme. Especially when in general most people have found that the Fables have brought out the best in many people, not the worst. For every story you hear of someone training the zone after getting what they wanted, or raids racing to take out a target before another raid gets there; you also hear of the spur of the moment organized grouping/raiding to make sure all people who want to get the drop get it when their turn comes up, regardless (most of the time) of level, or people taking down the less-wanted Fabled and announcing it to everyone so that the drop won't rot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The fables themselves are only up 1/12th of the year, and the jerks like you mentionned might do that in the same area you are in maybe once or twice over that month period. Just treat it like you would treat any other inconsiderate jerk who trains/kills you or whatever. As long as there is something someone wants deep in the zone, you will always have cases like that; just having "Fabled" in front of the mob's name won't change that, just change the zones they are likely to be in.&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Saroc_Luclin on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;04-07-2005&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;09:38 AM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

After all, we've been somewhat successful in removing motorists from sidewalks, I think.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway.... Yes, I know my solution is draconian. And quite possibly overkill. However, I think we all know enough about human nature to realize, and predict that anytime there is Uber_goodie00 available for minimal effort, you're going to have the greed factor bringing in cretins of this nature by the boatload. (We will have to disregard the non-functional status of Norrath's boats for the sake of this discussion.) After all, Greed is good, right?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It shouldn't be too hard to predict this, and take it into account when deciding where to put something like fabled drops.&lt;br&gt;Why not simply not put them in dungeons? Put them in open areas, where people don't have to be on the path to the exit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How about the "Fabled under-the-world Velium Hound"? He could be in Western Wastelands, at the northwest corner of the zone, well away from everyone. And see to it that he runs fast enough to make trying to train him to the zone pointless; he'd catch even a bard before he got 1/4 of the way to the zone. :P</description>

&lt;P&gt;Bucko, no-one here, not a single person, is arguing this point.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;We are arguing that your solution, remove all fabled mobs from lower level zones right now, is an inappropriate one.&amp;nbsp; And, we're right, the solution proposed is inappropriate.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;Agree totally.&amp;nbsp; This rude guy will do this same thing elsewhere where there is a drop he wants regardless of if that drop comes from a fabled mob or not.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Do not think that removing fabled mobs will stop this behavior.&amp;nbsp; What boggles my mind is there are easily earned LDoN / DoN augs with equal/better haste that can go into much better stat belts out there.&amp;nbsp; Why people even bother with this camp at very high levels just evades my understanding, but that isn't the discussion at hand.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Don't blame the content for rude people's behavior.&amp;nbsp; Put the blame where it belongs - on the sholders of the rude people.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Frankly I am happy about the fableds.&amp;nbsp; It has afforded my small guild the opportunity to gear up a couple of people in dire need without running a 4-5 hour raid to get 1 drop.&amp;nbsp; It's 4 whole weeks out of 52.&amp;nbsp; Ya also might want to consider that these zones use to have100s of trains a day...LGuk especially back when they were crowded so along with the Fabled Evil Eye in LGuk you also get the Fabled Lower Guk Trains, I hear they drop some great gear hehe.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>Seems to be two lines of thought here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1.  I like the fabled two it is a chance for non-uber guild people to get some quality gear.  It is a shame that the casual player only gets the opportunity one month out of the year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2.  Yes there are alot of high level players that are inconsiderate, obnoxious, jerks.  To many times I have seen low players mowed down, by high level players to lazy to cast invis or dust off their own train.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For an added thought: In the situation were players hunt on the zone line, especially in a closed tunnel like DS to ME.  You desearved to be trained for being stupid, and have no reason to whine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rhadoth&lt;br&gt;68th Season&lt;br&gt;Beastlord</description>
