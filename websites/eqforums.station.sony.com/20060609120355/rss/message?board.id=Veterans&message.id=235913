&lt;p&gt;like they are supposed to drop in PoN, but i have completely scratched that assumption because i killed 247 of those (yes i actually kept count) and never seen one drop yet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;That's teeth, not hides afaik. Teeth also drop in PoE. Hides drop off raptors in CT, but like I said, the drop rate is around 1:100 (I **SMURF** you not). Doesn't do much good to change them to drop outside of PoR (teeth) and VP (hides), both being keyed zones one of which most people are not likely to be flagged for or willing to go to (VP), and not even give the items a realistic drop rate. And since Ngreth hasn't been allowed to go back and change the drop rate, it just bones the races that need those to progress. I would kill to be a&amp;nbsp; woodelf so I could have a realistic tailoring path since it got **SMURF** all over when DoN came out and half of the Velious combines and Solstice Robes were nerfed. I would do wyverns AND othmir since I can clear out all of the wyverns in one fell swoop and the othmir in three. But just having the option to sit and kill thousands of othmir, which I know I've already done, to get the last 40 points in tailoring for me is not my idea of an enjoyable way to play EQ.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;br&gt;the bazaar is calling&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Yeah, I'm not about to pay the price for othmir hides that people ask regardless of me needing the money or not.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Edit: Oh, if you were refering to Great Reptile pieces, evidently you are either retarded or just didn't read the last two pages of posts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Juzam_Djinn on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;06-07-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;01:20 AM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

      <title>VP - Good example of disconnect between players &amp; designers</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Veterans&amp;message.id=235564#M235564</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Played around in VP today.&amp;nbsp; This zone, while never really that popular, is pretty&amp;nbsp; much a tomb 24/7.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Why is that?&amp;nbsp; Let's look...&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;- 3 to 4% AA per kill on the blue trash (solo)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;- Loot...coin from 1 gp to 9 pp&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;- Drops?&amp;nbsp; rare and no trade mostly&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;- Cash drops?&amp;nbsp; Only thing I saw was a basilisk hide...fetched 1pp at the vendor&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;- Adds...I don't think the zone designer could have packed more mobs in the hallways if they tried&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;- Key quest to get in the zone, which is okay....if there is some sort of reward for the effort...which there isn't&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;With the exception of a few quests that ppl w/ROV faction may wanna mess with (and these items were obsoleted like 2 expansions ago) this zone is pointless.&amp;nbsp; At least, before it was revamped, it had a few unique Kunark era items that made it worth visiting to fill up your "toy" bags.&amp;nbsp; I don't recall anyone asking for this zone to be revamped, please correct me if I'm wrong.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;What I don't understand, is why can the original Verant team that designed Antonica zones...create zones that still draw players and revamped zones / new expansions get ditched as soon as new content comes around?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I think some of the dev team actually plays EQ, but it just seems like there is a huge disconnect between what players want and the content that is provided to us.&amp;nbsp; Work and resources go into redesigning zones that are active for 2 weeks...and then go barren.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The only thing I can suggest, is that people who do actual zone designs...get some player input on test servers.&amp;nbsp; I don't know what the criteria would be for said players, but needless to say they should be long time players.&amp;nbsp; Some general criteria, that would at least attract me to&amp;nbsp;a zone, would be...&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;1 - XP&amp;nbsp; If they mobs don't give 10% solo AA +, it's not worth my time if XP is what I'm after.&amp;nbsp; This is a good bar because it makes it worthwhile for groups&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;2 - Zones which have mobs packed into every last inch and pulls are a constant train fight...gonna pass on those&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;3 - Zones that have no safe spot to set up a camp to XP in, or med safely in....cross off the list&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;4 - Zones that are itemized with drops that I can sell to other players (gear) are a big plus.&amp;nbsp; An even bigger plus is there are no required limits (we love our twinks)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;5 - Zones that are itemized with unique clickies, or are part of a quest that yields a nice clickie, are on the list.&amp;nbsp; XP is irrelevant (ex:&amp;nbsp; Wood Elf Illusion click mask)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;6 - Zones that require me to camp keys and/or flags should have some sort of tangible benefit...ie VP being a better than average source for blue diamonds, or XP per kill, or coin per kill...there are a few mobs here that drop some tradeskill items, but they are somewhat in the zone and the nature of VP is such that it's just not condusive to farming&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;7 - Zones that have static named camps are favorites of those who like to farm, group or single&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;8 - Zones that can support groups or solo artists are also favorites&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Anyway, just my thoughts.&amp;nbsp; If I'm full of hooie please enlighten me.&amp;nbsp; But IMO, VP is a garbage zone atm.&amp;nbsp; I'd rather see it reverted back to what it was before.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Zajeer, thanks for the detailed response.&amp;nbsp; Interesting to see a designer's point of view.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;My biggest frustration with this zone, is like another person alluded to.&amp;nbsp; Mob density.&amp;nbsp; It's not easy getting folks to come here, and working this zone solo...it's difficult to make headway against the sheer number of mobs.&amp;nbsp; Once you leave the ZI area, ever single pull involves a split.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I realize you didn't take this isnto account when you designed it, as it was intended as a raid zone. Anyway, thank you again for taking the time to set me straight on some things.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;The quests in the revamped VP ruled. I really enjoyed doing them mostly solo. Some of the gear was an upgrade for me at the time. I sure wish there were many many many .... many more quests like these in the game.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Raider have more plat in their bank accounts because? Well it is true they don’t need to go to the bazaar to upgrade, but any cash coming in during a raid goes directly to the guild bank. But the raider does have expenses, some classes may have the guild supply them with gems used in spells, but in my guild and I’m sure this is common practice in other raid guilds too, I have to supply my own food and drink, my own lobby stone for summoning my corpse when called to by the raid leader and of course my own invis potions, IVU potions, heal potions, cure potions and anything else I don’t have a clicky for. Truth of the matter is, if I only raided my character would go bankrupt in a very short time. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;However, being a long time player, I’ve invested in trade skills to make my own stat food and drink cutting my expenses down. My raid equipment allows me to box better, or in sometimes solo in zones, for items to sell in the bazaar or to a vender sell fast cash drops I get. But this has to be done outside of raiding time, an advantage which I am fortunate to have. So yes I can have more money in the bank then some non raiders, but I would not say this is true of all raiding the raiding community, any more that all non raiders have more cash than raiders, because as I mentioned previously a non raider might need to buy from the bazaar more of the extra equipment upgrades they want from raiders and non raider bazaar mules. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I had my original VP key well before the change, and being at the time in a casual guild, I found getting the new upgraded key extremely difficult. The day I got the upgraded key I believe there was at least 100 players in the zone zerging Suled Dar's Shade, and I had to do this at 4am my time as there were no Euro pick up raids going on. Yes it was a very hard fight indeed, perhaps far too difficult for the intended raiders? But once inside the available quests were nearly all one group, so with a bit of help from my friends I got a few nice upgrades from that revamp. There was one quest involving Hoshkar, that had no reward for either Bards, Monks Beastlords or Berzerkers, so in that Shik I believe you won your titled argument even though you never made it in your post. :)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;PS&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Lets have a Sleeper Revamp please. Aimed towards something nice for the mid raiding community, but not needing anything more key wise than is currently needed.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;PPS&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Bring back&amp;nbsp;a re imprisoned Sleeper, make him totally end game level plus plus plus. No loot, :smileysurprised:, but flag the accounts and send the players who eventually beat him a designer cloth cap sent via the mail saying, I beat the sleeper and all I got was this cloth cap. :smileytongue:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;Wow, what a thread and what a great variance of comments. I take full responsibility for the revamp of VP. It was my first zone project as a designer on this team when I started. Keep in mind; I did this revamp right after LDoN was launched. I'll give you some insight on what the VP revamp entailed:&lt;xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" &gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;1) Ripped out all of the old, horrible pathing in the zone and repathed the zone.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;2) Changed the placement of base population in the zone and made it more varied, as well as more dense in specific hallways to make you crawl to specific rooms and use those as safe points for pulling the rest of the hallways. A good example of this is the "safe cubby" which was used in old VP as a place to pull Hoshkar to kill him. In the current VP, that's a good place to place a group and pull hallways of NPCs to.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;3) Increased the difficulty of the base population of the zone and changed the drops and added rare NPCs that drop new loot, as well as the old loot off the old dragons. I felt that, it would be unfair to take away something like the Robe of the Azure Sky from players. So the rares, which, I tried to give mimic the old dragons in terms of abilities, dropped the old loot.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;4) Added quests to the zone - 1 per dragon. Looking back, if I had more time, I would have probably had some anti-dragon quests that occurred outside of the zone that gave players an additional benefit to killing in the zone. The quests in the zone were extremely popular at the time, which was great. However, killing in the zone wasn't popular because everyone wanted to "save" their faction.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;5) Changed the key quest. I felt under the old key quest, getting access to an elemental planes level zone (in terms of difficulty and reward via exp/loot) would have been too easy. I added in a "gateway" dragon that was roughly as difficult as a tier3 god in POP would limit the access to players that was on the verge of being elemental flagged. I wanted to make a "faster" access pathway into the zone instead of camping the old key mobs, so I introduced an alternate method of getting the items needed for the key, which was a faster method, but required a group. Initially I got good feedback on this. Not sure how people feel about it in today's game.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;6) Changed all of the dragons in the zone and made them "elemental mini" difficulty. I tried to shoot for around the same difficulty as Arch Mage Yozanni in Plane of Fire. Phara Dar was tuned to be around Xegony difficulty.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;I took 3 long (~70 hour work weeks) to design, implement, and test all of the content in the revamped Veeshan's Peak. This includes the itemization (I am/was the item's guy back then too, heh) and adding in spell requests for the various spells each NPC casts. At the time, there were a glut of Elemental guilds on a lot of servers, and my goal was to remove some stress off those 4 zones and offer an alternative place to hunt. I also wanted the quests to be decent rewards for players who could put in an amount of time outside of raiding, especially after having to kill an elemental gateway boss, and do a good amount of factioning.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;VP at the time was one of the least used zones in the game. You definitely could go into VP and kill all of the dragons solo. Once one group did that zone every week or maybe every week and a half, there was no other zone usage of the zone. I wanted more out of the zone - I wanted it to be a place that's used more. And for a good while after the revamp (I'd say up until Omens or so) the zone usage from the reports I saw showed that it was used more after the revamp than before.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal **SMURF**"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;Of course however, like every old zone, the usability of the zone reduces substantially over the years. The original poster thinks that there's disconnect between us and the players, but in my opinion, the original poster really doesn't seem to see why this zone isn't used anymore - it's because realistically, things from Gates of Discord and before are rarely used because there's newer, better, more rewarding content in each and every expansion we put out. It's simply going to happen in a game that now has 11 expansions and is pushing an 8th year of being Live. You could replace this VP thread and say the same thing for the Solusek C, Cazic Thule, or Siren's Grotto revamps. Heck, you can probably say the same thing for zones that don't have the revamp, such as &lt;xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" &gt;&lt;st1:place&gt;&lt;st1:PlaceName&gt;Dawnshroud&lt;/st1:PlaceName&gt; &lt;st1:PlaceType&gt;Peaks&lt;/st1:PlaceType&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt;, Crypt of Decay, or Riwwi.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;My guild isn't going to take down the dragon to 1) re-flag me, 2) re-flag anyone else (if there is anyone else) 3) flag anyone that has done the "other" access options - again if there is anyone else&amp;nbsp;4) for quest loot that is below what&amp;nbsp;is dropping now.&amp;nbsp; And I have looked for other guilds doing this and have yet to 1) find any or 2) be online when there is a guild doing it.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Perhaps it is just me, but I dislike having something taken away from me for what seems to be an "Arbitrary" decision.&amp;nbsp; You felt that "under the old key quest, getting access to an elemental planes level zone (in terms of difficulty and reward via exp/loot) would have been too easy" so you introduced a raid required mob for access.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;MPG Trials only require a single group and drop better loot.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;A variety of OoW/DoD Rares that can be duoed, drop better loot.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Quests rewards in PoR that can be duoed and soloed offer better loot.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Point is, trying to get&amp;nbsp;a raid together for the sole fact of getting myself re-keyed (since what does it offer to anyone else in my guild) is fruitless.&amp;nbsp; Perhaps it is time to allow the old key re-entry on its own merits (just don't give it the Augment Change without doing the raid).&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Will this give new life to this zone?&amp;nbsp; Doubt it, but then I am probably in the minority on this one.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>Man, this is a silly thread.&amp;nbsp; What would prompt you to do a "review" of a zone revamp that happened like 2 years ago?&amp;nbsp; Will we be seeing you complain about how lower guk just doesn't have any good upgrades for level 70s next?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the time VP was a really fun zone with some very original boss fights.&amp;nbsp; Testing it with Zajeer was one of the funnest things I've done in EQ, and I am now Qvic-MPG level but still wearing the breastplate I got from VP (although it's definitely due for an upgrade :p).&amp;nbsp; VP's only downfall as an exp/raid zone was the fact that as good as it was, the quests were even better, and a lot of guilds never raided there because their members didn't want to lose faction.&amp;nbsp; Personally I did all of the quests and used most of the items for months or years.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That said, it might be a good time to consider taking the key off of it or making it 1-groupable to bring more people into the zone :).&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;VP at the time was one of the least used zones in the game. You definitely could go into VP and kill all of the dragons solo. Once one group did that zone every week or maybe every week and a half, there was no other zone usage of the zone. I wanted more out of the zone - I wanted it to be a place that's used more. And for a good while after the revamp (I'd say up until Omens or so) the zone usage from the reports I saw showed that it was used more after the revamp than before.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Why not add code to restrict players levels to 60 or 62 (banish anyone higher level aggroed to dragons in vp)&amp;nbsp;to fall more in line with what you did when people were 1 grouping or soloing&amp;nbsp;nagafen?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Then in addition add a seperate zone Veeshans B or something, that required the shade key to enter for higher level players?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Or simply send any player over 62 into Veeshans b instead of Veeshans old upon entry.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Also, to quickly comment on the tuning of the Shade outside of VP, as well as the events inside/base population inside. I had a superb guild on the Test server, who was elemental planes capable (however, they weren't in Plane of Fire yet - they had just killed Rallos Zek) test all of the events for me. For the Shade, I used 48 non-elementally equipped players from this raiding guild and after the tuning they were able to do it fine.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I also used this same guild (48 of them) to test the events inside. I based the events on the statistics/power of mini-bosses in Plane of Earth/Fire in terms of HP, AC, damage output, and spells and then had this guild test them. I'm sufficiently confident that these events are on par with AMY from Plane of Fire, and Xegony from Plane of Air.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Edit: P.S. Keep in mind, the Test server players generally have lesser gear and lesser AAs than a Live server player, simply due to the fact that there are more players playing on Live, making grouping and acquiring gear easier. However, I'd contend some of the Test server guilds are more skillful compared to Live server guilds because of this - they have to do more with less, which made for a good comparison point in tuning.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Zajeer-Dev on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;06-07-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;04:14 PM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Very interesting stuff, Zajeer - thanks for the Dev perspective. I think the use of new VP may have peaked not right away, but after some time - when those who grew to be able to kill Suled Dar's Shade were still able to get upgrades from inside (largely quests, as you said).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;One question regarding encounter design: do you tend to design a mob's abilities (and the other challenges of the event) with a particular solution in mind, or do you say "Let's give this mob a 3k dd, hatelist-based shadowstep, and adds that proc an aggro reducer, and see what the players figure out?"&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Depends on the encounter. Some of the encounters&amp;nbsp;I start with an outline of what we want it to do (how difficult it would be, how much HP/AC it has) and then I try and figure out how to make the encounter interesting. Sometimes though, the idea of what the encounter is about comes first, and then I fill in the blanks on how much HP/AC it has, what spells, etc. A good example of this is when I wrote up the Suchun raid. The main idea in my head was to make the encounter based on keeping your mana/endurance above a certain point, and if you didn't, you die. I then worked around that idea and made it into a 3 wave event, with portals/adds, mini-bosses, and a final boss at the end. I then expanded upon that event during testing, when players said "hey, it would be cool to add this" and in some situations I added it.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Feedback during the beta process can be really cool if you get a good guild to test - a guild that wants to test and make sure everything is correct. I rely a lot on player ideas for a lot of varied things on events. Some of you guys that have tested with me on beta know - I'm pretty open about making an event more fun (as well as killing players in the process).&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>I thought this was an ok revamp at the time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The only 2 i didnt like were PoM (lots of fun stuff lost) and Vulak (he was made unkillable, total waste of time).&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;I ran a pickup raid and killed Vulak in ring format. He didnt drop the axe i wanted but he was killable. (tip: key is offtanking one of the 2 drakes that split into 10 more each until you kill the next miniboss. This happens 2 times in the ring event)&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

This happens 2 times in the event also iirc.)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;eq was a different game when vp got revamped. 60hp+ gear in the bazaar was considered very nice to most the population. people in time were looked on as gods, anyone who wasnt in the elemental planes loved ldon. The items linked from the&amp;nbsp;revamped vp seemed awesome to many. OOW and beyond&amp;nbsp;changed all that though. Like the dev said, it was made for the time.</description>
