      <title>Settling down in EQ</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=roleplay&amp;message.id=441#M441</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I proposed this question in the "Just for Fun" section, but I'm actually interested in what others think...&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If you could build a house anywhere in EQ&amp;nbsp;and have your character live there, where would you build it, and why?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The first response was in the middle of the Karanas, but personally, I don't think I could deal with all that rain... I was thinking Kunark, as I always felt it had that "settlement" feel to it, although Nedaria's Landing has some great spots (like near the waterfall)...&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Any thoughts?&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>Guardians of Sebilis - Sleeper server RP faction</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=roleplay&amp;message.id=438#M438</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Guardians of Sebilis is not yet a guild, though it will one day become one. (As soon as I hear back from Sony and make any changes.) It exists as a faction of iksar seeking one common goal: the restoration of the old city (Old Sebilis) through any means necessary. While New Sebilis is quaint, it is a shadow of the former empire. Guardians seek to relive the triumphs of the five iksar tribes and protect and reclaim what is rightfully theirs, including old territories now turned over to goblins and spirits, the abominations that are sarnak, and all manner of inhabitants that don't belong, culminating with the liberation of Old Sebilis in the name of the iksar. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;To put it into a sentence, Guardians of Sebilis is a casual-friendly guild wherein roleplaying is highly encouraged. Many people have been searching for roleplay on the progression servers, myself included, and as the saying goes (or is horribly paraphrased) ... it is what you make it. The iksar have been my favorite race since I first started playing right after Kunark was released. The love of the lore and the points of interest associated with them has not subsided. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;When Kunark is opened, the Guardians faction will exist as a public channel (likely sleeper.GuardiansofSebilis ) with the intent of meeting likeminded people who might be interested in joining the guild, and even those who are not, who wish for a channel common to those of us roleplaying iksar. This channel exists for both ic and ooc chatter. We'll see how it goes if there is a need to branch the channel, but at the moment it doesn't seem necessary. For the most part, Guardians remain IC in venues such as /say and /shout, and casual everywhere else. Channel-goers are encouraged to see where everyone is at and interact with them in character should they see them out and about.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;We do not plan to be stagnant. Many people have a view of roleplayers that only includes level 20 and under characters sitting inside a city talking to one another all day. The Guardians have a select purpose for existing, and that purpose is to reclaim former territories that have fallen to enemies. Though we are of a casual formation, grouping is highly encouraged, and dungeon crawls will be organized. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The utmost courtesy is expected of all members, either tagged or associated with the channel (who are still considered members of the 'faction'). This means not only courtesy to fellow roleplayers, but to everyone on the server. Everyone pays their monthly fee and deserves equal right to enjoy the game as they please. Roleplaying is never, under any circumstances, an excuse to personally attack someone in any manner. Characters have preferences and get into spats. Their players are expected to realize when personal offense could be taken, and do everything in their power to avoid it.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I've rambled on for too long, but to recap:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;1. Guardians of Sebilis is an unofficial faction existing in both guild form and public channel. (/join GuardiansofSebilis) &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;2. While it is primarily iksar, other races will be considered with the utmost caution. * &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;3. We will maintain a mature, casual-friendly environment wherein roleplaying and knowledge of lore is highly encouraged. **&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;4. Respect of fellow players, roleplayers or not, is not only expected, it is absolutely required. Wearing the guild tag means you represent us as part of a whole. Please help to dispell the negative connotations associated with roleplayers.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;5. Our in-game goals are not to rush through Kunark content, but to explore the various areas associated with it; areas that have been deserted as the years have passed. Our ultimate goal is to get into OS and do as much as we can there. Under no circumstances are we to lay physical claim to certain areas because of an IC reason. Again, help dispell the negative connotations associated with roleplayers. Camps are to be respected, trains are to be avoided, griefing is a good way to get kicked out of the guild fast. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* -Anyone- is welcome in the public channel, and is expected to act in a mature and respectful manner. For timeline's sake, we will be treating this as though the lands of Kunark have just been discovered by our soft-skinned brethren, as it was when Kunark was first released. Expect iksar you encounter to be cautious, suspicious, and guarded under the best and most liberal of circumstances. If you wish to carry the tag, you must prove that you are in full support of the cause. Guardians will not turn away the extra help, even if it's grudgingly, but traitors will be persecuted. (As mentioned, race ingame is not an excuse to personally attack someone. There is a difference between being harassed in character, where both parties have a say, to being harassed out of character. Recognize and respect this difference) &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;** This is not and never will be an elitist society. Roleplayers of all experience levels are heartily welcome, even those who have never done it before but would like to give it a try. No one will ever be condemned for 'not roleplaying enough', but if you carry the tag, please note that you are expected to at least give it a shot. We do not expect everyone to be or want to be IC 100% of the time. If for, whatever reason, you don't feel like it - just say so. But be courteous of those around you that do. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>Progression Server &amp; Roleplaying.</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=roleplay&amp;message.id=432#M432</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;Not sure if this would be the best place to put this, but I've already put this on the upcoming server's offical boards. I would encourage roleplayers to come to the progression server when it's released. Currently me and a few people are working on creating a server-wide OOC channel for roleplayers to be able to indentify one another and perhaps organize little roleplay events, recruit for roleplaying guilds, and the like. Seeing how this server is brand new, it seems able to cater to the roleplaying community more than the typical exclusivley high-level population on most servers. The specifics about the server-wide channel hasn't been worked out yet, so if you have any suggestions feel free to post them here. It would be very nice to get a solid roleplaying community going in this game again, and the new server presents the perfect opportunity.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Small Group Returning To EQ Looking For RP Guild/Server</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=roleplay&amp;message.id=430#M430</link>
      <description>The title says it all, just picked up EQ Titanium and after having not played EQ in 4-years some friends and I are returning.  We wish to be part of the RPing/Family type guild and are experienced RPers ourselves and very friendly.  We don't actually want to be on the RP rules server because of the single character rule, but have been told there are RP communities on some of the others, so if some of you kind folks could point us in the right direction we'd be very grateful.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;:smileyhappy:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Looking for a good RP server and a good RP guild.</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=roleplay&amp;message.id=428#M428</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;Subject says it all, well mostly.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I want to roleplay, while leveling also. I'm not a completely hardcore roleplayer, but I'm not light either, I like to roleplay a lot, and used to in this game a lot.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Sadly I quit the game a few years ago, but I have returned to start again.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If you know of a server that has a lot of roleplay on it that would be great. I tried FV but in the tutorial everyone was 'leet speaking' and a few even gave me the '**SMURF** n00bz' and similar. It is sad that the RP has died so much since I have been gone.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Playing without PoK</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=roleplay&amp;message.id=423#M423</link>
      <description>Do any of you play without PoK? - please share your experience!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My partner and I have an alternate couple, two dark elf necromancers (currently, level 30 and leveling very slowly).  I wouldn't say PoK is a complete taboo for those, but at times we managed to do many sessions in a row without visiting PoK.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This made us to plan long runs across continents and oceans, build factions in High Keep, Runny Eye, Paineel, with Erudin and Qeynos guards, etc. (and we're very picky whom we want for friends), know where we can buy water, plan on visiting our friends in Oggok and other places, enjoy revenge sessions (for example, bashing Misty Thicket guards and then chilling out in the Runny Eye).  Not coming to PoK makes us knowing the Norrath geography better and looking into corners we didn't look into before.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course, it requires a little discipline, but once some basic plan of where we go next and how we will get there is in place, PoK becomes sort of irrelevant rather easily.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyone doing anything similar? - let know.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gwyth</description>

      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=roleplay&amp;message.id=408#M408</link>
      <description>I will try my best to keep this short and simple&lt;br&gt;really. I came back to EQ after a long break and &lt;br&gt;partly the reason for my return was that I've&lt;br&gt;been playing other games, but I missed the whole&lt;br&gt;allure EQ had. The atmosphere, the lore, actual&lt;br&gt;fantasy races, ect...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, I come back and make a character on FV, very excited&lt;br&gt;to start role-playing and meeting new people. Well, It&lt;br&gt;was sad that I found almost no one taking time to role-play&lt;br&gt;or the ones I did find where very 'closed off' and had their&lt;br&gt;friends and weren't interested in the least to meet new&lt;br&gt;people. I looked into the frosty goblet tavern channel&lt;br&gt;on FV and met some very nice people and good role-players&lt;br&gt;but the ones I find are either on during the day, (I play &lt;br&gt;very late at night.) or are not willing to go outside&lt;br&gt;of their circle of friends like I mentioned.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, I am asking if there are any good Rp guilds out there&lt;br&gt;willing to take me in. I'm starting from scratch really so &lt;br&gt;I am more then willing to make a character on any server&lt;br&gt;and join. Please, please, please help me. I'm looking for&lt;br&gt;in-depth role-players that are more concerned with that aspect&lt;br&gt;of the game then raiding or leveling, though of course I&lt;br&gt;want to get further in level.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I miss Eq badly but it I can't find a good guild then the &lt;br&gt;majority of reasons I returned are baseless and I will&lt;br&gt;lose my desire to be here. ^ ^&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(I really hope this doesn't take a month to get a responce to.) *Crosses fingers.*</description>

      <description>What is up with the war in Feerott?!? I went to check it out, used origin so I would come in from Oggok. There was an ogre army forming in front of Oggok. They conned aimably. They start walking, so I walk with them (a little bit of role playing sounded fun). We get within sight of a big troll, and blam dead. After I get through loading, I look back at what hit me.... THE OGRE ARMY!!!!! So much for role playing (/rude Sony)</description>

      <title>Roleplay Filter</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=roleplay&amp;message.id=394#M394</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I was thinking this might be kind of cool.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;How about a roleplay filter, which automatically filters words and replaces them, a bit like the badword filter?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;No matter how hard I try, I cannot stop myself using certain words. "Tank" springs to mind. "Omg", "**SMURF**" and other abreviations I can avoid but some people get addicted to. "Buffs" is another one. "Train" &amp;amp; "zone" etc. "Inc". There's dozens, I'm sure.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So you make a filter so that when you type "buff" it comes out "blessing", when you type "**SMURF**" it comes out "What the..?", when you type "inc" it comes out "Beware!" and so forth.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I think it would be pretty hard to set the filter just right for every word, some people use different terms in different ways. You could partially get around this by making the filter customisable.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>Quotes from your gaming group.</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=roleplay&amp;message.id=343#M343</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;This works on other forums, so let's try it here.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The idea is to post a quote from one of your game sessions (EQ, pen and paper, whatever) that you think is funny and the story that goes with it.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The most recent one for us was that my druid in a D&amp;amp;D game was facing a very powerful vampire.&amp;nbsp; Most of my spells just don't work on undead.&amp;nbsp; I have a companion, a huge ape that I call Ape.&amp;nbsp; I discover that, by the rules of the game, I can cast a spell and it will affect both me and my companion.&amp;nbsp; Flame Blade is the only spell I have that might help us survive, so I try it.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The GM asks me why I think that Ape will have any idea how to use a flaming sword.&amp;nbsp; Wouldn't the fire scare him?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;"You know what, if someone can teach a bear to ride a unicycle, I can definitely teach an ape to use a flaming sword."&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Please, make your posts funnier than mine.&amp;nbsp; :)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;Here is an idea, i think that the banking system could be more realistic. Perhaps we could do this by awarding interest on money in the bank or a loan system for newbie characters to get started. There may be other applications im not thinking of that could make it more realistic. Let me know what you think.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <title>RPing in EQ..</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=roleplay&amp;message.id=324#M324</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I don't play EQ to roleplay, but I have to say I wish I could. Back when I first decided to play, that was my plan. I was going to be 100% in character all the time, no exceptions. That lasted about an hour. On my server (this was long before FV existed), the vast majority have zero interest in roleplaying, a good number actively discourage it, a small number like it in a limited fashion for brief moments every now and then, and a tiny percentage (myself included) actually want it to be what the game is about.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The problem I ran up against then and still run up against now is that to do anything in this game you need other people, so you learn very quickly that roleplaying, far from being the point of EQ, is actually an impediment to playing the game. Add to that the fact that the game does not lend itself to roleplaying by design. Yes it has some of the trappings of a RPG; a history and storyline (WELL hidden, however, so as not to annoy the powergamers), a beautiful&amp;nbsp;fantasy RPG look, and customizable player characters. You CAN shoehorn roleplaying into it&amp;nbsp;if you choose to make the effort, but it takes ALOT of effort to immerse yourself in this game. Where is your characters home? Kelethin? But where is his house? There are no houses. What does he like to wear? Armor. Where does he go to sit and socialize with his friends. He can't sit, there are next to no chairs anyway, but there are a few benches he can kneel on here and there. So what does he do then? Kills things or makes pottery...&amp;nbsp; Not a world which lends itself to roleplaying a being with a full and interesting life. Like I said, it can be done, but you end up feeling like the PVPers when they complain about things which don't work the way they think they should and are told that EQ was not designed for PVP so you get what you get. The difference is that EQ&amp;nbsp;IS supposedly designed for roleplaying.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;A few years ago, someone in my guild made a post asking people what the two areas of EQ most in need of improvement were. My response was "I can't sit in a chair and there are no stars in the sky at night." The response I got from them was pretty much what I would have expected had I said "It needs more machine guns". They thought I was completely nuts. Now I am delighted to say that one of my two biggest issues has been addressed :), and it is cool to see the NPCs interacting more and doing something other than standing in one spot forever. (although the tavern on PoK where you hear all the talking and singing and then go in and there's just A_GUY_01 standing there is just f-ing creepy, which I don't think was the intended response :P).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Why do I play EQ? I play to advance my character and to help my friends advance their characters. Because as limited as his life may be, he's still my creation and I have come to care about him. That puts this game firmly in the category of hack-and-slash, which I do enjoy. I just enjoy roleplaying alot more. The thing is, there just isn't any such thing as a MMOG where roleplayers can experience real roleplaying. Money talks and apparently roleplayers have much quieter money than powergamers. ;) But of them all, I think EQ with all its limitations offers the best RPing environment around, and I am happy that I have had a&amp;nbsp;couple of&amp;nbsp;fun RP experiences in the 5 years I have been playing (no not talkng about cyber-sex :P).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So what's my point? Just to discuss roleplaying in EQ, which is what this forum is for. :smileywink:&amp;nbsp;Do I think that someone might read this and pull a few guys off of developing new ways to keep the level 70 crowd from getting bored and maybe do a few more things to improve the immersiveness of the game for the RPers? Yeah right.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;But I wish they would :)&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>Are the boats fixed and back in the game yet?</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=roleplay&amp;message.id=288#M288</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Just wondering.&amp;nbsp; EQ2 is growing old fast on me and I am longing back to the old world of Norrath. Problem is, I consider the boats in EQLive as one of the mainstay features of what that mmorpg represents: freedom and depth, even if there are a zillion other ways of transportation nowadays.&amp;nbsp; I could *still* take a boat and ponder, listening to the music, while the islands are floating by in the distance. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;You can find none of this sort of peace and quiet in modern mmorpgs: WoW has boats but it's still an afterthought, a "quicky" to give the player the idea of boat-travel. What I want is my 30 minute trip from Freeport to Butcherblock back! &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Has there been *any* indication that they will fix the boats? Leaving them out and not responding to any questions about this sort of thing is what turned me away from EQ: it seemed EQ was going to be left to rot, while only features would be added to please a high-level raiding playerbase. Bringing back the boats would be a sign for me that they still care about the original premisse of the game.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Any signs?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=roleplay&amp;message.id=281#M281</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;This if from an original message to my guild:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#3366ff size=3&gt;The only thing I didn't like reading about EQ2 is that there are only 2 starting cities and you have to be&amp;nbsp;polarized to either the good one (Qeynos) or the Evil one&amp;nbsp;(Freeport). It's nice that they made these cities so huge with a large number of zones, it gives one the feeling that they are really in a large city. However,&amp;nbsp;I would imagine it would make every other city look stupid and insignificant.&amp;nbsp;Furthermore, as it applies to lore and roleplaying, this would seem to make the rest of the world insignificant as the whole game revolves around these 2 cities. My machine can't run EQ2 but I'm not sure I'ld play it if I could. No harm though in having some fun and trying it out.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#3366ff size=3&gt;Hopefully Sony will give in to some of my feedback suggestions for EQ1, such as not focusing the storyline so much around the Wayfarers brotherhood, but rather using it as a tool for major GM events. When was the last time someone saw a dragon like Vox or Trakkanon flying over Qeynos to burn it down to pacify the growing ire of the Ring of Scale. I would rather see more lore and guild events like this centered around the core world of EQ instead allowing them to shrivel up and die and be considered obsolete. Maybe this would bring back some higher levels to some core places in the EQ world that have become obsolete. The center of this game should still revolve around the starting cities I think, but it has always moved to the latest expansion. Maybe EQ1 needs to add to the starting cities and surrounding zones and give incentives for higher level players to come back. Even small changes reflecting the storyline, such as Qeynos Scouts moving out into the Karanas because of building tensions with Freeport ( which have led to the situation in EQ2) would keep things interesting. What about some high Lich seizing the throne of Qeynos by force and turning it for a time into an undead city (one suggestion I gave EQ years ago) Dynamic evolution of quests should also be important and would be an easy way to support a good storyline just under a gm event level. Quests could come and go depending upon the evolution of the gameworld.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size=3&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman"&gt;&lt;FONT color=#3366ff&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size=3&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman"&gt;&lt;FONT color=#3366ff&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;I would love to see a high level quest in the Ebon Mask based upon the war of Assassins that would result in a mask of the namesake of the guild (maybe Tier`dal rogue only with a black skull helmet graphic). But I would also like to see evolving quests, maybe the Circle has moved in on the Freeport Rogues guild, and some information needs to be intercepted from an operative in the Gulf of Dulak. That’s a weak example focused on rogues, but I’m sure something could be developed.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#3366ff size=3&gt;This is an easy way for Sony to make the gameworld more enjoyable and to recruit another playerbase of accounts. Some people play this game for the pvp (which this game was never really centered around like some of the others out there), some play for the loot and exp grind which is gratifying in some ways, but what good is it outside of the pwerlevel grind?? The focus in this game needs to be taken off of hack and slash powergrinding, and onto the fantasy storyline of the game. After all isn’t that what brought most of us to this game in the first place? Isn’t that the original intent of the game designers? Sony has the cash cow so why rock the boat? Let sleeping dogs lye. (LOL I couldn’t fit too many clichés in there.)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#3366ff size=3&gt;Does anyone remember the time when Eq was going to allow players to run NPC's? I think recruiting players to do so for a gm event would do a lot for the game. Early on in EQ I think there was a gm event where a gm played a dragon that flew out to the Karanas or thereabouts and someone killed him in the end and was awarded the prize of an artifact. (Whats an artifact you might ask&amp;gt;?? That’s a unique item granted at the end of a major gm event.) It’s been a long time since I’ve seen a major gm event. I remember one Halloween where one of the Karanas zones turned blood red and got overrun with mid/ high level undead with unique drops only found from that event. I could be wrong, maybe events have been going on and I’m just not aware of them, but I think that’s where the clickable storyline on the top of the screen should come in. I think people would start reading more newspapers, and other lore as well.&lt;BR&gt;Maybe if you sent some feedback about this they will open their eyes. There should be gms for technical problems, but then they should have gms for the fantasy development and dynamic evolution of the world through server events (both short and semi-long term), and to game-wide evolution of events through a combination of storyline and changes in the EQ world (outside of new expansions). I don’t mind, and would encourage new expansions so long as they are integrated in this manner. Most new expansions are on the high end, and have no effect on the rest of the world, all they do is make the rest of Norrath obsolete to the high end, which will lead to the death of this game.&lt;BR&gt;In the meantime good luck with EQ2 if you are trying it out, but I think a lot of players went there looking for something that was missing here, and I don't think they are going to find it because these major problems haven’t been addressed.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>A discussion on the problems in the RP world.</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=roleplay&amp;message.id=277#M277</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=10342&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Go there and scroll down a tad past Lord Macho Man Ran.... err Mithaniel Marr, and find a post by "bgb" asking how he can kill his own deity, and read all responding posts, paying special attention to two people: Firemaster and Ehlron.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;These two represent two of the main problems that have led to a problem in RPing in recent months.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Firemaster represents the "ub4h" side to it, which has an open disdain for RPing, actually viewing those who RP as a lesser breed of player. Plenty of RP'ers break the mold he suggests ((I'm 67 and EP flagged, and continuing PoP progression, which he would claim I can't do for lack of ability.))&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Ehlron represents the RPing side, which consist of the people who let the role play them, instead of vice versa. It has always been my belief that the challenge to RPing isn't so much saying "This is my character, what can I do in the situation?" but more "This is the situation, what would my character do in this situation/is it reasonable for him to do the thing I want in the situation?" However, people like Ehlron have lore handed them, and pull the RTS strategy of turtling, falling on the RP, covering himself with it, and refusing to budge.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;There are other problems as well, such as what actually significantly reduced my desire to roleplay, and I admit I've had a hard time RPing since it happened. The situation was this ((No names are to be given, though those who know me will know)): I was an officer in an RP guild, and was known for a somewhat nonstandard character. My characters background is tame, and actually focuses on a lack of dramatics ((Not the scorned child of a deity, no parents killed at the age of 2 and forced to wander the streets. Parents still alive and running a bar)) which some people like and can do well, but I avoid. I also spoke Elvish ((DE SK here)) constantly, for the RP reasons of having light Elves who hear it hate me for corrupting their tounge, Dark Elves hating me for using it, etc. Think comedic annoyance.&amp;nbsp;Things were going well until I joined a raiding alliance to raid amongst the planes. It's something my character would do as a quest for power, for kicks, and to have more lighties and Ikkies to needle. This was looked at with a touch of disdain ((Which given my server's raiding community, I'm not surpried)) New leadership came in, and took such a low IC view of what I was doing, I was stripped of my officership... however, I suspected, and confirmed OOC motivations for this. I went off on the person's RP, which many seem to like and respect as detailed, and short story long, I left the guild.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The problem? The new leader RP'd a vampiric Lloth worshipper turned by Mistmoore himself, with psychic and telekinetic powers, as well as control over any and all spiders due to her matron, Lloth, and was also personally tormented by Saryrn. I disliked the Lloth worship, and flat out refused to accept the spider control ((The spider Adan, or King, is under the direct control of Bertoxxulous, see the Bertox ring event for proof. Saryrn and Terris Thule also have spiders in their power. Are three deities going to allow a sudden newcomer from an outside dimension to claim herself as the "Spider Queen" and delegate control to her followers? Especially when the follower is in direct and personal contention with one of the aforementioned deities? Even if so, wouldn't logic dictate that the control would be limited?)) She used these spiders as literal spies, so that anything done anywhere, anytime was IC information to her, since a random spider that&amp;nbsp;just happened&amp;nbsp;would tell her.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Have any others encountered these types of problems often? How has/does it affect your RP? How do you respond? How would you rank these as threats to good RP? Are there any other prevalent problems to RP across EQ? Discuss.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
