    <description>&lt;DIV&gt;We do not anticipate any problems with having all accounts moved off of the server that have requested it by the end of the 30 day period.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Nothing major here just a couple quick questions. You said that youd be moving chars off of Zek for 30 days. My question is do all moves stop after that 30 days? Meaning if i have 3 accounts moved and 3 accounts still waiting to be moved and the 30 days comes up am i screwed? IM sure its going to be that way im just asking well in advance what the plan is. The free server transfers from Zek are the only reason ive been able to keep my wife playing for the last few months. Ive been on the other server for a week now and shes still there on Zek, getting crankier and crankier as each day passes. Those of you that are married im sure can understand why im posting here. Can SOE please give me some peace of mind and assure me that all 3 of her accounts will indeed be moved before the 30 days. She is worried to hell that because we have 6 accounts only a few will be allowed to transfer. Anyway thanks for your time. &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
