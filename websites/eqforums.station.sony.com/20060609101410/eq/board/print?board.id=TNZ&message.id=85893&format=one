<DIV>Original EQ - awesome, equal footing for adventure</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><EM>Actually, those with high playtimes levelled faster and killed hill giants and eventually killed Naggy and Vox I presume. Wasn't Hate in the original EQ? I can't imagine casual players clearing hate in those days. Massive gap between players.</EM></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Kunark - Minor Keying, but overall equal footing</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><EM>Still big gaps in levels between casual and high playtime players. Epics and dragons get killed by raiders. Massive gap between players.</EM></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Velious - Minor Keying and best expansion to date</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><EM>More raiding, still big gaps in levels between casual and high playtime players. Massive gaps in power.</EM></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Luclin - Moderate Keying, aliens, transporters, the beginning of the downfall of EQ</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><EM>Ditto.</EM></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Planes of Power - Heavy flagging required, mass numbers and playtime required.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><EM>Same raiding content separation, but amazing planar experience significantly closes the gap between casual and high playtime players. Gradually, everyone becomes the same level (65).</EM></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>LDoN - Work your ass off to get points to buy sub-par gear.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><EM>LDoN gear is not sub par.</EM></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>----------------------------</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Gearwise, there's *always* been a *massive* difference in gear between casuals and&nbsp;hardcore players&nbsp;(two very vague terms, I know, but for want of better ones to use). And this has *always* been determined by raiding at the top end of gear progression. The gap is no bigger today than it was ever, I think. If anything it's smaller, because mudflation began to take place in Luclin and Planes of Power which meant even the easy to access items were exceedingly powerful. Difference between rogue epic and&nbsp;dragoon dirk&nbsp;&gt; difference between JTB and wicked shank, for example.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Levelwise, there's usually been a massive level difference too. That has to a certain extent been eradicated. The difference between a casual player and a hardcore player now is very slight, both&nbsp;often being high level (65).&nbsp;AAs give diminishing returns because you pick the best ones first.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The only area in which the gap has perhaps&nbsp;widened is in access to content. But I'd debate even that. In earlier expansions, you could enter many of the zones, but you couldn't venture beyond the zone in anyway. A level 20 character with a rusty sword would not be found in Chardok, for example. There were just as many zones a casual player couldn't enter then as there are now.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The difference today is that the level 20 character mentioned above would have had a massive choice of suitable places to hunt, whereas today they are squeezed into just a few level appropriate zones (BoT, Drunder etc)</DIV>
