				The reasoning why is that the new coding in place for armor, using the enchance character model currently in place only as Drakkin, allows a much higher detailing and the older dye system blanked it out.<br><br>So as a Drakkin, if you dyed your armor you lost much, if not all, of the graphical detail of the pieces.&nbsp; This is due to the dye coding being based on luclin models.&nbsp; Luclin modles are big, bulky hunks of graphic junk, and the method used for dying them is special.&nbsp; In the future, the developers hope to allow a different style of dying for the new graphics code on the enhanced models.&nbsp; This will allow the armor to actual change color and retain details and shading, rathar than&nbsp; dipping the whole piece in a bucket of thick paint.&nbsp; They also wish for new PC models (pending time, resources, and authorization), and adding a more in depth level of individuality to all races for their armor.&nbsp; Including the advanced dye system and more unique amor graphics.. instead of every armor piece sharing similar graphics from level 1 to 75...&nbsp; Different armor pieces will recieve different unique graphics, much like EQ's original models had when velious was released.&nbsp; I don't know of any Drakkin with Tier3/4 armor, but supposedly those have a unique look over the basic Drakkin armor.. Or atleast it was planned to be that way.<br><br>-Wyre<br><div></div>
