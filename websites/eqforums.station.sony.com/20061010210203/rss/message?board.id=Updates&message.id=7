&lt;DIV&gt;EverQuest - Live Update - 08/11/05&lt;BR&gt;----------------------------------&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;*** Headlines ***&lt;BR&gt;----------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;Gukta is no more.&amp;nbsp; The Trolls have retaken their ancestral home and torn down the remembrances of the Frogloks.&amp;nbsp; The Guktans, suffering more than just defeat, have retreated into the Rathe Mountains.&amp;nbsp; They have built a tent city to accommodate their needs, but there is something obviously wrong.&amp;nbsp; Many of their friends and family were touched by the curse laid upon the battlefield by the Warlord Ykesha. These poor souls have been corrupted.&amp;nbsp; They have been torn from the breast of Mithaniel Marr and grasped by the clutching claws of Innoruuk and turned to evil.&amp;nbsp; Yet they are cousins and brothers to the remaining Guktans and so they live together, trying to make the best of their fate.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** Items ***&lt;BR&gt;----------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;- Ancient Mist Root Stone, Refracted Dusk Amethyst, Ancient Life Root Stone, and Refracted Dawn Amethyst are now usable in the hands and wrist slots.&lt;BR&gt;- All potions that were recently introduced now have a required level instead of a recommended level.&lt;BR&gt;- Lightning Singed Mantle now has 38 AC.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** Missions ***&lt;BR&gt;----------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;- Changed the required count for the kill and loot elements on the Dragons of Norrath mission "Diseased Pumas". This change was to fix a discrepancy between the number of items required for task completion compared to the number of kills and items looted that the task said you needed.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
