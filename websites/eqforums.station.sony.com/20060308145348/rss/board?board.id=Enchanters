      <title>Almost over for another enchanter</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Enchanters&amp;message.id=6392#M6392</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;I have played EQ now for some 4-5 years,most all this time as an enchanter.My first toon was actually an Iksar SK which I scrapped when I realized Iksar were hated by all other races.They were a new race,and Kunark at that time was new,so many people who I got to know showed respect towards this new race and its abilities.I was in a bad position though as I played on an old PC with windows 98,and a dial up connection.This was so bad I could not group and was forced to solo through out his career because the lag in a group always got me killed.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I rolled an enchanter after seeing what they were capable of but alas I was still in the same boat - I couldnt group.I didnt mind too much though because the enchanter was a unique class,full of things that made people stop and look,make them jealous of the things we could do.I leveled up at a nice rate soloing,I made zones like LoIO and FM my home for a long time,challenging the giants on a nightly basis.When I managaed to move my hunting grounds to Dreadlands and Burning Woods, I had gotten a new PC and upgraded my connection to DSL.A whole new world opened for me as I was able to group,keep other people alive,and learn CC.Karnors Castle was my new stomping grounds,and many a friend I made there,and never had a problem finding a group.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;When PoP arrived,I was moving as fast through the lower end planes as I could,leveling up as fast as possible,gaining as many AA's as I could to improve myself.I joined a raiding guild and started progression through unseen zones,gaining flags,gaining uber loot,learning how far this class could be stretched,bent,and twisted to do what was neccessary to keep my duties of CC under my belt.But I saw the class starting to go astray,we started losing abilities,losing focus of what we once were.People started saying enchanters were overpowered,that we werent supposed to be a DPS class and we were suppose to do nothing more than buff,slow,and mezz.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Charm which we relied on had taken a downturn,and talk was going around about how Total Domination was nerfed to actually do nothing but waste the AA's we spent on it.Charm didnt last as long as it once did,and even with TD3 it broke fast and often.We complained and were ignored.I struggled through this and GoD,then into OoW.We had more abilities taken away,more of our class defining abilities restrained in the name of Balance which is so one sided against us that it is silly.We were told by more people - &amp;quot;You arent a DPS class,you are suppose to buff&amp;quot;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I struggled through this as well,struggled through different guilds who folded,went astray,destroyed by greed,etc.I struggled through the flagging proccess to get to Anguish.Have been there and conquered those mobs with my guild,and have set our eyes on Vishtmar,DoDH progression,and now PoR.I have more or less realized I will never get all my DoDH spells as these cannot be soloed,and no one wants to repeat these missions.I have tried for 4 weeks now to get help on obtaining these and cannot recieve help from anyone in or out of my guild.And because I have had financial problems and havent been able to buy PoR as of yet,the guild I am in are now getting their spells while I am yet again left waiting my turn - a turn that will never come because as with DoDH,After everyone has their spells from PoR,they will not help other get theirs.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And tonight I recieved a slap in the face of an insult from the very people I guild with,the people I have fought alongside,have kept alive with CC,have set up rune rotations on tanks to keep them standing.When I ask for help in obtaining the spells needed to increase my dps on raids,to help raise the dps of others with mana flare,I am told enchanters are not DPS,and they are basically not important enough to waste time on getting their spells.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This isnt my guild alone,this is a somewhat common issue going on in other guilds.Many of the top guilds on my server do not employ full time enchanters,but have botted toons who gave up the game long ago - toons who are kept to do nothing more than buffs for raids.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I have struggled a long time to keep the faith,to try and believe that one day we might be restored with what we once had as a class - Respect.I am convinced now that we will never see this again though.Most all classes have their own mana regen,other classes have been given our ability to CC,others have superior slow,others have superior dots and nukes,and our mana regen abilities have been bottled to keep us out of groups.Every class has a place in the game now but ours.CC? Not really needed in the newer content if a monk or bard is in group.Mana regen? Potions,bards,beastlords,druids.Haste? Potions,shamans,augs,bards.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We have been forgotten,passed over,and ignored.We have lost the respect we once had.And this has made me wonder if I can struggle longer to see what will come.More spells and abilities I will never see? Gear that is unobtainable because no one wants to tackle the content for a Chanter? Or possibly an upgrade to our charms,made obtainable only through the most high end raid required quests?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It seems to me the only ones who know we are a DPS class,are the ones who played enchanters long ago,when we were looked upon in wonder and admiration.When we had Respect.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Problems with 2.0 since PoR release</title>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Been having issues with the DA portion of my enchanter epic 2.0 in that it isnt absorbing the amount of damage it is supposed to before dropping.It has happened several times in Anguish but as hard as those mobs hit I had taken little notice of it.Tonight I was soloing in Ssra and this happened 4 times in a row - I had ethereal rune up and my epic's aegis right after it - mobs in Ssra were hitting me for 90-150 average and after my ethereal rune had gone down,2-3 hits later my Aegis went off from my 2.0 absorbing less than 400 damage. This needs to be looked at quickly - I bug reported it after hearing in serverwide chanter channel of a few more people experiancing this.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Ive noticed in the last couple weeks a problem that seems to be happening with Stasis,one that has effected not only myself but a few others on raids as well.Three times now I have started cast on stasis only to see a tank engage the mob as I begin casting - I duck to interupt or move foward or back,and yet the stasis still casts,and is resisted instead.This leaves the stasis down,not being able to cast again for the required duration.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This has happened with 2 other enchanters in guild on raids.They mentioned it may be lag which caused this,yet I find it strange that it can happen to 3 differant chanters at differant times in differant zones on differant mobs.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Theft of Thought PROC</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Enchanters&amp;message.id=6321#M6321</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;I just thought I'd post this to try and help people with possible mana pool issues.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The DoD mission &amp;quot;Sabotage!&amp;quot;, when completed with a group level average 63-67, can yield a Voodoo Wand; a nice priest/caster useable weapon that procs Theft of Thought. Now, if you could get this piece to proc only once a minute, that alone would be 40 mana regen per tick (400 a minute). I'm not sure what it's actual proc rate is, but if it were even twice a minute, it would be very nice indeed.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Of course, there are issues to consider if you want to melee a mob for procs... damage shields, attacking from behind to avoid ripostes, etc... but many might consider the pros to outweigh the cons in a lot of cases.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Mind you, the group level must be 63-67 on COMPLETION... you could just do the mission with a higher group, then have one or two people disband and /taskadd a couple of other, lower level people, and complete it. The Wand is Attuneable (so it's droppable), so I'd guess it's a chest drop at the end, and not the only possible one... but some people may want to look into getting one to bandolier in during LoM moments.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I'm sure there'd be plenty to discuss about it. I just wanted to bring it to the community's attention.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Most of you are pretty familiar with who I am, as well as the fact that I'm a Social Scientist and Statistician by trade as well as working on my combined Masters in those fields.  Coding is an essential skill in both fields and at its simplest is developing a daemon to go through a large amount of posts and datamine for certain keywords or combinations therein.  In this case I searched approx 300k posts from &lt;a href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq" target="_blank"&gt;EQlive&lt;/a&gt; (enchanter asylum and veterans) as well as &lt;a href="http://www.therunes.net/forums" target="_blank"&gt;TheRunes&lt;/a&gt; (eq1+lounge).  Keywords included such things as survivability, charm, resist rates and the rest of our favorite buzz-words.  The dates of the search data are from &lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;3-21-04&lt;/font&gt; through &lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;1-15-06&lt;/font&gt;.  After the initial data, I refined the categories and coded by hand through approximately 900 pages (front/back and TINY!) for positive and negative posts in each category.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is what that looks like:&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.magechantry.com/nanyea/code.jpg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Charts not being my specialty because most assuredly I am not a marketing person we see some interesting trends:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of 300k posts more then a third of them are concerning &lt;font color="#cc9900"&gt;Charm&lt;/font&gt;, 14 percent involve a &lt;font color="#cc9900"&gt;lock down mez&lt;/font&gt; and {X+3} content is also very important.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#cc9900"&gt;{X+3} Content Viability&lt;/font&gt; includes such things as being able to use our spells effectively upon xp mobs ie your level +3 as well as having access to the basic tools needed to do so.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#cc9900"&gt;Damage output&lt;/font&gt; is mutually inclusive of charm and when its not is when charm is not a viable option.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#cc9900"&gt;Mana Regen&lt;/font&gt; is broken into both self and group regen which are both significant numbers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As you can see although we are not a vocal population (many reasons including large gaps where no centralized posting place, propensity to box, etc) we are a significant portion of the EQ Population at all levels:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.magechantry.com/nanyea/total.jpg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We also have the third largest population drop off post 60 where in many cases it becomes the antithesis of fun to play an enchanter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Class reinvisionment is an ongoing process but with a third of all active posts relating to charm, any changes must include a broad view of charm.  Some of the more interesting ideas presented or lost among class reinvisionment include:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;removing the rule of 3 from charming&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;clicking off pet buffs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;immunity messages for mez + charm&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;mez mitigation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;spell accesibility&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;charm xp penalty&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;immunity flags/resists in old content&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;risk v. reward&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;survivability&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;in camp v. out of camp CC&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;use of pets in most situation (charm pets included)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;This does not include a few ideas I've been pushing to include:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font color="#cc3300"&gt;Creating a single defensive buff (not limited to one aspect such as a defensive proc, but something that has group and raid applications towards survivability)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font color="#cc3300"&gt;Combining the PBAE Stun and PBAE Mez lines into a single line with a line 7: Reduce Hate by 750&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font color="#cc3300"&gt;Replacing the lost # of spells with a Level + 3 Cap Low resist mez 35% less mana effecient, -75 resist adjustment, 5 ticks base with a 6 second recast.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font color="#cc3300"&gt;Enchanter post KEI clarity line should change the +wis/int mod to V2 overcap so that they may exceed the current caps&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font color="#cc3300"&gt;Charm (currently revising my last few submissions to include a new limiting factor), But I'm not happy unless our pet is dealing 1.0-1.5 times a DPS class in group and the introduction of items and foci specific to Charm&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font color="#cc3300"&gt;I would also like to see mez specific haste foci&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>No more Expansions</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Enchanters&amp;message.id=6197#M6197</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;After reading the last few posts I have made the descision to not buy any further expansions until SOE and its devs realize there is a problem with our class,reply to some of these threads,and give us some answers.Nanyea stated we need to have a united voice on this matter,and maybe hitting them in the wallet by refusing to purchase any more expansions will get their attention.I am one voice,I hope there are others out there who feel the same way and realize this may be the way to get what we have asked for in vain over the past several years.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;We have waited too long and begrudgingly continued to fight in hopes that we may be noticed and aknowledged.We have not staged a sit down or strike like the warriors did a couple years back,we have asked and waited.And waited.And waited.The waiting needs to end.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>Reply to Wolja and the Enchanter Community</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Enchanters&amp;message.id=6188#M6188</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
Wolja wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;Nothing here adds utility for raids. I do not now or have ever wanted to be soley a buff bot and third cousin nuker on raids. I know they can do it from some of the events but they have promised class-balance for nigh on three years now. Some action would assist. You and others have posited some great ideas over the years. When Sony works out there are other thinking chanters, other than Nanyea, action may occur, perhaps.&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Your right Wolja, the problem is they keep quitting/retiring/selling their accounts...&amp;nbsp; There have always been and will be other chanters that seem to be heard alot, thankfully the high wiz-chantress of nukes finally retired... and I could really use some help and other opinions here to help persuade people what chanters could use and what we really need.&amp;nbsp; Probably the biggest blow to enchanters was when they all just quit and accepted what was handed to them.&amp;nbsp; The only place we ever really took a stand was charm, and I think thats what really hurt us... because it is such a controversial issue and the dev team is split on it.&amp;nbsp; They all recognize that is severely underpowered, but no one wants to be the one to put forward a change that suddenly breaks the game stupidly in favor of enchanters.&amp;nbsp; Without a VERY active community which does not exist for enchanters on any board it is VERY hard to rally the support needed to make changes.&amp;nbsp; According to EQPlayers there are tons and tons of chanters out there, in fact its the number 3 most played class.&amp;nbsp; Further fact finding showed that a very significant portion of enchanters quit between 65 and 70, and that almost 2/3rd of the 70 enchanters havent played in almost 4 months.&amp;nbsp; Thats not healthy for any class... so between the snafu that was DX9 engine upgrade, the charm nerf, and the last few months enchanters are on a severe decline... I've been trying to recruit a high end enchanter for months with no luck and no offense but Cestus just took a very sub-par chanter because they were in desperate need too.&amp;nbsp; Most of the uber guilds I know are like this... but its not just uber guilds, its up and down the entire range.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;50-60 has great content for that level, but not for the level of gear people are used to now, and most choose to just powerlevel past it... theres so much 50-60 content in fact that you could play a year straight and still not play all of it, so much storyline that people just skip over because its not worth their time invested v. newer zones.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Unfortuneatly it does fall to me again to bring the bad news, and if not me, it still wouldn't be our fallen Class Correspondent whos working herself to the bone in real life, its another issue but I really wish she would do the right thing and at least tell the community whats going on with her and her duties... and that really leaves very few other people who are gonna step forward and take that big backlash.&amp;nbsp; You guys are mean, and in a way rightfully so because enchanters have been taking hits for the sins of kunark even today the holy trinity haunts us.&amp;nbsp; At the very least you all know who I am, and even if you don't like me or believe me to be some EQ Antichrist, I at least try to keep you guys informed.&amp;nbsp; I really do care about EQ which has been such a big part of my life for the last 6? or is almost 7 years now and the enchanter class is nearest and dearest to me.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;No one is going to magically step forward and say "Enchanter_01" welcome to the EQ inner circle, you will now direct the future of the enchanter class.&amp;nbsp; The community has to come forward, be vocal and intelligent about what they want, present it through the proper and public channels and be active.&amp;nbsp; Passisivity doesn't accompish anything in real life and neither does it work in this game.&amp;nbsp; One of my favorite sociology professors says that the most effective social movements aren't the violent in your face ones, nor the passifist ones, but the ones that are Fiesty... because they stand out, they don't shock and threaten the people in power, nor does it turn off the rest of the community that is vital for their support.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Anyhow I'm going to continue reading the boards daily (which is where I get most of my feedback), using the feedback button, posting, emails, tells, and the like as well as participating in betas and trying to make sure EQ sticks around for the long haul as does the enchanter class.&amp;nbsp; I dont claim to represent the enchanter class, you guys need to speak up and do that for yourself and the rest of us... but I will be there supporting you.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;p.s. as far as my personal agenda for enchanters&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;1) Class Reinvisionment&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;2) Expansion&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;3) Charm&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;4) Raid Viability&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;5) Group Viability&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
