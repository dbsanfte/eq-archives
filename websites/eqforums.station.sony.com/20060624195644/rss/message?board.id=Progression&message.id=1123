      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'll just repeat what I've already said about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Say you're a lvl 40-something casual in the classic era when Naggy and Vox are killed. The uber players will either:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1) Take over the zones you're exping in to farm gear for alts/trading/whatever&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2) Quit, so the casuals will never get to see the later expansions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I'm completely against it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I've never been a fan of farming. I'd rather move on once finished with a given area/encounter. If I'm done with all unlocked content but have to wait for weeks or months to continue, I'd probably just cancel. A progression server isn't much of a &amp;quot;progression&amp;quot; server if you can't keep...you know...progressing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Given the time necessary to key up for the end of each expansion, I don't think anything but EQclassic will be finished quickly. It will naturally take months. Those servers that came up 3-4 years into the game during luclin + PoP took nearly a year to catch up WITH access to all existing content. It will inevitably take longer here with the incremental access to content. When I say &amp;quot;nearly a year&amp;quot; I mean that for the most organized, hardcore 10+ hours daily unemployed basement dweller guilds. (I was part of one of them at the time).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'd bet the fastest most hardcore guild gets to Quarm's corpse in about one year. That's EQclassic + 4 expansions. Ignoring LoY &amp;amp; LDoN, we've still got what, 5 expansions left? That sounds like a nice lineup for year #2 to me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don't think condensing 7 years into 2 is unreasonable. I'm certainly not signing up for another 7 years ;p&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-Chaan&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;1) I really dont see the use of another thread on this topic that will just require everything that has been said to be said again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2) Time-based unlocking isnt in sync with the concept or what the devs have said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3) Please read the other 4 or 5 (rather lengthy) threads on the topic.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As long as unlocking the expansions requires the most difficult encounters to be beaten (and hopefully a variety of encounters) then there is no need for any sort of time limit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And don't forget that they can always have other triggers needed too, like, for any expansion that increases the max level they could require X number of characters to be at the max level of the time in addition to certain kills. Or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you only have to kill the relatively easy encounters, then sure, it probably will open up really fast, but for all we know, this is what the devs *want* to happen. They may envision this server to get 90% caught up in a year or so, and completely caught up in 2 years, and them opening up additional servers like this every 6 months or so, and then slowly contracting older servers if their population falls. Such a strategy, if advertised correctly, might result in more new accounts being started as it gets rid of the major problem non-eq players I know have talked about: they feel like they can never catch up so why bother starting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description>
