It keeps them different from evacs.<br><hr></blockquote><br>Gates: If I want to gate out of combat, I can cast the basic Gate (5 sec). However, if I want to gate to, say, Greater Faydark - that is 7 sec. And gating to Twiligh Sea is 10.5 sec.<br><br>Portals: If I want to evac my group, I can cast Evacuate (9 sec). There is usually no reason to evac to a different zone (there haven't been zones with unsafe succor points in a very long time), but there are evac spells for that too - to Nek, Fay, etc. Now why in the world would I want to portal out of combat instead of evacing? There is a very, very, very small chance of leaving party members behind on evac but nobody would ever portal instead of evac really - just for the reason of leaving the zone. And yet portal spells have casting times from 16 to 24 sec.<br><br>Translocate: If I were to TL somebody else out of combat (so that the mob that's killing them would kill me instead??), there is the basic Translocate spell (8 sec). TL them to Nexus instead of the bind point is 10 sec. But TL to PoK (and some other places) is 15 sec. Why? What possible purpose other than just being inconvenient can that serve?<br><br>None of those spells with extra long casting times are used to escape combat. They are used quite as intended - to transport groups and raids to and from perfectly safe places around the world. And that's where players' time is simply wasted for no real reason.<br></div>
