				<DIV>Went on a guild outing to Sol A with my lvl 26 Vah Shir beastlord. Obvisouly, I couldn't shrink myself since I don't get that spell until lvl 30. However, I do have the spell Tiny Companion for shrinking my pet. It didn't work. I had to stay to the back of everyone else so I wouldn't block the hallways. I and my pet couldn't join in the fight unless we were in one of the rooms. I had to stay back and just watch the hallway fights. This wasn't fair to me and certainly not fair to my guildmates. Now, I know I'm low level and this may not seem as important as the problem the huge pets are causing on raids, but it's important to me. I'm paying for the game so I can have fun. It wasn't fun having to watch the action instead of participating or being worried&nbsp;my pet and I&nbsp;would get trapped in a doorway and everyone would die.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Please, this issue needs to be taken more seriously by those with the power to fix it. </DIV>
