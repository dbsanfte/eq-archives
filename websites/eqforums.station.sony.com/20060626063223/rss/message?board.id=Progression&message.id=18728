      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I never started playing EQ until kunark, and my first toons were all Iskar, so I never really got to enjoy the good ol zones of original EQ other than sol A, Sol B, Oasis, &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;SOl b and lguk definatly 2 of the zones that i missed the most after expansions came out.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Lguk was always the zone EVERYONE went to when they were high enough level because it was basicaly -the- dungeon to go to and everyone wanted to be able to say they were camping frenzy for the fbss or deadside king for the ykesha.&amp;nbsp; Going to that zone was great because you always had to sit at the zone in begging for an invis if you coudlnt cast it yourself in order to try to run to the camps further into the dungeon.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Sol b was great because there seemed to usualy be less people there even though a druid could teleport to lavastorm right outside the zone in and you didnt have to run through a friggen upper guk type place to get to it.&amp;nbsp; Im looking forward to going back there and killing those kobolds in 3 windows, getting some mithril armor, moving onto the scarab or spider rooms .. oh memories.. efreeti boots wee.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;I used to like fear kiting mammoths in Everfrost once my ranger got enough levels not to be one rounded by them. :smileyhappy:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Doing the same to the elephants in South Karana was nice, too. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Vegeta-X on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;06-11-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;08:09 AM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;South Karana was the hot spot (mid 20's to mid 30's) on my old server, I remember it used to crash due to too many people being in there at one time.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;Cazic Thule was by far my favorite zone way back when.&amp;nbsp; As well as Sol A and Sol B.&amp;nbsp; I can't wait to be able to get to these zones again and relive some of the old memories.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The original Cazic Thule zone was lvl 25-35 give or take a few levels. Was the funnest zone in game until they revamped it imo.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;There was a copy of Cazic himself named Avatar of Fear in the lower part who took a good group to kill normaly. Sure hope they bring that back.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;Yeah, I remember the Cazic Thule being a very popular grouping zone for those lvls.&amp;nbsp; I never played there much, other than just grouping in the initial court yard area (and sometimes soloing there during odd hours when it was empty).&amp;nbsp; I hope to try it out a bit more this&amp;nbsp;time around.</description>

&lt;P&gt;I usually started out in the newbie zone for the race I created.&amp;nbsp; Then around 5 or so, I'd head to blackburrow until about 10. Then Kurn's tower until 15ish (18 maybe) and then PC until 25.&amp;nbsp; High Keep until 34 or 35, then Dawnshroud for a few levels, then dreadlands.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;These days, what I'll do is start in the tutorial, go until level 10, then head to the level 10 hotspot, and jump hotspot to hotspot (maybe with a MM thrown in here and there for good measure.)&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;On The Combine, I'm interested in enjoying things like I did before.&amp;nbsp; So that will mean Crushbone will see a visit.&amp;nbsp; I may start an ogre or troll and enjoy those areas as well, since I never played one of them.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;LET ME START this by sayins im fairly drunk..BUT&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;i palyed alot durin g original eq so maybe i can shed some light. in the 30s original split paw was awesome. basically i went from 18-35 in south arkarana /paw so i have some very cool memories of this area. haha, i remmeber the old strat of paw..it wne like this "Don't pull from behind the doors". but don't let'em fool ya, paw was pretty ridic xp int late 30's&amp;nbsp; once you got beyound the doors. you just needed good CC. also, since caic thule is being reverted i'd sugest checking out that rea as well. the thing about original eq is this: it had great dungeon crawls. paw, guk, solb, were all these great gems of zones that no one experience d cause it was HARD. even when kunark hit you had TONS of outdoor zones that encouracged chain pulls to maximze xp just to get from one level to the next. don't get me wrnog, dalnir and nurga were both amazing zones, and were designed with great grouping possibilites in mind. i guess the majory of the blame should be on the mmo&amp;nbsp;playier base in general....that being instant gratification. everyone wants to elevel as soon as possibilie without enjoying everything in between (im guildty of that i admit).&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;but seriously if you want to enjoy eq the way it was meant to be played by the original devs of EQ check out some of the dungeon crawls eq has to offer. even in earlier level blackburorwo/ befallen, najena ( WAY undertutilized), then to paw, sola/b, guk youll enjoy thier original vision of everquest which led into the original planes. those planes in old world gear took true skill and was not a simple race of DPS and chain complete healing.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;well thats my view anyay. hopefully ive been fairly coherent and it will add some fun times to your play time jwalthof. everquest truly is still the best mmo on the market in terms of PVE. EQ2, WoW, daoc, swg, DDO, beta vanguard...none of them come close. everyone just wants to level as fast as possible to hit poorly designed raiding content.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;enjoy this server, it may be the last time you get to experience a truly&amp;nbsp;great game. everquest wasn't put on the video game walk of fame for nothin'.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;Where will we go at those levels now that Mistmoore and Paw are for much higher levels??

&lt;P&gt;I suspect, or read somewhere, that splitpaw will be reverted to the lower level zone it was?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Anyway, crushbone was great, blackburrow, the warrens, the spires in southern karana, the (argh, I forget the name of the birds!) town in southern karana, upper guk, lower guk... lower guk was always too crowded. There was HHK, way too crowded too.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Hunt guards. Those were always good.&lt;/P&gt;</description>
