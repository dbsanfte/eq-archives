				CLASS:&nbsp; Shadowknight
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>HP: Unimportant.&nbsp; A byproduct of gear with high AC<br>Mana: Same as HP<br>Endurance: Completely useless<br>AC:&nbsp;
Most important stat in the game for an SK.&nbsp; All of my gear choices
are based on this number, plus the type 2 mods(e.g. shielding) and
focus effects.<br>
 </div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>HP Regen: Unimportant<br>Mana Regen: Only important if you are not capped.&nbsp; Very easy to cap.<br>Endurance Regen:&nbsp; unimportant<br>
 </div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Strength: not considered when making gear choices<br>Stamina: not considered when making gear choices<br>Agility: not considered when making gear choices<br>Dexterity: not considered when making gear choices<br>Charisma: not considered when making gear choices<br>Intelligence: not considered when making gear choices<br>Wisdom:
not considered when making gear choices.&nbsp; Why does the
shadowknight planar armor from plane of fear have wisdom on it instead
of intelligence?<br>
<br>
 </div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Cold Resist: Generally not important as the high ac gear typically
has decent resists.&nbsp; Resist buff clickies are a whole other story.<br>Disease Resist: Ditto<br>Poison Resist: Ditto<br>Magic Resist: Ditto<br>Fire Resist<img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-very-happy.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0>itto </div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Attack: Not important<br>Delay: Not important<br>Damage: Not important<br>Range: Not important </div>

<div>Haste: Not important can be tributed.&nbsp; I'm having&nbsp; a
hard time optimizing my tranking gear and finding an affordable haste
item.&nbsp; This is at the qvic level </div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Combat Effects: Unimportant<br>Shielding: The second most important stat.&nbsp; This and AC are how i choose my gear<br>Stun Resist: not something i try to find on gear.<br>Strikethrough: unimportant.<br>Spell Shield: Something that i should focus on but it is very hard to find on gear with high ac and shielding<br>Avoidance: the third most important tank stat.&nbsp; <br>Accuracy: unimportant<br>DOT Shielding: Something that i should focus on but it is very hard to find on gear with high ac and shielding </div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

Skill Mods: generally considered useless.&nbsp; <br>
Click Effects: One of the real joys of EQ.&nbsp; I have 17 click effect items that i have collected for this toon.&nbsp; <br>
Proc Effects: Not all that important.&nbsp; Happy with the generic
lifetap effects for SK weapons but would like to see more rune proc
effects for the SK class<br>
Worn Effects: improved dodge, improved parry and similar worn effects
have been shown through parsing to have such a minimal effect on
tanking that it could be nothing more than the RNG playing games.&nbsp;
Completely unimportant.&nbsp; <br>
Focus Effects:&nbsp; Very important at all times to have a magic damage
focus for lifetaps, a distance focus for pulling, a focus for extended
DOTs, mana preservation focus, and for HT we need a generic damage
focus.&nbsp; The generic damage focus is very hard to find.&nbsp;
Almost everything is magic.<br>
<br>
<br>
My gear goals for my SK are to cap shielding and avoidance, put the
highest AC aug i can find in every slot, and pick the highest AC gear
for my content while maintaining the needed focus effects.&nbsp; I
would like to get more spell shielding and dot shielding but the
choices are very limited.<br>

				<DIV>CLASS: Paladin
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>HP: Lack of hitpoints causes death, so definately important. However, having more hitpoints doesnt allow me to tank better. Not as important as AC/Avoid/Shielding and other things that reduce damage taken.<BR>Mana: I definately need mana because I depend on my spells.<BR>Endurance:&nbsp;I have never seen my endurance bard drop... So&nbsp;I dont know.&nbsp;<BR>AC: This is absolutely critical.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>HP Regen: Nice to have.<BR>Mana Regen: We dont get a chance to sit and med, so definately important.<BR>Endurance Regen: Not important.&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Strength: I find str, sta, agi, dex, and wisdom to be very important... However my stats have been above the hard cap for the last several expansions, so I take them for granted.<BR>Stamina: <BR>Agility: <BR>Dexterity: <BR>Charisma: <BR>Intelligence: <BR>Wisdom: </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Cold Resist: All resists are situational to the content.&nbsp;Resisting an NPC spell effect can be crucial to an event. &nbsp;<BR>Disease Resist: <BR>Poison Resist: <BR>Magic Resist: <BR>Fire Resist: </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Attack: Never really noticed a difference, I dont have a whole lot of input as my damage output isnt that great and my role is really a tank who can toss out nice heals.<BR>Delay: <BR>Damage: <BR>Range: </DIV>
<DIV>Haste: </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Combat Effects: <BR>Shielding: I have picked some up, but I dont really notice a difference in my tanking ability. My understanding is it that it is more noticable against NPC that hit really hard.<BR>Stun Resist: I want to max this as nothing is worse than pulling an NPC and being stunned while it gets to take cheap shots.<BR>Strikethrough: This helps me do more damage since I usually attack monsters from the front.<BR>Spell Shield: Dont pay much attention to it.<BR>Avoidance: I notice a big difference in tanking with this.<BR>Accuracy: Dont pay much attention to it.<BR>DOT Shielding: Dont pay much attention to it.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Skill Mods: I have never had a skill mod item.<BR>Click Effects: I like clicky ac/mana regen/resists. <BR>Proc Effects: I like heal procs on my weapons.<BR>Worn Effects: I used to dread giving up my faerune item, but now that it is an AA it isnt so bad.<BR>Focus Effects: Improved Dodge, Parry are awesome. I want to get cleave and ferocity eventually.<BR></DIV></DIV>

				Class:Warrior<br><br>HP: Pretty important to a tank of course but I don't necessarily need more just so mobs can be made to hit harder<br>Mana:meh<br>Endurance: Important for using skills discs but I don;t have any problems with the way it's been itemized so far<br>AC: The most important tank stat gimme more more more.<br><br>HP Regen: meh, not important to me at all unless I'm soloing. I'm getting heals right?<br>Mana Regen: N/A<br>Endurance Regen: *blink**Did you actually just say Endurance Regen? It's the single most deficient part of the entire game and it needs to be addressed, End Regen should be about on par with Mana Regen for casters.<br><br>Strength, Stamina etc: Nothing wrong with the way they are now, no need for more unless the caps get raised again<br><br>Resists: Could use a bit more on these, for example I'm way over the cap on all my physical stuff but I have a hard time getting enough resists. Then again, anything I really need to resist is probably unresistable.<br><br>Attack: meh it adds dps but doesn't really help me do my job as a tank, easily maxxed though.<br>Delay: I want to avoid ripostes and damage shields so higher delay weapons are where it's at for warriors in my opinion, lower delays for offhanders i suppose but I'm really more concerned with aggro than anything else where weapons are concerned.<br>Damage: I want high damage to go with that higher delay<br>Range: Wouldn;t mind having a ranged attack that I don't have to swap aout with my "good" range item. I know bandolier helps but I still don't have enough bandoliers.<br>Haste: Important but there's nothing wrong with the way it's done now except maybe put it on some more items so it's not such a dkp hog.<br><br>Combat Effects: Need more items with it that also have stats like Avoidance, Shielding and AC, I need more CE but I can;t really sacrifice other things for it like i'd like to.<br>Shielding: Big time need for this on items, augs or whatever, we can't sacrifife it.<br>Stun Resist: need more<br>Strikethrough: meh.get rid of ALL the spam though please.<br>Spell Shield: big<br>Avoidance: see shielding<br>Accuracy: meh<br>DoT Shielding: i never notice it but I guess so<br><br>Skill mods: Defensive stuff I like<br>Click effects: I love them, from the useful stuff to illusions or whatever, just need more buff slots to go with them<br>Proc Effects: Static Blow please, better augs weapons with proc rates etc, did I mention Static Blow?<br>Worn effects: defensive stuff<br>Focus effects: give me enough EoA to keep up with other classes' aggro output.<br>Shields: Yes glad you asked we need more good shields and better ways to use them, say a warrior useable weapon similar to what knights get that can only be used with a shield?<br><br><div></div>

				Merloc thanks for asking!<br>
<blockquote><div>-------<br>CLASS: Monk<br>
</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>HP: Important up to a point, less important after it becomes
acceptable to take several rounds from mobs you run into (but never not
important)<br>Mana: Not important<br>Endurance: Not terribly important
past a point (I have nothing to spend end on if burning after a point -
on plows regen is the issue, not pool size)<br>AC:Important up to a
point - Once you're above the soft cap its not terribly important, the
rate of return isnt optimal for a leather class, so its a hard stat to
focus on imo.&nbsp; I'd like more, but I just don't see SoE ever
getting away from the armor archtype blinders.<br>
 </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>HP Regen: Not really important- I'm capped, but 45 regen doesnt do much against the 1k-10k hitters I run into, even in exp grps<br>Mana Regen: Not important<br>Endurance
Regen: Important to a point, it takes about 30-40minutes in an exp
group with constant use to go through an end bar, unfortunatly it takes
even longer to refill.&nbsp; We just don't have much to use end on, so
unless that changes, its only marginally useful.<br>
 </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Strength: I'm capped, its not terribly useful.&nbsp; I also have
an archiac weight penalty, what good does it do me besides a few atk
and end?<br>Stamina: Likewise capped , not useful except for some hp, some end.<br>Agility: Likewise capped, only useful for a few pitiful (very few) avoidance ac and some end.<br>Dexterity: Likewise capped, only useful for minor proc gains and some end.<br>Charisma: Likewise capped- not useful, im LONG passed the merchant cap, and likewise its only minorly beneficial on DI fires.<br>Intelligence: Not capped - only useful in tradeskills.<br>Wisdom:Capped
- only useful in tradeskills...its rather hard to come by at lower
levels, meaning melee have an inherrant tradeskill disadvantage.<br>
 </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Cold Resist: Almost capped - the resist system has its problems,
but I enjoy having 600 vs all self buffed, semi-useful on some aes
(mostly older content)<br>Disease Resist: See above<br>Poison Resist: See above<br>Magic Resist: See above<br>Fire Resist:See above<br>
 </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Attack: Useful, unfortunatly its easy to cap....not useful after that<br>Delay: I'm beginning to see rounding errors on monk weapons at low delay, I'm still gathering concrete evidence though<br>Damage: Useful duh~<br>Range:250 or so on throwing is useful, under that sorta sucks.<br>
 </div>
<div>Haste: I've been capped at 40-45% on items for about 6yrs
now.....but nice to have a decent selection available for moving gear
around (its currently on like 3 items I have- or will be soon)<br>
 </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Combat Effects: Pretty much useful only for dps procs...which don't exist in abundance anymore due to dmg augs being more dps<br>Shielding: Useful, but not my major focus - i prefer to not take hits<br>Stun
Resist: Not really useful as a monk at all, although I think i may end
up near cap just because it works out that way eventually<br>Strikethrough: Very useful, sorta hard to get, I want to be sure im at 35% if possible at all times.<br>Spell
Shield: Very useful, harder to get until DK, I aim for 35%.&nbsp;
Harder to raise due to rareness on melee gear until DK - casters in
guild are at like 50% easily - no monk serverwide has 35% I believe.<br>Avoidance: Useful, unfortunatly everyone and their brother has 100 and its on all sorts of gear.<br>Accuracy:
Very useful, unfortunatly the cap needs to be raised imo.&nbsp;
Probably on the short list of most-desired mods for any dps class. <br>DOT
Shielding:Moderatly useful, depends alot on amount of DoT AE
itemization (currently not tons in game), harder to raise, needs to be
on more melee gear. Ditto as spell shielding.<br>
 </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Skill Mods: +Block% fairly useful (and too **SMURF** rare, 1 weapon in
luclin, time tunic, anguish legs...thats it), +Dodge% not so much, the
rest are....there are no others in game for monks really =/<br>Click
Effects: More needed!&nbsp; Lots of stacking issues though - especially
more overhaste, too **SMURF** rare.&nbsp; Other clickies like monk class
items (anguish tunic, vish cloak) are rather lame imo - especially the
vish cloak, why put in a 1200dd clicky that takes away from your dps
when clicking? not a large upgrade at all....<br>Proc Effects:
Zzzzzzzzzzzzz...boring for awhile now.&nbsp; Fiery Strike V, VII,
VIIII, IX, XI, XIXIXIXVIIIIVIVIOSDUIDOMGIMSOBORED.....oh and bring back
Serpents Bite - and upgrade it...seriously a proc that is missing from
monk weapons!<br>Worn Effects: You need more +FK dmg mods, um, I can't
really think of anything else in this category.&nbsp; Too bad that 10
fk is only worth about 2-2.5dps though.<br>Focus Effects: Yaay~....look down<br>
  <br>
Improved Block = very useful, too rare on items though (IB4 is only on
2 items, my class only items, and a rare bracer from a zone not
condusive to farming), its also very rare on lower lvl items vs
say....Parry items that pop up all over.<br>
Improved Dodge = semi useful, but not nearly as much as block, decent itemization currently.<br>
Ferocity = not too useful for a monk, going from 5 to 6 added about
5dps....its a very lame focus for monsk, we need alternatives...<br>
Cleave = pretty useful, not a huge dps increase but still seeing decent gains, itemization for monk is nice.<br>
Other mods = Um, at one point or another a few other mods have appeared
on gear...unfortunatly, theyre not very useful (ie anguish tunic's
focus only adds about 2-3dps at most), melee need serious help.<br>-------</div></blockquote><br><div></div>

Most of the things Chanters do, there is not much scaling as gear progresses.&nbsp; Slows are the same percentage. Mezz only varies in duration by 1 tick on a high end gear chanter over a naked one.&nbsp; No foci effects debuffs or buffs other than duration which REALLY doesn't matter all that much.&nbsp; But adding a Foci that effects runes by X% would start to make so gear difference between chanters, in my humble opinion anyway.</P><p>Message Edited by Breez_Bayou on <span class=date_text>07-06-2006</span> <span class=time_text>12:44 PM</span>

One of the reasons I quit playing so much was the feeling of being overwhelmed at having to replace ALL my focus effects and the domino effect it would have as I lost functionality to replace gear.<BR></DIV><p>Message Edited by Gloriana-EM on <span class=date_text>07-06-2006</span> <span class=time_text>12:49 PM</span>

				<DIV>CLASS:&nbsp; Ranger</DIV>
<DIV>Raiding Experience : Guild recently got into Txevu, we've killed a couple named in there but have yet to make a serious drive towards the boss of the zone (and Tacvi access)</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>HP:&nbsp;&nbsp; Very Important<BR>Mana:&nbsp; Middle importance.&nbsp; Recast on our nukes puts me low only if I don't have a mana regen buff, or if I'm burning Hail of Arrows as fast as I can<BR>Endurance:&nbsp; Zero Importance<BR>AC:&nbsp;&nbsp; Important.&nbsp; It helps when soloing if not bow kiting, and also helps when assisting as a Tank Mezzer</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>HP Regen:&nbsp; Unimportant<BR>Mana Regen:&nbsp; Middle importance.&nbsp; Not that hard to cap, but recast on most nukes make it harder to run out of mana<BR>Endurance Regen:&nbsp; Zero Importance</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Strength:&nbsp; Middle importance until capped; afterwords, only importance is in keeping capped.<BR>Stamina:&nbsp; Very Important.&nbsp; More Sta = more HP.&nbsp; One of three most important stats to try to keep capped, or to get capped.&nbsp; After capped, only importance on gear is in keeping it capped.<BR>Agility:&nbsp; Unimportant.&nbsp; Little impact upon defensive abilities that I've noticed.</DIV>
<DIV>Dexterity:&nbsp; Very Important.&nbsp; One of three most important stats to try to keep capped, or to get capped.&nbsp; After capped, only importance on gear is in keeping it capped.<BR>Charisma:&nbsp; Unimportant.<BR>Intelligence: Zero Importance<BR>Wisdom: Very Important.&nbsp; One of three most important stats to try to keep capped, or to get capped.&nbsp; Third of these character stats after Sta and Dex.&nbsp; After capped, only importance on gear is in keeping it capped.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Cold Resist: <BR>Disease Resist: <BR>Poison Resist: <BR>Magic Resist: <BR>Fire Resist: </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>All resists are equally important.&nbsp; I don't look at these Very Important statistics when looking at gear however, because for the most part resists tend to go upwards as one acquires more and better gear from raids.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Attack:&nbsp; Very Important until one exceeds the cap, then only importance is in keeping at or near the cap<BR>Delay:&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>Damage: <BR>Range: </DIV>
<DIV>Haste:&nbsp; Important.&nbsp; Melee need to keep one (or two, or maybe even three) haste items on them to allow all but one to be upgraded with a non-haste item, but so long as there is at least one worn haste item, the presence of haste on any other potential upgrade is moot (especially with Enchanter haste spells being as high haste as they are).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The other stats in this grouping seem to be intended for weapons.&nbsp; Obviously, a high Range for a ranged attack is desireable - it helps to have a greater pulling range, especially with mob runspeeds nowadays, and the potential to avoid some mob AE's by using ranged instead of melee combat can permit the healers to concentrate more on those who cannot avoid the AE's thusly.&nbsp; Weapon Damage is Important in and of itself.&nbsp; Weapon Delay is also Important in and of itself (high delays on 2 handers reduce the number of ripostes taken and increase the Damage Bonus per hit, and low delays on one handers increase both the number of ripostes taken and the number of times per minute that the Damage Bonus is applied).&nbsp; Taken together, however, you get the Very Important Damage/Delay ratio.&nbsp; The ratio is of more importance than either the damage or the delay is, on their own.&nbsp; As a note, for archery attacks, the Damage on the arrow is Very Important (as opposed to just Important) because it is added to the damage of the bow when the game determines how hard that particular attack hit.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Combat Effects: More procs.&nbsp; 'nuff said.<BR>Shielding: Helps tanks more than it does me.&nbsp; I'll take it, but its Unimportant.<BR>Stun Resist: Helps tanks more than it does me.&nbsp; I'll take it, but its Unimportant.<BR>Strikethrough: Important.&nbsp; Worth keeping between the 25% and 35% marks if possible to do so without augs, especially as I don't get any Strikethrough AA's.<BR>Spell Shield:&nbsp;Important.&nbsp; Reduces the damage from AE nukes that I cannot avoid while raiding.&nbsp; Outside of raids, Unimportant because mobs don't tend to nuke that badly.<BR>Avoidance: Important.&nbsp; see AC.<BR>Accuracy: Important.&nbsp; Fewer misses means more damage dealt in the same amount of time.<BR>DOT Shielding: Important, but only for raiding, as few mobs outside of raids seem to bother with dots, and those that do can typically be cureed by the group in short order (unlike raids where the healers are busy concentrating on the tanks).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Skill Mods: Not sure if weapon skill mods do much of anything.&nbsp; Other skill mods, such as Dodge, Parry, Riposte, and tradeskill mods, can be useful depending on the skill being modified and how often it is used.&nbsp; The Parry +4% mod on my arms that I got in Time, for example, only help when I'm being attacked.<BR>Click Effects: Depends on the effect.<BR>Proc Effects: Depends on the effect.&nbsp; I'm partial to lifetaps, personally, as are many rangers and beastlords in my guild.&nbsp; Most tanks I know prefer stun or other aggro procs though.<BR>Worn Effects: Faerune is an important worn effect, for both the vision and the Enduring Breath component, but only one (or two, for freedom of upgrade purposes) is needed.&nbsp; Most other worn effects have since been changed over to stats (worn ATK, worn Regen, mana regen, etc.) so not too sure what you're looking for here.<BR>Focus Effects: Important.&nbsp; I've even given up an aug slot for Improved Heal V.&nbsp; Improved Damage foci are very useful for nukes, and Burning Affliction foci are very useful for dots (not that I've got many of those heh).&nbsp; The Omens change from ID and BA to elemental-specific nuke and dot combined foci makes it harder to find the appropriate foci for some casters, though the ranger 1.5 and 2.0 have made this a lot easer for me personally.&nbsp; The melee foci are also Important.&nbsp; However, I will sacrifice a melee or spell focus on a piece of gear if the new piece of gear is a clear AC and HP upgrade, especially if the new piece has more HP unaugged than my old piece did augged.&nbsp; The AAAA crafted augs are a very nice method of obtaining foci.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>HP Regen: (nice, but don't bother, we need healed in spurts and sitting around waiting on HP isn't something we are really wanting to do or going to do when we have healer watching over us, give it to necros who are trying to counter a side affect)<BR>Mana Regen: (umm... don't bother, again don't have any, don't want any)<BR>Endurance Regen: +4 or +5 (need serious attention in monks who spend our days serving up mobs to people sitting on their butts)</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Strength: 15 (nice for hitting mobs, not so nice for equipment weight, maybe add in a calculation to add a little tolerance to a monks weight restrictions)<BR>Stamina: (Same as HP)<BR>Agility: 20 (the higher the better, need items that concentrate primarily here and Dex)<BR>Dexterity: 20 (the higher the better, need items that concentrate primarily here and Agi)<BR>Charisma: (nice, but don't bother, isn't it part of a class description to be a hermit and not be good with people, vow of poverty, etc...)<BR>Intelligence: (don't bother)<BR>Wisdom: (don't bother)</DIV>

<DIV>Haste: 60% (have you ever thought about letting this stack for a monk)</DIV>

<DIV>Combat Effects: +25 (nice, as I have stated it would be nice to do the same amount of damage as everyone else, since I get so little time)<BR>Shielding: +25 (not nice getting smacked in the back of the head while looking for your group during a pull)<BR>Stun Resist: +25 (nice and great for pulling)<BR>Strikethrough: +25 (I think this ability was made for a monk)<BR>Spell Shield: +25 (not nice getting nuked in the back by a mob)<BR>Avoidance: +25 (yup, I'm not meant to take a hit, I'm just not suppose to get hit at all)<BR>Accuracy: +25 (sure, but I swear all these new abilities are so low in how many points we can get off a piece of armor then why bother)<BR>DOT Shielding: +25 (yikes, ya, need it, second most likely to be DoTTed (tank first), since we are the first to say high to a mob, just ask the undead in Arcstone... first dot, then follow is their golden rule)</DIV>

<DIV>CLASS: ROGUE</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>As a rogue that is raiding the end game there are only really&nbsp;two things that I look for in loot.&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>1. dps</DIV>
<DIV>How will it increase my dps?&nbsp; My attack is maxed so untill the cap is increased there isn't really anything I can do there.&nbsp;&nbsp; However over on the rogue boards they have parsed that for ever 10 attack I gain roughly 1dps so the more attack the better.</DIV>
<DIV>Accuracy...yes please</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>And the 1 big thing that is important in this area would be +bs damage.&nbsp; It pains me to have to keep my time bp because I am not yet maxed at 125.&nbsp; It was a great start that you guys added 3 items in demi plane with +bs damage on it thank you very much for that, but I just hope that there will be more options in the future.&nbsp; Having to wear gear that is from pop, god, and anguish because I can't afford to replace them due to the decrease in my dps (which is my main role I might add) is very discouraging.&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>So untill my main hand weapon choice is freed up from my 2.0 I will constantly look for other ways to increase my dps.&nbsp; Stagnation isn't good for water and it isn't good for my gear.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>2. Ways to keep my butt alive.</DIV>
<DIV>This would be via hp, or shielding, avoidance, dot shielding, spell shielding, ect....&nbsp; A dead rogue does no dps so I have to avoid agro first, and secondly I have to live through any ae ramp/spell ae that the mobs put out.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Really my stats are maxed so I don't pay attention to them anymore.&nbsp; My resists are very high and untill the cap is raised I won't bother with them.&nbsp; And ac? HA I don't tank there for I care not.</DIV>

				I've played an Enchanter since November of '99 with some breaks in between. Now I play at the top end raiding, so my perspective will be focused there. Mainly in relation to itemization, Enchanters are expected to do the same job they always have but on a very uneven playing field versus mobs compared to the other caster's jobs.<br><br>CLASS: Enchanter<br> <br>HP: Being one of the most frontline casters HP used to be more important than anything. However, as mob dmg went up exponentially, and gear only raised moderately, this went out of focus.<br>Mana: Now the lifeblood of all I do, mana is obviously the most vital to functioning. However, I rarely find my problems [death, et c.] come from a lack of mana<br>Endurance: No impact <br>AC: The caster cap has remain unchanged so long and the way silk classes mitigate make this almost useless. Perhaps thats an issue that needs to be fixed, rather than gear<br> <br>HP Regen: Downtime reducer, even with max regen its not enough to make it that worthwhile<br>Mana Regen: Obviously most important but hard caps make it overly abundant. <br>Endurance Regen: Not important to me, but its also nonexistant I think<br> <br>Strength: Helps me carry that 100k plat and thats about it<br>Stamina: Its important for me to have max sta because its more hp, thats about it<br>Agility: Not important to me<br>Dexterity: Also not important unless Im soloing with Lilac<br>Charisma: The myth stat of enchanters, I'm at the cap and I'd like to think it affected my mez and charm but I believe its such a small help its not important<br>Intelligence: More mana, more tradeskills help, easily capped<br>Wisdom: No relevance to me <br> <br>Resists: Always important but the way resists seem to work makes it not worth the effort to have them maxed for most new content. For old content though and exp groups, max resists are wondeful<br> <br>Combat Effects: No relevance<br>Shielding: Vital to an Ench, perhaps slightly harder to come by. While I'm sure everyone will scream for shielding, I think it would help enchanter survivability<br>Stun Resist: Vital, shaking off that stun during mez intense moments can be the saving factor. Every moment I'm stunned mobs are killing people<br>Strikethrough: No relevance<br>Spell Shield: Very useful and more easily gotten for casters<br>Avoidance: I loathe Avoidance; I'm so far past the cap and it seems they think if they throw an Avoid mod on something, they can leave off something actually useful.<br>Accuracy: No relevance<br>DOT Shielding: Like SS but rarer<br> <br>Skill Mods: Not enough, and the ones that exist don't do anything unless it raises your skill a certain amount. That 8% mod on Time robe is completely useless. The 12% mod on DP back actually does something though since it raises the skill enough points. <br>Click Effects: The few ench specific clickies have been nice, it would be nice to see some more in the future but we've been told they're too unbalancing<br>Proc Effects: No relevance, although I think any caster proc weapons should have a better mod since we suck, but then we might be meleeing all the time<br>Worn Effects: Can't think of any ench specific atm<br>Focus Effects: Probably one of the most frustrating factors of gear planning<br><br>Innoruuk's Irony: the tash focus, is on 2 items. One is from Anguish gloves and the other is an aug from a LDON raid that you can only con people into doing once because its so boring. See, this focus would have been great on DP class item... or you know, any other item option. <br><br>Reagent Conservation: Last seen on an anguish mask, and there was really nothing in between there and reagent conservation V or whatever it was, makes this a useful but almost nonexistant focus. You could always take away the peridots from our rune and alendar line,... but I figure this is a more viable option <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-wink.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0><br><br>Spell Specific mana pres: Seen on almost every DP class item... the 25% Mana preservation. I'm sorry but this is just ridiculous when almost everyone running around in these zones already is going to have 20% Mana pres. That 5% for ONE spell doesn't make it worthwhile. I pray this never shows up again and I'll leave it at that.<br><br>Since they seem set on keeping some focus' capped, perhaps in the higher end the focus range could be decreased. If you want to keep Detrimental Mana Pres at 20%, then say the focus in Demi could be 3-20%, DK could be 5-20%.<br><br>Really, looking back over the past 3 expansions items they are boring, unoriginal and provide very few options for some essential focus' [altho I will say Last Bloods helped this issue to an extent but also caused a bunch of other problems]. Obviously not every item can be a "WOW, I just HAVE to have that" but they are currently nonexistant. And a final note, cookie cutter items are NOT okay, and everyone notices it. It makes item design look lazy and like they don't really care about their job.

<P>Doh... Forgot about the Melee Focus Effects like Cleave and such... guess they need to be more promenant since I forgot they even existed refer to Wycca's post as he is got it down... mainly made this post so that you had a Lower End Monk example too... not everyone finds it easy to max all stats as a monk without getting penalties for weight.</P>
<P>And you missed that in your list of things to look at</P>
<P><FONT color=#ff0099 size=7>WEIGHT </FONT>is crucial to a monk, so on all those items you have labeled "Beast, Druid, Monk" make them light as that Beasts and Druids don't care how much they way... but I got to maintain my girlish figure.</P>

				CLASS: Monk
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>HP: Important, but not the most important<br>Mana: Useless<br>Endurance: Somewhat important, but regen is more valuable<br>AC: Very important.&nbsp; Defense helps in all aspects of the game.&nbsp; Lots of mobs AE rampage.<br>
 </div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>HP Regen: Decently important<br>Mana Regen: Useless<br>Endurance Regen: Extremely important<br>
 </div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Strength: Not that important<br>Stamina: Not that imporant<br>Agility: Not that imporant<br>Dexterity: Not that imporant<br>Charisma: Not that imporant<br>Intelligence: Useless<br>Wisdom: Not that imporant - grants extra endurance, i think<br>
 </div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Cold Resist: Once resists cap, they are useless.&nbsp; Sometimes useless when facing raid mobs nowadays too.<br>Disease Resist: <br>Poison Resist: <br>Magic Resist: <br>Fire Resist: </div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Attack: Useful<br>Delay: Not sure.&nbsp; I guess useful.&nbsp; As long as the DPS output is comparable, i could care less of the delay<br>Damage: As long as DPS output is comparable, i could care less about the actualy DMG #<br>Range: Would be nice to have endless quiver type AA to make range item throwing useful.<br>
 </div>

<div>Haste: Capped for years at 40 to 46.<br>
 </div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Combat Effects: Very important, especially in PvP pre-nerf of 2.0.<br>Shielding: Very important, especially in PvP, AE rampaging mobs, and pulling.&nbsp; Definitely not enough Shielding items for monks.<br>Stun Resist: Very important, especially in PvP<br>Strikethrough: Fairly important<br>Spell Shield: Fairly important<br>Avoidance: Very important, but there is an abundance of items with Avoidance.&nbsp; Is easy to cap.<br>Accuracy: Fairly important, but there is quite a few accuracy items available<br>DOT Shielding: Fairly important.<br>
 </div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Skill Mods: <br>Click Effects: Need more inventory slots available
if we have more clickies.&nbsp; Or possibly much longer buff timers.&nbsp;
Casters clickies are affected by Extended Enhancement, where as Pure
melee isn't.&nbsp; More overhaste clicky options too.<br>Proc Effects: Wish we were able to stun high level mobs, as well as monk 2.0 pre-PvP nerf.<br>Worn Effects: Fairly important.&nbsp; Need more Cleave 5+ gear available.<br>Focus Effects: Monks only have like 2 or 3 Focus that I've seen.&nbsp; Could use a lot more.<br>
-------<br>
<br>
Overall, however, I would like to see itemization equal out across the
board.&nbsp; It's sad to see a plate class get a BP from the exact same raid
mob, but it has 30 more AC, more hps, more resists, and usually more
mods (like Shielding, etc).&nbsp; For example, the Kess BP's.&nbsp; I don't think
gear should have the exact same stats/mods on them, but equal it out a
bit more.&nbsp; For example, if warriors get 100AC + 6% shielding BP, maybe
a different armor-type class would see a 50AC + 4% shielding + 4%
spellshield + 30 additional resists.<br>
<br>
I hope the input helps!<br>

				<div>Thanks for taking the time to do this. Here you go.<br>
<br>
-------<br>CLASS: Enchanter<br>
Progression Level: Tacvi/MPG Trials<br>
</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>HP: Critical.&nbsp; Enchanters get beat on more than any non-tank class.&nbsp; HPs give us a slim chance of surviving it.<br>Mana:
Irrelevant.&nbsp; My gear all has mana on it because gear at this level
does, but I never look at the numbers.&nbsp; I die before I run out of
mana 99% of the time. For that other 1%, there's Gather Mana.<br>Endurance: Obviously Irrelevant.<br>AC: Mostly irrelevant. The current returns on this are so laughable that I can't see giving it any priority.<br>
 </div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>HP Regen: Irrelevant for all useful intents and purposes.<br>Mana
Regen: Was once moderately important, now is another number I don't
even look at.&nbsp; I routinely catch myself looking at a piece of
gearing and thinking "Oh. That has mana regen on it."&nbsp; The cap is
so easy to reach at this level of progression that it's beside the
point.<br>Endurance Regen:&nbsp; This stat doesn't actually EXIST.<br>
 </div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Strength: Irrelevant.<br>Stamina: Good to keep at cap, but so easy at this gear level that it's irrelevant.<br>Agility: Less irrelevant than it used to be, but still not something I'd assign any great priority.<br>Dexterity: Completely worthless.<br>Charisma: Important, and surprisingly hard for an enchanter to keep at cap. <br>Intelligence: Irrelevant. I'm over my cap by something like 150pts.&nbsp; <br>Wisdom: Irrelevant.&nbsp; Not a stat for my class.<br>
 </div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Cold Resist: Moderately useful<br>Disease Resist: Moderately useful<br>Poison Resist: Moderately useful<br>Magic Resist: Moderately useful<br>Fire Resist: Moderately useful </div>

<div>&nbsp;<br>
Generally, unless I have on resist that is falling far behind the
others, I look at "total resists" rather than any single resist in
particular.<br>
<br>
</div>

<div>Attack: Irrelevant.<br>
Delay: Irrelevant.<br>Damage: Irrelevant. I don't even hold a weapon these days.<br>Range: No need.<br>
 </div>

<div>Haste: Irrelevant.<br>
 </div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Combat Effects: Irrelevant.<br>Shielding: Very small returns here,
but I'm working on it just because I have nothing else other than HP to
improve my survivability.<br>Stun Resist: Critical up to cap, irrelevant once that cap is passed. Not getting stunned is crucial.<br>Strikethrough: Irrelevant.<br>Spell Shield: Moderately relevant. Seems very easy to get, and its utility is diminished by our runes.<br>Avoidance: Critical to cap out.&nbsp; Enchanters geat beat down in melee a lot, and this helps us live.<br>Accuracy: Irrelevant.<br>DOT Shielding: Fairly important.&nbsp; Beats out spell shielding because our rune spells don't help against DoTs.<br>
 </div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

Skill Mods: Basically irrelevant.&nbsp; The actual impact of these is so small as to be virtually nonexistant.<br>
Click Effects: Depends on the click, but some are very useful.<br>
Proc Effects: Fun, but not important.<br>
Worn Effects: Faerune is great because I'm lazy.&nbsp; No other worn effects are relevant for me that I can think of.<br>
Focus Effects: Varies from focus to focus.&nbsp; Some are critical
(Detrimental spell haste) others are trash (beneficial range.)<br>
<br>

				<div><br><blockquote><hr>Merloc-DEV wrote:<br><div>Hello Everyone,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Before I get too far along, I thought I'd ask for some feedback from players on how they view different stats with respect to the class(es) they play.&nbsp; Obviously, I have my own view on things, but I'd like to know how any why people have their own views.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>What I'd like, is for you to&nbsp;take a look at this list of the basic item stats (feel free to include any others that I left out), and let me know how and why they think they are, or aren't, important to your class.&nbsp; All comments are useful, and feel free to use current items as examples to illustrate your points if you feel the need.&nbsp; Be sure to INCLUDE THE CLASS name, so I can put your feedback in context.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hopefully, I'll gain some new insights that will help me do my job better.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thanks.</div>
<br><hr></blockquote><br><br>You sure you know what your getting in to?&nbsp; As a Anguish geared Ranger and Shaman (and played a mage twink quite a bit) I just have a few general suggestions.&nbsp; Now, my biggest grip in itemization goes along with a items spell focus effects, but there are other issues.<br><br><br>First, look at the itemization of Vex Thal as an example of end zone itemization.&nbsp; Not only did it have a distinct mix of useful and unique items, there was also the lack of weapons which made it worthwhile.&nbsp; It was, and still is, the best itemized end expansion zone in EQ.<br><br>Second, class only items were cool when they first came out in PoP.&nbsp; But by now, with melee using their Epic 2/2.5 and non-melee having to give up their epics to wield (clerics excepted), they have become a waste.&nbsp; Getting 2x necro dagger (Dagger of Death)&nbsp; on ever 2 out of 3 Yihist kills in Tacvi is a beyond ridiculus.&nbsp; Additionally, go4ing to the OoW expansion itemization, beastlords made out.&nbsp; Not only did they get a Bst only 2hander from MPG trials, but they Bst only 1hander off Ture which is a carbon copy of the War/Rang/Rog/Bard/Monk/Bst 1 handed blunt off KtH (along with their Epic).&nbsp; This kind of itemization is pure laziness.<br><br>Third, a class like a shaman or druid is extremly dependent on their gears focus effects.&nbsp; Due to both the offensive and defensive nature of these classes, they need to have focus effects of just about every type.&nbsp; This includes:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; healing focus<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; beneficial mana preservation<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; detrimental mana preservation<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; beneficial spell haste<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; detrimental spell haste<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; beneficial buff duration<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; detrimental debuff/dot duration<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; beneficial spell range (for heals)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; detrimental spell range (more for druid nukes)<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Damage focus for shaman includes<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  Magic (DoTs)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  Poison (DDs, Rains, AEs, DoTs)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  Cold (DD)<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Damage focus for druids includes<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Fire<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  Cold<br><br>In PoP is wasnt too difficult to fill in a focus needs.&nbsp; This is because you had spell Focus that covered more then one line.&nbsp; Conservation of Xegony covered both bene and detri mana pres.&nbsp; Fury of Solusek covered all DDs (I dont believe DoT focus was in the game at this point).&nbsp; <br><br>But now, equiping a shaman has problems in items with different needed focus effects taking the same slot.&nbsp; If I want beneficial mana preservation (Avariciousness of the Ikaav) and I'm in a Anguish level guild (so Anguish minus OMM, Tacvi including Tunat, DoN through YarLir, DoDH - Shyra/Bloodeye) I have limited choices.&nbsp; They include the BP from Tunat, boots from MPG Trial of Adaptation (which isnt normally farmed), the Ring of Deterance from AMV in Ang, the Shroud of Surging Storm from Yarlir (very rare drop, think we have gotten 3 in 30kills).&nbsp; Now, if I got the MPG trial boots then I cant use Anguish boots which has Beneficial Mana pres.&nbsp; So I have to get that from somewhere else.&nbsp; If I wanted posion damage focus, for which there is only one gear option between the Tacvi/MPG level loot and Demi-plane, that being the Eye of Rikk from Rikk.&nbsp; This is a Range so this would force me to drop my Crystal staff which would force me to get a detrimental mana pres somewhere else.&nbsp; The Warbeads of the Magus are nice but then I would loose my beneficial spell haste from 
  Necklace of Grimspirit Beads.&nbsp; So I have to find something else for that.<br><br>What I'm trying to point out here is casters have run into a jigsaw puzzle of items when they need to weigh Spell focus + item focus.&nbsp; Melee dont have to worry about this as Haste or ImpDodge or other melee centric needs dont denegrate and are not as needed.&nbsp; Additionally, for haste, a melee can just xp in a Skylance instance and wait for a 75HP/75mana/40%haste aug to drop...then they never have to worry about haste again.<br><br>Additionally, there are items in the game that make no sense or are just badly itemized.&nbsp; <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=47281" target=_blank>Belt of Contempt</a> for example off Ture.&nbsp; Its All/All but the focus effect applies to 3 classes (Shaman, SK, Necro) and of those 3, the shaman disease dots are worthless in a raid enviroment (and in general IMO).&nbsp; So you now have a All/all item which is just stats to almost all classes.&nbsp; Or shielding on Int caster only items (or even class items).&nbsp; The Mage head item from Qvic has 1% shielding on it.&nbsp; As a int caster, if they are getting hit, then shielding wont do them any good due to their crap AC and mitigation.&nbsp; Bracer of Grievous Harm
      from Tacvi has Fire damage focus on it.&nbsp; Since only Druids can use fire dmg of the 3 leather classes, its a useless focus for Beastlords; had the item had Cold dmg focus, then it would have been better itemized for the Leather Classes.&nbsp;&nbsp; Or Xxeric's Warbraid having Poison damage focus.&nbsp; Even though this item is for int casters, only Necros gain the benefit of the focus.&nbsp; If the Focus were fire, then 3 of the 4 classes could use...even better had the focus been magic based dmg, then every class who could wear could use.&nbsp; Finally, there are some caste only items that look like they were designed for melee only (think haste, atk and accuracy on a int caster item).<br><br>HP Regeneration.&nbsp; This as a whole needs to be rethought.&nbsp; Worn Regen has increased on a gradual level while Mob DPS and AE damage has increased on a exponential level.&nbsp; Whats wrong with players having a worn regen of 150/tic at the end game?&nbsp;&nbsp; Will this really unbalance the game?<br><br>Worn Attack - This is similar to the regen as it has diminished returns also.&nbsp; When you get to 2500+ attack, even the 50more attack from AAs wont make a difference in DPS.&nbsp; Also, this is another issue in that why do caster only gear have attack when casters rarely if ever melee a mob.<br><br>Dmg/Delay on weapons.&nbsp; For the most part, I have no issues here.&nbsp; The main one are piercing drops.&nbsp; For any class other then a rogue (and none epic2/2.5 rogu at that) to be using a poker is someone decreasing their DPS.&nbsp; When desiging pokers, look back at a <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=70710" target=_blank>Crystal Dagger</a> for inspiration.&nbsp; Also on the King/Queen in RS loot table is a <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=70721" target=_blank>Allin's Mace</a> and <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=70722" target=_blank>Crystal Hilted Shinai.</a>&nbsp; In this case, the dagge has a dmg/delay reasonable close to the other weapons (.7 vs .65).&nbsp; Yet a <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=47317" target=_blank>Aneuk Dagger of Eye Gouging</a> from Jelvin has a ratio of .82 making it all but worthless for non-rogues or Apps.&nbsp; The same goes <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=71645" target=_blank>Fang of Kessdona</a> (.8 ratio).&nbsp; Again a item that goes to either non epic2 rogues or to recruits.&nbsp; <br><br>There are several other issues which I'm sure others will point out, but this gives you an idea.<br></div>

make a difference<br>

Intelligence: 0 = insert witty joke about iksar here<br>

Skill Mods: 4 = having looked at some of the numbers crunched by
various people, a 10% increase is barely effective, especially on
things like block/dodge, etc. <br>

I + dodge III doesn't have to equal dodge IV, but it would be nice to
get something out of it <br>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Before I get too far along, I thought I'd ask for some feedback from players on how they view different stats with respect to the class(es) they play.&nbsp; Obviously, I have my own view on things, but I'd like to know how any why people have their own views.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>What I'd like, is for you to&nbsp;take a look at this list of the basic item stats (feel free to include any others that I left out), and let me know how and why they think they are, or aren't, important to your class.&nbsp; All comments are useful, and feel free to use current items as examples to illustrate your points if you feel the need.&nbsp; Be sure to INCLUDE THE CLASS name, so I can put your feedback in context.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hopefully, I'll gain some new insights that will help me do my job better.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thanks.</div>
<div><br><hr><br>Since you have been playing a wizard you already know this, but just to be on the same page:<br>&nbsp;</div>
<div>-------<br>CLASS: Wizard<br></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>HP: Semi-important. We don't tank, but we take AE.<br>Mana: Top importance. An OOM wizard is a waste of space and heals. The situation today is better than it was 1.5 yr ago thanks to 2 mana efficient nukes, but still - once your mana is gone you become useless.<br>Endurance: Zero use.<br>AC: Don't care. We don't tank. When taking an occasional hit from a kited mob avoidance is a lot more importnat.<br> </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>HP Regen: Not important. Especially with HoT potions.<br>Mana Regen: THE Top Importance. Sustained DPS is our weakest spot.<br>Endurance Regen: Zero use.<br> </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Strength: Zero use.<br>Stamina: Zero use. (a few extra HP don't make a difference)<br>Agility: Low importance. Helps avoid melee hits, but that not something a wizard does all the time.<br>Dexterity: Zero use.<br>Charisma: Zero use.<br>Intelligence: Important only at low-medium levels. Very easily maxed with today's gear at top levels.<br>Wisdom: Zero use.<br> </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Cold Resist: Very important (extremely important for raiders). Resisting (at least partially) big AEs means the difference between life and death.<br>Disease Resist: same<br>Poison Resist: same<br>Magic Resist: same<br>Fire Resist: same </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Attack: Zero use.<br>Delay: Zero use.<br>Damage: Zero use.<br>Range: Semi-important. Good for kiting.<br> </div>
<div>Haste: Spell haste -- Very important.<br> </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Combat Effects: Almost zero use (meleeing with a proc weapon is more of an entertainment than practical for a wizard).<br>Shielding: Low importance. We don't tank on a continous basis.<br>Stun Resist: Very important. Both for solo play (not getting stunned by occasional hits) and for raids with nasty stun AE.<br>Strikethrough: Zero use.<br>Spell Shield: Very important for raiders.<br>Avoidance: Semi-important for solo/group players. Less so for raiders.<br>Accuracy: Zero use.<br>DOT Shielding: Very important for raiders. Less so for soloing against DoT casting mobs (HoT potions easily cover normal mob DoTs).<br> </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Skill Mods: Very important for Evocation.<br>Click Effects: Important, depending on the clicky. Epic 2.0 is good. Clicky nukes are good.<br>Proc Effects: Almost zero use (see Combat Effects).<br>Worn Effects: Worn mana regen -- Extremely important.<br>Focus Effects: Very important. And need to get back on par with melee foci/mods. The randomness of 1..N% yields diminishing results.<br>-------</div><br></blockquote></div>

<DIV>-------<BR>CLASS: Ranger in a DK raiding guild</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>HP:&nbsp; Very important, HP is the stat that never stops giving<BR>Mana: Important <BR>Endurance: Not important since we have no way to use it anyway<BR>AC: Important </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>HP Regen: Important although at the levels of gear I have the cap is easy enough to reach<BR>Mana Regen: Important&nbsp;FT seems a tad rare on ranger items especially in the sub Demiplane levels <BR>Endurance Regen:&nbsp; not important see earlier comment</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Strength: Str seems hard to come by on ranger gear though it like other stats aren't really that important<BR>Stamina: Sta on ranger gear at the high end is pretty decent no real complaints there<BR>Agility:&nbsp; Agi is a tad rare on midlevel ranger gear but overall isn't too bad<BR>Dexterity:&nbsp; Dex is overflowing on ranger gear<BR>Charisma:&nbsp;Useful if you do alot of Traq pulling or get DI cast on you seems a bit hard to cap with ranger gear but not to aweful<BR>Intelligence: who cares&nbsp;<BR>Wisdom: Ranger gear seems to be overflowing with wisdom so everything seems good in this regard</DIV>
<DIV>On stats in general other than stamina they seem for the most part to have too big of an actual visable affect in the game so they would seldom be weighed over other more important factors in gear selection</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Cold Resist: important though is reasonably represented in ranger gear<BR>Disease Resist: important&nbsp; reasonably represented in ranger gear<BR>Poison Resist:&nbsp; important&nbsp; reasonably represented in ranger gear<BR>Magic Resist: Important doesn't seem to be reasonably represented in ranger gear<BR>Fire Resist:&nbsp; important&nbsp; reasonably represented in ranger gear</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Attack: Imporant upto 300 after that irrelevant. ATK was pretty common on time level gear but was rather difficult to aquire on GOD to CoA gear problem seemed resolved post CoA<BR>Delay: this is pretty much tied to damage in the ratio in the end the delay is less important than the ratio of the weapon in quesstion as is the actual damage, though said delay must be considered when determining actual ratio rather than simple ratio do to the application of the damage bonus on mainhand. Additionaly extremely low delay weaponry have a problem with increasing the vulnerability to Damage shields at the same time they maximize the effectiveness of +damage augs<BR>Damage: see above</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Note on damage/delay for bows in general bows in CoA and above just isn't cutting it. Currently each of these 3 bows are extremely underpowered compared to their melee equivelents based on the 85% criteria that has been stated in the past by the developers as a target for bow dps. Ladwenae can get you actual parses and concrete data but essentially in order to hit the 85% of melee target each of these bows need about 25 added to their base damage</DIV>
<DIV><BR>Range: 200+ please <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0></DIV>
<DIV>Haste: Important: for any melee centric class haste is extremely important.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Combat Effects: Relatively important more procs =more dps though not as important as other stats<BR>Shielding: This is important for the raiding ranger and seems to be quite lacking in our high end gear<BR>Stun Resist : Important also very much lacking on much high end ranger gear<BR>Strikethrough: somewhat important seems to be relatively well represented on the gear available to us<BR>Spell Shield: see sheilding<BR>Avoidance: Important but seems to be relatively well represented on high end raid gear<BR>Accuracy: this is one that I focus on quite a bit it is very important but also relatively easy to cap at the high end.<BR>DOT Shielding: once again important to the raiding ranger though it does seem to be more common on our gear than the other types of shielding</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Skill Mods: Mis them would like to see some return<BR>Click Effects: Not enough of them, Would really like to see a few more overhaste items available at the high end prefereably items other than range slots (Ranger class item mayhaps? ;-) Proc Effects: Proc's are fun and many are useful for extra DPS important though behind ratio<BR>Worn Effects: Imporant<BR>Focus Effects: Imporant</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>A note on effects and mods for hybrids we end up in a rough position since we are both casters and melee and in order to attain maximum effectiveness we need both casting and Melee foci. As such items with no foci particularly visable armor slots (see the last two high end ranger wearable sleeves) are particularly annoying please try to avoid this sort of thing in the future.<BR>-------</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>One will notice going through the list that there are very few things I don't value as a ranger. This will probably hold relatively common with all the hybrids to a far greater degree than either of the pure classes. This is pretty much do to the fact that we have both a casting and a melee focus. Rangers are a very versatile class with no single overwelming strength relying instead on a wide and varied toolset&nbsp; to get the job done. As such we cannot get away with focusing on just one aspect of our class to the exclusion of all others. As a ranger not only do I have to worry about offensive melee stats and effects&nbsp;but also defensive as well as all but a couple of&nbsp;focus effects&nbsp;(poison and desease are pretty much the only types of spells we don't have)</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>As such well thought out itemization is extremely important to the&nbsp;effectiveness of the class.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Oh and while your at it can you at least bump the AC on our class DP item to be on par with the Zerker item?</DIV></DIV>

My goal is stay alive as long as possible and for the mobs I come up against the key stats are HP, my resists and how well I can avoid being hit.&nbsp; Next to that, the effects that my weapons and their augments generate is also very important. Also important is my Warder, who sadly does seem to be suffering from the not having kept pace with me as I've levelled.</DIV></DIV>

<DIV>Skill Mods: Somewhat useful depending on the mod<BR>Click Effects: Insanely important to a Shaman as we never have enough spell slots....<BR>Proc Effects: Not real important<BR>Worn Effects: Somewhat useful<BR>Focus Effects:&nbsp; Shaman I think utilize focus effects to an insane degree.... there is too many focuses we need and certainly not enough item variety on many highly important focuses. Cant possibly stress enough how important focus effects are to us.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Not that there is much to be done about it but I would liek to note....</DIV>
<DIV>Priest archtype gear is mainly gear toward healers of which we are the weakest healer and we usually have different needs than the other Priests.</DIV>
<DIV>Chain gear since we are sharing it with 3 DPS classes tends to be very DPS oriented.</DIV>
<DIV>IE Attack, Accuracy etc which we have very little use for.</DIV>
<DIV>This generally means Shaman have to compete for harder to obtain all/all or multiarchtype gear.</DIV>
<DIV>This combined with the sheer number of focus effects we need makes it very hard to effectively gear a Shaman.</DIV></DIV>

				CLASS: Magician
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>HP: High - This raises our survivability against AE's, being hits, and generally everything. The leading cause of death is lack of HP, everyone wants 'em.<br>Mana: Extremely high. This determines the amount of DPS I can sustain to fulfill my classes role on raids, groups, and soloing. Though, currently after a certain point having a mana pool around my size has turned into a yawn fest waiting for it to regen <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-wink.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0><br>Endurance: Zero use. I can jump all I want already.<br>AC: Personally, I would say low on AC. As a caster AC does not help me mitigate damage as well as any other class, therefore it's a wasted stat for me considering it's minimal returns.<br> </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>HP Regen: Nice to have when soloing. I agree with others that it might be capped too low for todays EQ.<br>Mana Regen: Extremely High. The cap on this needs to have a large increase, if you ask me. Having 10k mana pools as the norm has showed how far the game has moved on over the years, yet we still only have a 15 FT cap (20 with AA's). Hardly a linear progression.<br>Endurance Regen: No need.<br> </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Strength: Not very useful. I have weight reduction bags for that.<br>Stamina: Good for HPs, that's about it. As a resident HP guy I geuss it's semi imporant, but I'd put it at moderate.<br>Agility: Not very.<br>Dexterity: Low to none.<br>Charisma: Low to none.<br>Intelligence: High, but I have over twice the Cap currently.<br>Wisdom: Low to none.<br> </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Cold Resist: All resists are useful in all aspects of the game.<br>Disease Resist: --<br>Poison Resist: --<br>Magic Resist: --<br>Fire Resist:-- </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Attack: None.<br>Delay: None.<br>Damage: None.<br>Range: None.<br> </div>
<div>Haste: None.<br> </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Combat Effects: For fun, no use really though.<br>Shielding: Helps raise my survivability if I get hit. It improves all aspects of the game for me.<br>Stun Resist: Extremely high. Channeling spells thru stuns and being able to run away from a avoided stun is a HUGE part for me.<br>Strikethrough: None.<br>Spell Shield: I'm nearly double the cap on this without trying. It IS extremely useful, just the abundance of it makes the effects less noticable. Though, I'd rather have more of it than none.<br>Avoidance: Pretty decent I suppose. Nowhere near the usefulness on us as tanks of course again. Once more, a huge abbundance.<br>Accuracy: None.<br>DOT Shielding: Refer to spell shielding.<br> </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
Skill Mods: The only useful ones are +specialization skills. Even those have proven to give minimal effects.<br>Click Effects: Very nice to have. It increases my ability to perform well during spell refreshes and also adds on the nice extra buff effects that I need to continue with my damage.<br>Proc Effects: None.<br>Worn Effects: Currently, none.<br>Focus Effects: The leading factor of all casters. Without these, we're useless and fall EXTREMELY far behind melees. Though, when these focus' are moved to new slots every expansion it makes it hard to decide which items to grab.<br> <div></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>HP: Important.&nbsp; This is obvious.&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>Mana: don't care.<br>Endurance: Semi-important, but pool size only postpones the inevitable point where we're stuck regenerating it at a ridiculously low rate.<br>AC: Semi imporant, up to a point.&nbsp; I'm not sure where AC caps for monks are, but it's not something that I actively search for in my upgrades.<br> </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>HP Regen:&nbsp; I'm almost capped, albeit unintentionally.&nbsp; not super important. <br>Mana Regen: don't care.<br>Endurance Regen: would love to see this implemented, but in a responsible way so as not to overpower certain classes(zerkers, mostly)<br> </div>
<div>&nbsp;<br>[these aren't super important to me, as they all max in post-time raiding.&nbsp; for the casual monks, more agility and more dex]<br></div>
<div>Strength: capped <br>Stamina: capped<br>Agility: capped(took me longest to cap)<br>Dexterity: capped<br>Charisma: don't care<br>Intelligence: don't care<br>Wisdom: it's pretty high, as I share an armor archetype with druids/beasts.&nbsp; i don't tradeskill, so it's not super important to me.<br> </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Cold Resist: <br>Disease Resist: <br>Poison Resist: One of my weakest points<br>Magic Resist: High end monk gear is sorely lacking in MR, the rest are pretty easy to pile on.<br>Fire Resist: </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Attack: Important.&nbsp; I'd rather overdo it than underdo it, as atk is important to our dps.<br>Delay: Important.&nbsp; Recent parses are showing favorable dps situations to lower delay weapons even in offhand weapons, as our dual wield rate gets higher and higher.<br>Damage: Obviously important.&nbsp; <br>Range: Monk ranged dps is a joke.&nbsp; I know this isn't the responsibility of the itemization dev, but some kind of range disc for monks would be nice, but nothing overpowered so as not to step on the toes of our neighborhood rogues.<br> </div>
<div>Haste: Would like to see more 45% items, or higher.&nbsp; I have clickable 50% haste, and I'd like to be able to cap or be close to cap when I solo.<br> </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Combat Effects:&nbsp; Procs play a pretty important role in our dps, and this mod is probably the hardest for us to cap.<br>Shielding: Semi-important for offtanking situations, or ae. <br>Stun Resist: Important for pulling.&nbsp; Getting stunned on high end raids can lead to death if we aren't quick on the feign death button.<br>Strikethrough: Fairly important, but also common on monk gear.<br>Spell Shield: I value this stat a lot at the level of raiding that I'm on(Tacvi, about to break anguish).&nbsp; It helps tremendously with AE's.<br>Avoidance: Very important, and fairly easy to cap.&nbsp; I'm not one to turn down avoidance gear.&nbsp; <br>Accuracy:&nbsp; Extremely important from a dps standpoint.&nbsp; I dps more than I pull on raids nowadays, and would like to see more accuracy on gear.&nbsp; I go out of my way to get gear with accuracy on it.<br>DOT Shielding:&nbsp; I don't value this as highly as I value spell shield, but it's nice to have.<br> </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Skill Mods: I love the block mod on my time tunic, and the dodge mod on my neck piece(GoD tongue samples quest) and wouldn't mind seeing this on gear more often.<br>Click Effects: Clickies are fun.&nbsp; I'd like to see more overhaste options(especially at the lower end, even some 3% clickies for easier raids would be nice just to have options.&nbsp; As it stands, there are only a few:&nbsp; Quarm Ear, Tacvi Ring, Zoo Event in Qvic ear, RSS Royals cape, OMM Range, and Mayong Range.&nbsp; I've never seen the ear drop from the zoo event.<br>Proc Effects: See my above statements regarding combat effects.&nbsp; Procs are nice.&nbsp; I'd also like to see more non-elemental +damage augs.&nbsp; The last two expansions have been good about that for monks(Eye of Lycanthrope, and the deathknell 3 dmg+lifetap aug). <br>Worn Effects: All are important.<br>Focus Effects: I'd like to see endurance conservation focuses.<br>-------<br><br>Here's my magelo for a point of reference, if that helps:<br><br>http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1077519<br><br>edit:&nbsp; I wholeheartely agree with the above poster's message about wanting to look like a monk.&nbsp; I don't want leather tunics.&nbsp; I dont' want to look like a druid or a human beastlord.&nbsp; I'd like more chestwrap options, or NPC's that you can turn your armor into for chestwrap options.&nbsp; I don't like shoulderpads;&nbsp; i'd prefer armbands.&nbsp; I like fistwraps, and small unobtrusive bracers.&nbsp; <br><br>The robe look from robe of the lost circle with old models, where the monk still appears bare chested but has the long draping robes-- this is very cool and I'd love to see it with luclin models.&nbsp; Helmets are ugly.&nbsp; I'd love to see actual headbands implemented.<br><br>Weight is a concern as well.&nbsp; I'd like more coin weight reduction options, as it's a crappy deal when I'm farming for plat and I either have to destroy money, or run and bank because I'm losing armor class due to heavy coinage.<br></div><div></div><p>Message Edited by Wonton_Noodle on <span class=date_text>07-06-2006</span> <span class=time_text>06:33 PM</span>

<div><font color="#ffffff">&nbsp;</font></div>
<div><font color="#ffffff">HP: For many necros including myself, HP is more important than mana to a certain extent.&nbsp; There are 2 reasons.&nbsp; One is because for us, HP is mana, because our lich converts mana to hp and blood magic uses hp to cast spells. The other thing is we find ourselves getting hit a lot either from aggro or from trying to lifetap tank things and the more the HP the better in those cases.</font><font color="#ffffff"><br></font><font color="#ffffff">Mana: Important and definately needed, but not as much as HP.</font><font color="#ffffff"><br></font><font color="#ffffff">Endurance: Do not need, period.</font><font color="#ffffff"><br></font><font color="#ffffff">AC: AC does not help us much, but may help slightly with tap tanking situations.<br> </font></div>
<div><font color="#ffffff">&nbsp;</font></div>
<div><font color="#ffffff">HP Regen: Very important to necros due to lich draining hp, but at the high end it is pretty easy to max.&nbsp; But if the cap is ever raised, more is better.</font><font color="#ffffff"><br></font><font color="#ffffff">Mana Regen: Mana regen is just important to us as other int classes</font><font color="#ffffff"><br></font><font color="#ffffff">Endurance Regen: Not important.<br> </font></div>
<div><font color="#ffffff">&nbsp;</font></div>
<div><font color="#ffffff">Strength: Not important.</font><font color="#ffffff"><br></font><font color="#ffffff">Stamina: Every item has Stamina almost, so most necros are maxed, but if we weren't maxed it would be important for the sake of HP.</font><font color="#ffffff"><br></font><font color="#ffffff">Agility: Not very important, but might help for tap tanking.</font><font color="#ffffff"><br></font><font color="#ffffff">Dexterity: Not important.</font><font color="#ffffff"><br></font><font color="#ffffff">Charisma: Not important except for those charm junkies who think it helps for charming (I never use charm, though).</font><font color="#ffffff"><br></font><font color="#ffffff">Intelligence: Basically same story as Stamina, almost everyone is maxed, but would be important if we weren't maxed.</font><font color="#ffffff"><br></font><font color="#ffffff">Wisdom: Not important.<br> </font></div>

<div><font color="#ffffff">&nbsp;</font></div>
<div><font color="#ffffff">Skill Mods: Alteration, conjuration, and dodge mods would all be nice.&nbsp; Maybe even a mod to increase successful FD or willful death going off.</font><font color="#ffffff"><br></font><font color="#ffffff">Click Effects: Dot click efects are the nicest, since they can stack with newer dots whereas buff effects become obsolete by new spells.&nbsp; Other effects that don't get effected by lvl caps being raised are nice, like trushar's recovery from GoD (spend 4 mana regen, get 20 hp regen). Other effects that would be nice are mana regen effects that stack with our self rune and newer versions of the methodical mind line of clicky effects or others that stack with it.</font><font color="#ffffff"><br></font><font color="#ffffff">Proc Effects: A necro trying to proc is kind of futile, so nothing useful I could see here.</font><font color="#ffffff"><br></font><font color="#ffffff">Worn Effects: Improved dodge is nice, can't think of anything else I guess that wasnt listed above already.&nbsp; The FD/willful death thing could be lumped here too.</font><font color="#ffffff"><br></font><font color="#ffffff">Focus Effects: Focus effects that increase our dot damage and lifetap damage are the most important.&nbsp; Poison and magic would be most important, followed by fire, and disease would be semi useful.&nbsp; The focuses that make detrimental spells (like dots) last longer are very important too (such as bane of the dragorn, etc).&nbsp; Detrimental range increase is also important.&nbsp; Detrimental mana pres and detrimental spell haste are also important.&nbsp; Affliction haste (33% dot spell haste) was awesome but seems to have been replaced totally by 20-23% detrimental haste.&nbsp; Some necros also like healing focus effects once their other ones are finished for pet heals (i'm not to that point yet though).</font><font color="#ffffff"><br></font><font color="#ffffff">-------</font></div><div></div>
