      <title>why pay for something( eqplayers) that has been broken  since it started =)) ?</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=eqplayers&amp;message.id=5169#M5169</link>
      <description>i HOPE this post will fix a few things, that i lucky enough, dont have to waste money to find out is there =))&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SoE has basicly put the feeling, i have in me right now that says, dont tell em what the mistakes / broken stuff are, but post about it on other boards*. so ppl will se, and try and keep from SOE, i mean that is the way they are, dont give a rats arse about others, just in it for the money. Unfortunately the person behind the idea EQ dont work for them anymore, and i bet its cos of greed too, cos take the game for one its build up, so big parts of it you CANT get to see or experience, if you dont work together with "strangers", that becomes familiar to you more and more the more you play with em, SOE dont give a **SMURF**e about you EVEN if you have been customer for more then 5 years =//&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SoE has become to far reached, it dos of course do some good, i aint saying nothing is so bad it isent good for something, what i am saying is there is more **SMURF**e then not that means something and im not talking in the terms well there are a 1000 god things so have to be a 1000 bad things then its basicly&amp;nbsp; not good or bad, im saying in the terms that some of the **SMURF**e they put on us is in it self same as 500 "normal" bad or good things yet for alot of ppl it just counts as 1 thing not&amp;nbsp; as it should say the 1 reason its bad =))&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;let me give you an example ( uh lucky SOE i have to use eqplayers mistake / **SMURF** up / broken thing to show you ) &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;take&amp;nbsp; your own profile on eqplayers, if you havent paid like me you will need to use the [url=http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/character_index.vm] Character of the Day [/url] that is on that link, now you go into Spells &amp;amp; Abilities page&amp;nbsp; from there you hit the Missing Spells &amp;amp; Abilities, now go to the lvl 29 spells and see all the imbue and mass imbue spells =)) ? those you ARE NOT able to get all of em cos of diety =)) so basicly soe here says : we ( soe) are such fools, we(soe) dont even know, that the toon our website says is tunare diety, cant use the spells that we ( soe ) knows are only for specific diety, yet we ( soe ) dont wanna show to you ( even thou you paid for a YOUR MISSING SPELLS not someone ellses ) =))&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;now i could go on and on about all kindsa stuf they let out in the open for you to see and realise they are **SMURF**ing with us on purpose, but im not gonna, soe can save thier own arse, by posting somethings here they are able to cover it up and im not into that **SMURF**e, with giving ppl information that helps em cheat you even more, or covering up they are cheating you, no sire bob =))&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;sure this "just" might be a mistake they havent gotten around to fix since eqplayers came out, but never the less why should i pay for this service if its broken =)) ?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Maybe i should charge em for&amp;nbsp; finding out they are not doing their job right =))&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;anyways SoE good luck with answering my question =))&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Ok, so you click the button on the General tab in Options in game that says to sync the character with EQPlayers, but when exactly does that happen?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Is it a set time of day? when you log out?&amp;nbsp; when does any change then appear in the ranking list?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My main character is anonymous for EQPlayers, but syncing has always been turned on, yet I never have an anon listing in the rankings as others do, which is why I'm curious as to how exactly the process works or should work.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yes, I'm a confused noob today. &lt;span&gt;:smileysad:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Issues with EQ Players</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=eqplayers&amp;message.id=5150#M5150</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Aside from general over all bugginess of eqplayers, I still am paying for the premium service. Which makes me sometimes sit and wonder why I am wasteing 2 bucks a month on practically nothing, but hey its 2 bucks right? I've reported several times on my acct that there are 2 of me atm on Eqplayers. Sent emails, posted sicky notes in your office, spray painted the office building wall at SoE headcorders, and currently I'm on your boards postin your bugz.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Basically if you sever transfered like me you get bugged apparently I guess on eqplayers and it list you on 2 different servers. Atm there is only one Corboy in the game and atm I am on Bristlebane. I was on Emarr and Server transfered to Bristlebane after my guild broke up. Now on Eqplayers it shows a Corboy on Emarr, and a Corboy on Bristlebane. The Corboy on Emarr is a snap shot basically of what I was wearing and flags I had back before I transfered almost 6 months ago, while the one on Bristlebane is actually somewhat correct(aside from being 79 hps off). &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;What I am curious about is kinda 2 fold. First off how can the leaderboards be right when some characters like in my case are listed on 2 different servers? Also is there a actual game bug that is make suffixes wrong?? I petitioned when I got to Bristlebane to have my of Bristlebane suffix fixed and the GM's basically said there was a bug with EQ players atm that would not allow characters to have 2 suffixes like everyone orginally did back in the day. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Atm the moment I have of Rodcet Nife, which is were I was created, but when they merged servers you got 2 suffixes basied on the server you were on the server you were created on. Now its like a toss up for most people, they either have the server suffix of the server they are on, or they have the server suffix title of the server they were created on. I know its being nitpicky but I would like to know, is that a eqplayers bug? Or is it one of the 1000's of bugs that actually roam the game at the moment in mass gangs killing the&amp;nbsp;hopes and dreams&amp;nbsp;of the loyal players as they pass??&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I guess I was just wondering if there ever will be a fix for the Double character issue? Also, is the suffix bug a game bug or a EQplayers bug? Are there any plan's to fix it? Or at this point any plan's to fix any bugs in general?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Curiously with Love, &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Your friendly complaining Rogue~&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>Change personal icon board level?</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=eqplayers&amp;message.id=5147#M5147</link>
      <description>I suggest that the personal icon ability be changed to Champion/Augur for the following reasons:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) Those levels still take a considerable amount of time to get to, so there is still no risk of users signing up and quickly putting up an offensive avatar.&lt;br&gt;2) It improves post recognition. Many people, myself included, also browse forums that permit everyone to have avatars. Since most people pick one avatar and stick with it, the prescence of their avatar instantly lets the reader recognise it once they have seen it a few times.&lt;br&gt;3) It is a very simple change to make, only requiring a small edit in the admin panel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thoughts?</description>

      <title>Searching for augments</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=eqplayers&amp;message.id=5135#M5135</link>
      <description>Hmm. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I want to find out what augments are available to add damage to my weapons.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I know there are some that have +damage modifiers, I know a couple of names, but I suspect there are others that I don't know about.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So I signed up for the full Eqplayers package to get access to the item search features.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately, there seems to be no way to search for augments.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Am I looking in the wrong place?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There seems to be no way to find an augment if you don't already know its name.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If the search is really as limited as it seems to be, I guess I'll drop the extra-cost features... no point in paying for something that is useless.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Allakhazam has a better item database interface, but it also seems to have no clean way to filter for damage augments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can anyone suggest a site that might help me find what I want?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I just upgraded&amp;nbsp;my subscription to include eqplayers.&amp;nbsp; I logged in and clicked on the updateplayer for my main character and after I finished playing last night logged on to check eqplayers and my character is no where to be found on this site. Is there anything on my end I can do to get it to appear or is this something that SOE has to do on their end? Any help is greatly appreciated.&amp;nbsp; 2.99 isnt too bad a price to pay for something but I would atleast like to be able to use the service and if my character isnt there then I dont want to have anything to do with this service.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;You have an opportunity here to pick up alot of new people if you&amp;nbsp;can get this fixed soon.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Magelo (biggest compeditor to you guys) recently did a big update that is severly bugged atm they are working on the problems to get them all ironed out.&amp;nbsp; If you can mange to fix yours before they do then you might actually get more subscribers to the service.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;IE me I'm kinda unhappy with what magelo has done with the new systems.&amp;nbsp; Mainly because it makes it so&amp;nbsp;there is NO legit leader boards for EQ in exsistance currently.&amp;nbsp; I have cared more about them since I started&amp;nbsp;climbing them latly.&amp;nbsp; Magelo ranking system isn't all inclusive&amp;nbsp;which EQrankings was (for the most part) before the magelo change.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;EQplayers&amp;nbsp;stats have always been off and the leaderboards have been broken since tss came out&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>when are TSS items going to be added to the item collector?</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=eqplayers&amp;message.id=5111#M5111</link>
      <description>this is 100% reproducable, you cannot search for any of the new high end raid items in TSS, the only items available via search are from Deathknell in Prophecy of Ro Expansion:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;use the following when doing an "advanced search"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;usable by class:&amp;nbsp; monk&lt;br&gt;primary stat:&amp;nbsp; hit points&lt;br&gt;required level: 75&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;This gives a list of the highest hit point items that are monk usable, but only return items from up to Prophecy of Ro.&amp;nbsp; No items from TSS.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>
