      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I really think these two classes should be in from the start. Like&#xD;
someone said before, a class is not "content". Just because they can't&#xD;
compleat their epic quests untill later is no excuse. Their epics have&#xD;
more power then the older kunark weapons. So they should come with the&#xD;
expansion they're tuned to (Zerker epic1 is nutty compaired to other&#xD;
2hs epic1's...Like the paladin and SK ones).&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
The beastlord pet wouldn't be anymore overpowered then low level mages&#xD;
red and yellow con pets. Just letting these two classes in would shut&#xD;
alot of people up, and it wouldn't really hurt anything. Neither of&#xD;
them are game-breaking(Zerkers are actually quite lame without&#xD;
AA...They would be epicly lame with oldworld gear AND no AA)&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

      <description>The rest of the classes won't be able to complete their epic quests until Kunark comes out either so beastlords won't be too far behind on that issue. Like others have said, I can understand the exclusion of iksars, vah shir and frogloks because that ties in with an expansion storyline. But additional classes? When was there ever any storyline attached to their inclusions in the first place?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It almost seems like disabling beastlords and berserkers would require MORE programming than just leaving them there, but not knowing the ins and outs of it all the opposite could be true too.&lt;br&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This point is not really relevant to us as players.&amp;nbsp; We want what we want, and so long as we get it, it does not matter if it was a simple change, or a hard one, only that we got the change we wanted.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;To the devs, you have a number of people who want this change, and a number who don't.&amp;nbsp; Why not put up a poll, and let the players decide by voting?&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>Of course it's relevant. If they enabled beastlords and zerkers but this along with other player-requested changed meant the server wasn't coming out for another few months due to additional work required would you prepared to wait? Would SOE risk losing the buzz this server has created? Especially as you have competing products being released between now and christmas. SoE wants to get this out asap to capitalize on all the publicity it's getting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;YES&lt;/STRONG&gt; I would be willing to wait if it meant that Beastlords and Berserkers got to start off on day one.&amp;nbsp; I am not willing to wait to create a berserker on this server if every other class got to start out months, if not years, earlier.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;Well they could have just done it when they were making other things global that weren't before, like the luclin models (or instead of wasting their time removing berserker/beastlord stuff they could just make them global with that time), &amp;nbsp;though personaly i'd even&amp;nbsp;be happy if&amp;nbsp;they could even say they will finish up what they need to to get the server live on the 28th and then get to work on making them global and add them in a few weeks or a month down the road, even that would be acceptable imo, heck if it was even that I had to wait for kurnak to be unlocked to start a berserker that would still be ok, just really velious or later is to late to bother with, then it would be to late to start and enjoy what will actualy be the good part of this server.</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;There are beastlord/berserker trainers in all the old world starting cities of races that can play them, as are the tomes/spellbooks and axe components, beastlords and berserkers were added to all appropriate gear for their class all the way back to original game (the&amp;nbsp;executioners axe from Lguk&amp;nbsp;is war/ber usable for example currently), and beastlord and berserker specific items were added were appropriate as well (there is ber and bst only kurnak armor and ber and bst only velious quest armor for example). Aside from actualy going in and changing the code to make those classes global (just like they are doing/already did&amp;nbsp;for the luclin character models) there is nothing else that needs to be done as all the older content stuff was updated when they were added into the game.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by sasandra on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;06-12-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;02:18 PM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Because the developers choose to keep these two classes locked away.&amp;nbsp; Very idiotic decision imo - it violates the whole premise of starting everyone off on the same footing - but it is what they've decided.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Yet, contrary to the decision to leave those two classes out, they're leaving 4 race/class combos in that weren't part of original EQ - Halflings get to be both Paladins and Rangers, and Gnomes get to be both Paladins and Shadowknights, even though those, similarly to the beastlord and Berserker classes, weren't availalbe to those races at the start of EQ, and came some time later.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The difference?&amp;nbsp; Beastlords and Berserkers came along with expansions, while allowing those classes (Paladin, and either Ranger or Shadow Knight) for those two races wasn't part of an expansion.&amp;nbsp; The implication being that they're not letting people who would play Berserkers or Beastlords start off on the same footing as the rest of the classes simply because those two classes have the DUBIOUS DISTINCTION of being linked to an expansion - a pair of expansions at this point who don't even have those classes as selling poitns anymore.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Well, you've been shown that halflings and gnomes weren't rangers, SK's, or paladins prior to a non-expansion related change.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Explain to me now, why it is in keeping with the "starting off on the same footing" idea to start with halfling and gnome hybrids, but not to permit races such as barbarians, dwarves, trolls, and ogres (as applicable) to be beastlords or berserkers.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The excuse that they're part of an expansion is not a valid one, IMO - they're not "content" they're a vehicle for experiencing that content.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>I think one reason they won't incorporate Beastlords is that unlike the classes in the game they won't be able to start less complete their epic quest as most of it takes place in Luclin.&amp;nbsp; As Beastlords was my favorite class it won't be as bad because even at the point when Luclin is introducted there will be a lot of 60's but it will still be a new server in reguards to the items/community so I don't really see a problem getting them up and grouping up with those prior characters.&amp;nbsp; I will miss it at the beginning but will start one once Luclin is unlocked most likely.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Well just because their epic need stuff in SoL isn't really a reason to not put them in, i'm sure everyone who wants to play them would rather wait till luclin to just start their epic as opposed to wait till&amp;nbsp;SoL to even start their character, at least beastlords are semi viable to start at the time SoL opens up, berserkers don't have that option. by GoD a new character simply isn't viable, you're way&amp;nbsp;to far behind, the levels you could catch up, but there's no hope for gear and slim chance for AA's, I know, I tried when GoD originaly came out, I had to leave my guild as switching mains wasn't allowed and I couldn't get anywhere near back where I needed to be to join another high end raiding guild, and berserkers were the only class I wanted to play but it wasn't viable, that's why I had stopped playing EQ.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Kevor,&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Halflings and gnomes were not initially allowed to be hybrids. That was something that was added later.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Well like i said i remember makeing a halfling ranger a long time ago and putting around with him for 5 levels.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Even if thats the case that was a change that was not part of an expansion i'm sure. Like many changes were&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;and its alreayd been stateed that most of those changes were staying with the expection of the zone revamps&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;which they have to change so players can play in some of them.&amp;nbsp; Like Paw and CT.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Excerpt from patch message:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;March 19, 2002&lt;BR&gt;------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;We wanted to start by letting everyone know how grateful we are for all &lt;BR&gt;of the suggestions for improvements that we've received both in EMail &lt;BR&gt;and on the various class and server boards. We appreciate all the help &lt;BR&gt;you've provided us. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;** Changes for Low Level Characters ** &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- Characters no longer lose experience for death below level 11 &lt;BR&gt;- Characters now begin first level with a stack of 20 food and drink &lt;BR&gt;- Items no longer appear on a corpse if you are below level 10, they &lt;BR&gt;reappear with the character &lt;BR&gt;- When a character "dings" level 10 you will be informed that your &lt;BR&gt;items will now be on your corpse &lt;BR&gt;- Characters will no longer appear with a Tome of Discord. They must &lt;BR&gt;get one from the Priest of Discord &lt;BR&gt;- New resurrection, evacuate and corpse summoning spells have been &lt;BR&gt;added at lower levels &lt;BR&gt;- We've moved the newbie bind points closer to where characters first &lt;BR&gt;start out, not outside in their newbie areas &lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;- Halflings and Gnomes have new classes available to them: Halfling &lt;BR&gt;Rangers and Paladins as well as Gnome ShadowKnights and Paladins. All &lt;BR&gt;of the necessary NPCs and items should be available for these new &lt;BR&gt;classes &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Well award one browny point to you to going the extra mile to prove me wrong &lt;b&gt;when&lt;/b&gt; i said&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;"even if thats the case."&amp;nbsp; Yes, you are the all knowing bard now. :) Even if it was beside my point&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;entirely. I can't remember every single change that happend from release till now. Not to say this is a&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;dead horse. Plus like i've said 2 times it doesnt matter useing that as an excuse because expansion&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;features should be limited to expansions. That wasn't an expansion feature just something&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;they added cause it was silly it wasn't there from the start.&lt;br&gt;</description>
