    <title>PoP Back-Flagging and Raid Tool?</title>
    <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Progression&amp;message.id=8057</link>
    <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Since Planes of Power was initially released, there were alternative access quests added to the flagging process to alleviate problems with back-flagging. Will this alternative flagging system remain in place on the progression server, or will it be disabled temporarily? I'm not really in favor of either option; simply curious to know how it will be handled. I realize this may not come into play on the progression server for some time, but I find it something to think about.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On a side note, also in line with PoP features, how will the raid tool added to the UI be handled? I understand that some newer UI features will be applied at the start of the server, such as the LoY LFG/Map tools, so that causes me to wonder about the raid feature. Again, I don't really lean toward having it and not, just curious. &lt;span&gt;:smileytongue:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;Ya, I'm not sure why this thread has been so quiet..&amp;nbsp; This is a huge deal to me, and should be to others.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; If you can 85% into EP and Time when planes of power is the latest expansion available, that will frustrate me to no end.&amp;nbsp; Please please please use original Planes of Power flagging rules until omens of war has been unlocked or something.&amp;nbsp; I'd still rather see PoP flagging rules never change from the original release, but I know that's asking alot.</description>

This efreeti spawns every hour and can be solo'd almost effortlessly by many classes that are around level 60. With the availability of this quest, ToSR access hardly seems like an accomplishment. I understand that several people didn't like PoP for one reason or another, but, personally, it was one of my favorite expansions. I would hate to see it so harshly cheapened by swinging its doors wide open with these pathetic alternate quests. Where's the sense of adventure, challenge and accomplishment when anyone can virtually do some of these quests with their eyes closed?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is plenty of PoP content open to players without needing flags. Some of these Planes were eventually opened with level achievements, but I see no problem with that. The important Planes still required effort and adventure to enter. Here is a list of Planes that can be accessed without flags:&lt;br&gt;Level 1: PoK&lt;br&gt;Level 45: PoTranq, PoJ, PoI, PoD, PoN&lt;br&gt;Level 55: PoS, PoV, CoD, PoTorment&lt;br&gt;Level 62: BoT, HoH&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think that list suggests that plenty of content is offered to players who don't have the ability or desire to join a raiding guild. Many of the zones in the list were great places for all kinds of players to roup for experience. Part of the mystique of the upper Planes was the need to go through epic tasks to access them, and this will be sadly lost with simple alternate quests. It's fine to add these quests later on, when the more casual players need easier access to them in order to catch up, but why destroy the heart of the expansion before it even starts?&lt;span&gt;:smileysad:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I agree with that.&amp;nbsp; But I also feel tier 2 planes should be cut off until the flag is completed, no exceptions.&amp;nbsp; Tier 1 PoP&amp;nbsp;loot will be VERY nice for anyone that has not yet entered Vex Thal.&amp;nbsp; I don't like the idea of opening planes in Tier 2/3 as you reach higher lvls.&amp;nbsp; To enter plane of valor, you should need one PoJ trial complete.&amp;nbsp; Not ding 55.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If you haven't been to Vex Thal yet, then there's plenty to do in luclin still, PLUS the 4 tier 1 planes that will be unlocked through planes of power.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I think removing the 85% rule and level-based semi-flags is a bit of an overkill, but I would rather see PoP reverted back to the original instead of having it left as is. Every alternate mechanism can be taken out, but then put back in later if things don't work out. But, if alternates are left in, they can't ethically take flags away from people if things go awry. So, ultimately, I guess it would be alright to try reverting PoP back to the original flags to see how it plays out, because the level-based alternates and 85% rules can be added afterwards if need be.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Basically, here's the way I see it. If all alternates are taken out, only the very best guild(s) will be able to push into PoP for a good while, which leaves a huge percentage of the PoP expansion unused to most players. Plus, a lot of guilds will be strained to continue progressing with PoP coming into the picture just after they finally managed to get into VT. Keep in mind, this server is going to move through expansions &lt;i&gt;a lot &lt;/i&gt;faster than the original game. If the 85% and level-based alternates are there, it allows for some of the good, but not best, guilds to eventually enter into PoP before it starts becoming obsolete. And, maybe this is just nostalgia talking, but as an aside, I do have some fond memories of groups in Bastion of Thunder once it opened to level 62, but it is now empty on the original servers. I would like to see it populated again, but this can't happen if the majority of players are kept out until other expansions open and the experience groups move to other zones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Heh, the more I think about it, the more it appears that PoP is a nice old monkey wrench thrown into the progression thing. &lt;span&gt;:smileytongue:&lt;/span&gt; There are a lot of variables and potentials for things to derail at that point in the server. It's really tough to speculate how the population as a whole will react to it, and which pathway is the best to retain a middle ground.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

  &lt;p&gt;Because of the differential between getting the heart in velious era&#xD;
and when PoP goes online.. there will be enough time for everybody and&#xD;
his sister to farm that efreeti. Any guild worth its salt will have a&#xD;
good 80+ % of their members flagged and ready to go and the lower&#xD;
levels will simply be carpet bombed for ornate while the minis get&#xD;
killed every time they pop. When there is enough to get in chambers,&#xD;
Sol Ro is pretty much a pushover.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;p&gt;TSR was a reward.. a reward for&#xD;
finishing tier 1-3 content. I still remember vividly when PoP went live&#xD;
people having trouble simply getting through PoJ Trials. Some people&#xD;
tried 50-100 times before they were successful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;p&gt;If you want to&#xD;
make a progression server.. make a progression server. If you want to&#xD;
grease&amp;nbsp;the wheels to make it easier later on.. leave things the way&#xD;
they are so everybody can be tier 3.5 the moment Aten Ha Ra hits the&#xD;
floor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;p&gt;-Quillium Lifehammer&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;hr&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;p&gt;AMEN.&amp;nbsp; How can we&#xD;
call it a progression server if all the things they added to make it&#xD;
easier for people later on is left in the game???&amp;nbsp; Minor stuff like&#xD;
raid windows and stuff is okay.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; But to leave PoP like it is right now&#xD;
is just ridiculous IMO.&amp;nbsp; The content is there for a reason.&amp;nbsp; It's not&#xD;
ment to be skipped. &lt;br&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
PoP is meant to be "PROGRESSED" through, not skipped.&amp;nbsp; Oh gee,&#xD;
where have I heard that term "PROGRESS" before, oh yeah... it's the&#xD;
servers goal.&amp;nbsp; Remove the Efreeti; I don't really care about the&#xD;
Elemental/Time key thing though, because it means a majority of the&#xD;
raid will have to have completed it already.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
PoP was my favorite expansion, don't ruin it please.&amp;nbsp; It's a masterpiece.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>The biggest problem I see with this is people being able to farm ornates and other low-end drops in ToSR. Although a typical group who used the efreeti shortcut to get in wouldn't be able to function very well, there is still a possibility they can bring a raid in to farm. Even if they dont kill the main bosses, some of the drops in Sol Ro are the best available aside from planar gods and elementals. It seems like people would be able to skip or power through a good amount of content using this method, which seems like the opposite of something we would want to see on a progression server. This issue isn't much different than leaving newbie armor quests or augmentations in; it grants people access to loot that is more powerful than what should be available to them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Well as a raid leader of a guild who moved from VT to PoP without doing much T1/T2 I can tell you that once you have been geared up in VT there is not much motivation to do early PoP and it can be a real pain to do backflagging.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I'm fairly sure they will keep the alternative access quests in.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

I still think everyone should be able to walk into any zone... the difficulty will keep them out after they've had a round or two of experience.&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;I would tend to see training and arse-hattery as some things that act to detract from the community in a few aspects, and cause a significant amount of frustration depending on the frequency. But, if aforementioned behaviors float your boat, then there are several zones rampant with them (i.e. BoT and Karnor's that I mentioned previously). As far as &amp;quot;'kid-glove' games,&amp;quot; I think what separates EQ from them is actually the challenge to progress in the game (i.e. experience loss, grouping, keys, flagging), whereas other MMOs allow the player to whisk through the content in less than 12 days of playing time, at the same time almost totally avoiding prolonged contact with another player.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In regards to difficulty keeping people out of a zone, I think that is largely subjective on the basis of the player's interpretation. Some people like a huge challenge, and others like exploiting the fact that they can occasionally get excellent groups while the player himself has significantly sub-par gear and/or skill. Reputation is good at dealing with the latter, though.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As far as walking into any zone, from a lore-ish perspective, I don't think the gods would be too happy with allowing unregulated trespassing in and out of their territories. &lt;span&gt;:smileytongue:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;hr&gt;alowe1 wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;Well as a raid leader of a guild who moved from VT to PoP without doing much T1/T2 I can tell you that once you have been geared up in VT there is not much motivation to do early PoP and it can be a real pain to do backflagging.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I'm fairly sure they will keep the alternative access quests in.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/span&gt;I can see where you're coming from here, as I had a similar experience, although I was not a raid leader. This is where I see alternate quests as being beneficial, but I think killing a single solo'able monster in order to temporarily bypass a huge amount of the PoP content is going a little overboard. Maybe reducing the number of highly difficult raid encounters from 7 down to 2 or 3 moderate encounters is more reasonable. And, based on Maddoc's response, I do also surmise that alternate quests will remain intact. I don't mind this too much in most cases, as I am aware of several needs, but some aspects bother me a little bit (i.e. a banished efreeti).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ultimately, I guess it is difficult to speculate. Watching it play out seems the only thing able to provide solid answers. The progression server will flow through an enormous amount of content, and I guess it is possible that a little reduction in potential tedium will be necessary along the way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Well luckily we have awhile until this is even an issue.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Maybe when the time comes, the dev's will change their minds.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Yeah, time is on our side for now. I do hope the devs decide to make some revisions to PoP's current state for The Combine, or I will be very sad. &lt;span&gt;:smileysad:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;sigh...  I guess we won't get to re-experience PoP like it was ment to be.  PoP was perfect the day of release..  with 85% rules and minimum lvl rules and alternate access, it just ruined it in my opinion. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;THIS MEANS ANY HOJO IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO BE 85'D INTO PLANE OF TIME.  :smileymad::smileysad:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This is one of the reasons I quit eq in the first place.  Taking my past accomplishments and making them worthless.  I spent 2 years getting my full time key, going through every single plane.  And then one day they make it so anyone can walk into plane of time with a raid and loot a key in tier 3....&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Quests like this better get taken out!&amp;nbsp; The whole idea is to progress, but if this stuff is left in, then no progression is necessary.&amp;nbsp; It clearly goes against the idea of this server.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

This was one of the things that acted to dilute the game for me, also. Once I arrived in a position to do so, I spent almost every available moment I had working on getting access to the Elementals and Time back in the day, only to watch a vast number of people achieve the same thing in a mere fraction of the time and effort that I put into it. Now, I understand that keeping content heavily sealed after it becomes somewhat obsolete is relatively pointless, considering better loot can be acquired through newer expansions; but I don't see the need to open up access to content when it is the current or recent end-game. And for that matter, I don't really embrace the idea of solo-able flags at any time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cheapening something that should be exciting and challenging just leaves me with an empty feeling. I would find it at least a somewhat acceptable compromise if the alternate access quests were left out until around Omens of War unlocking, which is roughly when they were originally introduced, I believe. And maybe change or leave out the "banished efreeti" quest that currently allows for &lt;i&gt;absurdly&lt;/i&gt; easy acccess to ToSR. I can see the strain it may put on some guilds after pushing through prior content, but I, for one, am looking forward to conquering the Planes again in the way it was orignally intended.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I guess this is kind of a dead topic now, but I still think it should undergo some consideration. Getting into ToSR with more ease than even getting half of the key for Veeshan's Peak or Vex Thal seems to be incongruous with the rest of the server. I realize that ToSR doesn't exactly compare to Plane of Time, but it does provide some loot that exceeds the quality of that found in the aforementioned zones. Yes, Vex Thal comes in the previous expansion, but should it become immediately obsolete upon the opening of PoP? I would like to see some of the more challenging content retain a bit of longevity. Considering, as per my interpretation, that the purpose of this server is to allow players to experience some of the older content without being practically forced to bypass it in order to remain on par with the community, it would only make sense to breathe a bit of life into the older zones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I guess what it boils down to is that I don't really understand why accessing the higher end Planes has to be so easy as soon as PoP opens. If we are going to have alternate mechanisms for access to zones to relieve flagging stresses, why not add them to Veeshan's Peak and Vex Thal (please don't) to make it seem like less of a double standard? If someone could explain this to me in reasonable terms, other than that "locking out content isn't fair" nonsense, I would really appreciate it. &lt;span&gt;:smileyhappy:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By the way, after reading this, don't forget that I am going to have to work through these keys and flags just like everyone else. I am looking forward to it. Maybe I am a masochist, but I just find accessing restricted content to be a very rewarding aspect of gaming.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I guess my point was, you didn't see a bunch of level 45s trying to break NToV or do HoT... you wont see a bunch of 50s in Sol Ro's Tower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As to are-hattery and training in relationship to adding to a community it's not that you like the arse-hat, but more that the enemy of my enemy is my friend kind of thing.  While there may be one person there doing dumb stuff, you can create a bond with other while ridiculing him.  I think the frustration in whatever manner it comes is why we all loved the game back then.  Frustration getting to the goal makes the goal that much sweeter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without hate how do you define love, without pain how do you define joy... eq gave/gives us pleanty of both.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
