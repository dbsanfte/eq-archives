<DIV>Something I'd like to have featured in the upcoming expansions is factions that matter once again.&nbsp; The faction system from Planes of Power on forward has been woefully lacking.&nbsp; Typically there are a large number of factions that do not matter, and then one or two factions which players need to raise in order to do the quests of that expansion.&nbsp; After many complaints about factions not mattering, DoN was released in which we had 2 factions we could raise (mutually exclusive) but whose faction path mirrored each other.&nbsp;&nbsp; There was essentially no difference between the factions.&nbsp; In fact, you might as well had only 3 factions in the DoN expansion:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>1. Good guys</DIV>
<DIV>2. Bad guys</DIV>
<DIV>3. Victims of the Good and Bad Guys (use this for the natives of the DoN zones).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>For some strange reason, I don't think this is what people meant when they said they wanted factions to matter again.&nbsp; Compare this to the much more complex and realistic faction system of the original game, Kunark, Velious, and Luclin and you can see how lacking it is.&nbsp; There could be much more to the faction system in DoN.&nbsp; Some of the mission hints at attempts to open up dialogues and relations with the goblins of Stillmoon temple, or other attempts to seek allies in the DoN zones.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the NPC's of these zones are almost all on unraisable factions.&nbsp; I can raise similar issues and examples for the faction system in GoD, OoW, LoY (what faction?), LDoN, and PoP.</DIV><BR>

<DIV>Comming from someone that has done tons of faction raising:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>1. Old World-Too many, too hard to raise in some circumstances.</DIV>
<DIV>2. Kunark system sucks, short and sweet Cabilis took too long and&nbsp; Venril Sathir was too hard to keep. The best faction hands down was Sarnak, for both simplicity, ease and logic. Max&nbsp;faction with Cabilis took me&nbsp;6 weeks at 3-4 hours a day 5 days a week if that gives you any indication...</DIV>
<DIV>3. Velious- While a great system because it was simple and elogent. It still had many flaws. If you were in a raiding guild that killed anything that moves, you basically got screwed of having a city there. </DIV>
<DIV>3. Shadows of Luclin- Shar Vahl was cake to raise, and Seru versus Katta was nicely done but lacked more indepth work. The whole expansion still seems a bit "rushed" anyway though.</DIV>
<DIV>4. DoN fixed the raid section by having people choose the side they wanted to go with however they chose to do so. Problem was besides the AA, there was really no lore given out or any side perks like faster travel or options to do more quests for other items or unique clickies.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>At best what I prefer:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>1.&nbsp;2-4 factions per "side", with clear and non-repetitive or insanely difficult ways to raise a faction. That is no 27 mobs in Warslik Woods slaughter fest where you have to kill 200-300 of them, and then say "I am not a great sorcerer" for an hour and a half.</DIV>
<DIV>2. Tasks that start out mundane and then go into more interesting stuff like assassination, espionage, or making grandmaster works for people. </DIV>
<DIV>3. Incentives to have and keep faction, either titles or access to cool quests.</DIV><p>Message Edited by Vjik on <span class=date_text>08-09-2005</span> <span class=time_text>08:21 AM</span>
