				<DIV>I dont think anyone really "flew off the handle" here. We just dont think pet heals should be no agro heals.&nbsp; But it doesnt matter what we think, SOE will fix this and things will be just as they were before. I think the most out of hand reaction has been from mages who over-react when people question why the heals should be no agro. Perhaps its just apprehension of the nerf bat or fear that there is some rationale for questioning this aspect of pet heals?</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>And the point about "gimp tanks" was taken from a mage who suggested, actually suggested that a gimp tank could hold agro and stand up to three mobs in dire, so why shouldnt a mage pet stand up to that? I didnt think he was talking about a gimp raid geared warrior and I still dont.</DIV>
