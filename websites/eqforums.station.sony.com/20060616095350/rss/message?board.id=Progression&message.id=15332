      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;It's pretty hilarious people actually think the point of instancing is to reduce player interaction or move the game to a more "single player mode". People are either A. not that smart. or B. Scum fabricating stupid reasons to support their agenda.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Instancing is first and foremost to preserve the value of ones playing experience and to prevent bottlenecks in certain&amp;nbsp;areas not&amp;nbsp;to "reduce player interaction". You still have to have a full raid or group and you still have to communicate with 5-50+ people. You still have "competition between guilds" just not in the same altered metaphoric definition of "influence&amp;nbsp;over others gaming experience" as you do in completely non instanced games.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Competition can be formulated quite nicely with the simple formula of&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Guild A: Skill + Time = ProgressA&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Guild B: Skill + Time = ProgressB&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Competition = ProgressA : ProgressB&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;While completly leaving out the (+/- subterfuge,&amp;nbsp;****blocking, Interferance) portions of the formula.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Let's face it the magic word here is "influence" NOT "competition". &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The same analagy can be made&amp;nbsp;to a "Pk'er" being a completely different breed of person compared to a "PvP'er". The Pk'er has no inteerest or intent in losing and they do whatever within or outside of the rules to kill or grief as many people as possible without dying while&amp;nbsp;the PvP'er is totally centered around actual competition based on skill, knowledge, and chance luck but always mediated on a relatively equal starting ground.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Trust me when i say I have met quite a few "Pk'ers" who try to pass off their actions as "competition" when in all actually they are being nothing but quite anti-competetive.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;That is the kind of analogy you want to use because those sports ones are ridiculous and illogical.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well, I can go out into my yard, and just lob a basketball into the hoop, and see how many shots I get in, and my friend can do the same thing, and then we can compare scores.&amp;nbsp; Or we can actually meet up in person and play one on one.&amp;nbsp; Personally, I think the latter is more fun, and I find the former rather boring.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Ok I see your point in influence over competition.&amp;nbsp; But they're the same.&amp;nbsp; Basketball players influence the other team just as much as guilds influence the other team.&amp;nbsp; I think I got that right.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The real issue here is the fac that 90% of you do not have the desire to be the best, as some do.&amp;nbsp; And that's not a bad thing, unless you make it one.&amp;nbsp; Anybody who was in a top guild back in 99 probably hated the other top guild just as much as the other top guild hated them, but that the same time they enjoyed each others company.&amp;nbsp; It's more like 'rivalry' than competition if that helps.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I didn't understand half of what you posted, but this is why we have instancing:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;1.)&amp;nbsp; Some guilds trained other guilds and Sony couldn't hire competent GMs to deal with the disputes.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;2.)&amp;nbsp; The more casual crowd wanted a shot at loot, so they dumbed it up and made a gazillion of the same mob.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;3.)&amp;nbsp; Because WoW has instancing. (Yeah EQ had it first, but they were anticipating WoW's)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;That said, I'm not trying to do away with instancing, but I don't like it because yeah, it does reduce the connection we have.&amp;nbsp; For instance I'll never know your true color because you wouldn't be able to train me.&amp;nbsp; I would rather you train me and get everything out on the table than let it build up inside you.&amp;nbsp; And if I wanted to play a game with 6 of my friends and only 6 of my friends, I would call them up, tell them to bring their comps and WC3 CDs to my house and we would have a LAN party.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;But instancing is far more appealing to the MAJORITY of the MMORPG subscribers today, so there's really nothing we can do about it.&amp;nbsp; That's why I'm going to enjoy EQ progression while I can.&amp;nbsp; After PoP comes out I probably won't even play any more.&amp;nbsp; No comraderie, no fun.&amp;nbsp; I enjoy competition, and PoP+ pretty much eliminates that.&amp;nbsp; Anyhow, that's just my opinion, you're welcome to have your own.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>If another guild plowed all the way to a mob, and then we zoned in, we'd generally respect their right to a first shot at the mob, as long as they don't take a ridiculous amount of time, try to wait for more people to arrive, or something like that.&amp;nbsp; I wouldn't pull the named as another guild was killing the guard mob right in front of it... unless they'd pulled similar crap on us in the past, then all bets are off.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If they lose, then we'd take our shot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Say someone was clearing pofear, and had the whole plane cleared.&amp;nbsp; We wouldn't zone in and pull cazic before they could get him normally.&amp;nbsp; We would give them a fair shot at cazic, and if they screwed up and wiped, we'd take him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If someone is trying to kite a mob or otherwise delay waiting for more people to arrive, because they lack sufficient force (or believe they lack sufficient force), then we'd engage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;By killing the targets that they are gathering for that you have allready beaten just because your guild can move faster?</description>

      <description>"If EQ was a guild vs guild game PoTime would have never been&#xD;
instanced.&amp;nbsp; The devs have already confirmed that your conclusion is&#xD;
wrong. "&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Incorrect.&amp;nbsp; EQ was guild vs guild, but was changed over time (mostly by SoE) to become more guild vs random pixels.&amp;nbsp; Original EQ was all about guild vs guild, but the vision is dead, and that's why we want to go back to the old days.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;"I dont know why anyone would want to be in a guild with you.&amp;nbsp; You&#xD;
obviously dont look at them as people, just more mobs to join you to&#xD;
compete against other guilds.&amp;nbsp; You completely miss the whole point of a&#xD;
guild with that thinking. "&lt;/p&gt;And somehow I have more interested in joining my guild than we can even come close to taking.&amp;nbsp; Perhaps you are wrong about what people want out of this game?&amp;nbsp; I look at my guildmates as people, and at others as people.&amp;nbsp; You're the one that wants to replace person vs person with instancing and move more in the direction of a single player game.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>"There is a differnce between competition and killing mobs or training&#xD;
guilds working on it just for the purpose of keeping them from getting&#xD;
gear and progression. Also if you think about it using sports to&#xD;
compare stuff with EQ is a bad example because when you play a sport&#xD;
the object of the game is to beat the other players. When you play EQ&#xD;
or other PvE MMORPS' however the object of the game is to advance your&#xD;
chacter not prevent others from advancing so you have an eaiser time.&#xD;
All that most people ask is that just becasuse you can dont jump over&#xD;
other guilds and kill targets they need to advance and you dont gain&#xD;
anything from. Yes there is a lot of competiton in the game but that&#xD;
doesnt mean people have to become complete jerks when it comes to&#xD;
advancing heck you might find that if you are nice to people they will&#xD;
be nice in return."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is a big difference between killing mobs to keep them from others and training others to prevent them from killing a mob they'd otherwise be able to kill.&amp;nbsp; The first is legal, and I'd do it, the second is not, and I wouldn't unless the other guys had started out training us.&amp;nbsp; i.e. We are killing AoW and you train tormax on us, you can bet that as you engage aow 10 mins later, tormax will visit you, or something along those lines.&amp;nbsp; Otherwise, if you're killing a mob, we'll give you your shot at the mob, and if you win, grats, and if you lose, we'll give it a shot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We don't just kill mobs that you want to be mean.&amp;nbsp; We do it because doing so helps us maintain a lead over you.&amp;nbsp; If we don't perceive you as a threat, we probably wouldn't do it.&amp;nbsp; Think of it this way.&amp;nbsp; Say we have enough ST keys to raid ST, but you guys are a cleric or 2 short.&amp;nbsp; If we kill Klandicar when we catch him up, we can prevent you from getting the st key you need to kill the mobs we want in st, hence, killing that mob that you say we don't gain anything from actually gains us a bunch of primals, sods, and other goodies.&amp;nbsp; So that's why we do it, not because we don't like you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>"The point of EQ is Player vs. Enviorment, not guild vs. guild."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I disagree completely.&amp;nbsp; EQ is all about guild vs guild.&amp;nbsp; That's the only real competition, and where all the fun comes in.&amp;nbsp; That's the point of it being an mmorpg.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Way back in 2000, I used to be like you guys that think "oh noz, the big bad uberguilds are going to steal our mobs because they are meanies!"&amp;nbsp; Then somewhere along the line, I realized that it's a GAME, and the point of playing a game is to win by any means possible within the rules.&amp;nbsp; If I go play baseball with my friends, am I being mean if I hit a home run?&amp;nbsp; No, I'm just playing the game, within the rules of the game.&amp;nbsp; Am I being mean if I'm playing monopoly and I put a hotel on Boardwalk and bankrupt someone?&amp;nbsp; Nope, that's how you play the game.&amp;nbsp; Competing with other guilds, as long as you stay within the bounds of the rules, is not "mean".&amp;nbsp; It's just part of the game.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Asking us not to do that is basically asking us to throw the game so you can win.&amp;nbsp; I think that's pretty lame, and I'd never ask anyone to throw a game so I could win.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
