&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Rez is farmed out how exactly? and Healing potions really aren't going to challenge the Cleric's positions I think. (mainly non-healers will benifit from this)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Chromonukes always do less then normal nukes, your normal nuke is 1400. Extending the focus items/AAs they effect is something that effects all classes. A definate increase in all your nukes is advisable, I think 1700 is somewhat too large an increase. Overall you'd probably be better off looking for lowered cast times and better mana costs.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;2.&amp;nbsp; fixed invis&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;No, never and again never. Give it a rest,. it ain't gonna happen and you aren'tt he only non-invising class out there. They've made Stackable invis potions to accomodate non-invising classes.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;3.&amp;nbsp; persistent pet&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Way, way too much.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;6.&amp;nbsp; unresistable reverse damage shield&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Don't think you need this, and don't think resists are that huge an issue with these reverse damage shields.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;7.&amp;nbsp; up the new solo reverse damage shields proc rates---they should be going off once every 3 or 4 times we are getting hit.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;They already are pretty impressive. Do you really need this?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;8.&amp;nbsp; along with number 4--give us an improved root that will actually land and stick for like 1 minute&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Your root is pretty good.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;9.&amp;nbsp; make our stuns land&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;They face the same restrictions that other Stunning classes have, I honestly think most Unstunnable mobs should remain uneffected by current stuns. besides you have alternative things to cast on stun immune mobs, like for example, Nukes.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;10.&amp;nbsp; an aura around us that cures disease and poisons&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Not a bad idea, but essentially an&amp;nbsp;Group Cure is what this would be, Clerics have this as a component in their group heals, but it could be a seperate spell in of itself.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#cc0000&gt;rez with 0% call to corpses to druid/shaman would be farmed out just as much as druid/wizard ports were with POK stones/gate potions.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Neither are as good as the original but both&amp;nbsp; give a gimped form.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; If the claim is being made that ports are farmed out (when nothing yet compares to an evac/exodus&amp;nbsp; and origin/gate potions still have nothing on ports, well then you would have to say rez was farmed out just the same.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I have yet to see gate potions (at 200 plat a shot) prevent a tpw--or move a party to new zone to exp.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; POK stones have about 1/3 the locations they can get you to as ports (places you want to go anyhow).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; magi/spires/POK stones will none of them get you out of a dungeon.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Gate potion will get you out of a dungeon-at a cost of almost 200 plat each and spreading you out if different bind spots--and definitly just cant move you all to next target zone like a port can.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Yet we hear all the time that ports are farmed out.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;1.&amp;nbsp; 1700 pt chromonuke&amp;nbsp; (80% of a druids)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; and make it affected by focus items and AAs--1200 is friggin rediculous nuke for a level 70 character.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#cc0000&gt;so what size increase do you think?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; druids have a 2100 pt nuke.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; if they are going to be 80% of our healing,&amp;nbsp; have DS and Lions strength to also add to dps, then what would our nuke need to be to be acceptable?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; shouldnt it at least be 80% of thiers---heck we still would not do 80% of t hier dps contribution because of DS and lions strength.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I dont see you recommending that warriors should do LESS then 80% of a knights dps.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; why should we do LESS then 80% of a druids dps AND have less utility---IF they get the healing increases?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; We would still be doing LESS-----in the tank world&amp;nbsp; Warriors do MORE!!!!!&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;2.&amp;nbsp; fixed invis&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#cc0000&gt;there is exactly one caster class which doesnt have fixed invis or invis---the reason they always gave was "it would trivialize CR"&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; well now there are two rezzers with fixed invis---excuse falls flat.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;3.&amp;nbsp; persistent pet&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Yes, definately.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;4.&amp;nbsp; a version of the warrior snare (trick mob into running back type thing)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; or give us an AA so that our own (but only our own) nukes dont break our own roots.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#cc0000&gt;have you tried to land a cleric stun or root on high level mobs?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I think you are remembering the stuns and roots working from&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;50 and 60 levels--not the 70s.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;paladin stuns work better then cleric ones currently.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; and now our roots do not work.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Ours were like druid roots--note they got a new improved one even though they have snare.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; We need a stun that will land or a root that will stick.&amp;nbsp; a lot of stuff that used to work for clerics in the 50s and 60s quits working on level 70 content.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Make our root and stuns work and this would be a non-issue.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;5.&amp;nbsp; an aura around us to increase everyones resists above the current 500 level.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; say a +200 to all resists that can go over the cap.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Way, way too much.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#cc0000&gt;so why are clerics resist buffs so far behind all the other casters?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; We need something to help us resist buff.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;6.&amp;nbsp; unresistable reverse damage shield&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Don't think you need this, and don't think resists are that huge an issue with these reverse damage shields.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#cc0000&gt;til you try to cast a reverse DS on a mob and have it resisted 3 times in a row (for four mobs in a row)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; so that it doesnt even land til mob is at 40% life, dont talk to me about it not being an issue.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; imagine mages and druids if there was a chance for thier DS to get resisted every hit?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; and they only use the mana to cast once and can then free up the spell gem.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;7.&amp;nbsp; up the new solo reverse damage shields proc rates---they should be going off once every 3 or 4 times we are getting hit.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;They already are pretty impressive. Do you really need this?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#cc0000&gt;I have tried using it 12-14 times in stillmoon temple.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; proc rate is averaging one in 14 hits.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; which is I dont know 1 in how many swings they take at me.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; but they hit me 14 times for each time it goes off.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; so I get hit for 250 * 14 or 3500 pts of damage to do 450 back.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; In that same time a druid damage shield (55 points only not even includign the 16 self only DS) would do&amp;nbsp; 14* 55 = 770.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; throw in druid self&amp;nbsp;DS and it is 71 * 14 = 994.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; see everyone sees our large one hit and assumes it is awesome.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; but with the low proc rate, it is not.&amp;nbsp; It should at least proc every 1 in 8.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;8.&amp;nbsp; along with number 4--give us an improved root that will actually land and stick for like 1 minute&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Your root is pretty good.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#cc0000&gt;the problem is ours is usually resisted by even stunnable mobs.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; paladin stuns land better then cleric ones.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; heck jsut give me all the paladin stuns and I would be happy with that part&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;10.&amp;nbsp; an aura around us that cures disease and poisons&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Not a bad idea, but essentially an&amp;nbsp;Group Cure is what this would be, Clerics have this as a component in their group heals, but it could be a seperate spell in of itself.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#cc0000&gt;rez with 0% call to corpses to druid/shaman would be farmed out just as much as druid/wizard ports were with POK stones/gate potions.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Neither are as good as the original but both&amp;nbsp; give a gimped form.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; If the claim is being made that ports are farmed out (when nothing yet compares to an evac/exodus&amp;nbsp; and origin/gate potions still have nothing on ports, well then you would have to say rez was farmed out just the same.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I have yet to see gate potions (at 200 plat a shot) prevent a tpw--or move a party to new zone to exp.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; POK stones have about 1/3 the locations they can get you to as ports (places you want to go anyhow).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; magi/spires/POK stones will none of them get you out of a dungeon.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Gate potion will get you out of a dungeon-at a cost of almost 200 plat each and spreading you out if different bind spots--and definitly just cant move you all to next target zone like a port can.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Yet we hear all the time that ports are farmed out.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Forgot about that 0% Rez. Unfortunately thats a necesity. However that only helps get the group up and going, it does not Rez the person. The expereince is lost unless they can get a Cleric Rez (or an inferior rez from Necro/Paladin)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Ports have been being farmed out for a long time, OOT Hammer, Thuragen potions for example. This is a good comparison, neither has really impacted Druids and Wizard populations.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#cc0000&gt;so what size increase do you think?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; druids have a 2100 pt nuke.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; if they are going to be 80% of our healing,&amp;nbsp; have DS and Lions strength to also add to dps, then what would our nuke need to be to be acceptable?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; shouldnt it at least be 80% of thiers---heck we still would not do 80% of t hier dps contribution because of DS and lions strength.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I dont see you recommending that warriors should do LESS then 80% of a knights dps.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; why should we do LESS then 80% of a druids dps AND have less utility---IF they get the healing increases?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; We would still be doing LESS-----in the tank world&amp;nbsp; Warriors do MORE!!!!!&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I do see me saying that Knights should do less then 80% of a Warrior's DPS though. That is the payment for us having great versatility as hybrids.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The proposed Healing increases to Druids and Shamans comes in the form of Stances, taking on a healing Stance involves dropping their DPS stance. Unless Clerics receive the same Stance system your&amp;nbsp;method of comparison doesn't match.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;A 6 second cast time Nuke is impractical to use for someone with healing duties, so simply increasing the size isn't the only solution, isn't the best solution. I'm sugesting improvements &lt;EM&gt;beyond&lt;/EM&gt; that. Not just increasing the Damage of your spells, but improving them overall so they can be employed more effectively with less conflict with your other abilities.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;-Lowered Cast times. Means you can get more opportunities to cast Nukes while healing, since casting other spells does conflict with your need to cast Heals. Additionally when you cast while in Melee you loose substantial melee DPS, lowered cast times would lessen that loss and make casting/Meleeing more practical.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;-Lower Mana Costs, would give you a greater pool to cast from, making it more practical to assist in DPS from casting while maintaining your needed mana pool.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Couple these things with an increase to your Damage Yields and you become more effective overall.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#cc0000&gt;there is exactly one caster class which doesnt have fixed invis or invis---the reason they always gave was "it would trivialize CR"&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; well now there are two rezzers with fixed invis---excuse falls flat.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Again, those call to corpses doesn't remove the need to obtain an actual Rez. And are not nearly as desirable. The "trivialize CR" was only one minor reason for why Clerics don't get Invis. And again you aren't the only class that doesn't get invisible, tell me why you deserve invis more then I do, or the Warrior does?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Stackable invis potions gives every non-invis class appropriate tools for this.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#cc0000&gt;have you tried to land a cleric stun or root on high level mobs?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I think you are remembering the stuns and roots working from&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;50 and 60 levels--not the 70s.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;paladin stuns work better then cleric ones currently.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; and now our roots do not work.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Ours were like druid roots--note they got a new improved one even though they have snare.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; We need a stun that will land or a root that will stick.&amp;nbsp; a lot of stuff that used to work for clerics in the 50s and 60s quits working on level 70 content.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Make our root and stuns work and this would be a non-issue.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Have I tried to land Cleric Stuns and roots on high level mobs? Why Yes I have Brum, practically every day. My stuns and roots work the same as yours do.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Paladin Stuns don't work better then Cleric Stuns. Really you stun lands for 25% greater duration. You have stuns, they work. Your root Sticks better then my root, what do you think I use when I solo and a mob runs? I slap a stun on it and root it.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Are your Stuns and Roots the best tools? No they aren't the best, everyone would like a snare I imagine. But the point is that you have such tools, and they do work. I know they work because I use the same tools.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;5.&amp;nbsp; an aura around us to increase everyones resists above the current 500 level.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; say a +200 to all resists that can go over the cap.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Way, way too much.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#cc0000&gt;so why are clerics resist buffs so far behind all the other casters?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; We need something to help us resist buff.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Fair enough, you may need an increase to your resist buffs. Perhaps they could use improving, that is fair enough. But this suggestion in particular is Way, way too much.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;6.&amp;nbsp; unresistable reverse damage shield&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Don't think you need this, and don't think resists are that huge an issue with these reverse damage shields.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#cc0000&gt;til you try to cast a reverse DS on a mob and have it resisted 3 times in a row (for four mobs in a row)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; so that it doesnt even land til mob is at 40% life, dont talk to me about it not being an issue.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; imagine mages and druids if there was a chance for thier DS to get resisted every hit?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; and they only use the mana to cast once and can then free up the spell gem.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;From what I am told, your resist rate for this spell is not that high. I can see an arguement for a greater resist adjustment made on this spell, but I don't see the need for it to be unresistable, nor do I think it resists enough to be such a large issue.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#cc0000&gt;I have tried using it 12-14 times in stillmoon temple.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; proc rate is averaging one in 14 hits.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; which is I dont know 1 in how many swings they take at me.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; but they hit me 14 times for each time it goes off.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; so I get hit for 250 * 14 or 3500 pts of damage to do 450 back.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; In that same time a druid damage shield (55 points only not even includign the 16 self only DS) would do&amp;nbsp; 14* 55 = 770.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; throw in druid self&amp;nbsp;DS and it is 71 * 14 = 994.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; see everyone sees our large one hit and assumes it is awesome.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; but with the low proc rate, it is not.&amp;nbsp; It should at least proc every 1 in 8.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Druid doesn't generally stand toe to toe with a mob to solo it, so comparing the DS in this manner is somewhat sceptical. I don't see the harm in increasing this however.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Your root is pretty good.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#cc0000&gt;ummm.&amp;nbsp; no it is not&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Oh, yes it is, 3.0 minute Duration, that's pretty decent if you ask me. But hey, why ask me, I only got 1.4 minutes on mine.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;9.&amp;nbsp; make our stuns land&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#cc0000&gt;the problem is ours is usually resisted by even stunnable mobs.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; paladin stuns land better then cleric ones.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; heck jsut give me all the paladin stuns and I would be happy with that part&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Paladin Stuns hardly land better then yours, there is an insignificant resist adjustment and thats about it. In additon you have a 25% greater duration on your stuns. The only real notable difference is in the number of stuns we can cast compared to you, however with their aggro, I don't think that would really be benificial.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Additionally, you get a number of other offensive spelsl that you can cast. Direct Damage, reverse Damage Shields, I'd gladly give you some Paladin stuns in exchange for a few of those. When I face an unstunable mob, thats it, I have zero offensive spells to use against them, I get nothing. (not saying I should) you at least have the option of casting something else, so i don't beleive you are lacking in versatility here.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Statements such as "Have I tried to land Cleric Stuns and roots on high level mobs? Why Yes I have Brum, practically every day. My stuns and roots work the same as yours do"&amp;amp; "From what I am told, your resist rate for this spell is not that high"&amp;nbsp;speak volumes as to your understanding of the cleric class.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Here's the short version &lt;/STRONG&gt;- No, your stuns and roots do not work the same as clerics.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Here's the long version &lt;/STRONG&gt;- Cleric and Paladin stuns share similar mana cost, cast times, and duration (that 25% extra duration you seem so fond of translates into a stun potentially sticking on a mob .5 seconds more).&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;So in that aspect they are similar.&amp;nbsp; However, to state they "work the same" is a huge fallacy.&amp;nbsp; First difference is the resist adjustment.&amp;nbsp; You state this is "insignificant".&amp;nbsp; I'll remember that as the mob bolts away from me after resisting the stun.&amp;nbsp; So even if the mob flees and your stuns are resisted, what do you do? -- Cast your root that works the same as the cleric one?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Oh wait, it doesn't work the same as the cleric one.&amp;nbsp; First difference is mana cost.&amp;nbsp; Yours: 75 mana.&amp;nbsp; Clerics: 180 mana.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Second difference is cast time.&amp;nbsp; Yours: .75.&amp;nbsp; Clerics:&amp;nbsp; 2.5.&amp;nbsp; Third difference is how a paladin and cleric must "finish off" this mob.&amp;nbsp; The cleric in order to damage a mob faster than it regens must use procs, nukes, or the ward (I guess could click off ward and not attack it..let it kill itself on marks....but we'd have to rez ourselves after we fell asleep at the keyboard before it died).&amp;nbsp; How do you finish off your mobs, melee - melee, stun, stun, melee --if your root breaks, you have more stuns available and a faster root to stop it.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;However, I do not intend this post as a "waah waaah" paladins get something we don't.&amp;nbsp; Rather it is a, Sir - what you posted is wrong and here is the proof.&amp;nbsp; Our stuns and roots do not work the same...end of story.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Actually yes they do work much the same. A stun stuns up to level 70 and root stops the mob's movements. Exactly the same.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Here's the long version &lt;/STRONG&gt;- Cleric and Paladin stuns share similar mana cost, cast times, and duration (that 25% extra duration you seem so fond of translates into a stun potentially sticking on a mob .5 seconds more).&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;So in that aspect they are similar.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Cleric stuns last 1 second longer then Paladins, there is no "potential" about that, Stuns are not mitigated, yours lasts exactly 1 second (25%) longer.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;However, to state they "work the same" is a huge fallacy.&amp;nbsp; First difference is the resist adjustment.&amp;nbsp; You state this is "insignificant".&amp;nbsp; I'll remember that as the mob bolts away from me after resisting the stun.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The resist adjustment on our stuns is insignificant, the amount that it effects resist rates is something that would only be noticed by lengthy parsing. What your case is that your stuns will be resisted, what?&amp;nbsp;0.00001% more often? I call that insignificant.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Oh wait, it doesn't work the same as the cleric one.&amp;nbsp; First difference is mana cost.&amp;nbsp; Yours: 75 mana.&amp;nbsp; Clerics: 180 mana.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Second difference is cast time.&amp;nbsp; Yours: .75.&amp;nbsp; Clerics:&amp;nbsp; 2.5.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Mana costs aren't really relevant, your nit picking. (and your not calculating duration into those costs)&amp;nbsp;You are also ignoring that you also have a 1.75 root. fast enough to do your job. &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Third difference is how a paladin and cleric must "finish off" this mob.&amp;nbsp; The cleric in order to damage a mob faster than it regens must use procs, nukes, or the ward (I guess could click off ward and not attack it..let it kill itself on marks&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Several Clerics above have explained exactly how they deal with such mobs, with little difficulty. &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;You can Stun it (5 seconds) follow that with a second Stun/dd (5.25 seconds) and then with a root, switch to a non procing weapon that does melee damage (your root lasts three minutes). Oh yes and you can Nuke the mob to finish it off when it's at it's last sliver of health, if you want to.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Do you have the best tools? No you do not. But you do have those tools. They can be used and they do in fact work. Warriors had no such tools, nothing, zero, zilch, nada. So thats how I answer your nit picking about how well the various tools that you have work as a reason&amp;nbsp;to why you should get the Warrior's skill by&amp;nbsp;pointing out the simple fact that you have such tools&amp;nbsp;to deal with fleeing mobs already.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;....but we'd have to rez ourselves after we fell asleep at the keyboard before it died).&amp;nbsp; How do you finish off your mobs, melee - melee, stun, stun, melee --if your root breaks, you have more stuns available and a faster root to stop it.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Fact is Clerics are currently Soloing, using these tools (root and stun) and not dying of boredom while soloing.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;However, I do not intend this post as a "waah waaah" paladins get something we don't.&amp;nbsp; Rather it is a, Sir - what you posted is wrong and here is the proof.&amp;nbsp; Our stuns and roots do not work the same...end of story.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;You cast a stun, themob becomes stuned (up to level 70). You cast a root, the mob becomes rooted and cannot move. Both these tools work the same.&amp;nbsp; We have identical effects, we use these spells in identical fashion, you're nit picking over irrelevant details.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Or will you tell me that my stun works like a fear and my root like a snare?&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Yeah...sure...such factors as resistence&amp;nbsp;check, &amp;nbsp;cast time, recast time, and mana cost really dont matter&amp;nbsp;at all in soloing...that is just nitpicking&amp;nbsp;... /sarcasm off&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Yes, we do share a 1.75 root with paladins, in fact Greater Immobilize is one we shared at 61/62.&amp;nbsp; I forgot to compare that I'm sorry.&amp;nbsp; Here is how that is different from yours.&amp;nbsp; This root type was upgraded for paladins to Shackles of Tunare.&amp;nbsp; Instead clerics were given the 3 min root upgrade that has no resist check.--Petrifying Earth.&amp;nbsp; So by comparing our&amp;nbsp;lev 62 Greater immobilize to your lev 65 Shackles of Tunare --&amp;nbsp; Greater Immobilize has twice the mana cost, a second longer cast time,&amp;nbsp;longer recast time than Shackles of Tunare.&amp;nbsp; They do share the same resistence adjustment except yours is a higher level spell so....never mind, it is insignificant right?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;And yes, I do know clerics can and do solo.&amp;nbsp; I personally find it a challenge and fun to do so.&amp;nbsp; However, your post was wholly inaccurate and doesn't correctly portray cleric soloing or make a valid comparison between clerics and paladins soloing.&amp;nbsp; If you dismiss the details, your point is simply invalid.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Nyianna, I wasn't comparing Clerics to Paladins as much as I was to Warriors. The claim here is that Clerics Need to have the Warrior AA to stop fleeing mobs, when you already have working tools to deal with such events.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Your root is not as bad as you paint, not nearly so. You are quibbling over irrelevancies, like "twice the mana cost as the Paladin root" which is pure hogwash. Root isn't used just to solo, but in groups as well, and for parking mobs, that 3 minute duration is well worth the extra mana. Additionally Clerics have alot more mana resourses then Paladins, so again moot point.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Point in order. Clerics do have the tools to deal with fleeing mobs, there is no need to farm the Warrior AA out.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;The biggest issue with cleric root and soloing clerics is that as soon as our ward of retribution procs the root poofs.&amp;nbsp; OR if we cast a DD spell the root poofs.&amp;nbsp;OR if our weapon DD procs the root poofs.&amp;nbsp; these are the three most important parts of a cleric's DPS: we &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;U&gt;NEED&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; these in order to kill the mob with any sort of erfficiency.&amp;nbsp; I did some testing and in barindu, once the mob got down to 20% I clicked off my ward, I changed weapons to a non-proccing weapon, and I rooted the mob.&amp;nbsp; From 20% to dead took twice as long as 100% to 20%.&amp;nbsp; I had to recast my root twice and my RDS's once, that's how long it took.&amp;nbsp; That is why a &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;U&gt;CLERIC&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; (on this very forum) originally suggested an AA to force mobs to stay and fight.&amp;nbsp; However, in their infinite wisdom, the developers decided to give that AA ability to warriors instead.</description>

You have the tools to do the job, yes perhaps not the best tools, no doubt,&amp;nbsp;but they are there and they do work.

&lt;P&gt;I disagree. "works SOOOOOOO poorly" is a gross exageration. &lt;/FONT&gt;Your roots and stuns are acceptable and functional tools for dealing with fleeing mobs. Soloing is never easy and&amp;nbsp;involves a certain degree of risk and unique tactics, and your ability to deal with fleeing mobs falls perfectly within acceptable limits.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;For "all intents and purposes" it does work. Clerics can solo mobs, they can kill them at an adequate rate and they can deal with fleeing mobs.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Now I won't disagree that there couldn't be improvements. A faster cast time on root for instance. However things such as the Warrior AA, or an unbreakable root are way out of line.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Your arguement is irrelevant, Paladins are a Melee Class, of course we can effectively Melee better then Clerics. Get a clue, we're supposed to be better then you.

&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;I as a pure Melee expect to Melee the mob straight through like normal. Of course&amp;nbsp;I don't get a happy standing mana regen, 30% haste spell nor my best weapon given to me on a gold platter (summoned hammer anyone?) nor a Reverse Damage shield. I just work my ass off like the rest of the players in the game.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;I do not, will not, disagree with a plausible arguement for an improvement to the Cleric's Roots and Stuns or even melee DPS, I won't argue that the last 20% of the mob isn't hard. But some of these suggestions go far above what is needed. An unbreakable root? the Warrior AA? those are too much. Furthermore you do have very effective tools that do in fact work.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;As for your cry for Paladin nerfs, you can play that card all you want but fact is our Heals and our Stuns have both been progressively reduced in power. I will have you recall that we once had the second best Heal in the game. We've been progressively reduced in power since then.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;You show nothing but ignorance when your only arguement is to call for nerfs to another class. Clerics have been getting plenty of improvements aimed at giving them greater soloability, some very good improvements. Standing Mana Regen, 40% Self-Haste, summoned Weaponry, Reverse Damage Shields, to name a few. And your complaint is the last 1/5th of the mob takes time to kill? So sorry if I don't buy into the hard luck story Brum.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>"so what size increase do you think?   druids have a 2100 pt nuke.   if they are going to be 80% of our healing,  have DS and Lions strength to also add to dps, then what would our nuke need to be to be acceptable?   shouldnt it at least be 80% of thiers---heck we still would not do 80% of t hier dps contribution because of DS and lions strength.     I dont see you recommending that warriors should do LESS then 80% of a knights dps.   why should we do LESS then 80% of a druids dps AND have less utility---IF they get the healing increases?   We would still be doing LESS-----in the tank world  Warriors do MORE!!!!!"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I had already voiced my views on your suggestions on page one, but I felt I should reply again. Ignoring mana cost, twin marks do 79 damage per hit, which is 24 / hit more than Nettle shield. They both last 15 minutes, but twin marks cost (without mana prez) 450 mana, Druid DS costing 220. No exp mob lasts 15 minutes unless you have pitiful dps, and druid ds is a buff, not a debuff that can be resisted. So in effect, a group will gain more benefit from their damage shield than our marks. So what? In a good group doing say Riftseekers, DS dps whether from marks or nettle shield is minimal compared to the total output of the group, its a nice have, but again if its your main dps source, even being passive, then there is a problem with the group. In exchange for lions which adds dps, we have vie, which decreases dps taken, you can not say that spell is not utility (although, a higher total hp until gone would be nicer). &lt;br&gt;Unless you have forgotten, our nukes have been revised once already, what of the time when our DD's had such a long recast, that if we wanted to chain nuke we would have to mem 2 different nukes? They had a higher base then too. Personally I do not see why you are so obsessed with the 80% figure - just how does a druid heal 80% of us? Naked sure, with heal bases, but with RNG and overal power from aa's, innate 5% to heals, and foci, druids will never heal 80% of a cleric, you are just considering instant heals (probably just lights) and not our whole plethora of heals. So you should not be fixated on a cleric doing 80% the dps of a druid, we never were the uber damaging class, and while I agree we should do more- we are the messengers of the gods so we should be able to smite with good godly power and not weaker hits, should it even matter if a warrior: Master of weapons, does more dps than us?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"there is exactly one caster class which doesnt have fixed invis or invis---the reason they always gave was "it would trivialize CR"    well now there are two rezzers with fixed invis---excuse falls flat."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It doesn't, they can only rez once every 10 minutes, how would you feel if someone told you "I'm rezzing the group, youll get rezzed in 50 minutes"? We have no timer on our rezzes, so be thankful. Invis is a dead issue now, it has been said enough.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"have you tried to land a cleric stun or root on high level mobs?   I think you are remembering the stuns and roots working from the 50 and 60 levels--not the 70s.   paladin stuns work better then cleric ones currently.    and now our roots do not work.    Ours were like druid roots--note they got a new improved one even though they have snare.   We need a stun that will land or a root that will stick.  a lot of stuff that used to work for clerics in the 50s and 60s quits working on level 70 content.   Make our root and stuns work and this would be a non-issue."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is true, in most content higher end, mobs are either too high for stun, or if lvl 70 or under they are tagged immune. What you are commenting on is the fact our stuns have a worse resist check overal (-55/-45 vs -10/0). Lowered checks would make them more useful and more likely to land, and that would be a good change. Our roots do work, early breakings happen all the time for us, but they also do often stay for full duration. At lvl 70, head to riftseekers and root a Pyrilen with Greater Immobilization and see how often it breaks too early. Sometimes it will, sometimes they will resist, sometimes it will land for full duration, it is all RNG. Our roots do work, if you think they do not then you are not persisting, if you want it too easy, is there a challenge?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"so why are clerics resist buffs so far behind all the other casters?   We need something to help us resist buff."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are lore reasons as to why druids gain a resist buff that is strong against the elemental magics of Fire and Ice - both of which they are profficient in; why shamen gain a resist buff strong against disease and poison for again it is their field of specialty; and why enchanters gain Guard of Druzzil - they specialise in magical enchantments. We already have resist buffs adding +40, if there was a Divine Resist then sure we should have a buff in that, but there is not, so which resist should clerics be profficient in? I do not see one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"til you try to cast a reverse DS on a mob and have it resisted 3 times in a row (for four mobs in a row)   so that it doesnt even land til mob is at 40% life, dont talk to me about it not being an issue.    imagine mages and druids if there was a chance for thier DS to get resisted every hit?   and they only use the mana to cast once and can then free up the spell gem."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Again, RNG. What mobs resist that much at  lvl 70? Barely many, heck anguish trash is the only kind of trash that I find resisting marks several times in a row if I am not lucky. If you do not land a mark in the first 20% then do not bother at all, unless the mob themself has a huge damage shield that needs removing. The latter is buffs, our mark is a debuff, that is just something we have to live with. But again, is DS dps THAT high to your groups?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"I have tried using it 12-14 times in stillmoon temple.   proc rate is averaging one in 14 hits.   which is I dont know 1 in how many swings they take at me.   but they hit me 14 times for each time it goes off.    so I get hit for 250 * 14 or 3500 pts of damage to do 450 back.    In that same time a druid damage shield (55 points only not even includign the 16 self only DS) would do  14* 55 = 770.   throw in druid self DS and it is 71 * 14 = 994.    see everyone sees our large one hit and assumes it is awesome.    but with the low proc rate, it is not.  It should at least proc every 1 in 8."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If that is what you believe then you do not understand how the ward mechanic works. It follows the basic proc laws, except with us initiating an attack round, the mob has to initiate an attack round on us, it will proc before the first hit of any given attack round. The 400% parry mod signifies that it is 4* 2.2 procs per minute, so ~9 procs a minute on average, it does not proc every X hits. EQ is all RNG, sometimes you will see it proc 23 times in a minute, sometimes just 5. So if a mob misses alot, where is that druid ds damage that is &gt; proc dmg? Non existant. The fact that the 2 forms of damage function completely differently shows a flaw to your DS dmg VS proc dmg argument. Don't believe me? Buff with ward, pull a lvl 1 trash near your hometown, that will barely ever hit you. Watch it proc regardless of hits or misses. Another thing you are ignoring is the fact that the ward can crit - while not every cleric may have crit aa's, it can do critical blasts for up to 2.25 times the base value. It also has separate proc lists per mob that is on you - pull 10 or so easy mobs and watch it spam nuke, which is a great great thing. The way it works now is fine as it is, if you think it does not work, then you do not know how to implement it properly in your method of soloing.</description>

      <description>"challenge I have no problem with.   have the mob summon and beat me when I root it.   that is what I actually want it to do.   I have tried 18 times to kill a stillmoon laborer solo.   every time they run.   every time they resist my top two stuns and a root and bring back friends.   Other casters got improved roots--I think it is not out of line for us to get one also---especially since we are most dependant on it for soloing."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Necromancers have Greater Immobilization as we do, a (-30) magic check root lasting 1 min but a cast time of 1.75 and 150 mana cost (I prefer this root), and Petrifying Earth as we do, another (-30) Magic check root but lasting up to 3 minutes with a 2.5 cast time and 180 mana. Wizards have strong root, sure, but that is extremely situational. Other than that, they share Greater Fetter with Enchanters, which is effectively Greater Immobilization with Petrifying Earth duration and a 140 mana cost. Granted, best root that casters get, but I ask you- when do you need a root to last 3 minutes? As you say, it can break before full duration, and as a cleric, when we want to finish off a runner I doubt it takes 3 minutes + to kill it even without ward. If you are having problem with a runner, then root it before running hp, lock it down and porcupine it to death if you fear ward breaking it too much and every further root resisting.&lt;br&gt;Druids have good roots, but they have been the root masters for a long time, so I will not debate that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"give us a chromo resist--one that is less then the individual ones that other casters get.    when the gods lend you thier protection, it should be good right?   then when no other casters are around we can protect our group."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Less than the individual (by that you must mean resist specific, even if 2 types?) is a more reasonable idea than +200 SVA. Not even all resist clickies allow that much. Chromatic resist generally means offensive spell wise, against your weakest resist, I'm guessing you mean prismatic - to all resists.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"it is when I am soloing.   and that is suppose to be the way I am to solo.   can you say DON progression.    other classes can solo two stillmoon laborers at a time.   is it too much to ask to be able to solo one reliably?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was talking specifically about groups. I know how much Damage shields are valuable in soloing - else I would not have done some of the first kills I have done, from which ~60% of total damage is from Marks+Damage shields combined - they are our only source of constant damage, provided things hit us. You have not stated your gear quality, just you are not anguish geared, but since when was that the minimum required gear to solo 2 at a time? That was doable in EP gear which with DoD must be easily achieved by now, I kid you not. If 2 at a time from the start is a problem, then before the first goblin is at 19% (the run %), pull another melee and tank both, with ward, until the first one dies, repeat as often as mana allows. Mob manipulation can be a key skill if you know their behaviours (why gaters gate and how to make them run and not gate, and so forth). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"the highest I have seen in 18 trys is 10 per minute.   SO if you have some magical means to make it proc 23 times a minute, please share.  I would think in 18 trys, the RNG should have shown me better by now, dont you?   "&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;23 was a typo I had overlooked, and I can not edit my posts. At the most I usually see 13 procs a minute, not 23.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"and the damage taken by the druid is ?   non existant.    if the mob is not damaging you, you dont have to heal yourself.   druids could solo that type of mob all day.   heck so could we if we could keep mob from running."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And the damage we take too, is non existant. But with ward, we can do damage without even having to take damage. Such is the way that ward works - it will even proc in Divine Aura. We too can solo that kind of mob all day, provided we balance mana used versus mana regained, and tip the balance so that mana regained &gt; mana used, over time. Runners arent usually the problem if you manipulate mobs and manage mana efficiently.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"wow--so I can wipe through orc pawns.    How does that help me in DON progression?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This was explaining to you that a mob does not ever have to hit to require our parry ward to proc, I wasn't saying "go solo orc pawns just to show you can". How does that help you in DoN progression? If you have good avoidance aa's, those laborers will miss you alot, and ward will proc even with those misses. I can remember as when I did DoN progression I was not particularly uber geared - I had no defensive mods and I just managed to buff to 1.9k AC. Things are sure different now :p&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"pull mob, cast pet hammer, reverse DS  (not in anquish gear so I can only heal myself thru one dk blue mob hitting me and not two)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;either nuke (or not depending on preference-I have tried both)  and melee with procing hammer&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So far this works good for me---except that due to very very low proc rate on ward (which is suppose to be our soloing tool) by the time mob gets to 10% life (I am down to about 40% mana)"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For one, if you want to solo mana efficiently - never nuke! That is the worst way to go, and the fastest drain. At the cost of larger bursts of damage, you are keeping plenty of heal / utility mana in return. I prefer meleeing and yaulping with a spam hammer, as that is some 'fun' dps (fun if you enjoy being a battle cleric) with the minuscule mana cost that is Yaulp. Now unless your gear is of the seriously low spectrum brum, If you are at 40% mana after 90% of one mob - it is your heal method that is wrong. Some may choose to disagree, but I highly favor the elixir method more than anything, self CH soloing is one of the most bleh methods anyone could think up. Against that content, (I imagine you have this spell) use Supernal elixir, and have a light that will heal ~40% of your hp with your current heal focus and quick heal as patches should you ever need. The elixir will keep you up for a long time, for the most part, and against 200 hitters, you shouldn't  ever really dip below 80% hp. If you go under 50% hp, then top up with a light / remedy (your choice, but I prefer lights when at lower health), but maintain that elixir - that is the best dps damnpening heal we have that favors RNG when hits are in the lower end of the Damage Interval spectrum. With practice, you should discover the knack to balance mana output with mana input, the only real drain being the rebuffing of ward. If you are still losing mana after that method, one which has earned me my best achievements in EQ and has worked for me ever since I began to solo at lvl 60+ (which without ward, took far far longer as Im sure many remember), then you need to look into Mana conservation foci / buff extend tribute and more FT.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;That's good advice!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I don't know if anyone can suggest better; if we want to improve it any more, we'll have to get a better breakdown of how the goblin soloing in Stillmoon is failing you, what gear you are using and what spells, etc.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I recently switched my root from the 3 minute to the 1 minute, and have found it works much better.&amp;nbsp; This is a good idea, and one I had overlooked for too long.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I cannot stress enough (nor agree enough) that nuking while soloing is, for the most part, a colossal waste of mana. I usually only nuke when I am in a group and not expecting to take any hits.&amp;nbsp; One cast of Ward of Retribution, when soloing, is going to far outdamage any single nuke I can throw.&amp;nbsp; My best nuke, right now, lands for 4024 against an undead mob.&amp;nbsp; That's a crit with full Destructive Fury AAs and an augment DD focus.&amp;nbsp; Against living critters, the crit range is usually in the 3300 range or so.&amp;nbsp; While I may be able to get two or three nukes off for the same cost of one Ward of Retribution, even at only 8 procs&amp;nbsp;a minute, I'm still looking at a minimum of ~4400 damage (550 damage x 8), and potentially much more than that if I get a couple of crit hits.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Nuking, when soloing, is plain and simple a bad idea.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Another big aid to soloing is going to be any investment in avoidance AAs.&amp;nbsp; I also cannot stress those enough.&amp;nbsp; When you consider that the ward can process on any swing (hit or miss) and you can boost your avoidance up considerably with AAs, it's pretty clear to me anyway how you can easily improve your solo capability.&amp;nbsp; You do not even need to have Anguish or Time gear for this -- just time to invest in those AAs.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Kilva's Skin of Flame potions are also an excellent kick for soloing; when you pair them with Mark of the Blameless and Mark of Retribution, you end up with a fantastic porcupine effect.&amp;nbsp; I'm by no means a rich cleric, but I can afford paying 400-500pp for a 10 dose Kilva's Skin of Flame.&amp;nbsp; If you visit a place like the Plane of Hate, or even if you go to Sebilis or Velketor's for one dose's duration of this potion, you are fairly likely to earn a good chunk of the cost back.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I've gone to Hate for a few hours and come back with nearly 2k of raw coin &amp;amp; gems and rewards from the armour turnin quests.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I think any cleric can solo.. it just takes time to gain the experience (knowing when you need to heal, what spells to use and when), and the knowledge to maximize your strengths (ward damage, quick healing) and minimize your weaknesses (lack of snare, lack of slow). Heck, I'd even say lack of slow is not a weakness at all any more. The LAST thing I want is a mob taking fewer swings at me.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Soloing doesn't have to be every cleric's cup of tea. However, I don't think it's fair to declare clerics to be woefully underpowered as soloers when, in my opinion, we have some rather unique strengths that make soloing a viable and entertaining option for me when I play this game.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

Whilst asking for more, appreciate what is already there and learn them to their full potential, and it will become apparent that while soloing is not for everyone, it is not as hard as people make it out to be. If more abilities get added without understanding of what is already there, there will only be a mastery of none. What we have is entertaining to me, and more fun things in the future that do not necessarily diminish challenges would be the right step in our reinvisionment, than further dumbing down of the game.</description>
