<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I heard that Devs are considering letting Drakkin TEMPORARILY use dyes on their armor.&nbsp; This would be temporary because they do plan to revamp the dye system game-wide so that specific things can not be dyed regardless of who wears it.&nbsp; Currently there is no functionality that prohibits the dying of certain items and it is desired to restrict this ability on some items.</DIV>
<DIV>
<P>It has not been decided yet if Drakkin with be given the ability to dye armor yet, even temporarily, and there is no guarantee that they will be given the ability.&nbsp; I just wanted to let you know i is being discussed and <STRONG><EM><U>MIGHT</U></EM></STRONG> be implemented even if it is something they can only do temporarily.</P>

<P><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" color=#ffff99 size=3>If you can show me any further instances where an actual Dev has responded and put into words exactly why we Drakkins can't use dye, please do me the favor of enlightening me.&nbsp; If you can't...&nbsp; Add yourself to the list of hall monitors who don't like the subject or disagree with me, but don't have anything to stand on either.</FONT></P>
