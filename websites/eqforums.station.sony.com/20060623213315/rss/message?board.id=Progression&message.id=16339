      <title>Server Name / Races</title>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Well, I agree entirely that a class world would be excellent. However, if you want to get newbies that are not already EQ players coming into the game, there are a few things that need to be done different this time around. First of all, I would suggest unlocking all of the races from the start. That way newbies won't come in, see an Iksar or Froglok model and decide they want to play that, then find out they can't. Then they'd either go to another server or just decide not to play since everyone would be too far advanced on other servers for them to ever catch up. Classes can wait to be unlocked, as that would be a major change to the original game, whereas player races would just be a minor one.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The other point I wanted to make, well, really to ask about... Will players be able to vote on the name of the progression server? (Of course the options should NOT be any name of a previous EQ server that was removed in the mergers.)&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>On the race issue, how would playing an Iksar without Kunark &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; be a major change to the game? First of all, theyre hated everywhere except Cabilis (excluding future expansion zones) and Cabilis, along with all the lore leading up to it, is completely nonexistant in the old world. Allowing them a place in the game before all of this has a chance to take place would drastically diverge from the whole concept of the race.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Dude, you really really need a read a few of the threads up before making your own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And I guess i'll have to play captain obvious and point out.. where do you expect the newer races to start when their home cities aren't even in the game yet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, if someone leaves because they can't be a different race, good.  Don't really want to play with someone that retarded.&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by cidienboulve on &lt;span class="date_text"&gt;05-22-2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;01:35 AM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;I guess I'll be captain obvious and point on that people thinking that way got EverQuest to the point that it is at today. Granted, some ideas might be silly in some people's posts, but you don't need to come across with a smart attitude when correcting other players. That mind set "if someone leaves... good" and then calling those people "retarded" is just plain ignorant altogether. If you haven't noticed (captain obvious here) EQ losing players caused our server counts to be cut in half, and general advertising for the game. For a long time there it was discouraging to even log in because PoK was empty. If anything, Sony needs to try and please as many people as possible, because we need our player base to grow again.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
