      <title>Couple questions new to test</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Test&amp;message.id=838#M838</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I'm currently debating starting on test.. ive been gone a while and am feeling the withdrawl symptoms again.. anywho on the the questions&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;1) Whats the population like lvl 30-60 i can two box so im not TOOO worried about it.. but social interaction is why i like the game to begin with&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;2)&amp;nbsp;Speaking of two boxing... If i come back i know im gonna have to two box till at least 60.. probably closer to 65 before i can even really try and get into a guild to group with people.. so the question remains what do you all need on the test server.. dont want to&amp;nbsp;spend a few months leveling only to&amp;nbsp;find out that the classes i leveled so that i can group arnt needed or wanted... &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;3)&amp;nbsp;hows the economy on the&amp;nbsp;test servers?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;4) any tips&amp;nbsp;related to test i should know having never played much on there&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>A few questions, from a Test Server newbie..</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Test&amp;message.id=827#M827</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Hi All,&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;So, long time EQ player, newbie on test server. I recently came back to play after quiting back when Plane of Fear raiding and Dragon killing were the uber passtimes. You old timers know what I am talking about...anyways after facing the realization that my gear is sorely out of date and that I don't know anyone anymore on my home server I decided to try Test.&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Wow..alot has changed. A REAL tutorial? If your old enough you remeber the original EQ tutorial? LOL...anyway I was impressed. Some things seemed to not work though, and that brings me to my first question:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=red&gt;Do I just use /bug to report problems on Test, is /bug even a command anymore?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The find command is a godsend. I read somewhere that we have access to all expansions, which brings me to my second question:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=red&gt;I used /testbuff but I cannot get my Adventure Stone so I can use the LDON Magus' is this a known issue? &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Again, I will /bug it if that is what needs to be done. I appreciate any responses. Btw, my name on Test is Lorkorle, I play an Iksar Necro.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Test&amp;message.id=825#M825</link>
      <description>Not sure if this has been posted , but search didnt come up with anything. Anyway Ive just reactivated my EQ Account and figured Id log onto Test to see if there are any improvements with DX9c . Anyway to make a boring story short - I was playing with character creation and noticed that eye colors were mismatched. One eye would be blue and the other green , or some combination.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;system is AMD 2600XP , ATI x700Pro , 1gig DDR&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Possible way to test content that players on test are currently unable to test</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Test&amp;message.id=816#M816</link>
      <description>I was scimming the PoK meeting message and had a possible idea on how to have test players be able to test the high end end game content.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It would work similar to /testbuff.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Basicially, just outside a zone that devs want tested would be an object similar to the PoK books.  When this object is clicked, the character would recieve a temporary buff or item transmutation to make the charcter equal to the normal high end player that would enter such a zone.  The buff/transmutation would only allow for play in the intended zone....the player couldn't click the object then go solo somewhere.....the new status would take effect as soon as the character zones in to then intended zone and last until player leaves the intended zone to be tested.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, since this would allow a character to experience an area they don't really have the ability to access, exp would be at a reduced rate....but would need to still accumulate to make it of interest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Item drops should probably also be at a reduced rate, but should still drop to help test players equip up&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-Rentia&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Was wondering if there was a FAQ around for making the test server a permanent home?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;(i.e. things that players should be aware of before making the decision to stay on test)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I've poked around the official site a bit and saw nothing.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I recently came back to EQ in a much more casual manner after roughly two years and plan to make the Test server my new home.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Thanks!&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>DirectX 9c bugs and comments</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Test&amp;message.id=793#M793</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;The first thing I learned after patching Test is that you really do have to go to Microsoft's DirectX site and download the updates. I had presumed that simply by keeping my computer up to date using Windows Update would be enough to keep DirectX up to date as well. It turned out that my computer needed all the updates to DirectX 9 since January 2005.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;On getting to the character select screen, I noticed that the shading of the character select environment was all wrong. I clicked explore and ran around. Objects would start out dark and then suddenly pop brighter as I got close to them. In the game itself, Plane of Knowledge looked positively gloomy. I suspect that the same lighting problems were occuring there too. I have not tried to debug this yet by adjusting my graphics settings. This could be caused by having dynamic lighting on or off.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;One positive note is that it seemed like the frame rate was a lot higher in PoK. I am not 100% certain of that and I did not see any other players moving around at the time so that could explain it. The game just felt smoother somehow. Perhaps the graphics engine is more efficient now with DX9c.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Anyway, keep up the good work, devs!&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Major Bugs=Completely shrugged off</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Test&amp;message.id=789#M789</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;You guys should honestly rename the Test Server. Why do I suggest this some may ponder?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;http://img68.imageshack.us/img68/4137/wtfsoe0jm.jpg&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Prime example of what I was referring to in this post:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Test&amp;amp;message.id=780&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let me pan out the entire story for everyone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First of all the day is May 15th, 2006 The day they implemented DX9.0c.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We get ready to start raiding we zone into Arcstone buff up, all is well. We engage Colossus, fights going well 90%, 80%, 70%, 60%.... boom 8-9% Zone Crashes as Colossus begins to explode. We /list general to see if we see any GMs are on, we get ahold of Dann who was kind enough to summon bugged corpses that were in the world and not ressable/draggable. We then kindly ask him to watch the fight again to see if Arcstone will crash again. That picture was the response we get.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We petitioned and /telled every single GM we could to witness this major bug if it were to happen again, but hey guess what?!! Yup, none were on their shifts were over. We sent tells to a GM that was currently working on the Beta Server (Nice to know they get attention) in regards to spending 5 minutes out of his time to watch us Engage Colossus for a second round. His response was for us to petition if it were to happen again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After praying for a response we finally lost hope. After fully rebuffing we decided to give Colossus One more shot, fights going well, 90%, 80%..... BOOM 8-9% Zone Crashes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'd like to point out that you just implemented one of the biggest patchs to EQ Test Server in a really long time and you guys arent even concerned about the aftermath of the patch. Once again id like to point out that you could spend a little extra money in hiring an employee or three to work evening shifts on the Test Server instead of having every single one of them log off around supper time because you refuse to pay them overtime. I'm not quite sure what you guys are trying to do to your playerbase but it sure as heck isn't increasing it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Ideal Obvious solutions to inrease Test Server Population</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Test&amp;message.id=780#M780</link>
      <description>Some may take this as a rant, but take it how you will. I'm also expecting this to be ignored since all my other petitions/reports to GMs about blatantly obvious issues ingame are.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I hear you guys are in dire need of increasing the player base. Well sit back and let me point out some obvious solutions to the unbelieveably horrid population that is on the test server in comparison to the Live.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First of all Its a double Edged sword im tired of the Devs ignoring every fricken thing we say. Not to mention Theres an AE Rampage/Flurry Bug out there on raid mobs such as M`Shas(Qvic) thats been around for a bit. Has been /bugged by at least 50 people in my guild and completely and utterly ignored thus far, not even a single remote response has been recorded. If your gonna ignore us at least pretend you care and acknowledge our exsistance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Give us some Devs/GMs that don't log off around supper time. When a zone such as PoK or the Guild Lobby goes down, it honestly screws up the entire playerbase, nobody can do a **FROGLOK** thing about it except wait an entire day for them to repop zones. I'll admit i've only been here(On the test server) for around a month and a half but if the service has always been this shotty its probably one of the main concerns as to why the heck nobody wants to play here. Another prime example is the fact that over easter all the devs were on holidays for at least two days and 1/2 of the zones were down because of the MGB bug. Are you honestly trying to provoke more people to play here? If you're trying to dangle a carrot in front of us, you forgot the carrot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, if your gonna change something at least take the 5 minutes to at least post it on the forum as to what the hell you did, I'm tired of the random surprises. Not to mention the random guessing on what you guys altered.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why the hell do you guys have a test forum if you guys ignore every fricken post we make asking questions such as Why the hell are fabled still up? Is that honestly too hard to answer?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A simple, &amp;quot;Oh, we forgot&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Its part of the test server now.&amp;quot; would suffice&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don't know about the rest of the server but a few others and I in the guild are nearing the point of calling this server quits because of this insane lack of professionality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is my last attempt im going to make for any feedback at all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Fabled, Why are they still here?</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Test&amp;message.id=766#M766</link>
      <description>Alright fables own, but why are they still here? One of my main concern is the ideal fact that people can't easily finish their epic 1.0.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
