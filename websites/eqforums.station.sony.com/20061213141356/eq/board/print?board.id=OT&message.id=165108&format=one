				The Lost Room is a 3 episode Miniseries on Sci Fi (and Space in Canada, surprisingly they are showing them concurrently). And it's been very intriguing so far. I'm glad they're keeping the 3 eps back to back to back. Been watching it the past two nights and loving it; a very intriguing situation, and the objects and their abilities are just very puzzling.<br><br>Plus I like the fact that it seems more intelligent than standard TV tends to be. There have been relatively few "WTH did you do THAT?!?" moments; and the Main Character seems smart but not super smart and has a lot of ingenuity. (He came up with a very workable and plausible solution to get the item out of the safe before I even thought about it, and his solution didn't come out of no where, it had been properly foreshadowed.)<br><br>I do hope they keep it as just a 3 ep miniseries and don't try to spin it out into a full series. Though it has the potential to keep going, I'm not sure it has the legs to go a full season. The pace it's going at now has been quick but felt appropriate.<br><br>(The polaroid window to the past was a neat item too for that matter, and I'm wondering what the fish's power is. <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0> )<br><br>Now the big question tonite will be who the key item is. In my IRC chat channel someone suspected that the key is someone we've seen before, which seems plausible. Not sure who it would be though.
