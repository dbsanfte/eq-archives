<DIV><BR>Yes, I've got all the flags.&nbsp; I've got the (completed) "Rithnok's Soulstone", the container version of "Drema's Soulstone", and the "A Soulstone Shard" from the Coterie Corruptor in Tenebrous Mountains.&nbsp; All of these items are on me (i.e. in my inventory, not in the bank).&nbsp; The Coterie shard is even stored inside the Drema's Soulstone container and nothing else is in that container, if that matters.&nbsp; I've also done all the quest "conversations" up to this point, including talking with Irak Altil initially in Halls of Honor.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I got the "zone emote" the first time I zoned into PoN with all this stuff, so at least part of the quest script is recognizing that I'm ready for that part:</DIV>
