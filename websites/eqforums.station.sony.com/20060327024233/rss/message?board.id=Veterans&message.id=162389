&lt;P&gt;Around Planes of Power and Lost Dungeons of Norrath, you could see it in hard numbers.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Which expansion launched almost 75000 new EQ accounts?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;If you answered Planes of Power, you'd be wrong. Lost Dungeons of Norrath signed up more new players by an order of magnitude than Planes of Power (a lot of those 'new' players were cancelled players who started playing again. I was in a guild at the time that had close to 20 people come back to EQ because of LDON. They quit because of Planes of Power).&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Lost Dungeons of Norrath didn't cater to the people who usually are asking for more content, it catered to what most people PLAY.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

Greater enhancement of gear and playing without dealing with 30-60 other people bogging you down and irritating you worked wonders. Now you have people crying for classic servers and less instancing. Weird. I bet most of the Devs pretend they're Willy Wonka on their off time, isolating themselves from all human contact. Cause people are weird, unexpected and weird.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;I have posted my views on leveling before, and am in favor of doing something to slow down the race to level 70 that every new player seems to get into. I have even seen posts from Dev's where they refer to getting to level 70 so you can &amp;quot;start the game&amp;quot;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Seems to me, that Sony would not want that, as it allows someone to get to the end game so fast that after 9 months, you have no reason to stick to the game.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;One of the big reasons people run for level 70, is that AA's come so much faster at level 70. 2 AA's an hour is doable. So, why stop at 51 to get AA's? Why stop at 60? or 65?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I think that AA experience should be leveled for all levels................&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In other words, make AA's come just as fast for a level 51 as they do for Level 70.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This will be an incentive to players to stop at level 51, and 55, and 60 etc, to get some AA's to make them more powerful, and to experience some of the abilitys that were TUNED for those levels. Those AA's were DESIGNED for characters of that level to use, but the slow AA progression encourages players to skip AA's till they get much higher in level. This change will encourage players to experience the content that is available to those levels and get something tangeable in return.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Kunnar on &lt;span class="date_text"&gt;01-13-2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;03:58 PM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;There is only a race if you chose to run.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The only people that make the "race" to 70 are the people that are running.&amp;nbsp; It is not designed into the game, except yeah, there are some pretty long stretches of pretty boring levels.&amp;nbsp; You don't need to.&amp;nbsp; You don't have to.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Games are supposed to be about having fun.&amp;nbsp; I have fun or I don't log in, and I haven't hit 70 yet with any of my characters in 5+ years of playing and 3 accounts.&amp;nbsp; I don't care for raiding so I don't do it.&amp;nbsp; I don't care for grouping with people who are after the most efficient killing experience, so I don't.&amp;nbsp; I could be getting the best experience in all the game, but if I am in a group where no one talks, I am going to leave.&amp;nbsp; I refuse to join any group that inspects me or asks me numbers (like mana or ac or whatever)&amp;nbsp;before joining.&amp;nbsp; I like being in groups of people who are yes, good at their class, but who are also good at having fun.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;No one makes me race to 70.&amp;nbsp; No one makes me stay at 62 or whatever level I may be that day.&amp;nbsp; I have goals that require leveling, I have goals that don't.&amp;nbsp; I didn't succumb to peer pressure when I was 15, I don't succumb to it when I am 45.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

Groups are scarce, and because of that the xp is so slow that I am thinking of leaving. That is not because I want to but because it is taking forever to &amp;quot;get to the game&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If anything they need to speed up the exp grind to 65 by twofold, then let those who chose to, delay as they see fit rather then shackle the rest of us for months while we try to get to the game.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lower level content is what attracts new players. That is the first thing they see upon entering the game. If there were better zones to attract old players there with their alts as well as new players with their mains, the zones would be populated and provide grouping possiblities for new players. That would, in turn, encourage those new players to recommend the game to their friends, thus bringing even more players in. It would give new players a real opportunity to learn their class and have fun leveling progressively instead of hurrying through MM leveling to 'reach the game'. Why in the world should the game begin at 65 or 70?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That mindset is what has caused the decline of new players to the game and the ridiculous idea that one should need to level up quickly to have any fun. Why can't lower levels be fun too? Why can't there be gear upgrades and spell drops from mobs in lower level zones? Why shouldn't the game be fun regardless of your level? Us veteran players will still be here as long as high level content is continually added but new players will continue to disappear if they are not given some attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There should be zones like WoS for low levels. For goodness sakes, even the tutorial has a named mob that looks like Velitorkin. There should be gear quests and spell drops ( I don't care if you can buy the spells from vendors, new players don't have much money). I can say with relative surety that if there was at least one static zone for progressive levels with nameds to kill, spell drops, gear drops, quest drops and decent experience those zones would be populated all the time and make finding a group easier for new players. Bringing in new players and providing them places to advance their characters, learn their class, develop their skills and have fun doing it is going to be vital for the future of EQ. Since the current static zones do not have anything to attract new players to them or even older players with their alts, they will remain wastelands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It doesn't bother me at all that people today can reach max level much faster than I did back in the old days.  I fondly remember going on level 52 Vox/Naggy raids for my epic books, but that's a roadblock that isn't practical in today's EQ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People reaching max level faster means more people available for grouping/raiding/etc at the highest level of the game. EQ needs to attract and retain new players, and faster leveling helps do that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Leveling Rate is fine.  Once I hit 60 I went strictly AA until I maxed out the abilities I could do at 60.  Then I pushed to 65 and repeated and now I have pushed to 70 and I'm working on AA's again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the original poster - I worked hard to achieve 70 for the various rewards that it entailed (better spells, better AA leveling, more zone access, better Damage on High level mobs, better access to upgrades, better).    I don't see any reason why I should have to give back some of my hard earned perks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;It is SoE's fault.  To get to the best loot in the game, you must raid.  To be in a raiding guild, you must be 70 &amp;quot;at least&amp;quot;.  That's why game start there for many.  SoE made the game progression very unfriendly to none-hardcore raiding guilds.  Not only raiding contents, many of the quests are almost imporssible for none-raiding people to do without reaching higher tier zones.  If the treasure is there, that's direction people will follow.  I've asked many times before, all raiding flagging content should be able to be instanced.  If content must be completed between players, people will have to rush.  If you have to rush, you will have to be 70.  What can you do?  Believe or not, many of the guilds are still working on PoP contents even though they have the size/power.  They just couldn't do it because mobs were not available enough, and when you do once or twice, people leave, and joined a guild that raid more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Having said that, I do think SoE has changed the direction with the current releases.  After the reitemizations, I am very happy with DoD.  This expansion has a lot of challenge for us, none-raiding people.  There are many missions that I will fail here and there with my groups, and my paladin has 1k aa, 13k, 2300ac buffed without many DoD group mission items yet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But many of my guildmates are having hard time doing most hard missions because we are not raiding guild, and have not killed any EP GoDs.  I have done mm only for the spell missions,  and heard some exp are good.  I hope SoE doesn't nerf those mm exp further because there are many high level people that really need a push....&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love reading posts like these :) It affirms my beliefs that people speak without researching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SoE is a business. They pay people to design content for us to play on and have fun.&lt;br&gt;How do they find out what we like to do?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The designers play the game and group with people and listen.&lt;br&gt;Listen to feedback posted on boards such as this.&lt;br&gt;Field thousands of complaints about certain aspects of the game&lt;br&gt;Field thousands of suggestions made in game /feedback&lt;br&gt;Ask&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most common quote on this board &amp;quot;It's SoE's fault&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;No, it's your fault.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the game itself crashes your computer, there is a possibility of it being SoE's fault.&lt;br&gt;If they change the game to meet the needs and demands and feedback posted by players of their game, it's definitely their fault that I like this game and continue to play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If this isn't the perfect game for you, leave. I have people on my ignore list that think that leveling and AAs are stupid. People think that they shouldn't have to work for good gear, raids should be removed from the game and a level 5 should be the same as level 70.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course you have to raid to get good stuff! Of course level 70 with 400 AAs is different from a level 70 with 0 AAs. I agree monster missions are a little silly and people that go from 50-70 in them are easy to spot because they don't know how to play their class, but that's to be expected. People like doing things the quick way. Examples of those people are prominently displayed in jail cells in your local cities and in the hospital after their car wreck. Mind you those are extreme examples, but it gets the point across. I personally don't like doing MMs because I chose my class and played my class for 70+ levels. I have done 3 MMs and found that they were kind of cool, but I wanted to get back to game play. Those who are subjugating themselves to the litany of MMs to the point that the level 70 pool has been diluted with what I refer to as &amp;quot;fake&amp;quot; 70's.  Those who don't know how the play their class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And in case you're wondering, I started playing this game when LDoN came out and have loved it since level 1. I gave away the rarest of things in Ultima out to total strangers after playing this game for a week.  If I find something that I like better than EQ, I'll shut off my accounts and give away my stuff that I can and stop playing! I'm not going to come on these boards and whine and complain that it's SoE's fault or it's soandso's fault that I don't like the game. If I don't like it, it means I don't like it. Do you like Anchovies? I don't, so I don't eat them. But I don't call up the maker of the Anchovies and whine and complain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes the game is flooded with high level characters, but you know what? That's not going to change! Leveling now is faster than when I started, and so be it. It took me a year and a half to get to 70 on my cleric but I took a few pit stops... I have done long drawn out quests and enjoyed the game as I leveled! (Weird, eh?)  Mind you my ranger hit 70 in 9 months, but I took the necessary pit-stops to get AAs crucial to my class. Ever have a 70 cleric hit you with 150 min Conviction? Does it upset you? It does me, but I don't say anything because I'm still happy that I have the buff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So 3 cheers to the Devs, Designers, Testers, Coders, Conceptual Artists, and GMs. Keep delivering us a great product and keep up the good work! And to those of you who want to complain about them, think about what they go through every day when they go to work. If you want a good example of what they go through, make a city in SimCity and make everyone in the entire city happy. It's not possible!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if you think the game is great the way it is, Let them know! They will be more than happy to hear that! Unfortunately, the way society is today, people only ask to see the manager if they're angry. People only post comments that are negative. Happy people are quiet because they are using the product. This is true in any industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Levelling these days is more about AA's (and gear) than levels.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm a firm proponent of making 50-70 easier (reducing the amount of XP needed to get the next level), so people can join the content of the last few expansions with the masses. Before 50 is still kinda lonely though, but at least you get to learn your class.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The majority of old world content has been woefully neglected, drops are pathetic, graphics are poor, spawn times for rare/quest mobs are simply disgusting imho, and quests are on the whole a travesty. The focus of development has been 65+ for 3 expansions now, and the lower levels are left to rot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Getting to 70 is an intimidating chore these days, especially when combined with the mountain of AAs to catch up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We dont need both...&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&amp;quot;Well if the loot wasn't better for a 72-man raid than a 6-man group there would be no raiders, and hence much less money in subscriptions&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What makes you think that SoE get most of their money from high-end raiding guilds?

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Have you even played the last three expansions? The programmers have put tons of single group content into the game. What is it you want exactly? raids completely eliminated? The only two expansions that have been aimed more at the raider than the groups is POP and GOD, and even they have quite a lot of group content. THe recent DOD upgrades has left the groupers with nothing to complain about really. There is VERY nice achievable rewards for those missions. And if raiders are as you believe such a pathetic minority, then you should have no problem making groups to go there.&lt;/div&gt;</description>
