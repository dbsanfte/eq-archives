<P>I think that Hate 2.0 is a lot more group oriented than raid.&nbsp; Characters that can fight there for xp can do so very successfully in groups.&nbsp; A counter example would be Anguish or most of the GoD raid zones where a single group attempting to earn xp there would find it extremely difficult unless they were overgeared for the zone.&nbsp; In Hate's original incarnation it was near impossible without a full raid, much like Fear.&nbsp; However, the newer version (which I like much much better....bravo for that revamp) is group oriented with only a few raid targets.&nbsp; In that regard, how is the revamped Hate different from WoS, MPG, Arcstone, Rellic or Sunderock?&nbsp; They all have raid targets but are mostly used by groups hunting for xp, quests&nbsp;and drops.</P>
<P>Considering the loot drops, named PH camps (completely unsuited to a theoretical raid plow) and the mob difficulty against a group of characters at the appropriate level, I think that Hate mobs should have the 30 second cool down timer&nbsp;except for&nbsp;the few raid targets.</P>
