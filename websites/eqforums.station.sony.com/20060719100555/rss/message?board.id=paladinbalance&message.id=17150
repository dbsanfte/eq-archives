&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff00ff&gt;Paladin - List Update scheduled for&amp;nbsp;05/06/05&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1. Better Mitigation &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;This is being considered as part #1 of the class Re-Envision process.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;There is a too large a disparity between warriors and paladins when it comes to tanking. A warrior in gear inferior to a paladin can and does tank better then the paladin even outside of discipline. While this issue only truly shows itself in high end group content the concern is that this trend will quickly leave paladins in the same straits that warriors were in when they did not have sufficient agro to make them desirable for group content. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;With more and more mobs either higher in level or flagged stun immune we take the full brunt of the damage the mob can dish out. We have no way of mitigating or avoiding any of this damage other then the same AA’s that every single class in the game gets. This issue is for all levels but becomes more of an issue the higher you progress. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The tanking between a paladin vs all other classes is not great enough. Mitigation should be based on Armor and Defense. A monk or ranger (for example, not picking on them) should NOT be as effective as a Warrior or Knight of similar AC/HP.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2. Better Healing &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Many changes to Paladin healing went live with the April 20th update.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: Roman?? New ?Times 12pt; red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;The recast timer on the level 65 and higher spells needs to be looked at. They do not allow for a situation where fast cast heals are needed. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;To get around the recast timer, a lot of paladins are loading 2 or more heals which further reduces our role as a utility player by reducing the number of spell gems available to us. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Our healing role tends to be as emergency patch healer.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Our longer-casting, slightly higher heals are simply too slow to cast to be useful – the “light” line is all very well, but the “touch” line is unused by many; could it be upgraded either significantly in terms of amount healed, or the cast time significantly reduced, in return for a higher mana cost?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Our heal-over-time spells can be very useful but the base heal value per tick is too low and if they get overwritten are a waste of mana. The grey out, being able to cast another spell right away, as well as the recast timer is restrictive. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;During battle paladins, even when tanking, are required to heal their group-mates as well as ourselves. To do this we need to target fast, cast the heal without interruption or fizzle and get back to the correct mob, quickly. During these times we fizzle and are interrupted too often, and the new AA to continue casting through stuns seems to not be working properly. What this comes down to is we need healing looked at for when we are also tanking. &lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;3. Stuns &lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: Roman?? New ?Times 12pt; red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff00ff&gt;&lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: Roman?? New ?Times 12pt; red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The most important issue with stuns is the non-scaling of stun aggro with level of spell.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;This means that Paladin aggro generation is effectively no greater than it was 30 levels earlier, while all other classes have been steadily increasing their aggro generation.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;This means that, little by little, it becomes harder for a Paladin to hold aggro against casters, and also that the other tank classes gradually eat away at our supposed aggro advantage.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;SKs have received significant upgrades, including Dread Gaze, which now means that Paladins are the only tank class without a specific AE aggro capacity.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Long cast time as well as the recast timer needs to be looked at. Because we are casting during battle, we need very fast casting spells or we are interrupted too often, and the long recast means that we have to mem 3 or 4 stuns to overcome agro and recast issues. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Ancient: Force of Chaos, needs to have its level limit looked at because of the level limit problems with trash mobs in group content as well as access to it. &lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;4. Epic issues &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;New&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;There are several issues regarding the Epics that we feel are very important to address.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Currently, any Knights at the medium and high end would be well advised to leave their Epics firmly in their bags unless they’re going to a fashion parade.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Knights (other than Berserkers, who cannot wield one-handed weapons) are the only classes that have two handed Epics.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;All Epic 1.5s were based on the class PoTime weapons – with the exception of Knights, whose PoTime class weapons are one handers.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Just as all Knights at the medium and high end are moving towards one handed weapons, so our Epics push us in the opposite direction.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The problems with two handers are obvious; they are inferior for tanking, and Epic 1.5 and 2.0 can both be easily outperformed by a one-hander setup from equivalent or even lower level content.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;The only benefit to using a two hander is DPS – and no Knight is ever going to be given a role as a DPS machine.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;We are tanks; let us tank with our Epics.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Two handers also lose a huge amount of stats compared to one handers.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;If they MUST be two handers, please can we not up the stats to at least be close to what we’d get from a one-handed setup?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The click effect is pitifully weak.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;A time-limited stun proc that you’d be lucky to even see proc during the click period, and a small boost to heals received.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;The stun proc needs to be unlinked and made innate and permanent to have any use at all, while the heal increase, while sounding nice on the face of it, gives no real benefit to the wielder.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The focus effects are replaceable with regular gear, removing the last possible reason to equip the Epic.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;5. Current Disciplines &lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: Roman?? New ?Times 12pt; red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: Roman?? New ?Times 12pt; red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The current set of Paladin disciplines is just about as close to useless as is imaginable.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Almost no Paladin ever uses anything other than Holyforge, and even that is seen as being largely useless these days.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Resistant&lt;/STRONG&gt;: This discipline lasts for 5 minutes, and has a base reuse time of 1 hour and raises all resists by 20.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The time on this discipline seems correct, it gives plenty of time to pop it at the beginning of a fight and either get full use out of it or more likely get the mob dead before it drops. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The amount of resist when compared to the mobs today is far, far too small.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;When first introduced it may have been of some use, when a “good” resist item may have had 15-20 total resists on it, and +20 to each resist was definitely useful.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;These days a “good” resist item can often have over 100 total resists, while adding +20 to any resist has minimal effect against the new Chromatic and Prismatic AEs with huge negative resist checks - yet this discipline does not have a corresponding upgrade.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Fearless&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Immunity to "Fear" and all spells that cause "fear". This discipline lasts for 1 minute, and has a base reuse time of 1 hour. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The biggest issue here is that after you purchase Fear Resistance for 12 AA's and Fearless for another 6 AA's this discipline is useless.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Sanctification&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Immunity to most types of harmful spells. This discipline lasts for 18 seconds, and has a base reuse time of 72 minutes.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;It does not last long enough. The only possible way it can be used is on a pull, otherwise we would never know when to use it. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;It does not block all harmful spells, and the ones we need it most on are irresistable, and sanctification does not block irresistable spells.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Holyforge&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Critical Hits and Crippling Blows versus undead with an increased probability of going off.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The concerns regarding the use of Holyforge are very well known.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Controlled tests by the community correspondent have been arranged, and will be performed as soon as the Test server is a bit more stable.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;No other disc in the game is retricted to such a small amount of game content. As per the class description, Paladins should be the masters of undead, such as Rangers are the masters of Archery. With 85 AA's spent, Holy Forge should provide DPS against undead somewhat approaching that of a true DPS class, as well as increased DPS versus live mobs without the ability to slay&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;6. Power versus the undead &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: Roman?? New ?Times 12pt; red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed, t&lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: Roman?? New ?Times 12pt; red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;his will most likely be evaluated as part of the class Re-Envision process.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;This issue revolves solely around the issue of our class description where it states that paladins are the greatest force against the undead. It is generally agreed that this power is in the form of DPS rather then tanking, though both are thought to have a strong role playing basis. Therefore this definition will deal mostly with our ability to damage an undead mob. Issue&amp;nbsp;8 is in regards to lack of undead so I will not go into that here except to say that the lack of undead does effect our power versus them since if their are no undead we have no power and if everything was undead we would be way overpowered.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The biggest reason we lack power versus undead is felt to be the RNG. As a slayer of undead we are too reliant on&amp;nbsp;this random factor. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;We should have DPS greater then a warrior outside of Holyforge and with Slay Undead 3. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Inside of Holyforge this power should be increased to the point that we approach genuine DPS class performance (during this discipline only).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;When in areas with mixed mobs, live and undead, it is not efficient to use our undead proc, instead we must use a lesser proc that works on all mobs. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;We have weaker direct damage spells versus undead than any other relevant class.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;7. Buffs/spells &lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: Roman?? New ?Times 12pt; red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;This will most likely be evaluated as part of the class Re-Envision process.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Much is made by some of the fact that Paladins can allegedly “buff better than any other single class”.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;This is highly misleading, however, and in practice the ONLY Paladin buff anyone ever asks for is the Brells line.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;We’ve recently got upgrades in the Direction line, for example, but many if not most Paladins will never even bother to mem this.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Can we find some ideas for unique buffing abilities for Paladins; maybe a resist line against poison or disease would be appropriate, or some form of “resist curse” buff (that would be unique, and situationally useful when preparing fpr many encounters).&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Also, a stronger (and even group) version of the Crusader’s Purity line would appear reasonable.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;This would fit in well with Paladin roles in general; our current cures are too weak and slow-casting to be of much benefit.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;8. Lack of undead &lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: Roman?? New ?Times 12pt; red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: Roman?? New ?Times 12pt; red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Planes of power saw a dearth of undead in the expansion. Discord has almost NO undead whatsoever that I have seen from start through Ikkinz and I expect more of the same from Omens. Why give us a power focus and then give us NOTHING to utilize it on? An advantage is NOT an advantage if it is functionally useless.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;9. Lull &lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: Roman?? New ?Times 12pt; red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: Roman??

New ?Times 12pt; red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;This will most likely be evaluated as part of the class Re-Envision process.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Disappears totally at level 55.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;10. Lay on Hands -&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;PLEASE make it impossible to blow Lay Hands on a corpse or a mob!!!! - &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;This is a known issue however I do not have any information currently on it's status.&amp;nbsp; Development thought the issue has been fixed however it's been confirmed that it still isn't working properly.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;And while you're at it, make it possible to see&amp;nbsp;how long before it's available like with an aability. &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;This is being considered&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

It is the ONLY means of crowd control a paladin brings to a group or raid and it is again disobviate on a great many 'trash; type mobs with no real good reason I can see. Another case of the class losing core functionality with no balancing factor.&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(&lt;SPAN **Zowie**?COLOR: Verdana?

Otherwise the tools are a waste of time and effort. Planes of power saw a dearth of undead in the expansion. Discord has almost NO undead whatsoever that I have seen from start through Ikkinz and I expect more of the same from Omens. Why give us a power focus and then give us NOTHING to utilize it on?

I'm not being a class rep here, these are toned down and shorter explanations of what the community thinks.

FONT-FAMILY: 9pt; **Zowie**?FONT-SIZE:&gt;A few other notes about Holyforge. It is the only discipline that requires you to get specific AA's to increase your chance of even getting a crit, cripple or slay. Paldins do not get crits till they buy an AA for critting. And Holyforge only gives you a three times chance of getting a crit, cripple or slay, and the&amp;nbsp;Fury of the Ages AA does not get factored into the equasion. So, while it does increase your chance for a crit or cripple it does not increase your chance while Holyforge is running. Why do we have a discipline that is linked to our AA's? This is all very frustrating.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1. Disappearing spell lines - &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Please consider providing upgrades to spell lines that we get early on in our careers, but which disappear before the endgame.&amp;nbsp; Examples would be the Lull, Fear Undead and Yaulp lines.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2. Disciplines (Holy Forge) - &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;No Paladin on any of the Forums believes that Holy Forge is currently working as intended.&amp;nbsp; Extensive anecdotal evidence, along with long parses by a member of the community, indicate that the level of DPS inrease is far below what would be expected, and indeed far below the boost (in proportionate terms) when Holy Forge was first introduced.&amp;nbsp; Please can the developers investigate Holy Forge and indicate whether the small DPS increases provided are really “working as intended”.&amp;nbsp; Please read this point in conjunction with point&amp;nbsp;10 below (Undead).&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;3. Disciplines (other than Holy Forge) - &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;The original Paladin disciplines are effectively of no use.&amp;nbsp; Fearless is superseded by the AA of the same name, and even for players without that AA the number of fearing mobs in the game has been drastically reduced.&amp;nbsp; Sanctification is of far too short a duration to be of any use, and does not block all incoming spells anyway.&amp;nbsp; Resistant was of some use when introduced, but the extension of resist ranges renders it irrelevant now.&amp;nbsp; Is there any reason we couldn't have updated versions of each of these disciplines introduced, at levels of power more in line with higher level players of today.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;4. Heal-over-time recast timer - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being evaluated&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The recast time on Paladin HoTs is 30 seconds, which is longer than the duration of the HoT.&amp;nbsp; This basically means that the HoT is reduced to being a self-only spell in most situations.&amp;nbsp; Other classes with HoTs do not suffer from this limitation, and are able to use their HoTs in a meaningful way to spot heal other characters.&amp;nbsp; In addition, the Paladin HoT spells also grey out the entire spell bar for far longer than other spells; again, something which does not affect Cleric or Shaman HoT spells.&amp;nbsp; Please consider lowering the recast time and the spell bar recovery time to give these spells a new lease of life – currently many Paladins completely ignore this entire spell line.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;5. Lay on Hands - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being evaluated&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Lay on Hands frequently "fires" only for the target to be dead before it lands due to latency, lag or whatever.&amp;nbsp; Is it possible please to introduce a post-cast check, whereby if LoH did not land for whatever reason, the ability is un-greyed-out and ready for reuse.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;6. Paladin Epic 1.0 - Dragon books - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being evaluated&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Many Paladins are extremely frustrated that the Dragon books for Epic 1.0 are effectively impossible to obtain on many servers, as the Kunark Dragons have a long respawn time and are usually killed by solo farmers within minutes of spawning.&amp;nbsp; The books are also a rare-ish drop, meaning that even when a Dragon can be found up it’s unlikely that the drop will be obtained.&amp;nbsp; We realise and acknowledge that Epics, even Epic 1.0s, should be a challenge; however the challenge is not the reasonable one of assembling a raid to kill a mob, it’s the unreasonable and unforeseen one of having to fight against solo players who can keep the Dragons permanently dead in order to farm twink haste items without even breaking a sweat.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Please consider implementing triggered versions of two of the Kunark Dragons (one for the Frost book, one for the Burnt book), maybe in much the same way as Ragefire was implemented for Clerics some years ago, in order to give Paladins today a realistic chance of obtaining the books.&amp;nbsp; With the books being no drop, Paladins are arguably in the worst situation of any class at the moment in terms of the ability to obtain their Epic 1.0, and a fix would be much appreciated.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;7. Stun mitigation - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being evaluated&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;One of the factors that has been quoted in the past as reasons why some of our other requests have not been granted is that we have such a large benefit over the other tank classes in terms of stun mitigation of incoming damage.&amp;nbsp; At the high end, where many of our other issues are most acute (such as aggro generation), stun mitigation is meaningless, as no mob we're ever likely to fight is of a level where we can stun it.&amp;nbsp; Given the lack of mitigation at the high end, there should be less of a reason for SoE to use such mitigation as a reason not to improve other areas of our gameplay.&amp;nbsp; If SoE on the other hand believe that we should be able to stun-mitigate, then please give players at the higher end the means to do so against appropriate content.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;8. Two handed weapons (including Epics) - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being evaluated&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Two handed weapons are too far behind equivalent level one handers and shields in terms of stats.&amp;nbsp; Everyone agrees that there should be a stat penalty to going two-handed, due to the DPS improvement, but the difference is currently too great.&amp;nbsp; Remember that not only do we lose out in terms of the regular stats being lower on a two hander than on a one hander plus shield, we also lose the potential of a second set of focus effects and a second augment (a very big deal given the quality of augments available these days).&amp;nbsp; There was some suggestion at the Summit of giving two handers a second augment slot, for example, to narrow the gap somewhat - can this be implemented?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1. Aggro&amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;Issue suspended pending implementation of announced stun changes&amp;gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;We'll remove or alter this item for the next update, once the changes that are due with the next patch have gone in.&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2.

Disciplines (Holy Forge) - &lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: Roman?? New ?Times 12pt; red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: Roman??

Disciplines (other than Holy Forge) - &lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: Roman?? New ?Times 12pt; red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: Roman?? New ?Times 12pt; red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;The original Paladin disciplines are effectively of no use.&amp;nbsp; Fearless is superseded by the AA of the same name, and even for players without that AA the number of fearing mobs in the game has been drastically reduced.&amp;nbsp; Sanctification is of far too short a duration to be of any use, and does not block all incoming spells anyway.&amp;nbsp; Resistant was of some use when introduced, but the extension of resist ranges renders it irrelevant now.&amp;nbsp; Is there any reason we couldn't have updated versions of each of these disciplines introduced, at levels of power more in line with higher level players of today.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;5. Heal-over-time recast timer - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being evaluated&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The recast time on Paladin HoTs is 30 seconds, which is longer than the duration of the HoT.&amp;nbsp; This basically means that the HoT is reduced to being a self-only spell in most situations.&amp;nbsp; Other classes with HoTs do not suffer from this limitation, and are able to use their HoTs in a meaningful way to spot heal other characters.&amp;nbsp; In addition, the Paladin HoT spells also grey out the entire spell bar for far longer than other spells; again, something which does not affect Cleric or Shaman HoT spells.&amp;nbsp; Please consider lowering the recast time and the spell bar recovery time to give these spells a new lease of life – currently many Paladins completely ignore this entire spell line.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;6. Lay on Hands - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being evaluated&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Lay on Hands frequently "fires" only for the target to be dead before it lands due to latency, lag or whatever.&amp;nbsp; Is it possible please to introduce a post-cast check, whereby if LoH did not land for whatever reason, the ability is un-greyed-out and ready for reuse.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;7. Paladin Epic 1.0 - Dragon books - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being evaluated&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Many Paladins are extremely frustrated that the Dragon books for Epic 1.0 are effectively impossible to obtain on many servers, as the Kunark Dragons have a long respawn time and are usually killed by solo farmers within minutes of spawning.&amp;nbsp; The books are also a rare-ish drop, meaning that even when a Dragon can be found up it’s unlikely that the drop will be obtained.&amp;nbsp; We realise and acknowledge that Epics, even Epic 1.0s, should be a challenge; however the challenge is not the reasonable one of assembling a raid to kill a mob, it’s the unreasonable and unforeseen one of having to fight against solo players who can keep the Dragons permanently dead in order to farm twink haste items without even breaking a sweat.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Please consider implementing triggered versions of two of the Kunark Dragons (one for the Frost book, one for the Burnt book), maybe in much the same way as Ragefire was implemented for Clerics some years ago, in order to give Paladins today a realistic chance of obtaining the books.&amp;nbsp; With the books being no drop, Paladins are arguably in the worst situation of any class at the moment in terms of the ability to obtain their Epic 1.0, and a fix would be much appreciated.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;8. Stun mitigation - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being evaluated&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;One of the factors that has been quoted in the past as reasons why some of our other requests have not been granted is that we have such a large benefit over the other tank classes in terms of stun mitigation of incoming damage.&amp;nbsp; At the high end, where many of our other issues are most acute (such as aggro generation), stun mitigation is meaningless, as no mob we're ever likely to fight is of a level where we can stun it.&amp;nbsp; Given the lack of mitigation at the high end, there should be less of a reason for SoE to use such mitigation as a reason not to improve other areas of our gameplay.&amp;nbsp; If SoE on the other hand believe that we should be able to stun-mitigate, then please give players at the higher end the means to do so against appropriate content.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;9. Two handed weapons (including Epics) - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being evaluated&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Two handed weapons are too far behind equivalent level one handers and shields in terms of stats.&amp;nbsp; Everyone agrees that there should be a stat penalty to going two-handed, due to the DPS improvement, but the difference is currently too great.&amp;nbsp; Remember that not only do we lose out in terms of the regular stats being lower on a two hander than on a one hander plus shield, we also lose the potential of a second set of focus effects and a second augment (a very big deal given the quality of augments available these days).&amp;nbsp; There was some suggestion at the Summit of giving two handers a second augment slot, for example, to narrow the gap somewhat - can this be implemented?&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;10. Undead&amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;Issue suspended pending discussion of DoD effect on Undead capabilities&amp;gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Once again, we'll revisit this - in the light of DoD, there have definitely been some improvements here - thanks!&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff00ff&gt;Paladin - List Update scheduled for&amp;nbsp;08/05/05&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1. Aggro &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being evaluated&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Currently, stun aggro is proportional to the maximum HP of the target creature, subject to an overall cap.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Aggro generation for both the other tank classes - and for many DPS classes - is on a completely different model which scales reasonably as player power and level increases.&amp;nbsp; There are obvious potential&amp;nbsp;issues with this clash of models, and we're now hitting a point in the game where these issues are really starting to hurt.&amp;nbsp; Basically a high-end Paladin simply cannot generate aggro at anything approaching the same rate as a Warrior or a Shadowknight, and it's far from uncommon for a chain-stunning Paladin&amp;nbsp;to lose aggro even to non-discing DPS classes at the very high end.&amp;nbsp; This situation is analogous to the aggro generation issues that Warriors, for example, had during early PoP - that had to be (and was) fixed, and now we need fixing.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;There are many possible solutions.&amp;nbsp; The most natural and easily maintainable would probably be to give each stun spell an explicit, fixed amount of aggro, regardless of the target mob, at a level appropriate to the level of the stun.&amp;nbsp; A "dirtier" fix may be to add aggro bonuses to high-end stuns, or to increase the aggro cap for high end stuns, however either of these fixes would just delay the time when similar problems were to arise.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;This is without doubt the number one issue facing the Paladin class today.&amp;nbsp; If nothing else is actioned on this list, please, please do something about aggro.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2. AE aggro &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being evaluated&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Shadowknights (Dread Gaze) and Warriors (Cyclone Blade, AE Taunt) both have reliable methods of building aggro on multiple targets.&amp;nbsp; Paladins are the only tank class that do not have this ability.&amp;nbsp; Please consider adding an AE aggro generation tool for Paladins.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;3. Disciplines (other than Holy Forge) &lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: ?Times New Roman?? 12pt; red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: ?Times New Roman?? 12pt; red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The original Paladin disciplines are effectively of no use.&amp;nbsp; Fearless is superseded by the AA of the same name, and even for players without that AA the number of fearing mobs in the game has been drastically reduced.&amp;nbsp; Sanctification is of far too short a duration to be of any use, and does not block all incoming spells anyway.&amp;nbsp; Resistant was of some use when introduced, but the extension of resist ranges renders it irrelevant now.&amp;nbsp; Is there any reason we couldn't have updated versions of each of these disciplines introduced, at levels of power more in line with higher level players of today.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;4. Disciplines (Holy Forge) &lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: ?Times New Roman?? 12pt; red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: ?Times New Roman?? 12pt; red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;No Paladin on any of the Forums believes that Holy Forge is currently working as intended.&amp;nbsp; Anecdotal evidence indicates no measurable increase in DPS against undead, and in fact situationally a decrease in DPS.&amp;nbsp; Unfortunately due to the short duration and relative rarity of Slay Undead procs, gathering enough data in controlled parses is close to impossible.&amp;nbsp; Please can the devs look closely at the Holy Forge code and ensure that it does work as intended.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;5. Lay on Hands &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being evaluated&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Lay on Hands frequently "fires" only for the target to be dead before it lands due to latency, lag or whatever.&amp;nbsp; Is it possible please to introduce a post-cast check, whereby if LoH did not land for whatever reason, the ability is un-greyed-out and ready for reuse.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;6. Two handed weapons (including Epics) &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;NEW&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Two handed weapons are too far behind equivalent level one handers and shields in terms of stats.&amp;nbsp; Everyone agrees that there should be a stat penalty to going two-handed, due to the DPS improvement, but the difference is currently too great.&amp;nbsp; Remember that not only do we lose out in terms of the regular stats being lower on a two hander than on a one hander plus shield, we also lose the potential of a second set of focus effects and a second augment (a very big deal given the quality of augments available these days).&amp;nbsp; There was some suggestion at the Summit of giving two handers a second augment slot, for example, to narrow the gap somewhat - can this be implemented?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;7. Stun mitigation &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;NEW&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;One of the factors that has been quoted in the past as reasons why some of our other requests have not been granted is that we have such a large benefit over the other tank classes in terms of stun mitigation of incoming damage.&amp;nbsp; At the high end, where many of our other issues are most acute (such as aggro generation), stun mitigation is meaningless, as no mob we're ever likely to fight is of a level where we can stun it.&amp;nbsp; Given the lack of mitigation at the highe nd, there should be less of a reason for SoE to use such mitigation as a reason not to improve other areas of our gameplay.&amp;nbsp; If SoE on the other hand believe that we should be able to stun-mitigate, then please give players at the higher end the means to do so against appropriate content.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;8. Undead &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: ?Times New Roman?? 12pt; red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed, t&lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: ?Times New Roman?? 12pt; red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;his will most likely be evaluated as part of the class Re-Envision process.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;There is a widespread feeling that Undead mobs are too rare in most content, and Paladin performance against Undead is sub-par.&amp;nbsp; A Paladin against Undead gets occasional eye-candy (if they have Slay Undead), but in terms of genuine DPS increases it's barely measurable.&amp;nbsp; We believe that, against Undead content, Paladin DPS should be genuinely meaningful - say up to Shadowknight levels against live mobs.&amp;nbsp; Even with SU, it simply isn't even close to that at the moment.&amp;nbsp; For the short amount of time we're under Holy Forge, the DPS of a Paladin with SU3 should be up there with the genuine DPS classes (only under Holy Forge, however).&amp;nbsp; See the Holy Forge item above - currently it seems to be not working as intended, but even when it was the DPS boost was far, far smaller than we believe would be appropriate.&amp;nbsp; Holy Forge is available for five minutes out of each 72 - making us genuine DPS classes against a small subset of mobs for less than 7% of the time would not be game-breaking.&amp;nbsp; Oh, and please put some Undead mobs in the zones which are designed to be the main XP zones in each future expansion.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;9. Disappearing spell lines &lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: ?Times New Roman?? 12pt; red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: ?Times New Roman?? 12pt; red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Please consider providing upgrades to spell lines that we get early on in our careers, but which disappear before the endgame.&amp;nbsp; Examples would be the Lull, Fear Undead and Yaulp lines.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff00ff&gt;Paladin - List Update scheduled for&amp;nbsp;07/05/05 - A revamped list...&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1. Aggro &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;NEW&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Currently, stun aggro is proportional to the maximum HP of the target creature, subject to an overall cap.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Aggro generation for both the other tank classes - and for many DPS classes - is on a completely different model which scales reasonably as player power and level increases.&amp;nbsp; There are obvious potential&amp;nbsp;issues with this clash of models, and we're now hitting a point in the game where these issues are really starting to hurt.&amp;nbsp; Basically a high-end Paladin simply cannot generate aggro at anything approaching the same rate as a Warrior or a Shadowknight, and it's far from uncommon for a chain-stunning Paladin&amp;nbsp;to lose aggro even to non-discing DPS classes at the very high end.&amp;nbsp; This situation is analogous to the aggro generation issues that Warriors, for example, had during early PoP - that had to be (and was) fixed, and now we need fixing.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;There are many possible solutions.&amp;nbsp; The most natural and easily maintainable would probably be to give each stun spell an explicit, fixed amount of aggro, regardless of the target mob, at a level appropriate to the level of the stun.&amp;nbsp; A "dirtier" fix may be to add aggro bonuses to high-end stuns, or to increase the aggro cap for high end stuns, however either of these fixes would just delay the time when similar problems were to arise.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;This is without doubt the number one issue facing the Paladin class today.&amp;nbsp; If nothing else is actioned on this list, please, please do something about aggro.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2. AE aggro &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;NEW&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Shadowknights (Dread Gaze) and Warriors (Cyclone Blade, AE Taunt) both have reliable methods of building aggro on multiple targets.&amp;nbsp; Paladins are the only tank class that do not have this ability.&amp;nbsp; Please consider adding an AE aggro generation tool for Paladins.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;3. Disciplines (other than Holy Forge) &lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: Roman??

&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The original Paladin disciplines are effectively of no use.&amp;nbsp; Fearless is superseded by the AA of the same name, and even for players without that AA the number of fearing mobs in the game has been drastically reduced.&amp;nbsp; Sanctification is of far too short a duration to be of any use, and does not block all incoming spells anyway.&amp;nbsp; Resistant was of some use when introduced, but the extension of resist ranges renders it irrelevant now.&amp;nbsp; Is there any reason we couldn't have updated versions of each of these disciplines introduced, at levels of power more in line with higher level players of today.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;4. Disciplines (Holy Forge) &lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: Roman??

&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;No Paladin on any of the Forums believes that Holy Forge is currently working as intended.&amp;nbsp; Anecdotal evidence indicates no measurable increase in DPS against undead, and in fact situationally a decrease in DPS.&amp;nbsp; Unfortunately due to the short duration and relative rarity of Slay Undead procs, gathering enough data in controlled parses is close to impossible.&amp;nbsp; Please can the devs look closely at the Holy Forge code and ensure that it does work as intended.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Lay on Hands frequently "fires" only for the target to be dead before it lands due to latency, lag or whatever.&amp;nbsp; Is it possible please to introduce a post-cast check, whereby if LoH did not land for whatever reason, the ability is un-greyed-out and ready for reuse.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;6. Two handed weapons (including Epics) &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;NEW&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff00ff&gt;Paladin - List Update scheduled for&amp;nbsp;06/03/05&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1. Better Mitigation&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt; With the changes to the AC cap that went live on &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;A href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Crier&amp;amp;message.id=115" target=_blank&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#cccccc&gt;May 11th&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt; has there been an improvement to Paladin mitigation?? &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;"- The return on AC over the cap has been increased for monks, paladin, and shadowknights of level 50 and higher."&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;There is a too large a disparity between warriors and paladins when it comes to tanking. A warrior in gear inferior to a paladin can and does tank better then the paladin even outside of discipline. While this issue only truly shows itself in high end group content the concern is that this trend will quickly leave paladins in the same straits that warriors were in when they did not have sufficient agro to make them desirable for group content. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;With more and more mobs either higher in level or flagged stun immune we take the full brunt of the damage the mob can dish out. We have no way of mitigating or avoiding any of this damage other then the same AA’s that every single class in the game gets. This issue is for all levels but becomes more of an issue the higher you progress. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The tanking between a paladin vs all other classes is not great enough. Mitigation should be based on Armor and Defense. A monk or ranger (for example, not picking on them) should NOT be as effective as a Warrior or Knight of similar AC/HP.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2. Better Healing &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Many changes to Paladin healing went live with the April 20th update.&amp;nbsp; Has there been sufficient improvement to Paladin healing since the April 20th update?&amp;nbsp; If yes lets remove this if not perhaps this issue should be reworded a bit to reflect the changes already made.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN COLOR: FONT-FAMILY: 12pt; ?Times New Roman?? **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;The recast timer on the level 65 and higher spells needs to be looked at. They do not allow for a situation where fast cast heals are needed. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;To get around the recast timer, a lot of paladins are loading 2 or more heals which further reduces our role as a utility player by reducing the number of spell gems available to us. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Our healing role tends to be as emergency patch healer.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Our longer-casting, slightly higher heals are simply too slow to cast to be useful – the “light” line is all very well, but the “touch” line is unused by many; could it be upgraded either significantly in terms of amount healed, or the cast time significantly reduced, in return for a higher mana cost?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Our heal-over-time spells can be very useful but the base heal value per tick is too low and if they get overwritten are a waste of mana. The grey out, being able to cast another spell right away, as well as the recast timer is restrictive. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;During battle paladins, even when tanking, are required to heal their group-mates as well as ourselves. To do this we need to target fast, cast the heal without interruption or fizzle and get back to the correct mob, quickly. During these times we fizzle and are interrupted too often, and the new AA to continue casting through stuns seems to not be working properly. What this comes down to is we need healing looked at for when we are also tanking. &lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;3. Stuns &lt;SPAN COLOR: FONT-FAMILY: 12pt; ?Times New Roman?? **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff00ff&gt;&lt;SPAN COLOR: FONT-FAMILY: 12pt; ?Times New Roman?? **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The most important issue with stuns is the non-scaling of stun aggro with level of spell.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;This means that Paladin aggro generation is effectively no greater than it was 30 levels earlier, while all other classes have been steadily increasing their aggro generation.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;This means that, little by little, it becomes harder for a Paladin to hold aggro against casters, and also that the other tank classes gradually eat away at our supposed aggro advantage.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;SKs have received significant upgrades, including Dread Gaze, which now means that Paladins are the only tank class without a specific AE aggro capacity.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Long cast time as well as the recast timer needs to be looked at. Because we are casting during battle, we need very fast casting spells or we are interrupted too often, and the long recast means that we have to mem 3 or 4 stuns to overcome agro and recast issues. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Ancient: Force of Chaos, needs to have its level limit looked at because of the level limit problems with trash mobs in group content as well as access to it. &lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;4. Epic issues &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;New&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;There are several issues regarding the Epics that we feel are very important to address.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Currently, any Knights at the medium and high end would be well advised to leave their Epics firmly in their bags unless they’re going to a fashion parade.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Knights (other than Berserkers, who cannot wield one-handed weapons) are the only classes that have two handed Epics.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;All Epic 1.5s were based on the class PoTime weapons – with the exception of Knights, whose PoTime class weapons are one handers.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Just as all Knights at the medium and high end are moving towards one handed weapons, so our Epics push us in the opposite direction.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The problems with two handers are obvious; they are inferior for tanking, and Epic 1.5 and 2.0 can both be easily outperformed by a one-hander setup from equivalent or even lower level content.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;The only benefit to using a two hander is DPS – and no Knight is ever going to be given a role as a DPS machine.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;We are tanks; let us tank with our Epics.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Two handers also lose a huge amount of stats compared to one handers.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;If they MUST be two handers, please can we not up the stats to at least be close to what we’d get from a one-handed setup?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The click effect is pitifully weak.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;A time-limited stun proc that you’d be lucky to even see proc during the click period, and a small boost to heals received.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;The stun proc needs to be unlinked and made innate and permanent to have any use at all, while the heal increase, while sounding nice on the face of it, gives no real benefit to the wielder.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The focus effects are replaceable with regular gear, removing the last possible reason to equip the Epic.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;5. Current Disciplines &lt;SPAN COLOR: FONT-FAMILY: 12pt; ?Times New Roman?? **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN COLOR: FONT-FAMILY: 12pt; ?Times New Roman?? **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The current set of Paladin disciplines is just about as close to useless as is imaginable.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Almost no Paladin ever uses anything other than Holyforge, and even that is seen as being largely useless these days.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Resistant&lt;/STRONG&gt;: This discipline lasts for 5 minutes, and has a base reuse time of 1 hour and raises all resists by 20.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The time on this discipline seems correct, it gives plenty of time to pop it at the beginning of a fight and either get full use out of it or more likely get the mob dead before it drops. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The amount of resist when compared to the mobs today is far, far too small.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;When first introduced it may have been of some use, when a “good” resist item may have had 15-20 total resists on it, and +20 to each resist was definitely useful.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;These days a “good” resist item can often have over 100 total resists, while adding +20 to any resist has minimal effect against the new Chromatic and Prismatic AEs with huge negative resist checks - yet this discipline does not have a corresponding upgrade.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Fearless&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Immunity to "Fear" and all spells that cause "fear". This discipline lasts for 1 minute, and has a base reuse time of 1 hour. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The biggest issue here is that after you purchase Fear Resistance for 12 AA's and Fearless for another 6 AA's this discipline is useless.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Sanctification&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Immunity to most types of harmful spells. This discipline lasts for 18 seconds, and has a base reuse time of 72 minutes.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;It does not last long enough. The only possible way it can be used is on a pull, otherwise we would never know when to use it. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;It does not block all harmful spells, and the ones we need it most on are irresistable, and sanctification does not block irresistable spells.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Holyforge&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Critical Hits and Crippling Blows versus undead with an increased probability of going off.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The concerns regarding the use of Holyforge are very well known.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Controlled tests by the community correspondent have been arranged, and will be performed as soon as the Test server is a bit more stable.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;No other disc in the game is retricted to such a small amount of game content. As per the class description, Paladins should be the masters of undead, such as Rangers are the masters of Archery. With 85 AA's spent, Holy Forge should provide DPS against undead somewhat approaching that of a true DPS class, as well as increased DPS versus live mobs without the ability to slay&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;6. Power versus the undead &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN COLOR: FONT-FAMILY: 12pt; ?Times New Roman?? **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed, t&lt;SPAN COLOR: FONT-FAMILY: 12pt; ?Times New Roman?? **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;his will most likely be evaluated as part of the class Re-Envision process.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;This issue revolves solely around the issue of our class description where it states that paladins are the greatest force against the undead. It is generally agreed that this power is in the form of DPS rather then tanking, though both are thought to have a strong role playing basis. Therefore this definition will deal mostly with our ability to damage an undead mob. Issue&amp;nbsp;8 is in regards to lack of undead so I will not go into that here except to say that the lack of undead does effect our power versus them since if their are no undead we have no power and if everything was undead we would be way overpowered.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The biggest reason we lack power versus undead is felt to be the RNG. As a slayer of undead we are too reliant on&amp;nbsp;this random factor. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;We should have DPS greater then a warrior outside of Holyforge and with Slay Undead 3. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Inside of Holyforge this power should be increased to the point that we approach genuine DPS class performance (during this discipline only).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;When in areas with mixed mobs, live and undead, it is not efficient to use our undead proc, instead we must use a lesser proc that works on all mobs. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;We have weaker direct damage spells versus undead than any other relevant class.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;7. Buffs/spells &lt;SPAN COLOR: FONT-FAMILY: 12pt; ?Times New Roman?? **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;This will most likely be evaluated as part of the class Re-Envision process.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Much is made by some of the fact that Paladins can allegedly “buff better than any other single class”.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;This is highly misleading, however, and in practice the ONLY Paladin buff anyone ever asks for is the Brells line.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;We’ve recently got upgrades in the Direction line, for example, but many if not most Paladins will never even bother to mem this.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Can we find some ideas for unique buffing abilities for Paladins; maybe a resist line against poison or disease would be appropriate, or some form of “resist curse” buff (that would be unique, and situationally useful when preparing fpr many encounters).&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Also, a stronger (and even group) version of the Crusader’s Purity line would appear reasonable.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;This would fit in well with Paladin roles in general; our current cures are too weak and slow-casting to be of much benefit.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;8. Lack of undead &lt;SPAN COLOR: FONT-FAMILY: 12pt; ?Times New Roman?? **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN COLOR: FONT-FAMILY: 12pt; ?Times New Roman?? **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Planes of power saw a dearth of undead in the expansion. Discord has almost NO undead whatsoever that I have seen from start through Ikkinz and I expect more of the same from Omens. Why give us a power focus and then give us NOTHING to utilize it on? An advantage is NOT an advantage if it is functionally useless.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff00ff&gt;Paladin - List Update scheduled for&amp;nbsp;05/06/05&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1. Better Mitigation &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;This is being considered as part #1 of the class Re-Envision process.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;There is a too large a disparity between warriors and paladins when it comes to tanking. A warrior in gear inferior to a paladin can and does tank better then the paladin even outside of discipline. While this issue only truly shows itself in high end group content the concern is that this trend will quickly leave paladins in the same straits that warriors were in when they did not have sufficient agro to make them desirable for group content. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;With more and more mobs either higher in level or flagged stun immune we take the full brunt of the damage the mob can dish out. We have no way of mitigating or avoiding any of this damage other then the same AA’s that every single class in the game gets. This issue is for all levels but becomes more of an issue the higher you progress. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The tanking between a paladin vs all other classes is not great enough. Mitigation should be based on Armor and Defense. A monk or ranger (for example, not picking on them) should NOT be as effective as a Warrior or Knight of similar AC/HP.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2. Better Healing &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Many changes to Paladin healing went live with the April 20th update.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: Roman?? New ?Times 12pt; red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;The recast timer on the level 65 and higher spells needs to be looked at. They do not allow for a situation where fast cast heals are needed. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;To get around the recast timer, a lot of paladins are loading 2 or more heals which further reduces our role as a utility player by reducing the number of spell gems available to us. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Our healing role tends to be as emergency patch healer.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Our longer-casting, slightly higher heals are simply too slow to cast to be useful – the “light” line is all very well, but the “touch” line is unused by many; could it be upgraded either significantly in terms of amount healed, or the cast time significantly reduced, in return for a higher mana cost?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Our heal-over-time spells can be very useful but the base heal value per tick is too low and if they get overwritten are a waste of mana. The grey out, being able to cast another spell right away, as well as the recast timer is restrictive. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;During battle paladins, even when tanking, are required to heal their group-mates as well as ourselves. To do this we need to target fast, cast the heal without interruption or fizzle and get back to the correct mob, quickly. During these times we fizzle and are interrupted too often, and the new AA to continue casting through stuns seems to not be working properly. What this comes down to is we need healing looked at for when we are also tanking. &lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;3. Stuns &lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: Roman?? New ?Times 12pt; red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff00ff&gt;&lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: Roman?? New ?Times 12pt; red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The most important issue with stuns is the non-scaling of stun aggro with level of spell.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;This means that Paladin aggro generation is effectively no greater than it was 30 levels earlier, while all other classes have been steadily increasing their aggro generation.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;This means that, little by little, it becomes harder for a Paladin to hold aggro against casters, and also that the other tank classes gradually eat away at our supposed aggro advantage.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;SKs have received significant upgrades, including Dread Gaze, which now means that Paladins are the only tank class without a specific AE aggro capacity.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Long cast time as well as the recast timer needs to be looked at. Because we are casting during battle, we need very fast casting spells or we are interrupted too often, and the long recast means that we have to mem 3 or 4 stuns to overcome agro and recast issues. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Ancient: Force of Chaos, needs to have its level limit looked at because of the level limit problems with trash mobs in group content as well as access to it. &lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;4. Epic issues &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;New&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;There are several issues regarding the Epics that we feel are very important to address.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Currently, any Knights at the medium and high end would be well advised to leave their Epics firmly in their bags unless they’re going to a fashion parade.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Knights (other than Berserkers, who cannot wield one-handed weapons) are the only classes that have two handed Epics.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;All Epic 1.5s were based on the class PoTime weapons – with the exception of Knights, whose PoTime class weapons are one handers.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Just as all Knights at the medium and high end are moving towards one handed weapons, so our Epics push us in the opposite direction.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The problems with two handers are obvious; they are inferior for tanking, and Epic 1.5 and 2.0 can both be easily outperformed by a one-hander setup from equivalent or even lower level content.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;The only benefit to using a two hander is DPS – and no Knight is ever going to be given a role as a DPS machine.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;We are tanks; let us tank with our Epics.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Two handers also lose a huge amount of stats compared to one handers.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;If they MUST be two handers, please can we not up the stats to at least be close to what we’d get from a one-handed setup?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The click effect is pitifully weak.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;A time-limited stun proc that you’d be lucky to even see proc during the click period, and a small boost to heals received.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;The stun proc needs to be unlinked and made innate and permanent to have any use at all, while the heal increase, while sounding nice on the face of it, gives no real benefit to the wielder.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The focus effects are replaceable with regular gear, removing the last possible reason to equip the Epic.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;5. Current Disciplines &lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: Roman??

&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff00ff&gt;Paladin - List Update scheduled for&amp;nbsp;04/01/05&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1. Better Mitigation &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;This is being considered as part #1 of the class Re-Envision process.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;There is a too large a disparity between warriors and paladins when it comes to tanking. A warrior in gear inferior to a paladin can and does tank better then the paladin even outside of discipline. While this issue only truly shows itself in high end group content the concern is that this trend will quickly leave paladins in the same straits that warriors were in when they did not have sufficient agro to make them desirable for group content. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;With more and more mobs either higher in level or flagged stun immune we take the full brunt of the damage the mob can dish out. We have no way of mitigating or avoiding any of this damage other then the same AA’s that every single class in the game gets. This issue is for all levels but becomes more of an issue the higher you progress. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The tanking between a paladin vs all other classes is not great enough. Mitigation should be based on Armor and Defense. A monk or ranger (for example, not picking on them) should NOT be as effective as a Warrior or Knight of similar AC/HP.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2. Better Healing &lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: Roman?? New ?Times 12pt; red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;This is being considered as part of the class Re-Envision process.&amp;nbsp; Some changes have made their way to Test Server already.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: Roman?? New ?Times 12pt; red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;The recast timer on the level 65 and higher spells needs to be looked at. They do not allow for a situation where fast cast heals are needed. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;To get around the recast timer, a lot of paladins are loading 2 or more heals which further reduces our role as a utility player by reducing the number of spell gems available to us. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Our healing role tends to be as emergency patch healer.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Our longer-casting, slightly higher heals are simply too slow to cast to be useful – the “light” line is all very well, but the “touch” line is unused by many; could it be upgraded either significantly in terms of amount healed, or the cast time significantly reduced, in return for a higher mana cost?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Our heal-over-time spells can be very useful but the base heal value per tick is too low and if they get overwritten are a waste of mana. The grey out, being able to cast another spell right away, as well as the recast timer is restrictive. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;During battle paladins, even when tanking, are required to heal their group-mates as well as ourselves. To do this we need to target fast, cast the heal without interruption or fizzle and get back to the correct mob, quickly. During these times we fizzle and are interrupted too often, and the new AA to continue casting through stuns seems to not be working properly. What this comes down to is we need healing looked at for when we are also tanking. &lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;3. Stuns &lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: Roman?? New ?Times 12pt; red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff00ff&gt;&lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: Roman?? New ?Times 12pt; red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The most important issue with stuns is the non-scaling of stun aggro with level of spell.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;This means that Paladin aggro generation is effectively no greater than it was 30 levels earlier, while all other classes have been steadily increasing their aggro generation.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;This means that, little by little, it becomes harder for a Paladin to hold aggro against casters, and also that the other tank classes gradually eat away at our supposed aggro advantage.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;SKs have received significant upgrades, including Dread Gaze, which now means that Paladins are the only tank class without a specific AE aggro capacity.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Long cast time as well as the recast timer needs to be looked at. Because we are casting during battle, we need very fast casting spells or we are interrupted too often, and the long recast means that we have to mem 3 or 4 stuns to overcome agro and recast issues. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Ancient: Force of Chaos, needs to have its level limit looked at because of the level limit problems with trash mobs in group content as well as access to it. &lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;4. Epic issues &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;New&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;There are several issues regarding the Epics that we feel are very important to address.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Currently, any Knights at the medium and high end would be well advised to leave their Epics firmly in their bags unless they’re going to a fashion parade.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Knights (other than Berserkers, who cannot wield one-handed weapons) are the only classes that have two handed Epics.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;All Epic 1.5s were based on the class PoTime weapons – with the exception of Knights, whose PoTime class weapons are one handers.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Just as all Knights at the medium and high end are moving towards one handed weapons, so our Epics push us in the opposite direction.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The problems with two handers are obvious; they are inferior for tanking, and Epic 1.5 and 2.0 can both be easily outperformed by a one-hander setup from equivalent or even lower level content.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;The only benefit to using a two hander is DPS – and no Knight is ever going to be given a role as a DPS machine.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;We are tanks; let us tank with our Epics.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Two handers also lose a huge amount of stats compared to one handers.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;If they MUST be two handers, please can we not up the stats to at least be close to what we’d get from a one-handed setup?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The click effect is pitifully weak.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;A time-limited stun proc that you’d be lucky to even see proc during the click period, and a small boost to heals received.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;The stun proc needs to be unlinked and made innate and permanent to have any use at all, while the heal increase, while sounding nice on the face of it, gives no real benefit to the wielder.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The focus effects are replaceable with regular gear, removing the last possible reason to equip the Epic.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;5. Current Disciplines &lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: Roman?? New ?Times 12pt; red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: Roman?? New ?Times 12pt; red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The current set of Paladin disciplines is just about as close to useless as is imaginable.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Almost no Paladin ever uses anything other than Holyforge, and even that is seen as being largely useless these days.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Resistant&lt;/STRONG&gt;: This discipline lasts for 5 minutes, and has a base reuse time of 1 hour and raises all resists by 20.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The time on this discipline seems correct, it gives plenty of time to pop it at the beginning of a fight and either get full use out of it or more likely get the mob dead before it drops. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The amount of resist when compared to the mobs today is far, far too small.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;When first introduced it may have been of some use, when a “good” resist item may have had 15-20 total resists on it, and +20 to each resist was definitely useful.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;These days a “good” resist item can often have over 100 total resists, while adding +20 to any resist has minimal effect against the new Chromatic and Prismatic AEs with huge negative resist checks - yet this discipline does not have a corresponding upgrade.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Fearless&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Immunity to "Fear" and all spells that cause "fear". This discipline lasts for 1 minute, and has a base reuse time of 1 hour. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The biggest issue here is that after you purchase Fear Resistance for 12 AA's and Fearless for another 6 AA's this discipline is useless.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Sanctification&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Immunity to most types of harmful spells. This discipline lasts for 18 seconds, and has a base reuse time of 72 minutes.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;It does not last long enough. The only possible way it can be used is on a pull, otherwise we would never know when to use it. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;It does not block all harmful spells, and the ones we need it most on are irresistable, and sanctification does not block irresistable spells.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Holyforge&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Critical Hits and Crippling Blows versus undead with an increased probability of going off.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The concerns regarding the use of Holyforge are very well known.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Controlled tests by the community correspondent have been arranged, and will be performed as soon as the Test server is a bit more stable.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;No other disc in the game is retricted to such a small amount of game content. As per the class description, Paladins should be the masters of undead, such as Rangers are the masters of Archery. With 85 AA's spent, Holy Forge should provide DPS against undead somewhat approaching that of a true DPS class, as well as increased DPS versus live mobs without the ability to slay&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;6. Power versus the undead &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: Roman?? New ?Times 12pt; red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed, t&lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: Roman?? New ?Times 12pt; red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;his will most likely be evaluated as part of the class Re-Envision process.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;This issue revolves solely around the issue of our class description where it states that paladins are the greatest force against the undead. It is generally agreed that this power is in the form of DPS rather then tanking, though both are thought to have a strong role playing basis. Therefore this definition will deal mostly with our ability to damage an undead mob. Issue&amp;nbsp;8 is in regards to lack of undead so I will not go into that here except to say that the lack of undead does effect our power versus them since if their are no undead we have no power and if everything was undead we would be way overpowered.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The biggest reason we lack power versus undead is felt to be the RNG. As a slayer of undead we are too reliant on&amp;nbsp;this random factor. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;We should have DPS greater then a warrior outside of Holyforge and with Slay Undead 3. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Inside of Holyforge this power should be increased to the point that we approach genuine DPS class performance (during this discipline only).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;When in areas with mixed mobs, live and undead, it is not efficient to use our undead proc, instead we must use a lesser proc that works on all mobs. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;We have weaker direct damage spells versus undead than any other relevant class.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;7. Buffs/spells &lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: Roman?? New ?Times 12pt; red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;This will most likely be evaluated as part of the class Re-Envision process.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Much is made by some of the fact that Paladins can allegedly “buff better than any other single class”.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;This is highly misleading, however, and in practice the ONLY Paladin buff anyone ever asks for is the Brells line.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;We’ve recently got upgrades in the Direction line, for example, but many if not most Paladins will never even bother to mem this.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Can we find some ideas for unique buffing abilities for Paladins; maybe a resist line against poison or disease would be appropriate, or some form of “resist curse” buff (that would be unique, and situationally useful when preparing fpr many encounters).&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Also, a stronger (and even group) version of the Crusader’s Purity line would appear reasonable.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;This would fit in well with Paladin roles in general; our current cures are too weak and slow-casting to be of much benefit.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;8. Lack of undead &lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: Roman??

Stuns &lt;SPAN New ?Times FONT-FAMILY: 12pt; **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: COLOR: red; Roman??&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff00ff&gt;&lt;SPAN New ?Times FONT-FAMILY: 12pt; **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: COLOR: red; Roman??&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The most important issue with stuns is the non-scaling of stun aggro with level of spell.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;This means that Paladin aggro generation is effectively no greater than it was 30 levels earlier, while all other classes have been steadily increasing their aggro generation.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;This means that, little by little, it becomes harder for a Paladin to hold aggro against casters, and also that the other tank classes gradually eat away at our supposed aggro advantage.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;SKs have received significant upgrades, including Dread Gaze, which now means that Paladins are the only tank class without a specific AE aggro capacity.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Long cast time as well as the recast timer needs to be looked at. Because we are casting during battle, we need very fast casting spells or we are interrupted too often, and the long recast means that we have to mem 3 or 4 stuns to overcome agro and recast issues. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Ancient: Force of Chaos, needs to have its level limit looked at because of the level limit problems with trash mobs in group content as well as access to it. &lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;4. Epic issues &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;New&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;There are several issues regarding the Epics that we feel are very important to address.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Currently, any Knights at the medium and high end would be well advised to leave their Epics firmly in their bags unless they’re going to a fashion parade.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Knights (other than Berserkers, who cannot wield one-handed weapons) are the only classes that have two handed Epics.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;All Epic 1.5s were based on the class PoTime weapons – with the exception of Knights, whose PoTime class weapons are one handers.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Just as all Knights at the medium and high end are moving towards one handed weapons, so our Epics push us in the opposite direction.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The problems with two handers are obvious; they are inferior for tanking, and Epic 1.5 and 2.0 can both be easily outperformed by a one-hander setup from equivalent or even lower level content.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;The only benefit to using a two hander is DPS – and no Knight is ever going to be given a role as a DPS machine.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;We are tanks; let us tank with our Epics.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Two handers also lose a huge amount of stats compared to one handers.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;If they MUST be two handers, please can we not up the stats to at least be close to what we’d get from a one-handed setup?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The click effect is pitifully weak.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;A time-limited stun proc that you’d be lucky to even see proc during the click period, and a small boost to heals received.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;The stun proc needs to be unlinked and made innate and permanent to have any use at all, while the heal increase, while sounding nice on the face of it, gives no real benefit to the wielder.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The focus effects are replaceable with regular gear, removing the last possible reason to equip the Epic.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;5. Current Disciplines &lt;SPAN New ?Times FONT-FAMILY: 12pt; **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: COLOR: red; Roman??&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN New ?Times FONT-FAMILY: 12pt; **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: COLOR: red; Roman??&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The current set of Paladin disciplines is just about as close to useless as is imaginable.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Almost no Paladin ever uses anything other than Holyforge, and even that is seen as being largely useless these days.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Resistant&lt;/STRONG&gt;: This discipline lasts for 5 minutes, and has a base reuse time of 1 hour and raises all resists by 20.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The time on this discipline seems correct, it gives plenty of time to pop it at the beginning of a fight and either get full use out of it or more likely get the mob dead before it drops. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The amount of resist when compared to the mobs today is far, far too small.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;When first introduced it may have been of some use, when a “good” resist item may have had 15-20 total resists on it, and +20 to each resist was definitely useful.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;These days a “good” resist item can often have over 100 total resists, while adding +20 to any resist has minimal effect against the new Chromatic and Prismatic AEs with huge negative resist checks - yet this discipline does not have a corresponding upgrade.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Fearless&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Immunity to "Fear" and all spells that cause "fear". This discipline lasts for 1 minute, and has a base reuse time of 1 hour. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The biggest issue here is that after you purchase Fear Resistance for 12 AA's and Fearless for another 6 AA's this discipline is useless.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Sanctification&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Immunity to most types of harmful spells. This discipline lasts for 18 seconds, and has a base reuse time of 72 minutes.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;It does not last long enough. The only possible way it can be used is on a pull, otherwise we would never know when to use it. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;It does not block all harmful spells, and the ones we need it most on are irresistable, and sanctification does not block irresistable spells.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Holyforge&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Critical Hits and Crippling Blows versus undead with an increased probability of going off.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The concerns regarding the use of Holyforge are very well known.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Controlled tests by the community correspondent have been arranged, and will be performed as soon as the Test server is a bit more stable.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;No other disc in the game is retricted to such a small amount of game content. As per the class description, Paladins should be the masters of undead, such as Rangers are the masters of Archery. With 85 AA's spent, Holy Forge should provide DPS against undead somewhat approaching that of a true DPS class, as well as increased DPS versus live mobs without the ability to slay&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;6. Power versus the undead &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN New ?Times FONT-FAMILY: 12pt; **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: COLOR: red; Roman??&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed, t&lt;SPAN New ?Times FONT-FAMILY: 12pt; **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: COLOR: red; Roman??&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;his will most likely be evaluated as part of the class Re-Envision process.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;This issue revolves solely around the issue of our class description where it states that paladins are the greatest force against the undead. It is generally agreed that this power is in the form of DPS rather then tanking, though both are thought to have a strong role playing basis. Therefore this definition will deal mostly with our ability to damage an undead mob. Issue&amp;nbsp;8 is in regards to lack of undead so I will not go into that here except to say that the lack of undead does effect our power versus them since if their are no undead we have no power and if everything was undead we would be way overpowered.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The biggest reason we lack power versus undead is felt to be the RNG. As a slayer of undead we are too reliant on&amp;nbsp;this random factor. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;We should have DPS greater then a warrior outside of Holyforge and with Slay Undead 3. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Inside of Holyforge this power should be increased to the point that we approach genuine DPS class performance (during this discipline only).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;When in areas with mixed mobs, live and undead, it is not efficient to use our undead proc, instead we must use a lesser proc that works on all mobs. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;We have weaker direct damage spells versus undead than any other relevant class.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;7. Buffs/spells &lt;SPAN New ?Times FONT-FAMILY: 12pt; **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: COLOR: red; Roman??&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;This will most likely be evaluated as part of the class Re-Envision process.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Much is made by some of the fact that Paladins can allegedly “buff better than any other single class”.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;This is highly misleading, however, and in practice the ONLY Paladin buff anyone ever asks for is the Brells line.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;We’ve recently got upgrades in the Direction line, for example, but many if not most Paladins will never even bother to mem this.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Can we find some ideas for unique buffing abilities for Paladins; maybe a resist line against poison or disease would be appropriate, or some form of “resist curse” buff (that would be unique, and situationally useful when preparing fpr many encounters).&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Also, a stronger (and even group) version of the Crusader’s Purity line would appear reasonable.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;This would fit in well with Paladin roles in general; our current cures are too weak and slow-casting to be of much benefit.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;8. Lack of undead &lt;SPAN New ?Times FONT-FAMILY: 12pt; **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: COLOR: red; Roman??&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN New ?Times FONT-FAMILY: 12pt; **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: COLOR: red; Roman??&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Planes of power saw a dearth of undead in the expansion. Discord has almost NO undead whatsoever that I have seen from start through Ikkinz and I expect more of the same from Omens. Why give us a power focus and then give us NOTHING to utilize it on? An advantage is NOT an advantage if it is functionally useless.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff00ff&gt;Paladin - List Update scheduled for&amp;nbsp;02/07/05&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1. Better Mitigation &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;This will most likely be evaluated as part of the class Re-Envision process.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;There is a too large a disparity between warriors and paladins when it comes to tanking. A warrior in gear inferior to a paladin can and does tank better then the paladin even outside of discipline. While this issue only truly shows itself in high end group content the concern is that this trend will quickly leave paladins in the same straits that warriors were in when they did not have sufficient agro to make them desirable for group content. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;With more and more mobs either higher in level or flagged stun immune we take the full brunt of the damage the mob can dish out. We have no way of mitigating or avoiding any of this damage other then the same AA’s that every single class in the game gets. This issue is for all levels but becomes more of an issue the higher you progress. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The tanking between a paladin vs all other classes is not great enough. Mitigation should be based on Armor and Defense. A monk or ranger (for example, not picking on them) should NOT be as effective as a Warrior or Knight of similar AC/HP.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2. Better Healing &lt;SPAN COLOR: FONT-FAMILY: New ?Times 12pt; Roman?? **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;This will most likely be evaluated as part of the class Re-Envision process.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN COLOR: FONT-FAMILY: New ?Times 12pt; Roman?? **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;The recast timer on the level 65 and higher spells needs to be looked at. They do not allow for a situation where fast cast heals are needed. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;To get around the recast timer, a lot of paladins are loading 2 or more heals which further reduces our role as a utility player by reducing the number of spell gems available to us. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Our healing role tends to be as emergency patch healer.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Our longer-casting, slightly higher heals are simply too slow to cast to be useful – the “light” line is all very well, but the “touch” line is unused by many; could it be upgraded either significantly in terms of amount healed, or the cast time significantly reduced, in return for a higher mana cost?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Our heal-over-time spells can be very useful but the base heal value per tick is too low and if they get overwritten are a waste of mana. The grey out, being able to cast another spell right away, as well as the recast timer is restrictive. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;During battle paladins, even when tanking, are required to heal their group-mates as well as ourselves. To do this we need to target fast, cast the heal without interruption or fizzle and get back to the correct mob, quickly. During these times we fizzle and are interrupted too often, and the new AA to continue casting through stuns seems to not be working properly. What this comes down to is we need healing looked at for when we are also tanking. &lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;3. Stuns &lt;SPAN COLOR: FONT-FAMILY: New ?Times 12pt; Roman?? **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff00ff&gt;&lt;SPAN COLOR: FONT-FAMILY: New ?Times 12pt; Roman?? **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Ancient: Force of Chaos, needs to have its level limit looked at because of the level limit problems with trash mobs in group content as well as access to it. &lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;4. Epic issues &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;New&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;There are several issues regarding the Epics that we feel are very important to address.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Currently, any Knights at the medium and high end would be well advised to leave their Epics firmly in their bags unless they’re going to a fashion parade.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The focus effects are replaceable with regular gear, removing the last possible reason to equip the Epic.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;

As per the class description, Paladins should be the masters of undead, such as Rangers are the masters of Archery. With 85 AA's spent, Holy Forge should provide DPS against undead somewhat approaching that of a true DPS class, as well as increased DPS versus live mobs without the ability to slay&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;6. Power versus the undead &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN COLOR: FONT-FAMILY: New ?Times 12pt; Roman?? **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;This issue revolves solely around the issue of our class description where it states that paladins are the greatest force against the undead. It is generally agreed that this power is in the form of DPS rather then tanking, though both are thought to have a strong role playing basis. Therefore this definition will deal mostly with our ability to damage an undead mob. Issue&amp;nbsp;8 is in regards to lack of undead so I will not go into that here except to say that the lack of undead does effect our power versus them since if their are no undead we have no power and if everything was undead we would be way overpowered.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The biggest reason we lack power versus undead is felt to be the RNG. As a slayer of undead we are too reliant on&amp;nbsp;this random factor. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;We should have DPS greater then a warrior outside of Holyforge and with Slay Undead 3. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Inside of Holyforge this power should be increased to the point that we approach genuine DPS class performance (during this discipline only).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;When in areas with mixed mobs, live and undead, it is not efficient to use our undead proc, instead we must use a lesser proc that works on all mobs. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;We have weaker direct damage spells versus undead than any other relevant class.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;7. Buffs/spells &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;New&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Much is made by some of the fact that Paladins can allegedly “buff better than any other single class”.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;This is highly misleading, however, and in practice the ONLY Paladin buff anyone ever asks for is the Brells line.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;We’ve recently got upgrades in the Direction line, for example, but many if not most Paladins will never even bother to mem this.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Can we find some ideas for unique buffing abilities for Paladins; maybe a resist line against poison or disease would be appropriate, or some form of “resist curse” buff (that would be unique, and situationally useful when preparing fpr many encounters).&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Also, a stronger (and even group) version of the Crusader’s Purity line would appear reasonable.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;This would fit in well with Paladin roles in general; our current cures are too weak and slow-casting to be of much benefit.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;8. Lack of undead &lt;SPAN COLOR: FONT-FAMILY: New ?Times 12pt; Roman?? **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN COLOR: FONT-FAMILY: New ?Times 12pt; Roman?? **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff00ff&gt;Paladin - List Update scheduled for&amp;nbsp;01/07/05&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1. Better Mitigation - &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;This will most likely be evaluated as part of the class Re-Envision process.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;There is a too large a disparity between warriors and paladins when it comes to tanking. A warrior in gear inferior to a paladin can and does tank better then the paladin even outside of discipline. While this issue only truly shows itself in high end group content the concern is that this trend will quickly leave paladins in the same straights that warriors were in when they did not have sufficient agro to make them desirable for group content. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;With more and more mobs either higher in level or flagged stun immune we take the full brunt of the damage the mob can dish out. We have no way of mitigating or avoiding any of this damage other then the same AA’s that every single class in the game gets. This issue is for all levels but becomes more of an issue the higher you progress. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;The tanking between a paladin vs all other classes is not great enough. Mitigation should be based on Armor and Defense. A monk or ranger (for example, not picking on them) should NOT be as effective as a Warrior or Knight of similar AC/HP.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2. Better Healing - &lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: New ?Times 12pt; Roman?? red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;This will most likely be evaluated as part of the class Re-Envision process.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: New ?Times 12pt; Roman?? red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;FONT face="Century Gothic"&gt;&lt;B normal? **SMURF**?mso-bidi-font-weight:&gt;&lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: Verdana? red; **SMURF**?COLOR:&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;The recast timer on the level 65 and higher spells needs to be looked at. They do not allow for a situation where fast cast heals are needed. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;To get around the recast timer, a lot of paladins are loading 2 or more heals which further reduces our role as a utility player by reducing the number of spell gems available to us. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;It is generally felt that our base heals do not heal for enough to play a role as emergency medic. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Our heal-over-time spells can be very useful but the base heal value per tick is too low and if they get overwritten are a waste of mana. The grey out, being able to cast another spell right away, as well as the recast timer are restrictive. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;During battle paladins, even when tanking, are required to heal their group-mates as well as ourselves. To do this we need to target fast, cast the heal without interruption or fizzle and get back to the correct mob, which their can be multiple. During these times we fizzle and are interrupted too often, and the new AA to continue casting through stuns seems to not be working properly. What this comes down to is we need healing looked at for when we are also tanking. &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;3. Stuns - &lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: New ?Times 12pt; Roman?? red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff00ff&gt;&lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: New ?Times 12pt; Roman?? red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Long cast time as well as the recast timer needs to be looked at. Because we are casting during battle, we need very fast casting spells or we are interrupted too often, and the long recast means that we have to mem 3 or 4 stuns to overcome agro and recast issues. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Divine Stun needs to have it’s level limit looked at because of the level limit problems with trash mobs in group content. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Ancient: Force of Chaos, needs to have it’s level limit looked at because of the level limit problems with trash mobs in group content as well as access to it. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;If a caster gets agro and gets hit even once he has low life agro, that low life agro is higher then stun agro, therefore we can’t get the mob off of the caster fast enough. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Agro generation created by different stuns needs to be looked at. It is thought that higher levels stuns should have more agro then lower level stuns.&amp;nbsp; &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;This is not intentional and is currently being looked into by our QA Department&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;4. Void Discipline - &lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: New ?Times 12pt; Roman?? red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: New ?Times 12pt; Roman?? red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Every melee class EXCEPT for knights has an avoidance disc. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Knights are the only tank classes that do not have this type of disc. Warriors (heavy raid tank) have Furious/Fortitude, and Rangers (light tank) have Weaponshield. On short fights where the damage intake is high, this gives either of these classes an unbelievable advantage to succeed. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;This type of disc is not unique to one or two classes. It is unique that knights do not already have this. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;It would make sense that since this is not a unique warrior-only type disc, that this ability should be shared from the parent class of both knight classes. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;5. Current Disciplines - &lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: New ?Times 12pt; Roman?? red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: New ?Times 12pt; Roman?? red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Paladins like all hybreds have four disciplines, two are shared and two of our own. The two disciplines that are shared are Resistant and Fearless.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;!--EZCODE BOLD START--&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Resistant&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;!--EZCODE BOLD END--&gt;: This discipline lasts for 5 minutes, and has a base reuse time of 1 hour and raises all resists by 20.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The time on this discipline seems correct, it gives plenty of time to pop it at the beginning of a fight and either get full use out of it or more likely get the mob dead before it drops. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The amount of resist when compared to the mobs today does not seem to scale. It is felt that the increase in resists is too low or needs to be graduated.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Fearless&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;!--EZCODE BOLD END--&gt;: Immunity to "Fear" and all spells that cause "fear". This discipline lasts for 1 minute, and has a base reuse time of 1 hour. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The biggest issue here is that after you purchase Fear Resistance for 12 AA's and Fearless for another 6 AA's this discipline is useless.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Our two unique disciplines are Santification and Holyforge.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;!--EZCODE BOLD START--&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Sanctification&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;!--EZCODE BOLD END--&gt;: Immunity to most types of harmful spells. This discipline lasts for 18 seconds, and has a base reuse time of 72 minutes.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;It does not last long enough. The only possible way it can be used is on a pull, otherwise we would never know when to use it. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;It does not block all harmful spells, and the ones we need it most on are irresistable, and sanctification does not block irresistable spells.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;!--EZCODE BOLD START--&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Holyforge&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;!--EZCODE BOLD END--&gt;: Critical Hits and Crippling Blows versus undead with an increased probability of going off. This discipline lasts for 5 minutes, and has a base reuse time of 72 minutes. The description for a paladin needs to be noted here. A direct quote from the EQLive website says this. "Paladins are the greatest force against undead."&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;It is the only discipline that when given at level 55 does not work. It can if very lucky cause between 1-3 crits in 5 minutes, but this is not considered working.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;An increase as put in during the 12/15 update, I am trying to confirm whether this is working correctly&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Holy Forge is completely unreliable. It is a random number on top of a random number and is way too streaky.&lt;/SPAN&gt; &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;To max out our time in Holyforge you must have purchased, including the 6 required in Genereal, Combat Fury3, Slay Undead3, Double Ripostle3, Flash of Steel3, Knight's Advantage3, Speed of the Knight3, and Planar Power5 for 305 dex. Thats a total of 85 AA's and wielding a two hander in order to fully maximize this disc. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Fury of the Ages does not effect the amount of crits in Holyforge &lt;/SPAN&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Cleave does not stack with Holyforge according to Lucy.&lt;/SPAN&gt; &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Even after 85 AA's spent, the random number generator is so wild it still renders Holy Forge as unreliable. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;No other disc in the game is retricted to such a small amount of game content. As per the class description, Paladins should be the masters of undead, such as Rangers are the masters of Archery. With 85 AA's spent, Holy Forge should provide the same reliable DPS against undead as a Ranger under Trueshot disc, as well as increased DPS versus live mobs without the ability to slay.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;6. Power versus the undead - &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: New ?Times 12pt; Roman?? red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Solution: tied to both Sks and Pallies. Change one of their discs to increase damage mitigation and/or prevent spell damage when used with shields in off hand for short durations. Also add or tweak current AAs to allow for more damage mitigation /ac only when equipping a shield in the off hand. Perhaps allow shields some way to block riposte damage&amp;nbsp;through an AA ability.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;LI&gt;During battle paladins, even when tanking, are required to heal their group-mates as well as ourselves. To do this we need to target fast, cast the heal without interruption or fizzle and get back to the correct mob, which their can be multiple. During these times we fizzle and are interrupted too often, and the new AA to continue casting through stuns seems to not be working properly. What this comes down to is we need healing looked at for when we are also tanking. &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;

&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Long cast time as well as the recast timer needs to be looked at. Because we are casting during battle, we need very fast casting spells or we are interrupted too often, and the long recast means that we have to mem 3 or 4 stuns to overcome agro and recast issues. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Divine Stun needs to have it’s level limit looked at because of the level limit problems with trash mobs in group content. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Ancient: Force of Chaos, needs to have it’s level limit looked at because of the level limit problems with trash mobs in group content as well as access to it. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;If a caster gets agro and gets hit even once he has low life agro, that low life agro is higher then stun agro, therefore we can’t get the mob off of the caster fast enough. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Agro generation created by different stuns needs to be looked at. It is thought that higher levels stuns should have more agro then lower level stuns.&amp;nbsp; &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;This is not intentional and is currently being looked into by our QA Department&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;

&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Every melee class EXCEPT for knights has an avoidance disc. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Knights are the only tank classes that do not have this type of disc. Warriors (heavy raid tank) have Furious/Fortitude, and Rangers (light tank) have Weaponshield. On short fights where the damage intake is high, this gives either of these classes an unbelievable advantage to succeed. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;This type of disc is not unique to one or two classes. It is unique that knights do not already have this. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;It would make sense that since this is not a unique warrior-only type disc, that this ability should be shared from the parent class of both knight classes. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;5. Current Disciplines - &lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: red; COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: Roman??

&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Paladins like all hybreds have four disciplines, two are shared and two of our own. The two disciplines that are shared are Resistant and Fearless.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;!--EZCODE BOLD START--&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Resistant&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;!--EZCODE BOLD END--&gt;: This discipline lasts for 5 minutes, and has a base reuse time of 1 hour and raises all resists by 20.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The time on this discipline seems correct, it gives plenty of time to pop it at the beginning of a fight and either get full use out of it or more likely get the mob dead before it drops. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The amount of resist when compared to the mobs today does not seem to scale. It is felt that the increase in resists is too low or needs to be graduated.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Fearless&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;!--EZCODE BOLD END--&gt;: Immunity to "Fear" and all spells that cause "fear". This discipline lasts for 1 minute, and has a base reuse time of 1 hour. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The biggest issue here is that after you purchase Fear Resistance for 12 AA's and Fearless for another 6 AA's this discipline is useless.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Our two unique disciplines are Santification and Holyforge.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;!--EZCODE BOLD START--&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Sanctification&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;!--EZCODE BOLD END--&gt;: Immunity to most types of harmful spells. This discipline lasts for 18 seconds, and has a base reuse time of 72 minutes.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;It does not last long enough. The only possible way it can be used is on a pull, otherwise we would never know when to use it. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;It does not block all harmful spells, and the ones we need it most on are irresistable, and sanctification does not block irresistable spells.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;!--EZCODE BOLD START--&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Holyforge&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;!--EZCODE BOLD END--&gt;: Critical Hits and Crippling Blows versus undead with an increased probability of going off. This discipline lasts for 5 minutes, and has a base reuse time of 72 minutes. The description for a paladin needs to be noted here. A direct quote from the EQLive website says this. "Paladins are the greatest force against undead."&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;It is the only discipline that when given at level 55 does not work. It can if very lucky cause between 1-3 crits in 5 minutes, but this is not considered working.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;An increase as put in during the 12/15 update, I am trying to confirm whether this is working correctly&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Holy Forge is completely unreliable. It is a random number on top of a random number and is way too streaky.&lt;/SPAN&gt; &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;To max out our time in Holyforge you must have purchased, including the 6 required in Genereal, Combat Fury3, Slay Undead3, Double Ripostle3, Flash of Steel3, Knight's Advantage3, Speed of the Knight3, and Planar Power5 for 305 dex. Thats a total of 85 AA's and wielding a two hander in order to fully maximize this disc. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Fury of the Ages does not effect the amount of crits in Holyforge &lt;/SPAN&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Cleave does not stack with Holyforge according to Lucy.&lt;/SPAN&gt; &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Even after 85 AA's spent, the random number generator is so wild it still renders Holy Forge as unreliable. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;No other disc in the game is retricted to such a small amount of game content. As per the class description, Paladins should be the masters of undead, such as Rangers are the masters of Archery. With 85 AA's spent, Holy Forge should provide the same reliable DPS against undead as a Ranger under Trueshot disc, as well as increased DPS versus live mobs without the ability to slay.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;6. Power versus the undead - &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: red; COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: Roman?? New ?Times 12pt;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;FONT face="Century Gothic"&gt;&lt;B **SMURF**?mso-bidi-font-weight: normal?&gt;&lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: Verdana? red; **SMURF**?COLOR:&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This issue revolves solely around the issue of our class description where it states that paladins are the greatest force against the undead. It is generally agreed that this power is in the form of DPS rather then tanking, though both are thought to have a strong role playing basis. Therefore this definition will deal mostly with our ability to damage an undead mob. Issue&amp;nbsp;8 is in regards to lack of undead so I will not go into that here except to say that the lack of undead does effect our power versus them since if their are no undead we have no power and if everything was undead we would be way overpowered.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;The biggest reason we lack power versus undead is felt to be the RNG. As a slayer of undead we are too reliant on&amp;nbsp;this random factor. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;We should have DPS greater then a warrior outside of Holyforge and with Slay Undead 3. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Inside of Holyforge this power should be increased to the point that we come close to a rogue in sustained DPS during this discipline. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;When in areas with mixed mobs, live and undead, it is not efficient to use our undead proc, instead we must use a lesser proc that works on all mobs. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;We have the weakest direct damage spells versus undead then any other class.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;7. Shields - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Currently being evaluated&lt;/SPAN&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Solution: tied to both Sks and Pallies. Change one of their discs to increase damage mitigation and/or prevent spell damage when used with shields in off hand for short durations. Also add or tweak current AAs to allow for more damage mitigation /ac only when equipping a shield in the off hand. Perhaps allow shields some way to block riposte damage&amp;nbsp;through an AA ability.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;8. Lack of undead - &lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: red; COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: Roman??

&lt;P&gt;Planes of power saw a dearth of undead in the expansion. Discord has almost NO undead whatsoever that I have seen from start through Ikkinz and I expect more of the same from Omens. Why give us a power focus and then give us NOTHING to utilize it on? An advantage is NOT an advantage if it is functioanlly useless.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;9. Lull - &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;This is something that will improve in future expansions.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Disappears totally at level 55&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;10. Lay on Hands - &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;PLEASE make it impossible to blow Lay Hands on a corpse or a mob!!!! - &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Is this still an issue with the last update?&amp;nbsp; I know QA was checking into it however I have not heard anything back, I am wondering if you have noticed a change.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;And while you're at it, make it possible to see&amp;nbsp;how long before it's available like with an aability. &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;This is being considered&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff00ff&gt;Paladin - List Update scheduled for&amp;nbsp;12/03/04 (LATE)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1. Better Mitigation - &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Currently being evaluated&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;There is a too large a disparity between warriors and paladins when it comes to tanking. A warrior in gear inferior to a paladin can and does tank better then the paladin even outside of discipline. While this issue only truly shows itself in high end group content the concern is that this trend will quickly leave paladins in the same straights that warriors were in when they did not have sufficient agro to make them desirable for group content. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;With more and more mobs either higher in level or flagged stun immune we take the full brunt of the damage the mob can dish out. We have no way of mitigating or avoiding any of this damage other then the same AA’s that every single class in the game gets. This issue is for all levels but becomes more of an issue the higher you progress. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;The tanking between a paladin vs all other classes is not great enough. Mitigation should be based on Armor and Defense. A monk or ranger (for example, not picking on them) should NOT be as effective as a Warrior or Knight of similar AC/HP.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2. Better Healing - &lt;SPAN COLOR: FONT-FAMILY: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: New ?Times 12pt; Roman?? red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

They do not allow for a situation where fast cast heals are needed. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;To get around the recast timer, a lot of paladins are loading 2 or more heals which further reduces our role as a utility player by reducing the number of spell gems available to us. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;It is generally felt that our base heals do not heal for enough to play a role as emergency medic. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Our heal-over-time spells can be very useful but the base heal value per tick is too low and if they get overwritten are a waste of mana. The grey out, being able to cast another spell right away, as well as the recast timer are restrictive. &#xD;

It is generally agreed that this power is in the form of DPS rather then tanking, though both are thought to have a strong role playing basis. Therefore this definition will deal mostly with our ability to damage an undead mob. Issue&amp;nbsp;8 is in regards to lack of undead so I will not go into that here except to say that the lack of undead does effect our power versus them since if their are no undead we have no power and if everything was undead we would be way overpowered.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;The biggest reason we lack power versus undead is felt to be the RNG. As a slayer of undead we are too reliant on&amp;nbsp;this random factor. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;We should have DPS greater then a warrior outside of Holyforge and with Slay Undead 3. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Inside of Holyforge this power should be increased to the point that we come close to a rogue in sustained DPS during this discipline. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;When in areas with mixed mobs, live and undead, it is not efficient to use our undead proc, instead we must use a lesser proc that works on all mobs. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;We have the weakest direct damage spells versus undead then any other class.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Solution: tied to both Sks and Pallies. Change one of their discs to increase damage mitigation and/or prevent spell damage when used with shields in off hand for short durations. Also add or tweak current AAs to allow for more damage mitigation /ac only when equipping a shield in the off hand. Perhaps allow shields some way to block riposte damage&amp;nbsp;through an AA ability.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff00ff&gt;Paladin - List Update scheduled for&amp;nbsp;11/19/04&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN #cccccc; FONT-FAMILY: COLOR: Roman?? 12pt; ?Times New **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE:&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff00ff&gt;Please note that there isn't any new development feedback in this update.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1. Better Mitigation - &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Currently being evaluated&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;There is a too large a disparity between warriors and paladins when it comes to tanking. A warrior in gear inferior to a paladin can and does tank better then the paladin even outside of discipline. While this issue only truly shows itself in high end group content the concern is that this trend will quickly leave paladins in the same straights that warriors were in when they did not have sufficient agro to make them desirable for group content. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;With more and more mobs either higher in level or flagged stun immune we take the full brunt of the damage the mob can dish out. We have no way of mitigating or avoiding any of this damage other then the same AA’s that every single class in the game gets. This issue is for all levels but becomes more of an issue the higher you progress. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;The tanking between a paladin vs all other classes is not great enough. Mitigation should be based on Armor and Defense. A monk or ranger (for example, not picking on them) should NOT be as effective as a Warrior or Knight of similar AC/HP.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2. Better Healing - &lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: COLOR: Roman?? 12pt; ?Times New **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: COLOR: Roman?? 12pt; ?Times New **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;FONT face="Century Gothic"&gt;&lt;B normal? **SMURF**?mso-bidi-font-weight:&gt;&lt;SPAN Verdana? FONT-FAMILY: red; **SMURF**?COLOR:&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;The recast timer on the level 65 and higher spells needs to be looked at. They do not allow for a situation where fast cast heals are needed. &lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;To get around the recast timer, a lot of paladins are loading 2 or more heals which further reduces our role as a utility player by reducing the number of spell gems available to us. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;It is generally felt that our base heals do not heal for enough to play a role as emergency medic. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Our heal-over-time spells can be very useful but the base heal value per tick is too low and if they get overwritten are a waste of mana. The grey out, being able to cast another spell right away, as well as the recast timer are restrictive. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;During battle paladins, even when tanking, are required to heal their group-mates as well as ourselves. To do this we need to target fast, cast the heal without interruption or fizzle and get back to the correct mob, which their can be multiple. During these times we fizzle and are interrupted too often, and the new AA to continue casting through stuns seems to not be working properly. What this comes down to is we need healing looked at for when we are also tanking. &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;3. Stuns - &lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: COLOR: Roman?? 12pt; ?Times New **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff00ff&gt;&lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: COLOR: Roman?? 12pt; ?Times New **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Long cast time as well as the recast timer needs to be looked at. Because we are casting during battle, we need very fast casting spells or we are interrupted too often, and the long recast means that we have to mem 3 or 4 stuns to overcome agro and recast issues. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Divine Stun needs to have it’s level limit looked at because of the level limit problems with trash mobs in group content. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Ancient: Force of Chaos, needs to have it’s level limit looked at because of the level limit problems with trash mobs in group content as well as access to it. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;If a caster gets agro and gets hit even once he has low life agro, that low life agro is higher then stun agro, therefore we can’t get the mob off of the caster fast enough. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Agro generation created by different stuns needs to be looked at. It is thought that higher levels stuns should have more agro then lower level stuns.&amp;nbsp; &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;This is not intentional and is currently being looked into by our QA Department&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;4. Void Discipline - &lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: COLOR: Roman?? 12pt; ?Times New **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: COLOR: Roman?? 12pt; ?Times New **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Every melee class EXCEPT for knights has an avoidance disc. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Knights are the only tank classes that do not have this type of disc. Warriors (heavy raid tank) have Furious/Fortitude, and Rangers (light tank) have Weaponshield. On short fights where the damage intake is high, this gives either of these classes an unbelievable advantage to succeed. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;This type of disc is not unique to one or two classes. It is unique that knights do not already have this. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;It would make sense that since this is not a unique warrior-only type disc, that this ability should be shared from the parent class of both knight classes. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;5. Current Disciplines - &lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: COLOR: Roman?? 12pt; ?Times New **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: COLOR: Roman?? 12pt; ?Times New **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Paladins like all hybreds have four disciplines, two are shared and two of our own. The two disciplines that are shared are Resistant and Fearless.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;!--EZCODE BOLD START--&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Resistant&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;!--EZCODE BOLD END--&gt;: This discipline lasts for 5 minutes, and has a base reuse time of 1 hour and raises all resists by 20.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The time on this discipline seems correct, it gives plenty of time to pop it at the beginning of a fight and either get full use out of it or more likely get the mob dead before it drops. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The amount of resist when compared to the mobs today does not seem to scale. It is felt that the increase in resists is too low or needs to be graduated.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Fearless&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;!--EZCODE BOLD END--&gt;: Immunity to "Fear" and all spells that cause "fear". This discipline lasts for 1 minute, and has a base reuse time of 1 hour. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The biggest issue here is that after you purchase Fear Resistance for 12 AA's and Fearless for another 6 AA's this discipline is useless.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Our two unique disciplines are Santification and Holyforge.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;!--EZCODE BOLD START--&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Sanctification&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;!--EZCODE BOLD END--&gt;: Immunity to most types of harmful spells. This discipline lasts for 18 seconds, and has a base reuse time of 72 minutes.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;It does not last long enough. The only possible way it can be used is on a pull, otherwise we would never know when to use it. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;It does not block all harmful spells, and the ones we need it most on are irresistable, and sanctification does not block irresistable spells.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;!--EZCODE BOLD START--&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Holyforge&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;!--EZCODE BOLD END--&gt;: Critical Hits and Crippling Blows versus undead with an increased probability of going off. This discipline lasts for 5 minutes, and has a base reuse time of 72 minutes. The description for a paladin needs to be noted here. A direct quote from the EQLive website says this. "Paladins are the greatest force against undead."&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;It is the only discipline that when given at level 55 does not work. It can if very lucky cause between 1-3 crits in 5 minutes, but this is not considered working.&lt;/SPAN&gt; &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Holy Forge is completely unreliable. It is a random number on top of a random number and is way too streaky.&lt;/SPAN&gt; &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;To max out our time in Holyforge you must have purchased, including the 6 required in Genereal, Combat Fury3, Slay Undead3, Double Ripostle3, Flash of Steel3, Knight's Advantage3, Speed of the Knight3, and Planar Power5 for 305 dex. Thats a total of 85 AA's and wielding a two hander in order to fully maximize this disc. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Fury of the Ages does not effect the amount of crits in Holyforge &lt;/SPAN&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Cleave does not stack with Holyforge according to Lucy.&lt;/SPAN&gt; &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Even after 85 AA's spent, the random number generator is so wild it still renders Holy Forge as unreliable. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;No other disc in the game is retricted to such a small amount of game content. As per the class description, Paladins should be the masters of undead, such as Rangers are the masters of Archery. With 85 AA's spent, Holy Forge should provide the same reliable DPS against undead as a Ranger under Trueshot disc, as well as increased DPS versus live mobs without the ability to slay.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&#xD;

Power versus the undead - &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: COLOR: Roman?? 12pt; ?Times New **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

Stuns - &lt;SPAN COLOR: FONT-FAMILY: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: New ?Times 12pt; Roman?? red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff00ff&gt;&lt;SPAN COLOR: FONT-FAMILY: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: New ?Times 12pt; Roman?? red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Long cast time as well as the recast timer needs to be looked at. Because we are casting during battle, we need very fast casting spells or we are interrupted too often, and the long recast means that we have to mem 3 or 4 stuns to overcome agro and recast issues. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Divine Stun needs to have it’s level limit looked at because of the level limit problems with trash mobs in group content. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Ancient: Force of Chaos, needs to have it’s level limit looked at because of the level limit problems with trash mobs in group content as well as access to it. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;If a caster gets agro and gets hit even once he has low life agro, that low life agro is higher then stun agro, therefore we can’t get the mob off of the caster fast enough. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Agro generation created by different stuns needs to be looked at. It is thought that higher levels stuns should have more agro then lower level stuns.&amp;nbsp; &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;This is not intentional and is currently being looked into by our QA Department&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;4. Void Discipline - &lt;SPAN COLOR: FONT-FAMILY: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: New ?Times 12pt; Roman?? red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN COLOR: FONT-FAMILY: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: New ?Times 12pt; Roman?? red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Every melee class EXCEPT for knights has an avoidance disc. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Knights are the only tank classes that do not have this type of disc. Warriors (heavy raid tank) have Furious/Fortitude, and Rangers (light tank) have Weaponshield. On short fights where the damage intake is high, this gives either of these classes an unbelievable advantage to succeed. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;This type of disc is not unique to one or two classes. It is unique that knights do not already have this. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;It would make sense that since this is not a unique warrior-only type disc, that this ability should be shared from the parent class of both knight classes. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;5. Current Disciplines - &lt;SPAN COLOR: FONT-FAMILY: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: New ?Times 12pt; Roman?? red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN COLOR: FONT-FAMILY: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: New ?Times 12pt; Roman?? red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Paladins like all hybreds have four disciplines, two are shared and two of our own. The two disciplines that are shared are Resistant and Fearless.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;!--EZCODE BOLD START--&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Resistant&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;!--EZCODE BOLD END--&gt;: This discipline lasts for 5 minutes, and has a base reuse time of 1 hour and raises all resists by 20.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The time on this discipline seems correct, it gives plenty of time to pop it at the beginning of a fight and either get full use out of it or more likely get the mob dead before it drops. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The amount of resist when compared to the mobs today does not seem to scale. It is felt that the increase in resists is too low or needs to be graduated.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Fearless&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;!--EZCODE BOLD END--&gt;: Immunity to "Fear" and all spells that cause "fear". This discipline lasts for 1 minute, and has a base reuse time of 1 hour. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The biggest issue here is that after you purchase Fear Resistance for 12 AA's and Fearless for another 6 AA's this discipline is useless.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Our two unique disciplines are Santification and Holyforge.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;!--EZCODE BOLD START--&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Sanctification&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;!--EZCODE BOLD END--&gt;: Immunity to most types of harmful spells. This discipline lasts for 18 seconds, and has a base reuse time of 72 minutes.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;It does not last long enough. The only possible way it can be used is on a pull, otherwise we would never know when to use it. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;It does not block all harmful spells, and the ones we need it most on are irresistable, and sanctification does not block irresistable spells.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;!--EZCODE BOLD START--&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Holyforge&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;!--EZCODE BOLD END--&gt;: Critical Hits and Crippling Blows versus undead with an increased probability of going off. This discipline lasts for 5 minutes, and has a base reuse time of 72 minutes. The description for a paladin needs to be noted here. A direct quote from the EQLive website says this. "Paladins are the greatest force against undead."&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;It is the only discipline that when given at level 55 does not work. It can if very lucky cause between 1-3 crits in 5 minutes, but this is not considered working.&lt;/SPAN&gt; &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Holy Forge is completely unreliable. It is a random number on top of a random number and is way too streaky.&lt;/SPAN&gt; &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;To max out our time in Holyforge you must have purchased, including the 6 required in Genereal, Combat Fury3, Slay Undead3, Double Ripostle3, Flash of Steel3, Knight's Advantage3, Speed of the Knight3, and Planar Power5 for 305 dex. Thats a total of 85 AA's and wielding a two hander in order to fully maximize this disc. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Fury of the Ages does not effect the amount of crits in Holyforge &lt;/SPAN&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Cleave does not stack with Holyforge according to Lucy.&lt;/SPAN&gt; &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Even after 85 AA's spent, the random number generator is so wild it still renders Holy Forge as unreliable. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;No other disc in the game is retricted to such a small amount of game content. As per the class description, Paladins should be the masters of undead, such as Rangers are the masters of Archery. With 85 AA's spent, Holy Forge should provide the same reliable DPS against undead as a Ranger under Trueshot disc, as well as increased DPS versus live mobs without the ability to slay.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;6. Power versus the undead - &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN COLOR: FONT-FAMILY: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: New ?Times 12pt; Roman?? red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;FONT face="Century Gothic"&gt;&lt;B normal? **SMURF**?mso-bidi-font-weight:&gt;&lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: Verdana? red; **SMURF**?COLOR:&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This issue revolves solely around the issue of our class description where it states that paladins are the greatest force against the undead. It is generally agreed that this power is in the form of DPS rather then tanking, though both are thought to have a strong role playing basis. Therefore this definition will deal mostly with our ability to damage an undead mob. Issue&amp;nbsp;8 is in regards to lack of undead so I will not go into that here except to say that the lack of undead does effect our power versus them since if their are no undead we have no power and if everything was undead we would be way overpowered.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;The biggest reason we lack power versus undead is felt to be the RNG. As a slayer of undead we are too reliant on&amp;nbsp;this random factor. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;We should have DPS greater then a warrior outside of Holyforge and with Slay Undead 3. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Inside of Holyforge this power should be increased to the point that we come close to a rogue in sustained DPS during this discipline. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;When in areas with mixed mobs, live and undead, it is not efficient to use our undead proc, instead we must use a lesser proc that works on all mobs. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;We have the weakest direct damage spells versus undead then any other class.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;7. Shields - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Currently being evaluated&lt;/SPAN&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Solution: tied to both Sks and Pallies. Change one of their discs to increase damage mitigation and/or prevent spell damage when used with shields in off hand for short durations. Also add or tweak current AAs to allow for more damage mitigation /ac only when equipping a shield in the off hand. Perhaps allow shields some way to block riposte damage&amp;nbsp;through an AA ability.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;8. Lack of undead - &lt;SPAN COLOR: FONT-FAMILY: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: New ?Times 12pt; Roman?? red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN COLOR: FONT-FAMILY: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: New ?Times 12pt; Roman?? red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Planes of power saw a dearth of undead in the expansion. Discord has almost NO undead whatsoever that I have seen from start through Ikkinz and I expect more of the same from Omens. Why give us a power focus and then give us NOTHING to utilize it on? An advantage is NOT an advantage if it is functioanlly useless.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;9. Lull - &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;This is something that will improve in future expansions.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Disappears totally at level 55&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;10. Lay on Hands - &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;PLEASE make it impossible to blow Lay Hands on a corpse or a mob!!!! - &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;A fix for this issue is going to Test server soon [TM]&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;And while you're at it, make it possible to see&amp;nbsp;how long before it's available like with an aability. &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;This is being considered&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff00ff&gt;Paladin - List Update scheduled for&amp;nbsp;10/22/04&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1. Better Mitigation - &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Currently being evaluated&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;There is a too large a disparity between warriors and paladins when it comes to tanking. A warrior in gear inferior to a paladin can and does tank better then the paladin even outside of discipline. While this issue only truly shows itself in high end group content the concern is that this trend will quickly leave paladins in the same straights that warriors were in when they did not have sufficient agro to make them desirable for group content. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;With more and more mobs either higher in level or flagged stun immune we take the full brunt of the damage the mob can dish out. We have no way of mitigating or avoiding any of this damage other then the same AA’s that every single class in the game gets. This issue is for all levels but becomes more of an issue the higher you progress. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;The tanking between a paladin vs all other classes is not great enough. Mitigation should be based on Armor and Defense. A monk or ranger (for example, not picking on them) should NOT be as effective as a Warrior or Knight of similar AC/HP.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2. Better Healing - &lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: red; COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: Roman?? New ?Times 12pt;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: red; COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: Roman?? New ?Times 12pt;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;FONT face="Century Gothic"&gt;&lt;B **SMURF**?mso-bidi-font-weight: normal?&gt;&lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: Verdana? red; **SMURF**?COLOR:&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;The recast timer on the level 65 and higher spells needs to be looked at. They do not allow for a situation where fast cast heals are needed. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;To get around the recast timer, a lot of paladins are loading 2 or more heals which further reduces our role as a utility player by reducing the number of spell gems available to us. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;It is generally felt that our base heals do not heal for enough to play a role as emergency medic. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Our heal-over-time spells can be very useful but the base heal value per tick is too low and if they get overwritten are a waste of mana. The grey out, being able to cast another spell right away, as well as the recast timer are restrictive. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;During battle paladins, even when tanking, are required to heal their group-mates as well as ourselves. To do this we need to target fast, cast the heal without interruption or fizzle and get back to the correct mob, which their can be multiple. During these times we fizzle and are interrupted too often, and the new AA to continue casting through stuns seems to not be working properly. What this comes down to is we need healing looked at for when we are also tanking. &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;3. Stuns - &lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: red; COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: Roman??

&lt;LI&gt;When in areas with mixed mobs, live and undead, it is not efficient to use our undead proc, instead we must use a lesser proc that works on all mobs. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;We have the weakest direct damage spells versus undead then any other class.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Solution: tied to both Sks and Pallies. Change one of their discs to increase damage mitigation and/or prevent spell damage when used with shields in off hand for short durations. Also add or tweak current AAs to allow for more damage mitigation /ac only when equipping a shield in the off hand.

&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff00ff&gt;Paladin - List Update scheduled for&amp;nbsp;10/8/04&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff00ff&gt;Please note that there isn't any new development feedback on this list.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1. Better Mitigation - &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Currently being evaluated&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;There is a too large a disparity between warriors and paladins when it comes to tanking. A warrior in gear inferior to a paladin can and does tank better then the paladin even outside of discipline. While this issue only truly shows itself in high end group content the concern is that this trend will quickly leave paladins in the same straights that warriors were in when they did not have sufficient agro to make them desirable for group content. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;With more and more mobs either higher in level or flagged stun immune we take the full brunt of the damage the mob can dish out. We have no way of mitigating or avoiding any of this damage other then the same AA’s that every single class in the game gets. This issue is for all levels but becomes more of an issue the higher you progress. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;The tanking between a paladin vs all other classes is not great enough. Mitigation should be based on Armor and Defense. A monk or ranger (for example, not picking on them) should NOT be as effective as a Warrior or Knight of similar AC/HP.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2. Better Healing - &lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: red; COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: Roman?? New ?Times 12pt;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: red; COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: Roman?? New ?Times 12pt;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;FONT face="Century Gothic"&gt;&lt;B **SMURF**?mso-bidi-font-weight: normal?&gt;&lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: Verdana? red; **SMURF**?COLOR:&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;The recast timer on the level 65 and higher spells needs to be looked at. They do not allow for a situation where fast cast heals are needed. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;To get around the recast timer, a lot of paladins are loading 2 or more heals which further reduces our role as a utility player by reducing the number of spell gems available to us. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;It is generally felt that our base heals do not heal for enough to play a role as emergency medic. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Our heal-over-time spells can be very useful but the base heal value per tick is too low and if they get overwritten are a waste of mana. The grey out, being able to cast another spell right away, as well as the recast timer are restrictive. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;During battle paladins, even when tanking, are required to heal their group-mates as well as ourselves. To do this we need to target fast, cast the heal without interruption or fizzle and get back to the correct mob, which their can be multiple. During these times we fizzle and are interrupted too often, and the new AA to continue casting through stuns seems to not be working properly. What this comes down to is we need healing looked at for when we are also tanking. &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;3. Stuns - &lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: red; COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: Roman?? New ?Times 12pt;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff00ff&gt;&lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: red; COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: Roman?? New ?Times 12pt;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Long cast time as well as the recast timer needs to be looked at. Because we are casting during battle, we need very fast casting spells or we are interrupted too often, and the long recast means that we have to mem 3 or 4 stuns to overcome agro and recast issues. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Divine Stun needs to have it’s level limit looked at because of the level limit problems with trash mobs in group content. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Ancient: Force of Chaos, needs to have it’s level limit looked at because of the level limit problems with trash mobs in group content as well as access to it. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;If a caster gets agro and gets hit even once he has low life agro, that low life agro is higher then stun agro, therefore we can’t get the mob off of the caster fast enough. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Agro generation created by different stuns needs to be looked at. It is thought that higher levels stuns should have more agro then lower level stuns.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;4. Void Discipline - &lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: red; COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: Roman?? New ?Times 12pt;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: red; COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: Roman?? New ?Times 12pt;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Every melee class EXCEPT for knights has an avoidance disc. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Knights are the only tank classes that do not have this type of disc. Warriors (heavy raid tank) have Furious/Fortitude, and Rangers (light tank) have Weaponshield. On short fights where the damage intake is high, this gives either of these classes an unbelievable advantage to succeed. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;This type of disc is not unique to one or two classes. It is unique that knights do not already have this. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;It would make sense that since this is not a unique warrior-only type disc, that this ability should be shared from the parent class of both knight classes. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;5. Current Disciplines - &lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: red; COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: Roman?? New ?Times 12pt;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: red; COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: Roman?? New ?Times 12pt;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Paladins like all hybreds have four disciplines, two are shared and two of our own. The two disciplines that are shared are Resistant and Fearless.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;!--EZCODE BOLD START--&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Resistant&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;!--EZCODE BOLD END--&gt;: This discipline lasts for 5 minutes, and has a base reuse time of 1 hour and raises all resists by 20.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The time on this discipline seems correct, it gives plenty of time to pop it at the beginning of a fight and either get full use out of it or more likely get the mob dead before it drops. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The amount of resist when compared to the mobs today does not seem to scale. It is felt that the increase in resists is too low or needs to be graduated.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Fearless&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;!--EZCODE BOLD END--&gt;: Immunity to "Fear" and all spells that cause "fear". This discipline lasts for 1 minute, and has a base reuse time of 1 hour. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The biggest issue here is that after you purchase Fear Resistance for 12 AA's and Fearless for another 6 AA's this discipline is useless.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Our two unique disciplines are Santification and Holyforge.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;!--EZCODE BOLD START--&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Sanctification&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;!--EZCODE BOLD END--&gt;: Immunity to most types of harmful spells. This discipline lasts for 18 seconds, and has a base reuse time of 72 minutes.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;It does not last long enough. The only possible way it can be used is on a pull, otherwise we would never know when to use it. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;It does not block all harmful spells, and the ones we need it most on are irresistable, and sanctification does not block irresistable spells.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;!--EZCODE BOLD START--&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Holyforge&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;!--EZCODE BOLD END--&gt;: Critical Hits and Crippling Blows versus undead with an increased probability of going off. This discipline lasts for 5 minutes, and has a base reuse time of 72 minutes. The description for a paladin needs to be noted here. A direct quote from the EQLive website says this. "Paladins are the greatest force against undead."&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;It is the only discipline that when given at level 55 does not work. It can if very lucky cause between 1-3 crits in 5 minutes, but this is not considered working.&lt;/SPAN&gt; &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Holy Forge is completely unreliable. It is a random number on top of a random number and is way too streaky.&lt;/SPAN&gt; &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;To max out our time in Holyforge you must have purchased, including the 6 required in Genereal, Combat Fury3, Slay Undead3, Double Ripostle3, Flash of Steel3, Knight's Advantage3, Speed of the Knight3, and Planar Power5 for 305 dex. Thats a total of 85 AA's and wielding a two hander in order to fully maximize this disc. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Fury of the Ages does not effect the amount of crits in Holyforge &lt;/SPAN&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Cleave does not stack with Holyforge according to Lucy.&lt;/SPAN&gt; &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Even after 85 AA's spent, the random number generator is so wild it still renders Holy Forge as unreliable. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;No other disc in the game is retricted to such a small amount of game content. As per the class description, Paladins should be the masters of undead, such as Rangers are the masters of Archery. With 85 AA's spent, Holy Forge should provide the same reliable DPS against undead as a Ranger under Trueshot disc, as well as increased DPS versus live mobs without the ability to slay.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;6. Power versus the undead - &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: red; COLOR: **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: Roman?? New ?Times 12pt;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;FONT face="Century Gothic"&gt;&lt;B **SMURF**?mso-bidi-font-weight: normal?&gt;&lt;SPAN FONT-FAMILY: Verdana? red; **SMURF**?COLOR:&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This issue revolves solely around the issue of our class description where it states that paladins are the greatest force against the undead. It is generally agreed that this power is in the form of DPS rather then tanking, though both are thought to have a strong role playing basis. Therefore this definition will deal mostly with our ability to damage an undead mob. Issue&amp;nbsp;8 is in regards to lack of undead so I will not go into that here except to say that the lack of undead does effect our power versus them since if their are no undead we have no power and if everything was undead we would be way overpowered.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;The biggest reason we lack power versus undead is felt to be the RNG. As a slayer of undead we are too reliant on&amp;nbsp;this random factor. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;We should have DPS greater then a warrior outside of Holyforge and with Slay Undead 3. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Inside of Holyforge this power should be increased to the point that we come close to a rogue in sustained DPS during this discipline. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;When in areas with mixed mobs, live and undead, it is not efficient to use our undead proc, instead we must use a lesser proc that works on all mobs. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;We have the weakest direct damage spells versus undead then any other class.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;

&lt;LI&gt;It would make sense that since this is not a unique warrior-only type disc, that this ability should be shared from the parent class of both knight classes. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;5. Current Disciplines - &lt;SPAN COLOR: FONT-FAMILY: Roman?? 12pt; **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: ?Times New red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN COLOR: FONT-FAMILY: Roman?? 12pt; **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: ?Times New red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Paladins like all hybreds have four disciplines, two are shared and two of our own. The two disciplines that are shared are Resistant and Fearless.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;!--EZCODE BOLD START--&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Resistant&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;!--EZCODE BOLD END--&gt;: This discipline lasts for 5 minutes, and has a base reuse time of 1 hour and raises all resists by 20.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The time on this discipline seems correct, it gives plenty of time to pop it at the beginning of a fight and either get full use out of it or more likely get the mob dead before it drops. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The amount of resist when compared to the mobs today does not seem to scale. It is felt that the increase in resists is too low or needs to be graduated.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Fearless&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;!--EZCODE BOLD END--&gt;: Immunity to "Fear" and all spells that cause "fear". This discipline lasts for 1 minute, and has a base reuse time of 1 hour. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The biggest issue here is that after you purchase Fear Resistance for 12 AA's and Fearless for another 6 AA's this discipline is useless.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Our two unique disciplines are Santification and Holyforge.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;!--EZCODE BOLD START--&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Sanctification&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;!--EZCODE BOLD END--&gt;: Immunity to most types of harmful spells. This discipline lasts for 18 seconds, and has a base reuse time of 72 minutes.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;It does not last long enough. The only possible way it can be used is on a pull, otherwise we would never know when to use it. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;It does not block all harmful spells, and the ones we need it most on are irresistable, and sanctification does not block irresistable spells.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;!--EZCODE BOLD START--&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Holyforge&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;!--EZCODE BOLD END--&gt;: Critical Hits and Crippling Blows versus undead with an increased probability of going off. This discipline lasts for 5 minutes, and has a base reuse time of 72 minutes. The description for a paladin needs to be noted here. A direct quote from the EQLive website says this. "Paladins are the greatest force against undead."&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;It is the only discipline that when given at level 55 does not work. It can if very lucky cause between 1-3 crits in 5 minutes, but this is not considered working.&lt;/SPAN&gt; &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Holy Forge is completely unreliable. It is a random number on top of a random number and is way too streaky.&lt;/SPAN&gt; &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;To max out our time in Holyforge you must have purchased, including the 6 required in Genereal, Combat Fury3, Slay Undead3, Double Ripostle3, Flash of Steel3, Knight's Advantage3, Speed of the Knight3, and Planar Power5 for 305 dex. Thats a total of 85 AA's and wielding a two hander in order to fully maximize this disc. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Fury of the Ages does not effect the amount of crits in Holyforge &lt;/SPAN&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Cleave does not stack with Holyforge according to Lucy.&lt;/SPAN&gt; &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Even after 85 AA's spent, the random number generator is so wild it still renders Holy Forge as unreliable. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;No other disc in the game is retricted to such a small amount of game content. As per the class description, Paladins should be the masters of undead, such as Rangers are the masters of Archery. With 85 AA's spent, Holy Forge should provide the same reliable DPS against undead as a Ranger under Trueshot disc, as well as increased DPS versus live mobs without the ability to slay.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;6. Power versus the undead - &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN COLOR: FONT-FAMILY: Roman?? 12pt; **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: ?Times New red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;FONT face="Century Gothic"&gt;&lt;B **SMURF**?mso-bidi-font-weight: normal?&gt;&lt;SPAN Verdana? FONT-FAMILY: red; **SMURF**?COLOR:&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This issue revolves solely around the issue of our class description where it states that paladins are the greatest force against the undead. It is generally agreed that this power is in the form of DPS rather then tanking, though both are thought to have a strong role playing basis. Therefore this definition will deal mostly with our ability to damage an undead mob. Issue&amp;nbsp;8 is in regards to lack of undead so I will not go into that here except to say that the lack of undead does effect our power versus them since if their are no undead we have no power and if everything was undead we would be way overpowered.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;The biggest reason we lack power versus undead is felt to be the RNG. As a slayer of undead we are too reliant on&amp;nbsp;this random factor. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;We should have DPS greater then a warrior outside of Holyforge and with Slay Undead 3. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Inside of Holyforge this power should be increased to the point that we come close to a rogue in sustained DPS during this discipline. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;When in areas with mixed mobs, live and undead, it is not efficient to use our undead proc, instead we must use a lesser proc that works on all mobs. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;We have the weakest direct damage spells versus undead then any other class.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;7. Shields - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Currently being evaluated&lt;/SPAN&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Solution: tied to both Sks and Pallies. Change one of their discs to increase damage mitigation and/or prevent spell damage when used with shields in off hand for short durations. Also add or tweak current AAs to allow for more damage mitigation /ac only when equipping a shield in the off hand. Perhaps allow shields some way to block riposte damage&amp;nbsp;through an AA ability.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;8. Lack of undead - &lt;SPAN COLOR: FONT-FAMILY: Roman?? 12pt; **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: ?Times New red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN COLOR: FONT-FAMILY: Roman?? 12pt; **SMURF**?FONT-SIZE: ?Times New red;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Planes of power saw a dearth of undead in the expansion. Discord has almost NO undead whatsoever that I have seen from start through Ikkinz and I expect more of the same from Omens. Why give us a power focus and then give us NOTHING to utilize it on? An advantage is NOT an advantage if it is functioanlly useless.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;9. Lull - &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;This is something that will improve in future expansions.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Disappears totally at level 55&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;10. Lay on Hands - &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;PLEASE make it impossible to blow Lay Hands on a corpse or a mob!!!! - &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;A fix for this issue is going to Test server soon [TM]&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;And while you're at it, make it possible to see&amp;nbsp;how long before it's available like with an aability. &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;This is being considered&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
