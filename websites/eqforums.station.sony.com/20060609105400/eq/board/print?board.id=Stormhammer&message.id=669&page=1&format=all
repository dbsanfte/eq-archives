				<DIV>Well hopefully today proved that there is high demand for tighter level restrictions on events. We had just under&nbsp;a full raid on a weekday morning for the 60-65 raid. Now if they can just tune the events to be at least a little challenge for the force assembled. It will also be interesting to see the turnout for a 50-60 event. Hopefully they will have one soon.</DIV>

				<DIV>Well this is my 2 cents worth.....&nbsp;&nbsp; I left stormhammer over the gm events - period.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Why ?</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>They were terribly unfair.&nbsp;&nbsp; After doing many many raids I&nbsp;got some potions and one ring that to my lvl sucked BIG TIME and 2 aa.&nbsp;Thats it! </DIV>
<DIV>the only 2 events i saw anything worthwhile 1.&nbsp; was in the arena it dropped great&nbsp; stuff and i was there for the whole fight but no one would let me in a group so no i couldnt roll.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
<DIV>I saw a druid get a mana +2 ring for healing the&nbsp;event host&nbsp;(I couldnt have possible win it cause im a mage)&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV></DIV>
<DIV>2.&nbsp; I did the second part of a two parter (I had to work the first part) .&nbsp; It was a long fight and took twice as much time as the first part.&nbsp; Well great stuff did get given away to the people but not to me cause I wasnt there for both.&nbsp; I got nothing.&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Thats the night i put my notice in to be transfered back and left stormhammer.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Who cares? no one but me -&nbsp;every time i play eq i remember these things and it makes me feel bad.&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><STRONG>I strongly support no drop stuff (my ring was)&nbsp; and i strongly support giving stuff to all that earned it even if you have to do it twice in a 2 part or 3 times in a 3 part everyone one should be treated fair!</STRONG></DIV>
<DIV><STRONG></STRONG>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><STRONG>As for the rest I dont even care about loot - I have been playing EQ for 5 years - But I do care about fair.&nbsp; Loot becomes obsolete over time...&nbsp;&nbsp; whats great today will be useless tomorrow.&nbsp; </STRONG></DIV>
<DIV><STRONG>
<DIV><STRONG></STRONG>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><STRONG>Heres an Idea&nbsp;- Why not let&nbsp;&nbsp;the classes roll before finding out whats on the table and a special item made up for the winners of that roll - maybe something that they could use?&nbsp; Maybe something unique?&nbsp; Thats what i though it was when i first came to stormhammer....&nbsp; But thats to simple having casters roll and finding a mage with a terrible robe and wow a brand new with a few nicer stats?&nbsp; </STRONG></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>the conversation would go like this - </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Gm - and proud as the winner of the roll for casters what item would best suit you.&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Proud - well my rings are kinda low would you have anything better than this (<FONT color=#6633ff>jade earring</FONT><FONT color=#ffffff>).</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#ffffff></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#ffffff>Gm - ah yes try this (&nbsp;<FONT color=#cc00ff>electified earing of the tempest</FONT>&nbsp<img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-wink.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0> on u might find it nicer!</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#ffffff></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#ffffff>Proud -&nbsp; Wow thanks GM this is something i can really wear.&nbsp; Thanks all to the raid it was very fun!</FONT></DIV></STRONG></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Grr I hate to see something like the events run so poorly! When they can be so much fun.&nbsp; </DIV>

				<DIV>Well Humper, I hear ya. I left SH too, both for the long LFGs and events. I actually won a roll for a spell. However I had all of my spells as a ranger level 60, a fairly easy task.&nbsp;So I asked for a higher level spell.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Mind you, the event became very difficult due to a major train brought by an unrelated guild. Lots of deaths. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>So, because it was taking time to sort out and the raid party was waiting for other rolls, I told the GM to deal with this after all other items were distributed since he/she refused to give me a higher level spell or a comparable item.&nbsp;Long story short, I got NOTHING out of that roll. I moved out that weekend and am still bitter.</DIV>

				<DIV>Greets,</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I've skipped the last few days events not for being upset just been sick irl.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>However,&nbsp; the majority of events I've been to lately... all the gm loot for the events has been no drop.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Actual drops on mobs that we've passed out have just been as normal.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I also took some time off because it got a bit petty over the no drops last few events I was at.&nbsp; Either people weren't happy, mostly because they wanted the item.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One time people showed up at almost the end of the event and caused major greif over loot which they hadn't earned a right to.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Just goes to show you most peoples motives I guess.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I've also seen people discussing no groups here and in pok etc... Personally I've had groups every day I've been on this server.&nbsp; Either with my now 62 beastlord... or being requested to drop down to my low 50's monk for ldon's.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I'm mostly grouped with the same people tho its about 12 of them in total.&nbsp; Only real problem I've had on storm hammer is noone I've met plans to stay here.</DIV>

				You know, I've been looking through this thread, and having been around since the earlier days of Legends, I'm wondering...<br>What's all the bickering about over items? Back in my first few events, we were given no-drop coins that we would take to a certain individual in town, and we would get what would appear to be a randomized item, though it may depend on the coin you get. As I recall, I have an earring from such an event. Moving along to the 'dividing the loot thing'.<br>Uh.<br>While I'm all for fair play and all..<br>WHY?<br>I figure that everyone should get something, and loot probably should not be divided according to rolling unless someone can only get one item, and then have to stop participating. At which point I would hope that there would be enough rewards to cover everybody participating, which is how it was last I recall this sort of thing happening.<br>Personally, I get upset when I see say, a caster, rolling on a weapon for warriors. Why? I'm a warrior, and more than likely I could use that weapon more than the caster, who is going to go sell it in the bazaar for more than I'm going to be able to afford to begin with, and I wouldn't blame other classes for getting upset if the same thing happened to them.<br>Likewise, I would not roll on a caster-exclusive-use item because I know I can't use it, and while I could SELL it, I would also be depriving another player of a well-deserved item.<br>This is just an example.<br>'Need before greed' can't be applied very easily, but when it's blindingly obvious (A caster rolling on a well-known, high-end warrior weapon)...<br>Well, you see my point.

				<DIV>nbg is nice, in a group with friends or guildies etc.. an open event though where there are 20 to 100 people, I say rolling is the only way to go.</DIV>
<DIV>so what if that chanter got a BoC, yeah, there are lots of warriors there that would of liked it.. but that caster earned it just as much as anyone else at the event,&nbsp;they run to bazaar and sell it...thats their choice with the items they won/earned.&nbsp; Alot of peoples goals in this game is to accumulate as much riches as they possbily can, use that money on alts, themselves or just look at it <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0>&nbsp; Everyone has their own goals in the game.&nbsp; And with open events, everyone should have an equal right to all the loot dropped.&nbsp; The events are fun to do, but it is nice to know that you may have a chance at an item in the end.</DIV>

				Oh, yes, by all means, let the casters have a shot at things.<br>Just don't give them priority over it. If you only get ahold of ONE of a certain item (again, example is a blade of rallos zek), then the people who can use it (warriors) get priority on it. If there's more than one, sure, give the casters a shot at one.<br>The thing is there's no way to tell what you're going to need to give out until you see the group, and if they tailored to the group and judged by what they already have, everybody could get something appropriate for them. That may be a little too much work for the guides, though.

				<DIV align=left>I personally agree with the starter of the thread.&nbsp; All NO DROP items would eliminate the NBG/FFA problem.&nbsp; Events should be fun, and should offer a chance at upgrades for you charachter.&nbsp; I'm really not pleased that I pay $40 a month to listen to a bunch of people fight about loot that they want to sell in the bazaar.&nbsp; To anyone that says you can't please everyone... I leave you with this..&nbsp;&nbsp; The happiest group of players I've ever seen after an event was on a 30-40 event in splitpaw.&nbsp; The actor made a list of everyone in the raid at the beginning of the event.&nbsp; After succesfully completing the task at hand, every single person was allowed to choose between 2 of their SS quest armors.&nbsp; Everyone gets nice NO DROP reward.&nbsp; Everyone is happy to continue paying $40 a month for the chance of it happening again.&nbsp;</DIV>

In a guild it's one thing, but in an open raid, if you're going to do NBG it has to be FAIR nbg.

I wouldn't mind bards and company rolling on such a thing.<br>My real point was that people should roll on things that they can use, and priority should go to them (not neccessarily one class on the weapon, mind.).
