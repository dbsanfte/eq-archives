    <description>Believe me, you don't want a feed spell! And it won't help your issue with the class. Giving you something other to do isn't going to fix the class. And your core issue afaik is that you can't mitigate initial spike dps enough to recover from a bad pull. Resists do play a role but they wouldn't be that critical if you infact had a way to stand up to a few adds and be able to lock them down. So if you can think of a way to reduce spike dps for the first few seconds without enabling you to tank mobs go for it. Like a manashield that shields against damage at a steadily increasing mana cost for example.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But don't ask for feed. It's for a reason this spell is loathed by quite a few necros. ;)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh and I'd love to get the illusions back the way they were - with full faction adjustments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sathras&lt;br&gt;70 necro&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>What Enchanters Really Need</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Enchanters&amp;message.id=4624#M4624</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I have read and Posted on several messages throughout the board concerning the class envisionment and this is what in my mind I believe actually needs to be done to save this dieing class.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Charm - reduce the DPS by no more than 50%,do not make these pets hasted/buffed in any way,but make charm more stable.With TD3 and 340 Charisma I still have charm breaks after 1 tic - this is wrong.If you want to reduce the dps on charmed mobs below this proposed 50%,then make all charms fixed duration,with Total Domination adding 1 minute per rank to the charm duration.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Upgrade Dire Charm through use of AA's - currently we are able to DC a mob to max level 46 - this is useless in the higher end game when enchanters are forced to solo because other classes are more needed in groups.Increase the DC level by 2 levels per rank up to a max of lvl 52 ( this is only 3 ranks)and make the AA cost moderate like 5-10-15 AA's per level rank.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Make Illusions useful,with their own built in collaboration type effect so they are more useable for entering cities,doing quests.Upgrade certain Illusions like BoG,NDT,Tricksters,placing them more in line with todays content and making them more desirable.Make our Illusions more usefull as well - certain effects like HP regen,attack rating,strength,dex,etc., that increases with the level of the caster.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Slows - A slow that is on par or slightly below that of a shamans.A fast cast low resist slow like they have will make us more desireable in groups.Low resist so we dont have to pre cast Tash - shamans dont need tash or malo on their slows so why do we?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Nukes that do more than agrivate a mob.Our best nuke tops out at 3k+ with a critical strike.Toss us a bone and seriously upgrade some nukes and DoTs for us.We should have a 2k nuke minimum and DoTs that do not get overwritten by everything a necro casts.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Upgrade our Stun line of spells not WoM.Morrel is a PBAoE MEZZ.Mezz = aggro. AoE Aggro = death.Upgrade Whirl Till You Hurl,Color stuns,Lagarn's Lamentation.We need more single target stuns not PBAoE mezz's that last for 6 seconds,7 for the enchanter when he dies 1 second after it breaks.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Lower resists on mezzes.The chances of a mezz being resisted in the higher end game is too high and chanters are often plastered to a wall when multiple mobs are coming into camp.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Make Mezz the first spells gained for rune turn ins for OoW spells.Increase drop rate again on greater and glowing runes - these are no drop anyway so they cannot be sold off and screw up eq economy.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Upgrade Tash - long overdue again considering who MR mobs are against magic based spells.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Upgrade our personal rune spell to enable us to take more than 1 hit from a top end mob.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;New Ideas - &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Give enchanters the ability to feed mana to others like Necros do - we have been the means for mana regen and controlling the mind since EQ started and how this ability has been overlooked for 6 years is beyond me.Considering how useless we have become on raids,the least we can do is give our mana to others when a mana draining mob is encountered.Give enchanters also the ability to resist mana drain spells slightly better than other classes - we can control the mind,and therefore should be able to resist a mob being able to drain our mana.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Give us a line of spells that will make us more usefull in groups - similar to clerics with the abilities to speed up spell casting,reduce fizzling even more,even make others spells more effective.Perhaps even give us the ability to reduce the mana cost of others with certain group-only abilities/buffs.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Spells that enable us to enchant weapons/armor and make them more effective.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Haste spell that breaks haste cap.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Buffs that can break the stat cap on certain stats like intell and wisdom.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;One suggestion I even saw was the best idea I have seen in years.Increase the hp/ac of enchanters to be on par with that of a druid while keeping us in cloth armor.Considering how fast an enchanter dies when charm breaks or mezz is resisted,this plan seems to be the most feasible.No other arcane caster class faces the aggro we do from certain spells that need to be cast while in group - and this is one of the reasons chanters are overlooked.No group wants to constantly rezz an enchanter who is grabbing aggro with tash,slow,cripple,or charm,and is having to be babysat with constant heals.Raising our ac to make us get hit less often,and hp to make us take more damage when we do grab aggro will make other classes fell safer knowing we wont need a rezz every 3 minutes.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;These suggestions on things we need could be expanded upon im am sure,but these seem to be the most needed items to keep this class from dieing off.We have become useless buffbots and I dare an EQ dev to log into any server and look for themselves as to how many enchanters are actually in groups.We are few and far between now,and our usefullness is currently limited to helping get people flagged on trials 5 and 6 for KT.This will change with upcoming plans to charm,and our class will not be needed at all for that - face it - we cant take a hit and we will be passed up for dps classes to take out the mobs faster.And taking out a mob with speed is not something an enchanter is able to do considering the nukes and dots we have.Charm was what gave us an edge and that has been nerfed to hell and back and will now be totally useless.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Pre 60 chanters have a chance at finding groups as the spells for our class was designed for that type of content - but from 60 to 70 it seems as though SOE hired a bunch of monkeys with computer skills to toss us some random crap every now and then.The 60-70 spells and our abilities do not match the content in the game,especially since OoW and DoN arrived.LDoN gave us a few spells that were useful,but LDoN is a thing of the past for post 60 toons now that better gear and content is available with DoN.LoY was a running joke offering us 1 spell that is moderately useful,but those zones also are dead as the content and gear coming from there is outdated.The risk vs. reward does not warrant many groups going there and is subject to many soloing classes over groups for the fact camps arent in dispute.GoD offered us some nice rewards providing we were already Time geared to face the mobs to get it.The spells in GoD were way out of balance when it is considered what level you need to be to get them,compared with the level of spell you recieved.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The game for many post 60 enchanters starts to go downhill after they hit the Planes and get flagged for the elemental zones and Time.As more guilds move into the raid content for GoD,OoW,and DoN,enchanters are having a hard time finding their niche considering how useless our spells have become compared to that of other classes.We recieve nerfs but no upgrades to what is useful and needed to keep us in groups.The spells and abilities we were given pre 60 made us wanted - now we take up space on raids and groups that is more needed for actual dps classes that can make or break a successful run.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;We need a serious overhaul,and our abilities need to be looked at closely when you compare the pre and post 60 enchanter.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Its been almost 10 months since I originally made this post and of all the suggestions I had made only a very few came to light.When this post was made the resist issue was a hot topic and it was and still is ignored.We are the red headed step child of classes in EQ in that we are noticed but quickly ignored and forgotten because the bulk of the eq community plays other classes such as clerics,warriors,bards,and necros.Nanyea posted that a survey was done and SOE found that enchanters were something like #3 ranked on number of classes in game,yet,an amazing number of those were below 70.She also commented about the large number of lvl 70 chanters that have quit and sold their accounts.On my server there are several high end raiding guild who regularly farm areas like DoN,DoD,GoD end zones,and of course Anguish.The majority of those guilds bought the accounts of the enchanters who were once loyal members,specifically so they would not lose a BUFFBOT for raids.The remaining enchanters here are hardheads who continue to hope for a return to our previous usefulness,our ability to control mobs and a situation when it arises.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Since this post was made no more "Reinvisionment" has been made,nor has it been mentioned.Instead we are handed yet again a few paltry spells hoping that we will not raise a stink about how gimp we have become,or about how the other rival classes such as bards and necros have been given more of the abilities we should have gotten,and how they have become more useful on raids and in groups while we have become more useless.God forbid someone brings up the suggestion of an enchanter "sit-down" or strike like the Warriors did a couple years back because SOE is already trying its best to do away with this class altogether.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Nanyea I respect the amount of time and effort you are doing for us,but new spells at this point is not the answer.SOE needs to stop dead in the water and stop with the expansions for a year or more,and they need to do it now.We need to have the reinvisionment completed,our class more defined,overhauled,and put back in its proper prespective.We need the abilities that we have been asking about for almost 3-4 years to be granted and our class be made more survivable in any situation.Mezz resists are a freakin joke,as are the mobs who need to be tashed and hit with Desolate Deeds 6-8 times before they are slowed.At lvl 70,with 11k hp and mana,I shouldnt have to hit a mob repeatedly 6-8 times with the same spell to get an effect.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;We should not have to invest time into grinding aa's or doing a "bust ass" quest for a spell that will help regen only a SMALL amount of mana and take up another buff slot.This group mana regen should be made an inherent ability of grouping with an enchanter,based upon the level of the enchanter from the time he/she starts at level 1 all the way to lvl 70.This inherent regen would&amp;nbsp;stack with &amp;nbsp;the enchanters own regen spells also,solving yet another ability many have asked for in the form of a self only regen buff.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Enchanters are supposed to be the "Masters of the Mind" and it's workings,giving us the ability to help our own and others minds regen and gather mana at a faster rate,and the ability to control minds,forcing one to do our bidding against its will.With this in mind how the hell did Necromancers get the ability to feed MANA to another class?Hit points I can see,they control the dead,death,and have a better understanding of the body and its workings,but not the mind.I made a suggetion on another post a year ago about giving us that ability and someone mentioned that would give guilds the excuse to DC enchanters on raids to do nothing more than&amp;nbsp;feed &amp;nbsp;clerics...........NEWSFLASH - enchanters are DCed on raids now to BUFF.Giving us the ability to feed mana would give us a more useful role on raids especially if this ability overwrote a necros and was superior to theirs.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The basics that we have all asked for have and continue to be overlooked,that mainly being lower resists on mobs so our debuffs and charms stick,and our survivability.We as a class do not possess the healing spells and abilities of other classes who have similar abilities to ours,yet we are the ones who suffer.Hell we dont even have a pet heal spell yet are given an animation who is one rounded by any mob in the high end spectrum.And in case the devs forgot this little tidbit of info - we were given Gimpy Mcstab as a "pet" because we HAD the ability to charm.Charm was the obvious alternative to using a crappy pet,a pet that isnt even controlable unless we grind more aa's and time into purchasing commands to make it run and hide before it is one rounded.Charm was an integral part of this class to make it on par with the other classes.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The devs need to think this one through long and hard - when they hear about Shamans,Necros,Bards,Wizzies,Mages,and Shadow Knights soloing mobs like Tallon and Vallon Zek in the planes,they should notice Enchanters are not&amp;nbsp;included on that list.Many of us dont want to be either,we just want the ability to solo viably&amp;nbsp;and &amp;nbsp;get experiance when we cant find groups.We are dieing as a class,being made into more upgraded buffbots,and all because of them.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Lets also add to this list a mezz that will actually mezz.I am getting tired of attempting to mezz mobs and recieve the message that XXX cannot be mezzed with this particular mezz spell ( Euphoria being used on a mob in Tirranun's Delve ).Euphoria being able to mezz up to lvl 73 and the mob in question being yellow to a lvl 70 ( or roughly 71-72 ).The spell should never have gone off if the mob was unable to be mezzed.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size=+2 color=red&gt;"What Enchanters Really Need"&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thats the title.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My only thought is that we need &lt;b&gt;COMMUNICATION&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I want to hear what happened with Tash.........I get more and less aggro from it, against the use of the same MA in raids.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I want to hear why we still see the Mez resists..(no way should a max cha/max int/max foci enchanter need to try to remez a blue mob up to 10+ times with nothing but resists, even after tashed/malo/hos.......are you ever going to change that nerf? - no this is not a single-time, random bad luck issue, this is so regular an issue our RL and GL just kill them and assign offtanks for the repops during the fight, so much for having a useful class activity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I want to know what you did or are going to do to charm, and when.... we are passed the time of vagaries in you information, tell us the specifics -  will we be able to see improved dps from a pet with buffing; is your "charmbuff" going to be worthwhile; how so; will the mob aggro/splat ratio/time for the enchanter be worthwhile to charm in groups?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I want to know when you are going to return the class back to it original fun-to-play class it was in Kunark, Velious era? - if not, then what are you planning, specifically to keep the few remaining Enchanters in game? - your mergers will only give relief on the short-term regarding numbers of this class, excluding the buff-bot alts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I want to know if you are not going to return our skills, or give us skills that are ours, as a PURE class, then what are you going to do?  Because I, for dang sure, have no interest to spend 4 hours of my raiding time doing buffs and being a mini-wiz.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I want to know if you want us to be thought as a useful slower in groups then when will you give us defenses that will work when we need them against the Resists you have imposed since OoW.........no way should we not have abilities to avoid splatting in 1 round to any blue-con mobs in a group environment - btw I may not have max AA's for Defensiveness yet, but I am fairly close, and tire of splatting to blues because I do not see the defenses happening as I think they should with the number of AA's I have already trained....this is with 8K raid buffed hp and epic rune, ethereal rune, mayhem, and rune of Z accounted for as buffs ~ 12k hp +/-.........no its not poor healers in group (I group and raid with these healers and they are very high quality healers).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Im at the point in game, if I can't find a group with the folks I know and trust, I seldom stay online more than an hour looking for other friends to group with...........and I am one who used to play up to 10+ hours daily, now down to maybe 4 hours for raiding 4-5 nights a week only.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, I will be waiting for answers for a short while longer.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Let me start off by saying that I agree with most of what is said here. I think charming is a good idea, but i know many enchanters (like myself) don't like charming and rarely do it, as it puts the whole group in jeapordy when it breaks AND you have multiple adds. Basically, charm upgrades don't effect me. My main question tho is why am I still using my lvl 57 slow at lvl 68? I feel that enchanters and shamans are interchangable in a group, with the exception that they can heal and we can mez. So why not give us the same slows? &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;So they are going to make all classes soloable.. but the main focus of how they are going to do that for chanters is to nerf charm.. not good. I wonder if anyone has ever "crunched any numbers " of the amount of groups .. raids.. etcetera that wil even allow a chanter to charm? Groups just simply do not wish to deal with charm breaks. give a chanter the ability to handle a charmed pet unaided. however you do that, and you will have made chanters a vialble dps class and given them the ability to solo.&amp;nbsp; why do we need to be a viable dps class? because in a one on one bards out haste out charm us. our slows require tash to stick&amp;nbsp; and even then are not as effective as a shamans. we have no healing ability at all. our nukes and dots are laughable in mana vs damage output + recast time. we cannot effectively melee. for&amp;nbsp;the long haul through the upper fifties a chanter cannot even mezz effectively. the only time I fell needed is when I am i POK and then I turn on anon and get out of there as quick as possible. we need to be more useful than sitting in pok casting KEI&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Why should we have to get spells that dont work the same in old content.&amp;nbsp; As it was we got a charm that only work in OoW zone really, I dont think Ive ever seen a mob that could be charm with our new charm that wasnt charmable with CoD in older zones.&amp;nbsp; I ve heard folks say they have charmed a 65 higher or high level&amp;nbsp;mob in some zones, but I ve never saw one.&amp;nbsp; We need sony to look at the MR they put on mobs in general I know they say they do, but on end game mobs I can tash and I have to hope that 2 other chanters are mezing and the SK is aggroing 20% of the time to live.&amp;nbsp; Why mez mobs that hit camp and with 4 chanter trying to mez it still goes to town kiling poeple.&amp;nbsp; I can see why some guilds just say fu..k we will just off tank.&amp;nbsp; Who wants to put up with something as un reliable as mez.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I dont think we need to ask for a spell that is limit and donsnt work in old expansions.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; When was the last wizard we heard go **SMURF** my new nuke dosnt work in GoD or the melee that said hum my unber weapons&amp;nbsp; of killing isnt doing any damage in old zones.&amp;nbsp; If we get a new spell and it happens to make us more powerful in old zone well so be it, because every other class is more powerful in those same zones.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I am saying I dont want a new spell that is only useable in new zones.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Excellent set of suggestions.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The keys to making enchanters fun to play again:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;SURVIVABILITY.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Our job is to get initial aggro on a mob and stop it.&amp;nbsp; We need to be able to survive long enough to do that.&amp;nbsp; However you do it . . . improved runes or Mind over Mana, inproved damage avoidance or mitigation.&amp;nbsp; Stuns that cast fast enough and land reliably enough to stop a mob long enough for a lock-down.&amp;nbsp; We need to be able to do our jobs and not splat.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;EFFECTIVENESS:&amp;nbsp; Our spells need to actually work.&amp;nbsp; This means lowering the insane magic resistance of mobs that require 3 or 4 casts of a spell for it to land.&amp;nbsp; This means getting rid of the gaps that force enchanters to play in zones with no tools that work (getting rid of the hard level caps on mezzes and stuns and letting them scale they way our nukes do in harder content.)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Right now we are not able to perform any of the basic functions of our class.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;We can't crowd control because we die every time a mez is resisted.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;We can't charm because the laughable damage our pets do is not worth the risk, and groups/raids won't tolerate them.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Many class-defining abilities such as illusions are obsolete and have not been used seriously in play for years.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;We are third rate or worse&amp;nbsp;compared to&amp;nbsp;other classes in all&amp;nbsp;the things we CAN do: slow, haste, nuke.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The suggestions above would address these issues.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>I disagree with your nuke claim.  Enchanters should be doing DPS via a viable charm spell.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mez and Stun aggro is about the same.  Stuns have their own problems with balancing.  I'd be happy with either a L 73 cap WoM or a stun that drops a recourse "cannot be PBAOE stunned" for 12 seconds on the mob.  However, PBAOE defences cannot decay to nothing on XP mobs, like they do at L 71 now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The problem with mez resists is not that they happen, but that they are a death sentance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Start mitigating resist modifiers on mobs.  You should be able to design a system so that new spells penetrate resist mitigation better but don't work better on old mobs, thereby fixing the resist-spiral-out-of-control problem.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don't want to be able to feed mana to other classes.  It's a cute idea, but it isn't an interesting job.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don't want more buffs.  Enchanters are, on the aggregate, a pretty strong buff class.  More buffs means more power allocated to passive abilities.  I don't want to be an afk-bot class, nor do I want to be overpowered.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bards breaking the haste cap is an active way they can add a DPS contribution.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Making enchanters more durable is good.  However, we don't want to revamp itemization.  I would propose making them more durable via spells and innate abilities, rather than gear, is best.  It should also scale with gear.  I don't think druid is enough: we need short-term durability on the level of a full tank, but we also need to be worse than tanks at long-term durability.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm disagreeing with you simply because lack of disagreement can cause SOE to confuse apathy with agreement.  We don't need fixes in many of the areas where you want changes, and I want SOE to work on things that will actually fix the class.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
Give enchanters the ability to feed mana to others like Necros do - we have been the means for mana regen and controlling the mind since EQ started and how this ability has been overlooked for 6 years is beyond me.Considering how useless we have become on raids,the least we can do is give our mana to others when a mana draining mob is encountered.Give enchanters also the ability to resist mana drain spells slightly better than other classes - we can control the mind,and therefore should be able to resist a mob being able to drain our mana.&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp; Maybe it could be a group spell?&amp;nbsp; Like enchanter casts (costs a good amount of mana) and then gives a short duration (like 4-5 ticks) mana over time buff to the group (to prevent lots of enchanters casting it at once on one group) except the chanter, and stacks with all other short mana regen buffs, like the ones that necros / SKs have.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Enchanters need a self only vie type AA that&amp;nbsp; absorbs a certain&amp;nbsp; percentage of the damage and the percentages changes depending in which zone we are in.&amp;nbsp; This will allow enchanters to survive a lot longer when we get agro against hard hitting mobs, in zones like KD&amp;nbsp; the&amp;nbsp; Vie AA should absorb 50 percent but in other zones like&amp;nbsp; one of the new don zones more like 20 percent.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Enchanters used to be the king of haste, but these days a bard can add so much more haste then we can, so it is about time enchanters get a group&amp;nbsp; 20 percent overhaste.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; For a class that used to have all the best buffs, we sure can't compete against the other buffing classes anymore, even a BL can add more dps to melee with attack buffs plus haste, then we can with our haste.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>I agree with pretty much everything you said in this thread and I feel that some these issues are more important than some of the ones in the current top 10.  Personally things I feel would help enchaters the most are a new single target stun and better mitigation.  The better mitigation would help solve the deaths caused by mez and charm spells without having to change the spells.  I don't really feel that enchanters are asking for alot or being excessive with their requests.  We are simply asking to be playable again.  We want to be able to play the game like everyone else and actually be useful to our fellow players.</description>
